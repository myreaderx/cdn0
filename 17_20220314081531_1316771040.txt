Her home was still lit by gas when she first began studying science &#8212; in a school for boys, because no such subjects figured into the curriculum of the local girls&#8217; school. By the time she was a teenager, living outside London, she watched gas-filled Zeppelins rain bombs and death from the air. She watched them go down in flames, shot down by British weapons. She watched her mother cry with the knowledge that piloting them were German boys not much older than Kathleen. </p>\n<p>Trained as a physicist, Kathleen Lonsdale went on to become the pioneering X-ray crystallographer who illuminated the shape, dimensions, and atomic structure of the benzene ring that had mystified chemists since <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/09/22/michael-faraday-mental-discipline-self-deception/\">Michael Faraday</a> discovered benzene a century earlier. She was still in her twenties. The chemistry of benzene would come to fuel the twentieth century. J.D. Bernal &#8212; the visionary scientist who first applied X-ray crystallography to the molecules of life and whose laboratory group she joined &#8212; came to see how beneath Lonsdale&#8217;s quiet, unassuming manner lay &#8220;such an underlying strength of character that she became from the outset the presiding genius of the place.&#8221; </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_76224\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kathleenlonsdale_NPG.jpg?resize=680%2C1023&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1023\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76224\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kathleenlonsdale_NPG.jpg?w=1196&#38;ssl=1 1196w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kathleenlonsdale_NPG.jpg?resize=320%2C482&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kathleenlonsdale_NPG.jpg?resize=600%2C903&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kathleenlonsdale_NPG.jpg?resize=240%2C361&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kathleenlonsdale_NPG.jpg?resize=768%2C1156&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/kathleenlonsdale_NPG.jpg?resize=1021%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1021w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dame Kathleen Lonsdale.

When the next World War broke out, Lonsdale &#8212; by then one of the world&#8217;s most preeminent scientists &#8212; was imprisoned as a conscientious objector to military conscription. She went on to become one of Europe&#8217;s most influential prison reformers, having seen how the prison industrial complex &#8212; a term then yet to be coined &#8212; is the price societies governed by the military industrial complex pay for the inequalities and injustices stemming from that foundational cult.</p>\n<p>In 1957, as part of a Penguin series that invited some of the era&#8217;s most lucid and luminous minds to explore some the era&#8217;s most urgent questions, Lonsdale composed a slender, exquisitely reasoned and deeply felt book titled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Peace-Possible-Kathleen-Lonsdale/dp/B0000CJNU6/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Is Peace Possible?</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/is-peace-possible/oclc/53468258?referer=br&#038;ht=edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>), now out of print.

Most civilized nations are beginning to realize that there is such a thing as a genuinely conscientious objection to personal participation in war, even if they do not regard it as expedient to encourage young people to think along these lines or take this stand.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75766\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett00-1.jpg?resize=680%2C566&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"566\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75766\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett00-1.jpg?w=1179&#38;ssl=1 1179w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett00-1.jpg?resize=320%2C267&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett00-1.jpg?resize=600%2C500&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett00-1.jpg?resize=240%2C200&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett00-1.jpg?resize=768%2C640&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of teenage artist Virginia Frances Sterrett&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/27/virginia-frances-sterrett-old-french-fairy-tales/\">century-old illustrations for classic French fairy tales</a>.

In terms of reason, they find it arguable &#8212; as it is &#8212; to say that although every possible way to avoid war must be sought, yet until men are perfect there will always be some who want to grab more than their share. They see no reason why this should be permitted if it can be prevented by the limited use of military force. They are pretty sure that it <em>is</em> prevented in many cases by the knowledge that force is there to stop it. For men are not perfect, but neither are they foolish enough, as a rule [<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with exceptions</a>], to burgle or murder even on a national scale, if they know that they will be stopped and punished.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Citing a prominent politician who had once said to her that &#8220;pacifism is not practical politics&#8221; but &#8220;to be spiritually healthy every nation needs to have a spear-point of idealist opinion,&#8221; she dismantles the convenient illusion that pacifism is a purely ideological stance with no practical responsibilities of political participation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The pacifist who argues that he is concerned only with principles, and that politics are not his business, is usually evading the discipline and the responsibility of hard thinking. His position is a logical one only if he does not either expect or desire the politician to put pacifist principles into practice for him. He won&#8217;t expect it, but if he does desire it then it is incumbent on him to study the world situation and try to decide for himself how it might be done, in general at least, if not in particular.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To illustrate the interleaving of lives across the artificial pickets of national borders, she looks back on the 1947 cholera epidemic that quickly came to claim five hundred lives per day in Egypt but was also quickly curbed after twenty nations cooperated on a supply line for vaccines. In a sentiment of staggering timeliness in the wake of the twenty-first century&#8217;s deadliest pandemic &#8212; which Mary Shelley <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/04/16/mary-shelley-the-last-man/\">anticipated two centuries ago</a> &#8212; Lonsdale observes that &#8220;plagues are no respecters of sovereignty,&#8221; nor are the far-reaching economic, moral, spiritual, and radioactive consequences of war.</p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/02/almost-nothing-yet-everything/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/almostnothingyeteverything6.jpg?w=1200&#038;ssl=1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Ryōji Arai from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/02/almost-nothing-yet-everything/\"><em>Almost Nothing, yet Everything: A Book about Water</em></a> by Hiroshi Osada</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In another sentiment of staggering timeliness in the aftermath of a twenty-first-century despot masquerading as a democratic ruler while erecting a physical wall on his nation&#8217;s border, and half a century before Toni Morrison lamented that in our time <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/08/06/toni-mirrison-borders-home/\">&#8220;walls and weapons feature as prominently now as they once did in medieval times,&#8221;</a> Lonsdale adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the objects of military alliances and military defence seems to be the prevention of population movements, the freezing of the <em>status quo</em>.</p>\n<p>It is just not possible to freeze the <em>status quo</em>, either nationally or internationally. One might as well try to freeze the Indian Ocean.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Writing shortly after the first test explosions of nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean, and shortly before Rachel Carson made <em>ecology</em> a household word <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-animated-episode-1/\">a century after it was coined</a> with her <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/01/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-dorothy-freeman/\">epochal exposé</a> on the ecosystem devastation pesticides inflict far beyond their intended locus of use, Lonsdale observes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>No nation can claim that it can do what it likes, even with its own. The air above it will move to other parts of the world. The water around it will be exchanged gradually, not only with surface waters elsewhere, but also with the waters in the depths of the ocean.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/02/almost-nothing-yet-everything/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/almostnothingyeteverything4.jpg?w=1200&#038;ssl=1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Ryōji Arai from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/02/almost-nothing-yet-everything/\"><em>Almost Nothing, yet Everything</em></a> by Hiroshi Osada</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At the heart of Lonsdale&#8217;s case against war is a clarity about the dangers of relativism and transactionalism, the dangers of mistaking self-interest for moral courage:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Total</em> disarmament would not be an extreme form of partial disarmament [but] something quite different&#8230; At present our attitude is &#8220;If you eat my grandmother, I&#8217;ll eat yours. But if you will agree not to eat my grandmother, I&#8217;ll agree not to eat yours either, but I will jolly well look out to see that you are not beginning to boil the water in the saucepan.&#8221; What we need to do is to develop a horror of cannibalism, a horror of the crime of war.</p>\n<p>Total disarmament means not only the abolition of military organization, of armament factories, of armies, of the naval and air forces, but the re-education of men and women everywhere to abhor the idea of war&#8230; abhor war and all preparations for war, not only in one country &#8212; although some country must set an example &#8212; but in every country&#8230; abhor it so much that they were willing to accept the readjustments that the absence of war and of the sanction of force might mean. It would be absolutely necessary to be clear on that point in any large-scale effort at adult education.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/08/02/edward-gorey-three-classic-childrens-stories-pomegranate/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/edwardgoreyfairytales_red3.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Edward Gorey for a <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/08/02/edward-gorey-three-classic-childrens-stories-pomegranate/\">special edition</a> of <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>This is a point of great subtlety and great import, for it speaks not only to the constant threat of war looming over the world but to the ecological apocalypse looming with even greater certainty unless we re-educate ourselves. In the near-century since Lonsdale&#8217;s time, we have cannibalized our climate for the exact same reason we have failed, as a civilization and a species, to eradicate war: Most people, whatever their loftiest moral standards may be, are simply too unwilling to inconvenience themselves with the not terribly demanding readjustments of habit that a personal stance against fossil fuel or the tendrils of the military industrial complex would demand of their daily lives. We weigh political candidates by how their tax policy would impact our personal finances and not by their intended military spending. We toss our soda cans &#8212; made of the same metal as the military aircraft of WWII &#8212; into the recycling bin when we remember, and we continue to fly across the increasingly carbonic sky we share. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/03/15/the-three-astronauts-umberto-eco/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/threeastronauts12.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/03/15/the-three-astronauts-umberto-eco/\"><em>The Three Astronauts</em></a> &#8212; Umberto Eco&#8217;s vintage semiotic children&#8217;s book about world peace</figcaption></figure>\n<p>With this, Lonsdale excavates the deepest stratum of the reasons for war. Military alliances and international treaties only gauze the open wound of widespread inequality and injustice that colonialism and capitalism have inflicted on our world. In a sentiment an epoch ahead of her time, she observes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Real security can only be found, if at all, in a world without the injustices that now exist, and without arms.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lonsdale considers how such a world might become possible:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are two ways in which such changes might come. One is the way of the compulsion of experience, the whip and spur of historical inevitability, the coercion of facts. That is the hard and bitter way. The other is the way of foresight, of preparation, of imagination. It is also the way of moral compulsion. It may be no less hard but it is not bitter.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Half a century before Jacqueline Novogratz bridged the notions of moral imagination and moral leadership in her elevating <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/07/27/jacqueline-novogratz-manifesto-for-a-moral-revolution/\">manifesto for a moral revolution</a>, Lonsdale laments that most people are not instinctually able to make the necessary effort of imagination, for they are too accustomed to being led by leaders too unimaginative and morally insipid, if not actively immoral. She writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most people&#8230; can rise to great heights of courage and sacrifice, but not usually without leadership. Two kinds of such leadership exist. The first is leadership from above. The other is leadership from within. Very often the second does have to precede the first. Those people who see clearly the necessity of changed thinking must themselves undertake the discipline of thinking in new ways and must persuade others to do so.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75929\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/the-star-lighter-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=680%2C597&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"597\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75929\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=320%2C281&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=600%2C527&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=240%2C211&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=768%2C674&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Rockwell Kent from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/15/rockwell-kent-wilderness/\"><em>Wilderness</em></a>, 1919.

It needs ways of living together peacefully and co-operatively, and these ways young people educated in the principles of peace could help find.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>What is essential in the future is that every member of the family, even little children, should learn at whatever cost not to give way to wrong or to co-operate in it&#8230; It would mean also that if another nation was invaded, and not our own, the support that we could give them would be limited to moral support&#8230; unless we intend to destroy the world to prevent aggression. But moral support is powerful in proportion to the integrity of the nation that gives it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Four years before Eleanor Roosevelt &#8212; who shared Lonsdale&#8217;s condemnation of nuclear weapons and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/07/10/all-human-beings-max-richter-eleanor-roosevelt-udhr/\">spearheaded</a> the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that set out to lay &#8220;the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world&#8221; &#8212; made her impassioned case for <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/05/02/eleanor-roosevelt-tomorrow-is-now/\">our personal power in world change</a>, Lonsdale observes that creating a world <em>without</em> war would require as much cultural devotion and resources as planning <em>for</em> war took in the past. But such planning, she observes, is not the unreachable work of governments &#8212; it is the work of the people, each and every one of us, for we ourselves are the primary resource of the possible future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If the will to plan internationally for peace were there, the mechanisms would not be far to seek. And the will that is required is that of ourselves, the ordinary people of the world, expressed urgently enough for those who govern not to be able to ignore it, even if they would.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/peace-from-trees-at-night-by-art-young_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight16.jpg?resize=680%2C1046&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1046\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-68425\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight16.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight16.jpg?resize=240%2C369&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight16.jpg?resize=320%2C492&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight16.jpg?resize=768%2C1181&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight16.jpg?resize=600%2C923&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/08/06/trees-at-night-art-young/\"><em>Trees at Night</em></a> by Art Young, 1920s.

Obviously my father hadn’t wandered away from me like a toddler at a picnic, or vanished like an important document in a messy office. And yet, unlike other oblique ways of talking about death, this one did not seem cagey or empty. It seemed plain, plaintive, and lonely, like grief itself. From the first time I said it, that day on the phone, it felt like something I could use, as one uses a shovel or a bell-pull: cold and ringing, containing within it both something desperate and something resigned, accurate to the confusion and desolation of bereavement.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/05/14/oliver-jeffers-the-heart-and-the-bottle/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/oliverjeffers_theheartandthebottle4.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/05/14/oliver-jeffers-the-heart-and-the-bottle/\"><em>The Heart and the Bottle</em></a> by Oliver Jeffers &#8212; an illustrated fable about love and loss</figcaption></figure>\n<p>She eventually realizes that the etymology of the word is in fact an apt analogue for the experience of loss:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The verb “to lose” has its taproot sunk in sorrow; it is related to the “lorn” in “forlorn.” It comes from an Old English word meaning to perish, which comes from an even older word meaning to separate or cut apart. The modern sense of misplacing an object only appeared later, in the thirteenth century; a hundred years after that, “to lose” acquired the meaning of failing to win. In the sixteenth century we began to lose our minds; in the seventeenth century, our hearts. The circle of what we can lose, in other words, began with our own lives and each other and has been steadily expanding ever since. This is how loss felt to me after my father died: like a force that constantly increased its reach, gradually encroaching on more and more terrain.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The most confounding aspect of grief is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/11/10/geometry-of-grief-michael-frame/\">its fractal nature</a> &#8212; the one great trunk of loss branches and twigs into the trivial, splintering reality into an infinity of losses until we come to look at the world (as that lovely verse by Lisel Mueller goes) <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/02/24/immortality-in-passing-lisel-mueller/\">&#8220;as if what exists, exists so that it can be lost and become precious.&#8221;</a> The small things we lose come to feel so precious that we dissolve into tears over the book that fell out of the bicycle basket on the way home, the trivial twig dragging with it the unbearable trunk. It is a universal experience, which Schulz captures with the splendid poetics of her particular mind:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Like a dysfunctional form of love, which to some extent it is, grief has no boundaries; seldom during that difficult fall could I distinguish my distress over these other losses from my sadness about my father.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>This is the essential, avaricious nature of loss: it encompasses, without distinction, the trivial and the consequential, the abstract and the concrete, the merely misplaced and the permanently gone. We often ignore its true scope if we can, but for a while after my father died, I could not stop seeing the world as it really is, marked everywhere by the evidence of past losses and the imminence of future ones.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Moving through her loss at a time when all of us, whatever the nature of our <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/02/03/emily-levine-cold-solace-anna-belle-kaufman/\">personal losses</a>, were moving together through what scientists have now termed <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7830022/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;ecological grief&#8221;</a> &#8212; a mere century and half after <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-animated-episode-1/\">the birth of ecology</a> &#8212; she follows the fractal:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The world itself seemed ephemeral, glaciers and species and ecosystems vanishing, the pace of change as swift as in a time-lapse, as if those of us alive today had been permitted to see it from the harrowing perspective of eternity. Everything felt fragile, everything felt vulnerable; the idea of loss pressed in all around me, like a hidden order to existence that emerged only in the presence of grief.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75847\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-animated-episode-1/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=680%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"381\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75847\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=320%2C179&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=600%2C336&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=240%2C134&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=768%2C430&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pressed wildflowers from Emily Dickinson&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-animated-episode-1/\">herbarium</a>, including species now endangered or extinct.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Because everything does suddenly feel so fragile &#8212; or, rather, because loss suddenly reveals that we are indeed <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/03/02/the-fragile-species-lewis-thomas/\">&#8220;the fragile species&#8221;</a> &#8212; grief itself becomes a kind of glue with which try to hold together the shattered pieces of our familiar world. In a passage of uncommon insight and sensitivity to what may be the most paradoxical and most underdiscussed aspect of loss, she writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most people, I think, are at least a little afraid of ceasing to grieve. I know that I was. However terrible our sorrow may be, we understand that it is made in the image of love, that it shares the characteristics of the person we mourn. Maybe there was a day in your life when you were brought to your knees by a faded blue ball cap or a tote bag full of knitting supplies or the sound of a Brahms piano concerto&#8230; Part of what makes grief so seductive, then, is that it seems to offer us what life no longer can: an ongoing, emotionally potent connection to the dead. And so it is easy to feel that once that bleak gift is gone, the person we love will somehow be more gone, too. </p>\n<p>Thus our strange relationship with the pain of grief. In the early days, we wish only for it to end; later on, we fear that it will. And when it finally does begin to ease, it also does not, because, at first, feeling better can feel like loss, too.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/liminal-worlds-by-maria-popova_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-59546\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=240%2C240&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=320%2C320&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=768%2C768&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=32%2C32&#38;ssl=1 32w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=50%2C50&#38;ssl=1 50w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=64%2C64&#38;ssl=1 64w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=96%2C96&#38;ssl=1 96w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fog.jpg?resize=128%2C128&#38;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Liminal Worlds</em> by Maria Popova.

To lose something is a profoundly humbling act. It forces us to confront the limits of our mind&#8230; It forces us to confront the limits of our will: the fact that we are powerless to protect the things we love from time and change and chance. Above all, it forces us to confront the limits of existence: the fact that, sooner or later, it is in the nature of almost everything to vanish or perish.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This, of course, collides with the most fundamental feature of our consciousness: its inability to parse its own negatios. <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/03/18/figuring-shoreless-seeds-and-stardust/\">Try as we might</a> in the virtual reality of the mind, on some deep animal level, we simply cannot fathom the actuality of nonexistence, the ultimate void, what Emily Dickinson termed <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/07/20/emily-dickinson-mother-death/\">&#8220;the drift called the infinite.&#8221;</a> </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_55647\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/07/07/trouvelots-astronomical-drawings/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=680%2C552&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Total eclipse of the sun, observed July 29, 1878, at Creston, Wyoming Territory\" width=\"680\" height=\"552\" class=\"size-full wp-image-55647\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?w=4885&#38;ssl=1 4885w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=240%2C195&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=320%2C260&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=768%2C624&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?resize=600%2C487&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/eclipse.jpg?w=2040&#38;ssl=1 2040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Total eclipse of 1878, one of Étienne Léopold Trouvelot&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/07/07/trouvelots-astronomical-drawings/\">groundbreaking astronomical drawings</a>.

Our inability to do that is reflected in our euphemisms for dying: to &#8220;pass away,&#8221; as if the person is transported to some other place rather than entirely displaced from existence; to &#8220;run out of time,&#8221; as if time still exists for the dead, a dimension they happen to have directionally vacated along some vector pointing elsewhere. </p>\n<p>A nowhere without elsewhere is simply beyond the grasp of human consciousness. </p>\n<p>Schulz intuits this, locating that creaturely instinct in the cultural trope of the Valley of Lost Things &#8212; one of the seven valleys the protagonists of L. Frank Baum&#8217;s 1901 children&#8217;s novel <em>Dot and Tot of Merryland</em> visit after a runaway boat carries them away from the Land of Oz. She writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although it often goes by other names, the Valley of Lost Things has haunted our collective imagination for centuries&#8230; in every context from autobiography to science fiction.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>Part of the enduring appeal of this imaginary destination is that it comports with our real-life experience of losing things: when we can’t find something, it is easy to feel that it has gone somewhere unfindable. But there is also something pleasing about the idea that our missing belongings, unable to find their rightful owners, should at least find each other, gathering together like souls in the bardo or distant relatives at a family reunion. The things we lose are distinguished by their lack of any known location; how clever, how obviously gratifying, to grant them one&#8230; This may be the most alluring aspect of the Valley of Lost Things: it renders the strangeness of the category of loss visible, like emptying the contents of a jumbled box onto the floor. In my mind, it is a dark, pen-and-ink place, comic and mournful as an Edward Gorey drawing: empty clothing drifting dolefully about, umbrellas piled in heaps like dormant bats, a Tasmanian tiger slinking off with Hemingway’s lost novel in its mouth, glaciers shrinking glumly down into their puddles, Amelia Earhart’s Lockheed Electra atilt upon the ground, the air around it filled with the ghosts of nighttime ideas not written down and gone by morning. It is this taxonomically outrageous population, shoes to souls to pterodactyls, that makes the idea of such a place so mesmerizing. Its contents have a unity and meaning based only on the single common quality of being lost, a kind of vast nationality, like “American.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/05/28/the-osbick-bird-edward-gorey/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/theosbickbird_edwardgorey3.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/05/28/the-osbick-bird-edward-gorey/\"><em>The Osbick Bird</em></a> by Edward Gorey</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But while the Valley of Lost Things is at bottom sorrowful place &#8212; &#8220;the things we love are banished to it, and we ourselves are banished from it&#8221; &#8212; its melancholy has a mirror image in the ecstatic delight of finding things. Schulz writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What an astonishing thing it is to find something. Children, who excel at it &#8212; chiefly because the world is still so new to them that they can’t help but notice it &#8212; understand this, and automatically delight in it&#8230; Finding is usually rewarding and sometimes exhilarating: a reunion with something old or an encounter with something new, a happy meeting between ourselves and some previously missing or mysterious bit of the cosmos.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In some territory of our collective imagination, there there seems to be an analogous place we might call the Valley of Found Things, strewn the forgotten phone number, the time for an afternoon walk, the photograph of my beaming twenty-something father atop my beaming twenty-something mother&#8217;s shoulders in the Black Sea. Finding, too, is a fractal delight &#8212; the simple delight of finding a long-treasured something we had lost, or finding something we didn&#8217;t know existed, branches from that grand, all-consuming, all-transforming, reality-recalibrating delight we call love. </p>\n<p>As with loss, so with love: Here too our our metaphors are woven of spacetime, bespeaking our inability to think and feel beyond it &#8212; we speak of &#8220;finding love,&#8221; as if love were stationed at some distinct location until (and here is another measure of time) we wander by to chance upon, something E.E. Cummings captured in that single perfect line: &#8220;love is a place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That place is precisely where Schulz found herself not long after her father&#8217;s death. She met (on Main Street in a small town, by a chance-fold of spacetime) and married (with all of their living parents and the bittersweet presence of her father&#8217;s absence: &#8220;a kind of commonplace memorial, a candle I don’t have to light because it is always bright with him&#8221;) the love of her life &#8212; a woman she came to love across the abyss of surface differences between them, differences past which she might not have plumbed the depths, had loss not reconfigured her world by shattering the bedrock of familiar reality to make space for the improbable, space for this stranger without whom spacetime came to feel unimaginable. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/05/28/the-osbick-bird-edward-gorey/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/theosbickbird_edwardgorey1.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/05/28/the-osbick-bird-edward-gorey/\"><em>The Osbick Bird</em></a> by Edward Gorey</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The second half of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Found-Memoir-Kathryn-Schulz/dp/0525512462/?tag=braipick-20\" target=_\"blank\"><strong><em>Lost &#038; Found</em></strong></a> is as much a meditation on finding the most precious of human finds &#8212; which is never a possession &#8212; as it is a love letter to her wife, ending with a beautiful meditation on how these twin experiences illuminate the central truth of life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That is all we have, this moment with the world. It will not last, because nothing lasts. Entropy, mortality, extinction: the entire plan of the universe consists of losing, and no matter how much we find along the way, life amounts to a reverse savings account in which we are eventually robbed of everything. Our dreams and plans and jobs and knees and backs and memories; the keys to the house, the keys to the car, the keys to the kingdom, the kingdom itself: sooner or later, all of it drifts into the Valley of Lost Things. </p>\n<p>[&#8230;] </p>\n<p>Nothing about that is strange or surprising; it is the fundamental, unalterable nature of things. The astonishment is all in the being here. It is the turtle in the pond, the thought in the mind, the falling star, the stranger on Main Street&#8230; To all of this, loss, which seems only to take away, adds its own kind of necessary contribution. No matter what goes missing, the object you need or the person you love, the lessons are always the same. Disappearance reminds us to notice, transience to cherish, fragility to defend. Loss is a kind of external conscience, urging us to make better use of our finite days. Our crossing is a brief one, best spent bearing witness to all that we see: honoring what we find noble, tending what we know needs our care, recognizing that we are inseparably connected to all of it, including what is not yet upon us, including what is already gone. We are here to keep watch, not to keep.</p></blockquote>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the unbearable name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).

And yet, by some felicitous deviation from logic &#8212; perhaps an adaptive imbecility essential for our mental and emotional survival, one of the touching incongruences that make us human &#8212; the moment something becomes precious to us, we quarantine the prospect of its loss in some chamber of the mind we choose not to enter. On some deep level beyond the reach of reason, we come to believe that the people we love are &#8212; must be, for the alternative is a fathomless terror &#8212; immortal. </p>\n<p>And so, when a loved one dies, this deepest part of us grows wild with rage at the universe &#8212; a rage skinned of sensemaking, irrational and raw, unsalved by our knowledge that the entropic destiny of everything alive is to die and of everything that exists to eventually not, even the universe itself; unsalved by the <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/10/alan-lightman-death/\">the immense cosmic poetry hidden in this fact</a>; unsalved by the luckiness of having lived at all <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/07/25/richard-dawkins-death/\">against the staggering cosmic odds otherwise</a>; unsalved by remembering that only because ancient archaebacteria were capable of dying, as was every organism that evolved in their wake, we and the people we love and the people we lose came to exist at all. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_76158\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/margueriteduras_marginalian.jpg?resize=680%2C910&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"910\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76158\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/margueriteduras_marginalian.jpg?w=700&#38;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/margueriteduras_marginalian.jpg?resize=320%2C428&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/margueriteduras_marginalian.jpg?resize=600%2C803&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/margueriteduras_marginalian.jpg?resize=240%2C321&#38;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marguerite Duras</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The French novelist, playwright, essayist, and filmmaker <strong>Marguerite Duras</strong> (April 4, 1914&#8211;March 3, 1996) captures this bewildering rage in the final pages of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Lover-Marguerite-Duras/dp/0375700528/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>The Lover</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/lover/oclc/11497818&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; her autobiographical novel about a writer creating herself as a woman and an artist in the act of writing, published the year I was born, some 3.7 billion years after the first archaebacterium began mutating and died.</p>\n<p>When the novel&#8217;s protagonist-narrator receives a telegram from Saigon, carrying news that her younger brother has been killed at twenty-seven, she receives the news as a kind of mistake, a &#8220;momentary error&#8221; eclipsing the universe, filling her soul with outrage &#8220;on the scale of God.&#8221; She realizes with the stab of hindsight that her brother had always appeared immortal to her, purely by virtue of being her beloved brother. Duras writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The error, the outrage, filled the whole universe&#8230; People ought to be told of such things. Ought to be taught that immortality is mortal, that it can die, it’s happened before and it happens still. It doesn’t ever announce itself as such &#8212; it’s duplicity itself. It doesn’t exist in detail, only in principle. Certain people may harbor it, on condition they don’t know that’s what they’re doing. Just as certain other people may detect its presence in them, on the same condition, that they don’t know they can.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With this, Duras turns to what fills our fragile mortality with meaning &#8212; what consecrates it with the sort of transcendence we might experience as joy, or art, or love. A century and a half after Mary Shelley <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/04/16/mary-shelley-the-last-man/\">contemplated what makes life worth living</a> as she envisioned a world savaged by a deadly pandemic, and a century after Walt Whitman <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/12/20/walt-whitman-specimen-days-meaning-of-life/\">contemplated what makes life worth living</a> after a paralytic stroke made him confront his own mortality, Duras arrives at a kindred conclusion:  </p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s while it’s being lived that life is immortal, while it’s still alive. Immortality is not a matter of more or less time, it’s not really a question of immortality but of something else that remains unknown. It’s as untrue to say it’s without beginning or end as to say it begins and ends with the life of the spirit, since it partakes both of the spirit and of the pursuit of the void.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/16/before-i-grew-up-miller-cucco/\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/beforeigrewup6-scaled.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Giuliano Cucco from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/16/before-i-grew-up-miller-cucco/\"><em>Before I Grew Up</em></a> &#8212; a lyrical elegy for life, loss, and our search for life.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This harmonic of life and death sings from the pages of Duras&#8217;s posthumous published <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Notebooks-Practicalities-Everymans-Contemporary-Classics/dp/1101907932/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wartime notebooks</a>, in one of which she reflects on the Mekong River of her native Vietnam as she traverses aboard a ferry: </p>\n<blockquote><p>All around the ferry is the river, it&#8217;s brimful, its moving waters&#8230; The river has picked up all it has met with since Tonle Sap and the Cambodian forest.

For Ellis, the thought that his atoms would ever come in close proximity to hers seemed as fantastical as meeting Beethoven. </p>\n<p>And then, one summer day in 1999, they did. </p>\n<p>His longtime friend and collaborator Nick Cave &#8212; himself an uncommonly soulful and penetrating thinker about <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/07/27/nick-cave-loss-grief/\">loss</a>, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/20/nick-cave-creativity/\">memory</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/01/24/nick-cave-music-ai/\">transcendence</a> &#8212; was directing London&#8217;s Meltdown Festival, and Nina Simone was to perform. Nobody yet knew it &#8212; for such is the murderous cruelty of lasts shot by time&#8217;s error &#8212; but it would be her last show in London. </p>\n<p>Cave recounts the nested strangenesses of that fateful evening:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nina Simone was a god to me and to my friends. The great Nina Simone. The legendary Nina Simone. The troublemaker and risk taker who taught us everything we needed to know about the nature of artistic disobedience. She was the real deal, the baddest of them all, and someone was tapping me on the shoulder and telling me that Nina Simone wanted to see me in her dressing-room.</p></blockquote>\n<p>She had summoned Cave to issue a commandment. Sitting there in her billowing white gown and Cleopatraesque metallic gold eye makeup, &#8220;imperious and belligerent, in a wheelchair, drinking champagne,&#8221; with &#8220;several attractive, worried men&#8221; lined against the wall, she looked at him &#8220;with open disdain&#8221; and declared that she wanted him to introduce her &#8212; as &#8220;Doctor Nina Simone.&#8221; (She had received her first honorary degrees in the 1970s at Amherst College, a block from Emily Dickinson&#8217;s bedroom, just as Ellis was beginning his life in music.) </p>\n<p>Cave issued an overeager &#8220;OK!&#8221; (In my mind, he curtsied.) And so, after his introduction, the show &#8212; which would end in &#8220;mutual rapture&#8221;: the audience in a state of grateful transcendence, Doctor Nina Simone &#8220;restored, awakened, transfigured&#8221; &#8212; began with intense emotional discord. </p>\n<p>Sitting five rows from the stage &#8212; &#8220;awestruck and glowing as if from a dream,&#8221; in his friend&#8217;s recollection &#8212; Ellis watched Nina Simone sit down at the Steinway, looking malcontented and angry and in pain, staring unsmiling at her fans while smoking her cigarette, smoking her cigarette while chewing her gum, &#8220;chewing with this look of tired defiance on her face.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Something about that struck Ellis as absolutely fantastic. It strikes me &#8212; the gum, the poetic incongruence of it &#8212; as tangible, chewable evidence of Whitman&#8217;s eternal insight that we contain multitudes, perhaps all the more multifarious in proportion to a person&#8217;s genius, which is always the product of greater interior complexity. Ellis recounts what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The crowd got to its feet when &#8220;Dr Nina Simone&#8221; came from Nick’s mouth and she moved onto the stage slowly. People were clapping, crying, screaming, ecstatic. I had never felt energy like that in a room. It was unfathomable to think we were in her presence. Those moments you don’t believe are real. When you know life will never be the same after.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>With great difficulty she walked to the front of the stage and she just put her clenched fist up in the air and just went, &#8220;Yeah!&#8221; Just like that. And I think there was this kind of reply, like a &#8220;yeah!&#8221; back, back to her. I remember nothing came out of my mouth as I attempted to reply. And then she did it again: &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; The sound of two thousand people gulping and their breath being sucked out of them.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_76098\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nina-Simones-Gum-Warren-Ellis/dp/0571365620/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimone_1999.png?resize=680%2C1001&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1001\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76098\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimone_1999.png?w=1008&#38;ssl=1 1008w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimone_1999.png?resize=320%2C471&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimone_1999.png?resize=600%2C883&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimone_1999.png?resize=240%2C353&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimone_1999.png?resize=768%2C1131&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nina Simone at the Meltdown Festival, London, July 1, 1999. (Photograph: Bleddyn Butcher.)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>There is no romanticizing the fact that this person of staggering genius self-medicated her longtime depression with substances, the abuse of which had caught up to her in a grim way by those final years of her life &#8212; a life of greatness staggered short by those very crutches for suffering. (Champaigne, cocaine, and sausages were among the things she demanded be brought to her backstage.) And yet there she was, majestic in her genius, unsaved by her genius, chewing her gum. With the empathetic poetry of perspective that underscores his book, Ellis writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I remember reading about a moment in her life in the mid-sixties when she got really depressed. Someone told her, &#8220;You know, you’re carrying the weight of everybody on your shoulders. It’s normal that you should crack up.&#8221; That we were about to see her perform in 1999 was a miracle.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As soon as she sat down at the Steinway, Nina Simone took the gum out of her mouth and stuck it under the piano; as soon as she walked off the stage, transformed and triumphal, Ellis leapt onto it as if in a trance, pried the gum from the piano, wrapped it in the abandoned towel she had used to wipe her sweat, and leapt off. He stuffed his strange bounty into a bright-yellow Tower Records bag and went back to his hotel. </p>\n<p>He began carrying it with him on tour, in the briefcase &#8212; that was the era &#8212; containing his &#8220;portable shrine,&#8221; alongside a 2B Staedtler pencil and a theosophical edition of <em>Notes on the Bhagavad-Ghita</em>, a poem from a friend and a green ballpoint pen from a Munich hospital, a red Japanese address book and a cross he had given his mother, which she had given back to him. Once or twice, perhaps the way one draws strength from an amulet, he looked at the gum in his hotel room, but he never touched it or removed it from the towel. Its existence remained largely a secret &#8212; partly the sanctity of the private talisman, partly his self-conscious sense that nobody else would care about Nina Simone&#8217;s chewed gum. </p>\n<p>And then, 9/11 happened. With his big beard, odd gear, and time-traveler garb, Ellis became the subject of constant bomb checks. Between the sniffer dogs and the general chaos, his strange relic no longer seemed safe in its towel and Tower Records bag. He decided to safekeep it at home. It lived for a while atop his own piano, but that began feeling too unsafe. He stuffed it in a vase in the window above the piano, but remained uneasy. He disassembled the piano and tucked it behind the soundboard. </p>\n<p>While touring, he began having panic attacks that something would happen to the gum, even though his watchful wife knew exactly where the gum was and exactly what it meant to her husband. </p>\n<p>When Ellis built himself a home studio, complete with a tiny shrine, he placed the Tower Records bag there, alongside a black-and-white photograph of his kids playing in the garden and a bust of Beethoven. Eventually, that too came to feel unsafe &#8212; he moved the gum to a wooden chest he had built in the attic and tucked it away along with his tax returns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nina-Simones-Gum-Warren-Ellis/dp/0571365620/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum8.jpg?resize=680%2C906&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"906\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76104\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum8.jpg?w=915&#38;ssl=1 915w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum8.jpg?resize=320%2C426&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum8.jpg?resize=600%2C799&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum8.jpg?resize=240%2C320&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum8.jpg?resize=768%2C1023&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>It remained there for many years, until Nick Cave asked his friend whether he still had the gum he had snatched from Nina Simone&#8217;s piano that strange and transcendent midsummer night in 1999.</p>\n<p>Two decades later, with Nina Simone gone to canon and stardust, her gum appeared inside a velvet-lined, temperature-controlled wood-and-glass box on atop a marble pedestal at the Royal Danish Library, part of <em>Stranger Than Kindness</em> &#8212; Nick Cave&#8217;s Copenhagen exhibition turned <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Than-Kindness-Nick-Cave/dp/0063048086/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">book</a>, exploring &#8220;the wild-eyed and compulsive superstructure&#8221; of creative influences beneath any artistic body of work, a subject he has contemplated with <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/20/nick-cave-creativity/\">uncommon poetry of insight</a>. </p>\n<p>Viewed from some distance, the miniature pedestal rises in its warm-lit case like a votive on the altar of some alien temple. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nina-Simones-Gum-Warren-Ellis/dp/0571365620/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum2.png?resize=680%2C843&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"843\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76101\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum2.png?w=1116&#38;ssl=1 1116w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum2.png?resize=320%2C397&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum2.png?resize=600%2C744&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum2.png?resize=240%2C297&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum2.png?resize=768%2C952&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ellis writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Something shifted when others became aware of the gum’s existence. I thought about how many tiny secrets there must be out there in the universe waiting to be revealed. How many people have secret places with abandoned dreams, full of wonder.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Except the relic on the marble pedestal was not Nina Simone&#8217;s gum, at least not exactly, and the story of its notness made it all the more a relic:</p>\n<p>After Cave asked about the gum, Ellis had gone into the attic, retrieved the yellow Tower Records bag, unfurled the towel, and looked at the gum for the first time in many years &#8212; there it was, unaltered by time or memory, with Nina Simone&#8217;s toothprint still exactly as he recalled it. He reflects:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The idea that it was still in her towel was something I had drawn strength from. Like the last breath of Thomas Edison contained in a sealed test tube, kept in the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. As Edison lay dying, Henry Ford telephoned Edison’s son and asked if he could capture the great man’s last breath. So he placed a rack of test tubes by the bed and stoppered them when Edison slipped this mortal coil. Unseeable, untouchable, the imagination that was activated by nothing. That nothing could engage the imagination. Communal imagination. That nothing could be everything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Followed back far enough, everything that moves us, everything we hold dear with a ferocity of feeling, is at bottom a hedge against our own mortality. Ellis realized that once his own atoms constellate a living person no more, this nondescript piece of chewing gum wrapped in a rag inside a twenty-year-old plastic bag would end up in a garbage bin &#8212; unless others become aware of its origin and significance, forming a chainlink of custodians to ensure the survival of this relic with meaning far beyond its materiality. </p>\n<p>The notion of getting the gum out of his orbit, into proper stewardship, into the public imagination, suddenly seemed like a duty. Recognizing that the polymers and resins laced with food-grade softeners were not equal to the task of historical preservation, Ellis decided to make a cast of it &#8212; an idea inspired by plaster-casts of hands he had seen while wandering into Melbourne&#8217;s antiquarian fair looking for one of the fourteen surviving copies of William Blake&#8217;s <em>America a Prophecy</em>. (Such is the superstructure of influences and creative catalysts.)</p>\n<p>Nervous not to &#8220;let the gum down as custodian&#8221; if anything went awry in the casting process, Ellis set out to find a collaborator he could entrust with this improbable miniature mausoleum. Even this becomes a meta-meditation on a fundament of art and the creative process, consonant with my own credo that so much of life is a matter of finding the people who <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/10/23/10-years-of-brain-pickings/\">magnify your spirit</a>. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Finding the right people to work with. That’s the thing, isn’t it? How does that happen? What draws us to people? Or them to us? This trust that is needed for collaborations to exist. This beautiful fragile moment each creation has to pass.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A Rube Goldberg machine of trusts follows, beginning with his younger brother&#8217;s childhood best friend &#8212; an artist from an old gold mining town in rural Australia that greets visitors with a replica of the largest gold nugget ever found there: a colossal 70-kilogram lump of precious metal forged billions of years ago in the core of some dying star as it collapsed into a black hole. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_76105\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/welcomenugget.jpg?resize=680%2C933&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"933\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76105\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/welcomenugget.jpg?w=1089&#38;ssl=1 1089w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/welcomenugget.jpg?resize=320%2C439&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/welcomenugget.jpg?resize=600%2C823&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/welcomenugget.jpg?resize=240%2C329&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/welcomenugget.jpg?resize=768%2C1054&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Welcome Nugget, Ballarat, Victoria.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As a boy, Ellis had marveled at the nugget from his bike; as a grown man, his mind&#8217;s eye &#8212; that prism of memory and association &#8212; brought back the gold nugget as a magnified version of Nina Simone&#8217;s gum, giving him the idea of finding a jeweler to make the cast. </p>\n<p>After some contemplation, his childhood friend sent Ellis to the perfect person for the odd job. In a London downpour, completely soaked and so anxious he nearly turned around to go home, Ellis arrived at the doorstep of the expat New Zealander <a href=\"http://hannahrings.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hannah Upritchard</a>. She remembers him turning up in his wool trousers and waistcoat, &#8220;a custodian of something big&#8221; &#8212; something big she was about to extract from a twenty-year-old towel using needlepoint tweezers and a fine scalpel. Everything about this surgery on the toothprinted soul made Ellis shudder. Given the delicate object and the material science involved, it would take a rare master to cast the relic without destroying it. Here he was putting his panicked trust in a total stranger:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Already aware I looked foolish enough as it was, I could feel my ears pop and the sound become muffled, that sensation when you put your head underwater and your heartbeat becomes an industrial pump&#8230; I was sort of hovering over her as if she was handling a newborn baby. Trying to be cool and totally not. I was instantly soaked in perspiration and I undid the fourth button on my best floral shirt. Three buttons is day time, four is for concerts. I really wasn’t helping the moment so I sat down on the wooden kitchen bench and watched her.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_76100\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum7.png?resize=680%2C906&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"906\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76100\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum7.png?w=838&#38;ssl=1 838w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum7.png?resize=320%2C427&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum7.png?resize=600%2C800&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum7.png?resize=240%2C320&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum7.png?resize=768%2C1024&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hannah Upritchard at work</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Frenzied with the knowledge that this stranger&#8217;s steady hands were the first to touch the gum since Nina Simone&#8217;s, Ellis felt an edge of sorrow that any touch might break the spell:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Her spirit existed in the space between the gum and the towel. That concert was in the gum. That transcendence. That transformation. It took me some time to come to terms with the fact that this would be broken.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When she asked him to hold it, he declined and left, leaving behind his fragile trust. Having sensed his unease, she sent him an assuring photograph of the gum sealed away in a neatly labeled empty marmalade jar, tucked into the safe storing the precious stones she works with. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Warren. I get it,&#8221; the message read. </p>\n<p>This simple kindness, too, becomes part of the way in which this seemingly foolish project is at heart a miniature of the largest truths about art and the creative spirit. Ellis reflects: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Those three words, &#8220;I get it.&#8221; It’s that moment when other people give you the confidence to trust and let go. Permission to let go. Often it is unspoken. It is understood telepathically. In the studio I’ve experienced this throughout my whole creative life, those moments when people reassured you with the confidence that allowed you to work to your greatest potential. Everyone getting it. To this day I haven’t touched the gum. I haven’t seen it physically since, except in the photo updates of its transformation. The beauty of others taking the baton.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The assurance was soon amplified by Upritchard&#8217;s conscientious craftsmanship and her devotion to rendering the perfect cast, both physically and symbolically. After considering the two possible approaches to casting &#8212; making a mould, or scanning the gum and having it 3D-printed &#8212; she felt the computerized option was &#8220;too impersonal and dismissive&#8221; to properly honor this strange and tender relic. Instead, she settled on &#8220;something cruder but also more honest and human.&#8221; </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nina-Simones-Gum-Warren-Ellis/dp/0571365620/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum6.jpg?resize=680%2C297&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"297\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76108\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum6.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum6.jpg?resize=320%2C140&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum6.jpg?resize=600%2C262&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum6.jpg?resize=240%2C105&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum6.jpg?resize=768%2C336&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Warming a walnut-sized ball of pink Super Sculpy with her hands, she shaped into two tiny hemispheres and gently pressed the twenty-year-old gum between them. </p>\n<p>Using this mould, she spent weeks perfecting the copy in blue wax, then cast it in silver. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nina-Simones-Gum-Warren-Ellis/dp/0571365620/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum4.jpg?resize=680%2C434&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"434\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76106\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum4.jpg?w=1881&#38;ssl=1 1881w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum4.jpg?resize=320%2C204&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum4.jpg?resize=600%2C383&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum4.jpg?resize=240%2C153&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum4.jpg?resize=768%2C490&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum4.jpg?resize=1536%2C980&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum4.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ellis finds the poetry in this material feat:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The metaphysical made physical&#8230; The gum was the relic laid in the foundations of a monument being built through love and care, with Nina Simone as the goddess over all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The photographs of the process reminded Ellis of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/23/emily-dickinson-herbarium/\">Emily Dickinson&#8217;s herbarium</a>, a facsimile of which he owns and cherishes.

It’s always been other people who have brought that potential out of me. I’m the inverse of the gum somehow. It’s about connection. People who have encouraged me to be the best I can, allow me to go unrestrained. Letting ideas take flight. Letting me take flight. The wonder of playing in a band. Making music with people. I was watching something unfold in a visual way, that I sensed often as an abstract or internalised concept&#8230; I could see a process happening in front of me that was familiar. An idea coming to life. Like a song or piece of music. People rallying around to do what was best for the song. Holding it aloft.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nina-Simones-Gum-Warren-Ellis/dp/0571365620/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum9.png?resize=680%2C758&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"758\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76099\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum9.png?w=1125&#38;ssl=1 1125w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum9.png?resize=320%2C357&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum9.png?resize=600%2C669&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum9.png?resize=240%2C268&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum9.png?resize=768%2C856&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nina-Simones-Gum-Warren-Ellis/dp/0571365620/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum3.jpg?resize=680%2C444&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"444\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-76107\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum3.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum3.jpg?resize=320%2C209&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum3.jpg?resize=600%2C392&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum3.jpg?resize=240%2C157&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ninasimonesgum3.jpg?resize=768%2C502&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Something about this entire endeavor is making me think of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/02/10/murmurs-of-earth-sagan-golden-record/\">The Golden Record</a> &#8212; Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan&#8217;s poetic gesture to the cosmos, which traveled aboard the <em>Voyager</em> spacecraft into the great unknown.

The overt scientific one, which got the project its NASA greenlight, was an effort to compress, encode, and transmit information about our world to another &#8212; an aim both ambitious and naïve, for the probability of this human-made artifact reaching another life-form in the vast expanse of austere spacetime, intersected with the probability of that potential life-form having the tools and consciousness capable of deciphering the disc, approximates zero. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/02/10/murmurs-of-earth-sagan-golden-record/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-63109\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=240%2C240&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=320%2C320&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=768%2C768&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=32%2C32&#38;ssl=1 32w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=50%2C50&#38;ssl=1 50w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=64%2C64&#38;ssl=1 64w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=96%2C96&#38;ssl=1 96w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/voyager_goldenrecord-1.jpg?resize=128%2C128&#38;ssl=1 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Golden Record</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But The Golden Record had a second aim &#8212; a poetic purpose that remains, in history&#8217;s hindsight, its primary: In the middle of the Cold War, in the aftermath of two World Wars and the assassinations of Dr. King and JFK and Gandhi, here was something holding a mirror up to humanity, inviting us to reflect on who we are and what we stand for, reminding us of our capacity for beauty and transcendence encoded in millennia of music from across our indivisible Pale Blue Dot &#8212; that ultimate poetic truth of what makes us human.

not at least a little abashed by the people we used to be, the voyage of  life has halted in the windless bay of complacency. This renders the interview a curious cultural artifact by design &#8212; a consensual homily of future abashment, etching into the common record who we were at a particular point in life, in a particular state of being, with all the temporary totality of thoughts and feelings that we so often mistake for final destinations of personhood. An interview petrifies us in time, then lives on forever, the thoughts of bygone selves quoted back to us across the eons of our personal evolution &#8212; a strange and discomposing taxidermy diorama of life that is no longer living.</p>\n<p>But a great interview does something else, too. A great touches the nucleus of being and potential, untouched by the forces of time and change.</p>\n<p>One January afternoon several selves ago, I entered the corrugated black walls of a snug recording studio at the School of Visual Arts to sit at a microphone across from a woman dressed entirely and impeccably in black &#8212; a woman all stranger, all sunshine. I didn&#8217;t expect that, over the next hour, the warmth of her generous curiosity and her sensitive attention would melt away my ordinary reticence about discussing the life beneath the work. I didn&#8217;t expect that, over the next decade, we would become creative kindred spirits, then friends, then longtime romantic partners, and finally dear lifelong friends and frequent <a href=\"https://themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-animated-episode-1\">collaborators</a>.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_53719\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/amandapalmer_debbiemillman.jpg?resize=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"What art does to and for us: Amanda Palmer performs &#34;Bigger on the Inside&#34; at the Design Matters recording studio as host Debbie Millman cries.

Every time, guests leave the studio with that distinctive glow of feeling deeply understood and appreciated, a little bit more in touch with ourselves beyond our selves, reminded of who and what we are in the hull of our being, in that place from which we make everything we make as we go on making ourselves. In the nearly two decades since the birth of <a href=\"http://designmattersmedia.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Design Matters</em></a> &#8212; born in that primordial epoch before podcasts, when Debbie actually had to pay for the radio waves transmitting these conversations &#8212; she has interviewed more than 450 creative people about the arc of their lives. Roxane Gay &#8212; once her interview subject, now her wife &#8212; describes the resulting totality as &#8220;a gloriously interesting and ongoing conversation about what it means to live well, overcome trauma, face rejection, learn to love and be loved, and thrive both personally and professionally.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The best parts of the best interviews from this immense body of work are now gathered in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Why-Design-Matters-Conversations-Creative/dp/0062872966/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Why Design Matters: Conversations with the World&#8217;s Most Creative People</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/why-design-matters/oclc/1233266324&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>). Pulsating through them are a handful of common themes &#8212; the elementary particles of which any creative life, any life of passion and purpose, any fully human life is built &#8212; none looming larger than the relationship between vulnerability and belonging, which constellates our entire cosmos of being: what we make, how we love, why we long for the things we long for, in love and in work. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72916\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-dorothy-lathrop-for-down-adown-derry-by-walter-de-la-mare-19224642772_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=680%2C801&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"801\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72916\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=320%2C377&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=600%2C707&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=240%2C283&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=768%2C905&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/03/09/dorothy-lathrop-down-adown-derry/\">Dorothy Lathrop</a>, 1922.

Artist <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/maira-kalman/\">Maira Kalman</a> captures the nuances with endearingly unselfconscious candor:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m constantly tormented. I think that’s the nature of creating anything &#8212; that there’s something wrong with you if you don’t have doubts. There is the duality that you have tremendous insecurity and a tremendous drive.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But insecurity is, in some deeper sense, the opposite of vulnerability. V-Day founder and <em>Vagina Monologues</em> creator V looks back on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/03/09/eve-ensler-tree/\">her brush with death</a> &#8212; which jolted her from a lifetime of trying to render herself invulnerable behind the armor of achievement and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/10/28/eve-ensler-apology-mother-earth/\">awakened her to a creaturely belonging with all of life</a> &#8212; and reflects:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I woke up from that surgery&#8230; I had tubes coming out of every part of my body. I had bags. I was hooked up to machines. I had a scar down my entire torso, but it was the first time in my life that I was a body, that it was fully a body. When you sit in a room and the doctor looks over at you and tells you the odds aren’t good, you die in that moment. There is a death that happens in your body. Then what begins to happen is you realize how much you want to be alive, and how beautiful life is, and how you want to actually live in your body and live fully in your life force.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>That tough veneer doesn’t let us feel our fear. It’s an invulnerability, even though underneath it we’re horribly vulnerable. Now, what I feel is that I’m vulnerable. We’re all vulnerable. We’re human beings on this planet Earth. We have no idea what we’re doing here. The greatest joy is living in that vulnerability. Which is different from insecurity.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75938\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/untitled-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent2.jpg?resize=680%2C538&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"538\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75938\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent2.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent2.jpg?resize=320%2C253&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent2.jpg?resize=600%2C475&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent2.jpg?resize=240%2C190&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent2.jpg?resize=768%2C607&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/15/rockwell-kent-wilderness/\">Rockwell Kent</a>, 1919.

Brené Brown has made it her life&#8217;s work to dive into and study those depths. She tells Debbie:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Vulnerability at its heart is the willingness to show up and be seen when you can’t control perception.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The one thing that we all have in common is&#8230; the paradox of vulnerability: that when I meet you, the very first thing I look for in you is vulnerability, and the very last thing I want to show you is my vulnerability.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We try to control perception by simulating invulnerability from behind various masks and armors. Among those most prevalent and pernicious in our culture is the broadcasting of busyness &#8212; this compulsion to signal that our valuable time is highly valued by others, that our presence and attention are in high demand, that how much we matter to the world exceeds the atoms of time at our disposal. (Autoresponders, particularly among creative people with no boss or client, are an especially unfortunate manifestation of this &#8212; rather than making the implicit and humane assumption that our response times are a natural function of their load and priorities, and therefore the best we can do no matter how long or short, an autoresponder makes a performative martyrdom of our own choices about how we are prioritizing our time and creative energies.) </p>\n<p>With her usual sympathetic intellect, Brown captures the tender humanity beneath these maladaptive self-importances:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Exhaustion is a status symbol because we desperately want to be seen, we desperately want to belong. We want to believe we’re lovable. In the absence of connection, there is always suffering, so we want to feel connected.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64202\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/two-fishes-swimming-in-the-sea-not-more-lawless-than-we_framed-print?sku=s6-8967304p21a12v52a13v54?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass6.jpg?resize=768%2C616&#038;ssl=1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illustration by Margaret C.

Alain de Botton, who has written about the subject with <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/alain-de-botton/\">such uncommon sympathy and sensitivity</a> over the arc of his own creative life, unravels the paradox in his conversation with Debbie:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s a real tension in love &#8212; at the beginning of love, particularly &#8212; between the desire to be honest about who one is and the desire to win the affection of another person. Of course, ideally, we can both be honest and loved for being honest. That’s the dream.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But the dream is too often dampened by our sense that we are too imperfect for the total acceptance we imagine love to be. We instead turn to safer counterfeits of love that allow us to dream a perfect dream, channeling the paradox of vulnerability into the paradox of the crush. De Botton observes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is often a desire to escape oneself in love. It’s not so much that one wants to be welcomed by another person. It’s that one wants to forget oneself and immerse in the perfection of another&#8230; We have this enormous capacity to locate perfection elsewhere, and this is what the crush is all about&#8230; The crush is the instantaneous certainty of the location of the ideal, and there’s an awful lot of projection and deception &#8212; self-deception &#8212; in it&#8230; The more information you know, the more you’re forced to realize that actually they are an independent person outside of your fantasy&#8230; The less information there is, the more our unconscious can hold onto this rather peculiar piece of emotional trapeze work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We reach for such counterfeits of love because the terror of real love often feels too great to bear &#8212; the terror of being known and cast out of love, which is a miniature of the ultimate terror, the ultimate vulnerability we are born into: being cast out of life. This is why, wherever real love exists, the terror of its loss is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/02/25/love-and-saint-augustine-hannah-arendt/\">the most fearsome of terror</a> &#8212; and why the fact of its loss, when it comes, can feel unsurvivable.

True belonging doesn’t require that you change who you are. It requires that you be who you are.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>We’re in&#8230; a spiritual crisis of disconnection. I define spirituality as the belief that we’re inextricably connected to each other by something bigger than us. Some people call that bigger thing God. Some people call it fishing. Some people call it art. Spirituality is no more, no less, than the belief that we’re connected to each other in a way that’s unbreakable. You cannot break the connection between human beings, but you can forget it. We have forgotten that inextricable connection between human beings.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64213\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/thoughts-silent-thoughts-of-time-and-space-and-death_framed-print?sku=s6-8967472p21a12v52a13v54?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=680%2C915&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"915\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64213\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=240%2C323&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=320%2C430&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=768%2C1033&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass21.jpg?resize=600%2C807&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Margaret Cook from a rare <a href=\"\">1913 edition</a> of Walt Whitman&#8217;s <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.

True belonging is not just about being a part of something but also having the courage to stand alone when you’re called to stand alone: when the joke’s not funny; when you don’t believe in something; when you have a different opinion; when you’re at family dinner and people are saying things that you actually find hurtful. When you’re called to stand alone and you can’t, then true belonging is very elusive. Your level of belonging will never exceed the level of courage you have to stand alone.</p></blockquote>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the unbearable name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).

A decade after Woolf&#8217;s death, the Nobel-winning quantum pioneer <strong>Erwin Schrödinger</strong> (August 12, 1887&#8211;January 4, 1961) would bring the lens of his new science to this age-old question threading together the minds of artists, philosophers, and mystics since the dawn of thought. </p>\n<p>In October 1956, Schrödinger delivered a set of lectures at Trinity College under the title <em>Mind and Matter</em>, posthumously included in his lecture collection <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Life-Autobiographical-Sketches-Classics/dp/1107604664/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>What Is Life?</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/what-is-life-the-physical-aspect-of-the-living-cell-and-mind-and-matter/oclc/70409030&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>). A generation of science later, on the cusp of our own century, the visionary mathematician, philosopher of science, and Nobel laureate Roger Penrose described the book as brimming with &#8220;points that, once they are grasped, have a ring of almost self-evident truth; yet they are still blindly ignored by a disconcertingly large proportion of people.&#8221; Today, as we continue to unravel the ongoing mysteries of mind and matter &#8212; which might be <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/04/05/carl-sagan-jonathan-cott-rolling-stone-interview/\">a single and permanent mystery</a> &#8212; Schrödinger&#8217;s book remains a tapestry of ideas epochs ahead of their time, yet stretching back to some of humanity&#8217;s most ancient wisdom.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_74854\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErwinSchrodinger_young.jpg?resize=680%2C963&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"963\" class=\"size-full wp-image-74854\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErwinSchrodinger_young.jpg?w=900&#38;ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErwinSchrodinger_young.jpg?resize=320%2C453&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErwinSchrodinger_young.jpg?resize=600%2C849&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErwinSchrodinger_young.jpg?resize=240%2C340&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErwinSchrodinger_young.jpg?resize=768%2C1087&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Erwin Schrödinger, circa 1920s.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Drawing on his lifelong inquiry into <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/11/03/erwin-shcrodinger-my-view-of-the-world/\">the relationship between quantum physics and Vedanta</a>, Schrödinger writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our science &#8212; Greek science &#8212; is based on objectivation, whereby it has cut itself off from an adequate understanding of the Subject of Cognizance, of the mind.

Schrödinger considers how we have erected these artificial barriers to cope with the &#8220;arithmetical paradox&#8221; of one-mind:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The reason why our sentient, percipient and thinking ego is met nowhere within our scientific world picture can easily be indicated in seven words: because it is itself that world picture. It is identical with the whole and therefore cannot be contained in it as a part of it. But, of course, here we knock against the arithmetical paradox; there appears to be a great multitude of these conscious egos, the world however is only one. This comes from the fashion in which the world-concept produces itself. The several domains of &#8220;private&#8221; consciousnesses partly overlap. The region common to all where they all overlap is the construct of the &#8220;real world around us.&#8221; With all that an uncomfortable feeling remains, prompting such questions as: Is my world really the same as yours? Is there <em>one</em> real world to be distinguished from its pictures introjected by way of perception into every one of us? And if so, are these pictures like unto the real world or is the latter, the world &#8220;in itself,&#8221; perhaps very different from the one we perceive?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Precisely because we <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/04/general-theory-of-love-music-emotion/\">perceive the world not as it is but as we are</a> &#8212; because our world-concept is shaped by the particular atoms of experience and neurochemistry composing our particular unchosen minds &#8212; Schrödinger observes that such questions, while genuine and natural, are actually &#8220;sham questions&#8221; that only further muddle this paradox of numbers &#8212; the numerous conscious egos of which the one world is composed. Instead, he endeavors to borrow from Eastern philosophy its &#8220;doctrine of identity&#8221; &#8212; a term uncolored then by our present political connotations, which he uses to mean rather the opposite: the inter-identification of minds with each other due to <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/11/03/erwin-shcrodinger-my-view-of-the-world/\">each mind being identical with the whole</a> &#8212; and to integrate it with the Western scientific worldview &#8220;without having to pay for it by a loss of soberness and logical precision&#8221; &#8212; an endeavor still met with staggering resistance by mainstream science, yet one taken up with renewed rigor by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/13/stephon-alexander-fear-of-a-black-universe/\">a new generation of scientists</a>. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72737\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-from-thomas-wrights-an-original-theory-or-new-hypothesis-of-the-universe-1750_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=680%2C977&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"977\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72737\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=240%2C345&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=320%2C460&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=768%2C1103&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/thomaswright_galaxies3.jpg?resize=600%2C862&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from Thomas Wright&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/02/16/thomas-wright-original-theory/\"><em>An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe</em></a>, 1750.

Not only has none of us ever experienced more than one consciousness, but there is also no trace of circumstantial evidence of this ever happening anywhere in the world. If I say that there cannot be more than one consciousness in the same mind, this seems a blunt tautology &#8212; we are quite unable to imagine the contrary.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The reflexive impulse to counterargue &#8212; perhaps by invoking the psychiatric disorder of dissociative identity, or some classic Oliver Sacks case study of a neurophysiological lesion resulting in multiple personalities &#8212; must be preempted with the simple recognition that personality, personae, and all the other performances of personhood we call identity are still playing out on the single stage of a person&#8217;s one and only consciousness. And yet the theater of reality is only one &#8212; there is only one world, atom by atom and moment by moment. With this, Schrödinger arrives at his Woolfian point:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The over-all number of minds is just one. I venture to call it indestructible since it has a peculiar timetable, namely mind is always now. There is really no before and after for mind. There is only a now that includes memories and expectations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A quarter century earlier, while Schrödinger was doing the quantum work that would earn him the Nobel Prize, the young Hannah Arendt &#8212; perhaps the most penetrating philosophical mind of the twentieth century &#8212; captured this aspect of consciousness in its most intimate manifestation, observing that if love is ever to prevail over the entropic inevitability of loss, <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/02/25/love-and-saint-augustine-hannah-arendt/\">&#8220;the only valid tense is the present, the Now.&#8221;</a></p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the unbearable name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).

He was thirty-six, dispirited and destitute, as passionate about his art and as pained by the world&#8217;s indifference to it as Walt Whitman had been when he self-published <em>Leaves of Grass</em> at that same age, from that same precarious place, intimate with the same depths of depression, buoyed by the same reverence for life. </p>\n<p>Drawing on that experience, Kent would later formulate the closest thing to a personal credo:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Often I think that however much I draw or paint, or however well, I am not an artist as art is generally understood. The abstract is meaningless to me save as a fragment of the whole, which is life itself&#8230; It is the ultimate which concerns me, and all physical, all material things are but an expression of it&#8230; We are part and parcel of the big plan of things. We are simply instruments recording in different measure our particular portion of the infinite. And what we absorb of it makes for character, and what we give forth, for expression.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75928\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/vision-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_vision.jpg?resize=680%2C606&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"606\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75928\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_vision.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_vision.jpg?resize=320%2C285&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_vision.jpg?resize=600%2C535&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_vision.jpg?resize=240%2C214&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_vision.jpg?resize=768%2C685&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The Vision</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

His parents had pressured him to channel his talent into a practical, profitable career in form and function, but he had dropped out of Columbia University&#8217;s architecture program to devote himself to the work of form and feeling, moving to a rugged island off the coast of Maine. He built himself a small house there and spent his days in solitude &#8212; reading Emerson and Tolstoy, and painting; laboring as a lobsterman, and painting. Immersed in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-animated-episode-1/\">Haeckel&#8217;s inception of ecology</a>, he grew enchanted with the interwoven life of nature; immersed in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/05/25/thoreau-walden-nature/\">Thoreau&#8217;s journals</a>, he absorbed the will &#8220;to live deliberately&#8221; in wild places where he could find and nurture his inner wilderness &#8212; those lush and desolate landscapes of the soul, from which all art is born.  </p>\n<p>So it is that, in his late twenties, Rockwell Kent voyaged to Newfoundland in the hope of establishing a communal art school with a friend in the untrammeled northern wilderness. The hope crumbled against reality, but the Great North cast a permanent enchantment. He returned four years later, in 1914, this time with his wife and three children, just as the world was coming unworlded by the Great War. </p>\n<p>In a small-town community where the notion of an artist was alien and suspect, the large-spirited, liberal-minded Kent was soon accused of being a German spy. Driven away, the family had to make the long voyage back &#8212; Kathleen pregnant with their fourth child, the other three ill with whooping cough. </p>\n<p>But the northern wilderness kept calling to the artist&#8217;s soul: </p>\n<blockquote><p>I crave snow-topped mountains, dreary wastes, and the cruel Northern sea with its hard horizons at the edge of the world where infinite space begins. Here skies are clearer and deeper and, for the greater wonders they reveal, a thousand times more eloquent of the eternal mystery than those of softer lands.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75929\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/the-star-lighter-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=680%2C597&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"597\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75929\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=320%2C281&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=600%2C527&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=240%2C211&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_star-lighter.jpg?resize=768%2C674&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>The Star-Lighter</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

Kent found Olson to be &#8220;a kind-hearted, genial old man with a vast store of knowledge and true wisdom,&#8221; a man of &#8220;deep experience, strong, brave, generous and gentle like a child,&#8221; a &#8220;keen philosopher [who] by his critical observations gives his discourse a fine dignity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Father and son set about converting Olson&#8217;s goat-house into a home. On either side of the log cabin, Kent &#8212; an excellent carpenter from a young age &#8212; built two long wall-to-wall shelves: one to hold their provisions, the other for paints, toys, clothes, and the flute. In the far corner, he built a bookshelf for their miniature library &#8212; sustenance for mind and spirit, as vital as the canned goods they had carried across the landmass and rowed across the icy strait of Arctic waters. Among the books were <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The Odyssey</em>; <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> and the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen; a book of Indian philosophy and a literary history of Ireland; a natural history of the ocean and a basic medical handbook; William Blake&#8217;s poems and <em>Life of Blake</em> &#8212; the biography with which Anne Gilchrist had wrested Blake from obscurity a generation earlier to establish him as a creative icon for generations, celebrated by Patti Smith as <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/11/28/willim-blake-poems-patti-smith/\">&#8220;the loom’s loom, spinning the fiber of revelation,”</a> and casting upon Kent a spell of &#8220;intense and illuminating fervor.&#8221;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75922\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/the-cabin-window-by-rockwell-kent-1918_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_cabin.jpg?resize=680%2C617&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"617\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75922\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_cabin.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_cabin.jpg?resize=320%2C290&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_cabin.jpg?resize=600%2C544&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_cabin.jpg?resize=240%2C218&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_cabin.jpg?resize=768%2C696&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Cabin Window</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

Kent tried calking the gaping openings between the logs with dried moss, but the moss never managed to dry enough for insulation under the interminable rain. Indeed, from the moment they set foot on Fox Island, father and son waded into a world ruled by rain, an <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/05/20/anne-sexton-love-poems-song-for-a-lady-ohara-hale/\">Anne Sexton kind of rain</a>. In their first seventeen days, a single cloudless sunrise greeted them. &#8220;It will be a strange life without the dear, warm sun!&#8221; Kent lamented in his journal. The absence of the sun &#8212; like any absences of cherished warmth and radiance &#8212; made its rare returns all the dearer, aglow with ecstasy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ah, the evenings are beautiful here and the early mornings, when the days are fair! No sudden springing of the sun into the sky and out again at night; but so gradual, so circuitous a coming and a going that nearly the whole day is twilight and the quiet rose color of morning and evening seems almost to meet at noon. We glance through our tiny western window at sunrise and see beyond the bay the many ranges of mountains, from the somber ones at the water’s edge to the distant glacier and snowcapped peaks, lit by the far-off sun with the loveliest light imaginable.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75920\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/day-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_day.jpg?resize=680%2C902&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"902\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75920\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_day.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_day.jpg?resize=320%2C425&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_day.jpg?resize=600%2C796&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_day.jpg?resize=240%2C318&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_day.jpg?resize=768%2C1019&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_day.jpg?resize=1158%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1158w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Day</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

They go berry-picking along the coast of Resurrection, skate on the pond &#8220;frozen hard and thick,&#8221; and watch the killer whales play in the cove by their cabin, &#8220;their terrible, mysterious, black arms that beat the water with a sound like cannon.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Recording these encounters with the elemental, Kent&#8217;s diary entries read like prose poetry, as any fully attentive and pure-hearted observation of nature always does &#8212; deeply affecting yet unaffected, fresh from the source. One mid-October evening, after quoting from memory a lullaby verse by a German poet born 100 years earlier, Kent exults:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The night is beautiful beyond thought. All the bay is flooded with moonlight and in that pale glow the snowy mountains appear whiter than snow itself. The full moon is almost straight above us, and shining through the tree tops into our clearing makes the old stumps quite lovely with its quiet light. And the forest around is as black as the abyss.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The following evening, a wholly different guise of beauty:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To-night the sun set in the utmost splendor and left in its wake blazing, fire-red clouds in a sky of luminous green.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The moon has risen and illuminates the mountain tops &#8212; but we and all our cove are still in the deep shadow of the night. It is most dramatic; the spruces about us deepen the shadow to black while above them the stone faces of the mountain glisten and the sky has the brightness of a kind of day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In another entry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>From our feet the cliff dropped in a V-shaped divide straight down to the green ocean; and at its base the ground swell curled, broke white and eddied. The jagged mountains across shone white against black clouds, &#8212; what peaks! huge and sharp like the teeth of the Fenris-Wolf.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75925\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/victory-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_victory.jpg?resize=680%2C617&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"617\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75925\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_victory.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_victory.jpg?resize=320%2C290&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_victory.jpg?resize=600%2C545&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_victory.jpg?resize=240%2C218&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_victory.jpg?resize=768%2C697&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Victory</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

And so, one cold October day seven weeks after alighting to Fox Island, Kent records:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We came home and had a good dinner. I cut more wood and at last, after one month here on the island, I PAINTED. It was a stupid sketch, but no matter, I’ve begun!</p></blockquote>\n<p>He feels &#8220;the goddess Inspiration returning&#8221; and soon the floodgates of his creative force rush open: </p>\n<blockquote><p>After the morning’s wood cutting I worked hard on my pictures. I’m now at last fully launched upon my work with small pictures going well. That’s both a relief and a concern to me. From now on my mind can never be quite free.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a passage that captures every true artist&#8217;s savage and restless devotion to their art &#8212; the kind Beethoven conveyed in his <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/18/beethoven-emilie-letter/\">letter of advice</a> to a little girl longing to be an artist, the kind at the heart of Martha Graham&#8217;s exquisite notion of <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/10/02/martha-graham-creativity-divine-dissatisfaction/\">&#8220;divine dissatisfaction&#8221;</a> &#8212; Kent writes one October day two months after his arrival:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Today was a day of hard work for me. I cut wood, baked bread and painted on three canvasses&#8230; Over to-day’s painting I’m filled with pride; it will be equalled by to-morrow’s despair over the very same pictures.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He becomes a channel for the majesty around him, seeing in it a reflection of his own worldview, mirroring it back to the world in the paintings nature draws out of him:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A wonderfully beautiful day with a raging northwest wind. I must sometime honor the northwest wind in a great picture as the embodiment of clean, strong, exuberant life, the joy of every young thing, bearing energy on its wings and the will to triumph.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75931\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/the-north-wind-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_northwind.jpg?resize=680%2C834&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"834\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75931\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_northwind.jpg?w=1167&#38;ssl=1 1167w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_northwind.jpg?resize=320%2C393&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_northwind.jpg?resize=600%2C736&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_northwind.jpg?resize=240%2C294&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_northwind.jpg?resize=768%2C942&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>North Wind</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

It is a paradise build of what his literary hero Hermann Hesse, writing in the same era on a different landmass in a wholly different landscape, called <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/03/06/hermann-hesse-little-joys-my-belief/\">&#8220;the little joys&#8221;</a> &#8212; those smallest atoms of aliveness. Kent records:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mornings we get up together and go through a set of Dr. Sargent’s exercises, do them with great energy. Then we go naked out-of-doors&#8230; No matter what the weather is we go calmly out into it, lie down in the drift, look up into the sky, and then scrub ourselves with snow. It’s the finest bath in the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One day, looking around the ramshackle goat-house that is now his home, filled with books and wind, filled with a man&#8217;s paintings and a child&#8217;s love, Kent observes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t see why people need better homes than this.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In an entry from the peak of winter, he contemplates how such simple life in harsh conditions can so salve and enlarge his creative spirit:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We have&#8230; turned out of the beaten, crowded way and come to stand face to face with that infinite and unfathomable thing which is the wilderness; and here we have found OURSELVES &#8212; for the wilderness is nothing else. It is a kind of living mirror that gives back as its own all and only all that the imagination of a man brings to it&#8230; and if we have not shuddered at the emptiness of the abyss and fled from its loneliness, it is because of the wealth of our own souls that filled the void with imagery, warmed it, and gave it speech and understanding.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Punctuating this surrender to the grandeur of nature and soul are various quotidian tragicomedies. Violent wind sweeps in through the cracks in the cabin and powders Kent&#8217;s drawing table with snow. The cold grows so ferocious that his fountain pen and paint freeze solid, the foxes&#8217; food freezes solid, the water pails freeze solid ten feet from the booming stove. One of Olson&#8217;s goats &#8212; &#8220;foolish-faced Angoras&#8221; &#8212; eats the broom, then breaks into the house, leaving &#8220;boxes, pails, sacks of grain, cans, rope, tools, all lie piled in confusion about the floor.&#8221; Such happenings only foment Kent&#8217;s deep-souled reflections on life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Where little happens and the gamut of expression is narrow, life is still full of joy and sorrow.

In consonance with poet Elizabeth Bishop&#8217;s insistence on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/02/08/elizabeth-bishop-solitude/\">why everyone should experience at least one long period of extreme solitude in life</a>, and with his contemporary Hermann Hesse&#8217;s insight into <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/01/15/hermann-hesse-solitude-suffering-destiny/\">the destiny-sculpting value of hardship and solitude</a>, Kent writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>These days are wonderful but they are terrible. It is thrilling&#8230; to reflect that we are absolutely cut off from all mankind, that we cannot, in this raging sea, return to the world nor the world come to us. Barriers must secure your isolation in order that you may experience the full significance of it. The romance of an adventure hangs upon slender threads. A banana peeling on a mountain top tames the wilderness. Much of the glory of this Alaska is in the knowledge I have that the next bay &#8212; which I may never choose to enter &#8212; is uninhabited, that beyond those mountains across the water is a vast region that no man has ever trodden, a terrible ice-bound wilderness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And yet, as much as nature might gladden human nature, it is our nature also to long for love and connection with our fellow beings. After twenty weeks of such extreme isolation, in an entry penned in the pit of winter, in a sentiment acutely relatable to any twenty-first-century person who has anguished to see an email go unanswered or to watch the three dots on their phone blink and disappear, Kent writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is terribly depressing to have your heart set upon that mail that doesn’t come.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His suicidal depression returns:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I feel like making no record of these days. I take pleasure only in their quick passage.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75923\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/go-to-bed-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_insomnia.jpg?resize=680%2C620&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"620\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75923\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_insomnia.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_insomnia.jpg?resize=320%2C292&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_insomnia.jpg?resize=600%2C547&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_insomnia.jpg?resize=240%2C219&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_insomnia.jpg?resize=768%2C700&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Go to Bed</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

The snow sticks to the mountain tops even to the steepest, barest peaks painting them all a spotless, dazzling white. It’s a marvelous sight&#8230; There never was so beautiful a land as this!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eventually, confusions about time arise. His only timepiece &#8212; a dollar watch handed down to Olson by its previous owner &#8212; stops working. Father and son begin living by animal instinct: They rise at daybreak, have a prompt breakfast &#8212; always the same: oatmeal, cocoa bread, and peanut butter &#8212; then eat only when hungry as they immerse themselves in the day&#8217;s work and in the living world around them, noticing, noticing, and turning those noticings into art; in the evenings, Kent plays the flute for little Rockwell and reads to him (but not stories about kings and queens, which the boy tells his father he dislikes because &#8220;they’re always marrying and that kind of stuff&#8221;), until they &#8220;go to bed without any notion of the hour.&#8221; A typical entry reads:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hard, hard at work, little play, not too much sleep. The wind blows ceaselessly. Rockwell is forever good, &#8212; industrious, kind, and happy. He reads now quite freely from any book. Drawing has become a natural and regular occupation for him, almost a recreation &#8212; for he can draw in both a serious and a humorous vein. At this moment he’s waiting in bed for some music and another Andersen fairy tale.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With time so elusive, they lose track of the date. There are practical consequences: The steamer to and from Seward &#8212; the “New York of the Pacific” &#8212; runs on a spare and strict schedule, on which they rely for their mail and provisions. There are poetic consequences, too: Unsure when to celebrate little Rockwell&#8217;s tenth birthday, they designate a best-guess day, on which Kent begins teaching his son to sing and presents him with his sole, precious present &#8212; &#8220;a cheap child’s edition&#8221; of a popular natural history encyclopedia. It so delights the boy with its depictions of his beloved wild animals that he decides, a generation before Borges, to begin writing and drawing an encyclopedia of imaginary beasts. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75927\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/zarathustra-and-his-playmates-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_zarathustra.jpg?resize=680%2C541&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"541\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75927\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_zarathustra.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_zarathustra.jpg?resize=320%2C255&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_zarathustra.jpg?resize=600%2C478&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_zarathustra.jpg?resize=240%2C191&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_zarathustra.jpg?resize=768%2C611&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Zarathustra and His Friends</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

Something quickens in him under the conditions of this new life &#8212; so spartan, so primal &#8212; and deconditions the habits of mind by which civilization bridles the spirit: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Here in the supreme simplicity of life amid these mountains the spirit laughs at man’s concern with the form of Art, with new expression because the old is outworn! It is man’s own poverty of vision yielding him nothing, so that to save himself he must trick out in new garb the old, old commonplaces, or exalt to be material for art the hitherto discarded trivialities of the mind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are days too short and dark to paint, too bleak to access the aliveness from which art springs &#8212; days when &#8220;the spirit didn’t work.&#8221; But there are also days, rosaries of them, that consecrate Kent&#8217;s painting with a state of total flow:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is weeks since I have stopped my work even for a walk. In this “out-of-doors life” I see little of out-of-doors.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Five months into this Fox Island life, having &#8220;struck a fine stride,&#8221; Kent settles into a peculiar creative routine:</p>\n<blockquote><p>During the day I paint out-of-doors from nature by way of fixing the forms and above all the color of the out-of-doors in my mind. Then after dark I go into a trance for a while with Rockwell subdued into absolute silence. I lie down or sit with closed eyes until I “see” a composition, &#8212; then I make a quick note of it or maybe give an hour’s time to perfecting the arrangement on a small scale. Then when that’s done I’m care free. Rockwell and I play cards for half an hour, I get supper, he goes to bed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Again and again, it is nature &#8212; so immediate, so alive, so numinous &#8212; that becomes the portal to this trance, leaving him with a magnified capacity for art and a clarified lens on life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One night, one midnight out on the black waters of a Newfoundland harbor, the million stars above, and on the wretched vessel’s deck the horde of half-drunk, soul-starved men saying their passionate farewells, &#8212; on the dull plain of their life a flash of lightning revealed an abyss; &#8212; this night on the still, dark cove of Resurrection Bay, rimmed with wild mountains and the wilderness, strong men about you, mad, loosened speech and winged, prophetic vision, &#8212; God! but sane daylight seeing seems to touch but the white, hard surface of where life is hidden.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75926\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/superman-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_superman.jpg?resize=680%2C839&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"839\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75926\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_superman.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_superman.jpg?resize=320%2C395&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_superman.jpg?resize=600%2C740&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_superman.jpg?resize=240%2C296&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_superman.jpg?resize=768%2C947&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Superman</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

The enchantment of it has been complete; it has possessed us to the very last. How long such happiness could hold, such quiet life continue to fill up the full measure of human desires only a long experience could teach. The still, deep cup of the wilderness is potent with wisdom. Only to have tasted it is to have moved a lifetime forward to a finer youth&#8230; We have learned what we want and are therefore wise. As graduates in wisdom we return from the university of the wilderness.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On March 18 &#8212; their last day in the wilderness, and the last days of the world&#8217;s first winter after the end of the war &#8212; Kent writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fox Island will soon become in our memories like a dream or vision, a remote experience too wonderful, for the full liberty we knew there and the deep peace, to be remembered or believed in as a real experience in life. It was for us life as it should be, serene and wholesome; love &#8212; but no hate, faith without disillusionment&#8230; Ah God, &#8212; and now the world again!</p></blockquote>\n<p>But as he reentered the world, with its falsehoods and human ferocities, Kent carried the wilderness with him, its indelible imprint on his soul. Looking back on his time in Alaska, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In living and recording these experiences I have sensed a fresh unfolding of the mystery of life. I have found wisdom, and this new wisdom must in some degree have won its way into my work.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75924\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/woman-by-rockwell-kent-1919_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_woman.jpg?resize=680%2C791&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"791\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75924\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_woman.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_woman.jpg?resize=320%2C372&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_woman.jpg?resize=600%2C698&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_woman.jpg?resize=240%2C279&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent_woman.jpg?resize=768%2C893&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Woman</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

The two New York exhibitions of his paintings that followed his return from Alaska were artistically and financially triumphal, sparking a new chapter of solvency for him and Kathleen, and liberating him at last to devote himself wholly to art. Timed with the second exhibition, the publication of his Alaska journal was heralded by England&#8217;s most esteemed culture magazine as &#8220;the most remarkable book to come out of America since <em>Leaves of Grass</em>.&#8221; (An epoch earlier, the English &#8212; much thanks to Anne Gilchrist&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/03/05/anne-gilchrist-walt-whitman-letters/\">impassioned advocacy</a> &#8212; had been early to recognize Whitman&#8217;s genius when his own country derided and dismissed him.) </p>\n<p>When the first exhibition of his Alaska drawings was being mounted, the gallery engaged one of New York&#8217;s preeminent art critics to compose the introduction for the catalogue. He wrote to Kent to learn more about how this time in the wilderness shaped his artistic practice. Kent responded with a letter so exquisite, so vibrant with his authentic spirit, that it was printed as the introduction instead. In it, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It has always been hard for me to understand myself, to know why I work and love and live. Yet it is fortunate that such matters find a way of caring for themselves. I came to Alaska because I love the North. I crave snow-topped mountains, dreary wastes, and the cruel Northern sea with its hard horizons at the edge of the world where infinite space begins. Here skies are clearer and deeper and, for the greater wonders they reveal, a thousand times more eloquent of the eternal mystery than those of softer lands.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While elsewhere in New York <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/08/03/the-universe-in-verse-natalie-batalha-edna-st-vincent-millay/\">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> was composing her now-iconic sonnet that begins with &#8220;My candle burns at both ends,&#8221; to be published months later, Kent reflects on the allure of the Great North&#8217;s elemental brutality, on the magnetic misery in the &#8220;gloom of the long and lonely winter nights,&#8221; and writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Always I have fought and worked and played with a fierce energy, and always as a man of flesh and blood and surging spirit. I have burned the candle at both ends and can only wonder that there has been left even a slender taper glow for art.</p>\n<p>And so this sojourn in the wilderness is in no sense an artist’s junket in search of picturesque material for brush or pencil, but the fight to freedom of a man who detests the petty quarrels and bitterness of the crowded world &#8212; the pilgrimage of a philosopher in quest of Happiness! But the wilderness is what man brings to it, no more. If little Rockwell and I can live in these vast silences beside the heartless ocean, perched high up on the peak of the earth with the wind all about us, if we can stand here and not flee from the terror of emptiness, it is because the wealth of our own souls warms the mountains and sea, and peoples the great desolate spaces. For the time we look into ourselves and are not afraid. We find here life, true life &#8212; life rich, resplendent, and full of love. We have learned not to fear destiny but to live for the heaven that can be made upon earth.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75932\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/untitled-by-rockwell-kent_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent1.jpg?resize=680%2C992&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"992\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75932\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent1.jpg?w=1649&#38;ssl=1 1649w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent1.jpg?resize=320%2C467&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent1.jpg?resize=600%2C875&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent1.jpg?resize=240%2C350&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent1.jpg?resize=768%2C1121&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent1.jpg?resize=1053%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1053w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/rockwellkent1.jpg?resize=1404%2C2048&#38;ssl=1 1404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Untitled</em> by Rockwell Kent, 1919.

(<em>Some necessary calibration for the ahistorical bristling modern readers often experience at our ancestors&#8217; word-choices: Women were not yet citizens and would finally win the right to vote two months after the artist&#8217;s return from Alaska, which was not yet a state and wouldn&#8217;t be for another forty years; the word &#8220;man&#8221; was both the unexamined universal pronoun &#8212; to remain so until Ursula K.

The hallmark of our species, the cost of living inside a consciousness so elaborate yet so self-limited, is that we know all this and yet we hunger for cohesion, for continuity, for pattern. </p>\n<p>We call that hunger meaning. </p>\n<p>We call it sensemaking. </p>\n<p>We call it storytelling. </p>\n<p>It is the great human implement that renders the world comprehensible to us and renders us comprehensible to ourselves. Its function is our shared inheritance; its form is the crucible of our difference: “Biologically, physiologically, we are not so different from each other; historically, as narratives &#8212; we are each of us unique,” the sage and sensitive neurologist Oliver Sacks observed as he considered <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/01/15/oliver-sacks-identity-self-narrative/\">the building blocks of personhood</a>.</p>\n<p>How that difference enriches our inner cohesion is what <strong>Barry Lopez</strong> (January 6, 1945&#8211;December 25, 2020) explores in the introduction to his enchanting essay collection <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/About-This-Life-Journeys-Threshold/dp/0679754474/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>About This Life: Journeys on the Threshold of Memory</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/about-this-life-journeys-on-the-threshold-of-memory/oclc/749294569&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75783\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/barrylopez_river.jpg?resize=680%2C451&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"451\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75783\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/barrylopez_river.jpg?w=1280&#38;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/barrylopez_river.jpg?resize=320%2C212&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/barrylopez_river.jpg?resize=600%2C398&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/barrylopez_river.jpg?resize=240%2C159&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/barrylopez_river.jpg?resize=768%2C509&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Barry Lopez.

I didn’t consider that these people spoke a truth no one else possessed; but, listening to them, I saw the inadequacy of my education. It lacked any suggestion that these voices were necessary, that they were relevant&#8230; In the years after those first encounters with senior Native American men, itinerant Asian poets, black jazz musicians, and translators, I deliberately began to seek the company of people outside my own narrow cultural bounds. I was drawn especially to men and women who had not dissociated themselves from the passionate and spiritual realms of life, people for whom mystery was not a challenge to intelligence but a bosom.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the human-nature counterpart to the evolutionary fact that <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/01/02/the-snail-with-the-right-heart/\">diversity is nature&#8217;s wellspring of beauty and resilience</a>, he adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The effect of these encounters was&#8230; an understanding that my voice, steeped in Jung, Dante, Heisenberg, Melville, and Merton, was not the only voice. My truth was not the one truth. My tongue did not compose a pinnacle language. These other voices were as indispensable to our survival as variations in our DNA.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_66455\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/a-velocity-of-being-mouni-feddag_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MouniFeddag.jpg?resize=680%2C944&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"944\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66455\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MouniFeddag.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MouniFeddag.jpg?resize=240%2C333&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MouniFeddag.jpg?resize=320%2C444&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MouniFeddag.jpg?resize=768%2C1066&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MouniFeddag.jpg?resize=600%2C833&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Mouni Feddag from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/11/20/a-velocity-of-being-letters-to-a-young-reader/\"><em>A Velocity of Being: Letters to a Young Reader</em></a>.

For however different the voices may be from each other, they all seek to express, to possess, to render real the same elemental truths and longings that pulsate beneath our human experience. Looking back on his early training in anthropological research and his immersion in various cultures over the course of his creative life, Lopez observes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In all human societies there is a desire to love and be loved, to experience the full fierceness of human emotion, and to make a measure of the sacred part of one’s life&#8230; The most dependable way to preserve these possibilities is to be reminded of them in stories. Stories do not give instruction, they do not explain how to love a companion or how to find God. They offer, instead, patterns of sound and association, of event and image. Suspended as listeners and readers in these patterns, we might reimagine our lives. It is through story that we embrace the great breadth of memory, that we can distinguish what is true, and that we may glimpse, at least occasionally, how to live without despair in the midst of the horror that dogs and unhinges us.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72916\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-dorothy-lathrop-for-down-adown-derry-by-walter-de-la-mare-19224642772_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=680%2C801&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"801\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72916\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=320%2C377&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=600%2C707&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=240%2C283&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/downadownderry_dorothylathrop17.jpg?resize=768%2C905&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/03/09/dorothy-lathrop-down-adown-derry/\">Dorothy Lathrop</a>, for Walter de la Mare&#8217;s fairy-poems for children, 1922.

You have the right to be angry, but you don’t have the right not to practice in order to transform your anger&#8230; When you notice that anger is coming up in you, you have to practice mindful breathing in order to generate the energy of mindfulness, in order to recognize your anger and embrace it tenderly so that you can bring relief into you and not to act and to say things&#8230; that can be destructive.

Instead, I have prepared another kind of list, shorter, more personally humbling, of some things I think I might have been learning more about if I hadn&#8217;t been so puzzled all those years by medicine itself. There are matters that I assume most other people my age comprehend nicely, and I never got round to studying.</p>\n<p>The Federal Reserve System is at the top of my list. I&#8217;ve never known what it was or what it did or how it did it, and what is more I don&#8217;t want to be told. The same goes for the stock market, and for the bond market, and the word processor (one of which I actually possess and am baffled by), and the internal combustion engine, and the universe, black holes, galactic mirrors, those other universes, and space-time. Most of all, space-time. I cannot get ahold of it.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_76134\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/11/universe-in-verse-animated-hubble/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mygod-scaled.jpg?resize=680%2C359&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"359\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76134\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mygod-scaled.jpg?w=2560&#38;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mygod-scaled.jpg?resize=320%2C169&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mygod-scaled.jpg?resize=600%2C316&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mygod-scaled.jpg?resize=240%2C127&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mygod-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C405&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mygod-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C810&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mygod-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1080&#38;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mygod-scaled.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Daniel Bruson for <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/11/universe-in-verse-animated-hubble/\">&#8220;My God, It&#8217;s Full of Stars&#8221;</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>With so fetching a wink, Thomas turns to the real object of his meditation: our native inability to comprehend how the same processes that begot these remote abstractions also begot the fleshy, feeling concreteness of us. There is something incredibly lovely about Thomas&#8217;s warm humor &#8212; here is man of extraordinary intellect, scientific erudition, and uncommon human sensitivity, inviting the rest of us, far more ordinary and modestly lettered, to join him in his gladsome bafflement at the seeming miracle of life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I even have troubles of my own with evolutionary biology. Not first principles, mind you, not the big picture, mostly just the details. I understand about randomness and chance, and election, and adaptation, and all that, and I now know better than to talk, ever, about progress in evolution, never mind purpose. My problems come when I think about the earliest form of known life, those indisputable bacterial cells in rocks 3.7 billion years old, our Ur-grandparents for sure, then nothing but bacteria for the next two and one-half billion years, and now the chestnut tree in my backyard, my Abyssinian cat Jeoffry, the almost-but-not-quite free-living microbes living in all our cells disguised as mitochondria, and, just by the way, our marvelous, still-immature, dangerous selves, brainy enough to menace all nature unless distracted by music.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Leaning on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/08/11/lewis-thomas-notes-on-punctuation/\">his training as an etymologist</a> &#8212; that is, an evolutionary biologist for the living organism of language &#8212; Thomas adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We need a better word than chance, even pure chance, or that succession of events, while still evading any notion of progress. But to go all the way from a clone of archaebacteria, in just 3.7 billion years, to the B-Minor Mass and the Late Quartets, deserves a better technical term for the record than randomness.</p>\n<p>I like the word <em>stochastic</em> better, because of its lineage in our language. The first root was <em>stegh</em>, meaning a pointed stake in the Indo-European of 30,000 years ago. <em>Stegh</em> moved into Greek as <em>stokhos</em>, meaning a target for archers, and then later on, in our language, targets being what they are and aiming arrows being as fallible as it is, <em>stokhos</em> was adapted to signify aiming and missing, pure chance, randomness, and thus stochastic. On that philosophical basis, then, I&#8217;m glad to accept all of evolution in a swoop, but I&#8217;m still puzzled by it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With great subtlety and sensitivity, Thomas then pirouettes to observe that this stochastic miracle of life across time exists <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/10/alan-lightman-death/\">only because death too exists</a>. A generation before Richard Dawkins made his poetic point about <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/07/25/richard-dawkins-death/\">the luckiness of death</a> and an epoch after the grief-stricken Darwin, having <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/02/12/annie-darwin/\">lost his most beloved child</a>, found personal solace in the scientific fact that the death of the individual is what fine-tunes evolution to ensure the survival of the species &#8212; &#8220;there is grandeur in this view of life,&#8221; Darwin wrote &#8212; Thomas dismantles the central logical fallacy beneath our species&#8217; fantasies of immortality, be they retro-religious or techno-futuristic. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75660\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/jacobs-dream-by-william-blake-1805_print?sku=s6-22921179p4a1v1?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/williamblake_jacobsdream_small.jpg?resize=680%2C865&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"865\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75660\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/williamblake_jacobsdream_small.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/williamblake_jacobsdream_small.jpg?resize=320%2C407&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/williamblake_jacobsdream_small.jpg?resize=600%2C764&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/williamblake_jacobsdream_small.jpg?resize=240%2C305&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/williamblake_jacobsdream_small.jpg?resize=768%2C977&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Jacob&#8217;s Dream</em> by William Blake, 1805.

We, and our brains, are working parts of the machinery, having made our appearance here and having our existence because of the operation of those laws, set in place on what we like to see as the pinnacle by the beneficent operation of chance and quantum mechanics. Pure luck, indeterminate and intentionless, all the way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But this, of course, is Lewis Thomas. And this, therefore, is not a case for vacuous materialism. This is Lewis Thomas, who often makes the deepest point by caricaturing its shallow opposite: </p>\n<blockquote><p>This view takes us a long distance toward understanding our place in nature, but not quite the full distance. We are still stuck with the problem of consciousness, and because of this <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/12/13/stephon-alexander-fear-of-a-black-universe/\">not-quite-settled matter</a>, we are stuck as well with the incessant questions with which our consciousness continues to plague us and disturb our sleep (for which also, by the way, we do not have a good explanation). Questions like: Are we the only creatures on the whole planet with real consciousness? Why is being being; why not nonbeing? Why should there be something, instead of nothing? How do you organize a life, or a society, in accordance with physical laws that forbid purpose, causality, morality, and progress, especially when you have to do so with brains that stand alive with these very notions?

I am a member of a fragile species, still new to the earth, the youngest creatures of any scale, here only a few moments as evolutionary time is measured, a juvenile species, a child of a species. We are only tentatively set in place, error-prone, at risk of fumbling, in real danger at the moment of leaving behind only a thin layer of our fossils, radioactive at that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a passage of extraordinary prescience, precisely in the context of our present ecological precariousness and what its only solution might be, Thomas adds as he considers our place in the family of life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are different, to be sure, but not so much because of our brains as because of our discomfiture, mostly with each other. All the other parts of the earth&#8217;s life seem to get along, to fit in with each other, to accommodate, even to concede when the stakes are high. They live off each other, devour each other, scramble for ecological niches, but always within set limits, with something like restraint. It is a rough world, by some of our standards, but not the winner-take-all game that it seemed to us awhile back. If we look over our shoulders as far as we can see, all the way past trillions of other species to those fossil stromatolites built by enormous communities of collaborating microorganisms, we can see no evidence of meanness or vandalism in nature. It is, on balance, an equable, generally amiable place, good-natured as we say.</p>\n<p>We are the anomalies for the moment, the self-conscious children at the edge of the crowd, unsure of our place, tending to grabbiness&#8230; But we are not as bad a lot as some of us say&#8230; At our worst, we may be going through the early stages of a species&#8217; adolescence, and everyone remembers what that is like. Growing up is hard times for an individual but sustained torment for a whole species, especially as brainy and nervous as ours. If we can last it out, get through the phase&#8230;. we might find ourselves off and running again.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75738\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-virginia-frances-sterrett-from-old-french-fairy-tales-1920_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=680%2C883&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Art by Virginia Frances Sterrett, Old French Fairy Tales, 1920\" width=\"680\" height=\"883\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75738\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=320%2C416&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=600%2C780&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=240%2C312&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=768%2C998&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/oldfrenchfairytales_sterrett2.jpg?resize=1182%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Century-old art by the adolescent <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/01/27/virginia-frances-sterrett-old-french-fairy-tales/\">Virginia Frances Sterrett</a>.

There were plants, but their reproduction was a tenuous game of chance &#8212; they released their pollen into the wind, into the water, against the staggering improbability that it might reach another member of their species. No algorithm, no swipe &#8212; just chance. </p>\n<p>But then, in the Cretaceous period, flowers appeared and carpeted the world with astonishing rapidity &#8212; because, in some poetic sense, they invented love. </p>\n<p>Once there were flowers, there were fruit &#8212; that transcendent alchemy of sunlight into sugar. Once there were fruit, plants could enlist the help of animals in a kind of trade: sweetness for a lift to a mate. Animals savored the sugars in fruit, converted them into energy and proteins, and a new world of warm-blooded mammals came alive. </p>\n<p>Without flowers, there would be no us. </p>\n<p>No poetry.</p>\n<p>No science. </p>\n<p>No music.</p>\n<p>Darwin could not comprehend how flowers could emerge so suddenly and take over so completely.

Hong Kong will immediately cease to be a name and become the center of your life. And you may never know how many people live in Hong Kong. But you will know that one man or one woman lives there without whom you cannot live. And this is how our lives are changed, and this is how we are redeemed. </p>\n<p>What a journey this life is! Dependent, entirely, on things unseen. If your lover lives in Hong Kong and cannot get to Chicago, it will be necessary for you to go to Hong Kong. Perhaps you will spend your life there, and never see Chicago again. And you will, I assure you, as long as space and time divide you from anyone you love, discover a great deal about shipping routes, airlines, earth quake, famine, disease, and war. And you will always know what time it is in Hong Kong, for you love someone who lives there.

Maybe there’s a good reason we find their fleetingness so piercing, can scarcely look at a flower in bloom without thinking ahead, whether in hope or regret. We might share with certain insects a tropism inclining us toward flowers, but presumably insects can look at a blossom without entertaining thoughts of the past and future &#8212; complicated human thoughts that may once have been anything but idle. Flowers have always had important things to teach us about time.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75847\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-animated-episode-1/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=680%2C381&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"381\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75847\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=320%2C179&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=600%2C336&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=240%2C134&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/emilydickinson_herbarium.jpg?resize=768%2C430&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Specimens from the teenage Emily Dickinson&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-animated-episode-1/\">herbarium</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Time, of course, is itself a creature of paradoxes &#8212; at once the relentless forward momentum of our mortality and <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/08/28/alan-lightman-einsteins-dreams/\">the greatest antidote to the anxiety of aliveness</a>. “When you realize you are mortal you also realize the tremendousness of the future,&#8221; wrote the poet, painter, and philosopher Etel Adnan in her <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/02/06/etel-adnan-journey-to-mount-tamalpais/\">gorgeous meditation on impermanence and transcendence</a>. &#8220;You fall in love with a Time you will never perceive.” </p>\n<p>It may be, Pollan intimates, that flowers betoken precisely this elemental duality and through it cast their enchantment upon us. After contouring <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/04/universe-in-verse-animated-episode-1/\">their astonishing evolutionary history</a> &#8212; so astonishing that the baffled Darwin called it &#8220;an abominable mystery&#8221; &#8212; he writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Look into a flower, and what do you see? Into the very heart of nature’s double nature &#8212; that is, the contending energies of creation and dissolution, the spiring toward complex form and the tidal pull away from it. Apollo and Dionysus were names the Greeks gave to these two faces of nature, and nowhere in nature is their contest as plain or as poignant as it is in the beauty of a flower and its rapid passing. There, the achievement of order against all odds and its blithe abandonment. There, the perfection of art and the blind flux of nature. There, somehow, both transcendence <em>and</em> necessity. Could that be it &#8212; right there, in a flower &#8212; the meaning of life?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meaning, of course, is just what we make of life &#8212; what we make of our mortality <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2020/02/21/brian-greene-until-the-end-of-time/\">as an inevitability of the universe that made us</a>. “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important,” the fox says to the Little Price. &#8220;All the stars are a-bloom with flowers,&#8221; the Little Prince says to the pilot before he returns to that fathomless region of spacetime from which he had visited.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_76021\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/thelittleprince_flowers.jpg?resize=680%2C549&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"549\" class=\"size-full wp-image-76021\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/thelittleprince_flowers.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/thelittleprince_flowers.jpg?resize=320%2C258&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/thelittleprince_flowers.jpg?resize=600%2C485&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/thelittleprince_flowers.jpg?resize=240%2C194&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/thelittleprince_flowers.jpg?resize=768%2C620&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/02/03/exupery-little-prince-morgan-drawings/\"><em>The Little Prince</em></a>, 1943.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Complement with Rachel Carson on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/07/rachel-carson-the-edge-of-the-sea/\">the ocean as a lens on the meaning of life</a> and Rebecca Solnit on <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/09/rebecca-solnit-trees/\">trees and the shape of time</a> &#8212; for any fragment of nature contemplated closely and sensitively enough becomes a lens on human nature and our search for meaning, as Rockwell Kent so keenly felt amid the wild Alaskan solitude, observing that nature is <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/15/rockwell-kent-wilderness/\">&#8220;a kind of living mirror that gives back as its own all and only all that the imagination&#8230; brings to it.&#8221;</a> </p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing <em>The Marginalian</em> (which <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/10/22/brain-pickings-becoming-the-marginalian/\">bore the unbearable name <em>Brain Pickings</em></a> for its first fifteen years).

Two centuries after his death, psychology &#8212; a science not even a glimmer on the horizon of humanity&#8217;s imagination in Beethoven&#8217;s lifetime &#8212; confirmed this intuitive practice, demonstrating that incubation precedes illumination in <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/08/28/the-art-of-thought-graham-wallas-stages/\">the five stages of the creative process</a>. </p>\n<p>Beethoven lived before the Age of Celebrity, before this awful contortion of art that bamboozled us into confusing visibility with merit and grandiosity with genius. Amid such confusion, that inner incubus of creativity &#8212; invisible to the outside world, impervious to public appraisal &#8212; is all the more vital, for it is also what enables artists to create rather than cater, to go on making works of truth and beauty answering only to their inner voice and accountable only to their own artistic integrity, rather than producing sellable commodities that fit snugly into some existing market of tastes and expectations. </p>\n<p>That countercultural creative integrity and its relation to private incubation is what <strong>John Lennon</strong> (October 9, 1940&#8211;December 8, 1980) channels in his conversation with Jonathan Cott, included in the altogether shimmering collection <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Listening-Interviews-1970-1989-Jonathan-Cott/dp/1517909015/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Listening: Interviews, 1970&#8211;1989</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/listening-interviews-1970-1989/oclc/1107060820?referer=br&#038;ht=edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/johnlennon.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Cott found himself charmed by the way Lennon &#8220;wrote little reminders to himself in the wonderfully absorbed way that a child paints the sun,&#8221; touched by the way this grown man, thrust into a public life and all the cynicism it can catalyze in a person, retained the fundamental childlike sweetness that is always our deepest connection to life &#8212; our own, and the lives of others that compose the shared symphony of aliveness. Cott observes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Acerbic and skeptical as he could be, John Lennon never lost his sense of compassion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is this opinionated, openhearted man of forty that Cott met one December evening in 1980 in Lennon&#8217;s ground-floor apartment at the Dakota &#8212; the iconic twentieth-century castle in Manhattan, in front of which he would be slain by the gruesome antipode of compassion three days later. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/doublefantasy.jpg?resize=680%2C533&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-75957\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/doublefantasy.jpg?w=1520&#38;ssl=1 1520w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/doublefantasy.jpg?resize=320%2C251&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/doublefantasy.jpg?resize=600%2C471&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/doublefantasy.jpg?resize=240%2C188&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/doublefantasy.jpg?resize=768%2C602&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/doublefantasy.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\nWhat occasioned Cott&#8217;s interview was the release of Lennon&#8217;s collaboration with Yoko Ono, <em>Double Fantasy</em> &#8212; the first record of his in what appeared to the outside world as a five-year creative lull, but was in fact the sort of vital, invisible incubation period out of which so many great works of art are born, the type that artist Rockwell Kent celebrated in the solitary Alaskan wilderness as one of those times in life <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/15/rockwell-kent-wilderness/\">&#8220;when nothing happens &#8212; but in quietness the soul expands.&#8221;</a> Lennon tells Cott:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The illusion that I was cut off from society is a joke. I was just the same as any of the rest of you, I was working from nine to five &#8212; baking bread and changing some nappies and dealing with the baby.

The king paid you twenty thousand bucks for this shit, and you knock it off in five minutes?&#8221; And the painter replies, &#8220;Yeah, but I spent ten years thinking about it.&#8221; And there&#8217;s no way I could have written the <em>Double Fantasy</em> without those five years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clad in a torn Jagger T-shirt he had gotten during the Rolling Stones&#8217; 1970 tour, Lennon reflects on a review of his song &#8220;From Me to You&#8221; that dismissed it as &#8220;below par Beatles,&#8221; and considers the odd petty satisfaction critics &#8212; be they paid or self-appointed &#8212; get from chipping at an artist&#8217;s general excellence by magnifying and lambasting small defects in particular works:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mick&#8217;s put out consistently good work for twenty years, and will they give him a break? Will they ever say, &#8220;Look at him, he&#8217;s Number One, he&#8217;s only thirty-six and he&#8217;s put out a beautiful song, &#8216;Emotional Rescue.'&#8221;&#8230; And God help Bruce Springsteen when they decide he&#8217;s no longer God&#8230; Right now his fans are happy. He&#8217;s told them about being drunk and chasing girls and cars and everything and that&#8217;s about the level they enjoy. But when he gets down to facing his own success and growing older and having to produce it again and again, they&#8217;ll turn on him, and I hope he survives it. All he has to do is look at me or Mick. So it goes up and down, up and down &#8212; of course it does, but what are we, machines?&#8230; When they first criticized &#8220;From Me to You&#8221; as below par Beatles, that&#8217;s when I first realized you&#8217;ve got to keep it up, there&#8217;s some sort of system where you get on the wheel and you&#8217;ve got to keep going around.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Artistic excellence &#8212; as every artist has realized, and some have <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/02/27/harriet-hosmer-figuring/\">enacted and articulated with uncommon clarity</a> &#8212; lies not in running oneself into the ground on this clattering hamster wheel of public approval, but in continually and quietly ascending one&#8217;s own private ladder of creative development.

The notion of a galaxy &#8212; a gravitationally bound swirl of stars and interstellar gas, dust and dark matter &#8212; did not exist as such. The Milky Way &#8212; a name coined by Chaucer &#8212; was commonly considered an <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/02/16/thomas-wright-original-theory/\">&#8220;island universe&#8221;</a> of stars, beyond the edge of which lay cold dark nothingness. </p>\n<p>When Hubble looked at the photograph the next morning and compared it to previous ones, he (I like to imagine) furrowed his brow, then with a gasp of revelation he (this we know for a fact) crossed out the marking N on the plate, scribbled the letters V A R beneath it, and could not help adding an exclamation point. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_75888\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EdwinHubble_Andromeda_VAR.jpg?resize=680%2C844&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"844\" class=\"size-full wp-image-75888\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EdwinHubble_Andromeda_VAR.jpg?w=967&#38;ssl=1 967w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EdwinHubble_Andromeda_VAR.jpg?resize=320%2C397&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EdwinHubble_Andromeda_VAR.jpg?resize=600%2C745&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EdwinHubble_Andromeda_VAR.jpg?resize=240%2C298&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/EdwinHubble_Andromeda_VAR.jpg?resize=768%2C953&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Edwin Hubble&#8217;s 1923 glass plate of Andromeda.

My father spent whole seasons<br />\nBowing before the oracle-eye, hungry for what it would find.<br />\nHis face lit up whenever anyone asked, and his arms would rise</p>\n<p>As if he were weightless, perfectly at ease in the never-ending<br />\nNight of space. On the ground, we tied postcards to balloons<br />\nFor peace. Prince Charles married Lady Di. Rock Hudson died.</p>\n<p>We learned new words for things. The decade changed.</p>\n<p>The first few pictures came back blurred, and I felt ashamed<br />\nFor all the cheerful engineers, my father and his tribe. The second time,<br />\nThe optics jibed. We saw to the edge of all there is &#8212; </p>\n<p>So brutal and alive it seemed to comprehend us back.</p></blockquote>\n<h5>THE MAKING</h5>\n<p>Every poet is a miniaturist of meaning, building cathedrals of beauty and truth with the smallest particles of language. It is with a poet&#8217;s mindset that Brazilian graphic artist and animation director <a href=\"https://danielbruson.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daniel Bruson</a> approached his contribution to <em>The Universe in Verse</em>. (Special thanks to <em>On Being</em> creative director Erin Colasacco for bringing Daniel into the project and for working with him and with composer <a href=\"https://www.floatingfast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gautam Srikishan</a> on making this symphonic cinepoem come alive.)</p>\n<p>After I relayed to Daniel why I had chosen this particular poem (which Tracy <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/05/12/tracy-k-smith-life-on-mars/\">read at the inaugural <em>Universe in Verse</em></a> in 2017) to illustrate the larger story of our search for cosmic truth &#8212; a search both made possible and made imperfect by our humanity &#8212; he grasped the nested layers of meaning with uncommon sensitivity, mirroring back his interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Hubble tries to see or make sense of the Universe, the father tries to understand the Hubble, the daughter tries to make sense of the father, the decade, the world, and the poet tries to put this whole into perspective. All these efforts have to face problems of scale or distortion: something too big or small, too close or too distant, too dark or too familiar. Not to mention the original problem with the Hubble mirror.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This cascade of distortion sparked the idea &#8220;to use optics as a metaphor, to seek for these imperfect, unresolved and elusive, but also suggestive and alive images.&#8221; </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\"

She overturned the handbook and overwrote the curriculum, creating the country&#8217;s most ambitious science syllabus, soon copied by other universities &#8212; including the all-male Harvard, which had long dropped its higher mathematics requirement past the freshman year. </p>\n<p>Maria Mitchell&#8217;s students went on to become the world&#8217;s first class with academic training in what we now call astrophysics. They happened to all be women. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_59515\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mitchell-Letters-Journals-Classic-Reprint/dp/1451018460/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=680%2C413&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"413\" class=\"size-full wp-image-59515\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?w=1145&#38;ssl=1 1145w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=240%2C146&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=320%2C194&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=768%2C466&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=600%2C364&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maria Mitchell, standing at telescope, with her students at Vassar</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Science was one of Maria Mitchell&#8217;s two great passions.

After visiting six majestic eucalyptus trees with a friend &#8212; living local legends, with deep roots in global history &#8212; she reflects:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s an Etruscan word, <em>saeculum</em>, that describes the span of time lived by the oldest person present, sometimes calculated to be about a hundred years. In a looser sense, the word means the expanse of time during which something is in living memory. Every event has its saeculum, and then its sunset when the last person who fought in the Spanish Civil War or the last person who saw the last passenger pigeon is gone. To us, trees seemed to offer another kind of saeculum, a longer time scale and deeper continuity, giving shelter from our ephemerality the way that a tree might offer literal shelter under its boughs.</p></blockquote>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/08/06/trees-at-night-art-young/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight1.jpg?resize=680%2C1074&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1074\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-68437\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight1.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight1.jpg?resize=240%2C379&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight1.jpg?resize=320%2C505&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight1.jpg?resize=768%2C1213&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/artyoung_treesatnight1.jpg?resize=600%2C948&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/08/06/trees-at-night-art-young/\"><em>Trees at Night</em></a> by Art Young, 1926.

They had outlived the wooden mansion in which some of the dramas of her life had played out. They were so broad they had buckled the sidewalk, and they reached up higher than most of the buildings around them. Their peeling gray and tan bark spiraled around their trunks, their sickle-shaped leaves lay scattered on the sidewalk, and the wind murmured in their crowns. The trees made the past seem within reach in a way nothing else could: here were living things that had been planted and tended by a living being who was gone, but the trees that had been alive in her lifetime were in ours and might be after we were gone.
