Mark Villar, Transportation Sec. Arthur Tugade, and Muntinlupa Mayor Jaime Fresnedi led in opening the facility in Pacwood Site, Barangay Tunasan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 144-bed quarantine facility was constructed by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) in partnership with the Muntinlupa City government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We love Muntinlupa. I’m a proud Muntinlupeño,” said Tugade at the ceremony.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fresnedi thanked Villar and the DPWH for the construction of an additional COVID-19 facility in the city to augment the city’s efforts to curb the virus.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DPWH and Muntinlupa converted shipping containers as isolation pods for positive COVID-19 patients, suspect and probable cases, and as quarters of medical frontliners who will serve in the facility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each room has a comfort room, air-conditioning unit, bed supplies, and a WiFi facility will also be installed. Residents who will occupy the isolation rooms will receive a COVID-19 essentials bag containing a hygiene kit, vitamins, medicine, thermometer, bedsheet, pillow, blanket, and towels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Muntinlupa’s own molecular laboratory for COVID-19 testing at the Ospital ng Muntinlupa (OsMun) in Alabang will be completed in the coming days.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OsMun director Dr. Edwin Dimatatac said the construction of the laboratory and delivery of medical equipment are expected to be finished by next week. The laboratory is located at the Saklolo at Gabay ng Ina at Pamilya (SAGIP) building at the back of the hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The laboratory aims to operate two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines which can process 500 to 900 samples a day. COVID-19 test results may be released as early as within 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deputy Chief Implementer against COVID-19 Sec. Vince Dizon earlier promised to donate one PCR machine to the molecular laboratory once the accreditation is approved by the Department of Health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Muntinlupa City government has also partnered with&#160;<a href=\"http://staysafe.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">staysafe.ph</a>&#160;in strengthening its contact tracing efforts. As a pilot project, a QR code system is being implemented in the city hall to keep record of visitors’ and employees’ activity.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of October 12, Muntinlupa has 4,476 confirmed cases including 4,125 patients who have recovered and 148 deaths, leaving 203 active cases.</p>\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 06:34:40 +0000","feedId":40733,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3053ac9bc31e1beb233d2acc9c5cc545","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jonathan Hicap ","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602571095388}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:38:15","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 14:38:15","feedId":40733,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 06:38:15 +0000","fetchMs":99296,"handleMs":20,"totalMs":99658,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":18,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"135b586132fb35cbb1669fe09384b6b7","hostName":"us-020*","requestId":"d8028a015764412191f2d58461a6bad0_40733","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:21:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:38:15","id":40733,"name":"Manila Bulletin","url":"http://www.mb.com.ph/feed","subscriber":79,"website":null,"icon":"https://mb.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-favicon-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn37@2020_6/2020/09/06/21-38-10-269_60475973a9413ae7.png","description":"The Nation's Leading Newspaper","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602570995731,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":99637,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":20,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
