We’re not just cherry-picking obscure titles, though, as these are movies that we find beautiful in their own, often unique ways. You might even say we think they’re sublime… and this week a recent hit from India livens up our hearts with War.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Sublime /səˈblīm/: of such excellence, grandeur, or beauty as to inspire great admiration or awe”</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>There are great action movies from all around the globe, and they come in even more varieties than there are official languages in India. Did that sound like a casual, seemingly tangential reference to India? Surprise&#8230; it was planned from the very beginning of this post. And now you&#8217;re riding a high because you didn&#8217;t see it coming, you&#8217;re not entirely convinced that makes a difference, and you love it all the same? Well get used to it, because this week&#8217;s Prime sublime find is an absolute modern classic of highly entertaining action, surprising story twists, utter nonsense, and glorious musical numbers. This week&#8217;s pick is 2019&#8217;s Indian action epic, <strong><em>War</em></strong>.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s War about?</h2>\n<p>A routine assassination by India&#8217;s top army intelligence agent, Kabir (<strong>Hrithik Roshan</strong>), goes sideways when the impeccably coiffed soldier kills one of their own high-ranking analysts instead. It seems Kabir has gone rogue, and with the order from on high to exterminate him, the army brings in their next best man. Khalid (<strong>Tiger Shroff</strong>) looked up to Kabir and saw the man as his mentor, and that closeness makes him the only one capable of bringing the traitor down. Of course, not every thing is as clear-cut as it might seem.</p>\n<h2>What makes War sublime?</h2>\n<p>Oh boy. Director/co-writer <strong>Siddharth Anand</strong> continues his shift away from romantic comedies with his second action film, <em>War</em>, and the result is something truly special. At over two and a half hours, a fairly standard running time for Indian cinema, the film delivers a deceptively simple setup before contorting every which way with its story and characters. Terrifically entertaining action set-pieces share the screen with impromptu &#8220;music video&#8221; breaks, an in-character intermission complete with a PSA about the importance of failure, mildly homoerotic teases, constantly shifting loyalties, flashbacks within flashbacks, a clear appreciation for the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> and <em>Fast &#38; Furious</em> films, gorgeous visuals, and more. Oh boy, indeed.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll start with the action. War comes locked and loaded with fight scenes, gun battles, and bigger set-pieces aboard cars, motorcycles, planes, and more. Both Kabir and Khalid take part in their fair share of brawls, both as enemies and partners thanks to the film&#8217;s copious flashbacks to happier days, and the two men are athletic enough to convince with their various moves and hits. Shroff, in particular, is almost balletic in his kicks and flips, but both men still take advantage of stunt doubles and digital trickery. The CG face-mapping during the motorcycle chase is notably poor &#8212; but rather than hurt the film it adds to the overall experience as the filmmakers keep it all entertaining as hell with a mash-up of playfulness and serious sincerity.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358214\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/war.jpg\" alt=\"War\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/war.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/war-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/war-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/war-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Khalid&#8217;s introduction is a single take action set-piece (with evident cuts) that sees him take down a room full of baddies while destroying every breakable object within reach. Later action sees them mowing down terrorists with a car-mounted Gatling gun, taking off on foot chases through the cobblestone streets of Marrakesh, skydiving between planes, engaging in an epic chase through Portugal in cars, on motorcycles, and on foot, and even trading paint with sports cars across the ice of the Arctic circle. Sure, the effects occasionally stumble, but the absolute fun remains at a high throughout. A sequence set in and around a military plane in the sky may not be as convincing as a similar one in an <em>M:I</em> film, but it&#8217;s every bit as entertaining.</p>\n<p>Anand crafts <em>War</em> with an eye for beauty and style wrapped in an only slightly cheeky seriousness, and the soundtrack keeps pace with catchy musical numbers and an energetically rousing score. Every moment&#8217;s a matter of life and death, except when it&#8217;s time for knowing smiles, romance, bromance, and music videos. We get a few dance breaks that care not where the film is plot-wise &#8212; we discover Kabir is a double agent, and soon we&#8217;re watching wide-eyed as he and Khalid share the dance floor for an extravagant blend of choreography, song, and color. Deep into the action we suddenly cut to a romantic summer fling of a video featuring Kabir wooing his woman beneath the Australian sun with song, dance, and smiles a plenty.</p>\n<p>Roshan and Shroff are both terrific leads, and it&#8217;s easy to see why both are big stars in India. Shroff is actually starring in Anand&#8217;s next film about an angry veteran forced into violence called&#8230; <em>Rambo</em>, and he&#8217;s fun to watch as his dance skills overtake every fight giving him a grace and athleticism most non-Asian action stars lack. Roshan may be slightly less agile &#8212; the CG mapping on his face for what looks like a standard jump kick is weird &#8212; but he&#8217;s every bit the impressive physical specimen. These guys are jacked, but that doesn&#8217;t stop Roshan in particular from being as charming and charismatic as any Western movie star. He&#8217;s arguably even more so as the man has two thumbs on his right hand. That&#8217;s three total, and if you think any Hollywood actor, let alone a star, would have kept that throughout his career rather than having it surgically removed, well, you&#8217;re wrong.</p>\n<p>While played (mostly) serious, the script is as entertaining as the action itself. Spy shenanigans involving double crosses, triple crosses, face swaps, and a steady stream of character absurdity keep the film from even suggesting a dull moment. There are so many sequences here, both action and otherwise, that deserve praise &#8212; the motorcycle chase would make John Woo proud in its thrills and ridiculousness &#8212; but they need to be discovered with your own eyes, ears, and fun-loving organs.</p>\n<h2>And in conclusion&#8230;</h2>\n<p><em>War</em> is an absolute blast from beginning to end. I could go on breaking down the numerous scenes and beats, but please, seek out its wonders for yourself. Yes it&#8217;s subtitled and 154-minutes long, but it is a goddamn gift for the senses. Sticklers for realism need not apply, but if you enjoy cinematic fun this is a must-see. Trust me. Please. For the love of all that you hold holy. Watch <em>War</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-prime-sublime/\">Want more sublime Prime finds?

Our lives may no longer be scheduled around small screen programming, but that doesn’t mean we should forget the necessary sanctuary of Saturday ‘toons. In this entry, we wade into the agony violently expressed within Genndy Tartakovsky’s Primal.</em></p> \n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" /> \n<p>Live life to its fullest. You never know if today will be your last. These are ideas bandied about whenever a tragedy strikes, and a life is taken suddenly. The shock from afar reminds us to take stock in those that surround us today.</p> \n<p>We try not to wallow on the sorrow the affected party must be experiencing. It’s awful. It’s unimaginable. The loss of a loved one poisons the heart of the one left behind, and if unattended, a greater darkness can grow.</p> \n<p>The safe response is to fill their fridge with baked goods and pat their shoulder as you wish them well on your way out their door. “They’ll get through this,” you tell yourself. “It takes time.”</p> \n<p><strong>Genndy Tartakovsky</strong>’s <strong><em>Primal</em></strong>, an impossible story of a caveman and his <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> partner, is dedicated to the notion that all we have is each other. Time is meaningless if we’re left to dangle by others who could act and elect not to do so. Spear and Fang share the bond of heartbreak, and their relationship fairies them across an ocean of despair.</p> \n<p>Both of them brutally lost their families to a universe apathetic toward their desires. With their spouses and children consumed into the bellies of red-horned beasts, the two hunters march to a destination they will never meet. They move because to stop would be to remember.</p> \n<p>Spear and Fang trick each other into surviving another day when a friendly fishing rivalry transforms into companionship.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>Primal</em> looks, sounds, and feels unlike any other series out there. While the character designs and the general 2D animation style is reminiscent of other Tartakovsky creations (<em>Samurai Jack</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>: <em>The Clone Wars</em>), <em>Primal</em> behaves like the rage of loss personified. The action erupts in blood and gore, and when the dialogue is not untranslatable, it’s exclusively screaming.</p> \n<p>To call the show “Hard R” is to undersell the experience. Each of <em>Primal</em>’s twenty-minute episodes operates with the subtlety of a chainsaw guided by a blood-thirsty Jackson Pollock. These bouts with demonic bats, gluttonous spiders, and drug-fuelled ape-men deliver on the promise never accomplished by the contents within the trashiest of ’80s VHS boxes.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, since <em>Primal</em>’s savagery is propelled by the unbearable pain of two childless parents, it never qualifies as wantonly perverse or gratuitous. If anything, the violence of <em>Primal</em> feels simplistically understandable.</p> \n<p>The relatability of Spear and Fang’s situation is further solidified as a result of their impenetrable language barrier. We cannot translate Spear’s guttural grunts or screams, or Fang’s cacophonous roars, but we get the gist. There is no Rosetta Stone for their language, but their agony, frustration, exhaustion, and excitement play on their face at a Kindergarten’s reading level.</p> \n<p>To put it bluntly, Genndy Tartakovsky’s<em> Primal</em> is cinema in its purest form. Stripped of discernable dialogue, the audience is forced to engage deeper on a visual level. Spear and Fang are Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton performing their physicality as loud as possible to penetrate the silence experienced on the other side of the screen. Forced to connect in this fashion, the emotions cut more profoundly with transference occurring swiftly between character and consumer.</p> \n<p>The first half of the first season of <em>Primal</em> aired last year (<a href=\"https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/genndy-tartakovsky-primal-finale-season-2-samurai-jack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a result of Adult Swim not wanting to wait</a> for production to finish before unleashing this bloody beast upon the world), and the final five episodes kicked off last Sunday with “Scent of Prey.” When we last saw our heroes, Fang appeared on the brink of death, having suffered a mortal wound at the hands of the ape-men. Spear, still dazed from partaking in the simian death cult’s Incredible Hulk elixir, knelt at his friend’s side and considered solitude and despair once more.</p> \n<p>The cliffhanger left its audience aching. The series proved cruel, dragging its heroes from emotional oblivion to an action-packed buddy-cop dynamic, only to leave them beaten, drained, and raw. Their fate felt senseless, but also in line with their family’s conclusion. The universe cared not for the kiddies, so why should it care for these rage-fueled brutes?</p> \n<p>“Scent of Prey” picks up seconds after the last episode. In the moment Spear accepts his friend’s death, Fang gasps for life. There is a chance.</p> \n<p>Spear gets to work tending to Fang’s wounds, clogging his gashes with mud, hand-feeding the big dinosaur what little water he can find. When vultures and other eaters of the dead begin to circle, Spear concocts a makeshift stretcher to carry Fang far from danger. When we’re talking <em>Primal</em>, though, danger always follows.</p> \n<p>Tartakovsky knows when to slow <em>Primal</em> down, and many of the season’s best no holds barred cage matches occur after long stretches designed to define character or environment. “Scent of Prey” is no different.</p> \n<p>The first half of the episode methodically tracks the progression of Fang’s health as Spear defends his nearly lifeless body from the hungry folk of the woods. Spear gives everything of himself while defending his friend. His muscles are stretched to their limits hauling the gargantuan <em>T-Rex</em>. His flesh is torn by the spikey green beetles that would make Fang’s meat their home. His patience is tested by the relentless herd of hyenas that stalk Spear’s every step.</p> \n<p>Every action is one born out of love. Fang gave Spear his life back. He owes the dino all he has.</p> \n<p>As “Scent of Prey” nears its end, Fang awakens in a cave. The entrance is barricaded with rocks. On the other side, he can hear Spear fighting an armada of hyenas. The caveman is prepared to trade his existence for that of the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>. Fang will have none of that.</p> \n<p>The dinosaur explodes from the rocks and dives teeth first into the hyenas. Spear is gobsmacked. His ol’ pal is back, and he’s turning dogs into dog food.</p> \n<p>Spear explodes into a victorious roar, and the audience is on their feet as well. Watching the two friends mutilate their way to safety is about as exhilarating a release of emotion as one can have watching television.</p> \n<p>These two titans have already gone through the wringer. What more can Tartakovsky throw at them? A zombie plague? Tune in next week.</p> \n<p>Genndy Tartakovsky’s<em> Primal</em> conveys grief by topping one extreme after another. <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/04/05/demolition-jake-gyllenhaal/82593118/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Loss is not Jake Gyllenhaal sledgehammering his house</a>. It’s a caveman converting two spikey-backed beetles into brass knuckles and wailing down upon the screams of red-eyed hyenas.</p> \n<p>After watching the first half of <em>Primal</em>’s first season, you’ll never again offer a pat on the shoulder or a warm pumpkin pie to a grieving friend. You’ll either keep your distance, or you’ll get down in the muck with them.</p> \n<p>All we have is each other. Alone we’re nothing. We all need a <em>T-Rex</em> by our side.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/PvZnfXmJ3vE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 11:16:15 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9028ffe944ebc8e23e910456a6f2bb58","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brad Gullickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/PvZnfXmJ3vE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn98@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-33-011_0f3370b8a74797ac.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522251253},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:11","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:11","title":"‘Spontaneous’ Finds Love in Dangerous Times","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358168","description":"\n<p>Something unexplainable is happening at Covington High School: the graduating class is exploding. Not with anxiety or hormones, but the literal kind of exploding, where they blow up like a balloon and pop blood-red carnage all over the classmates unlucky enough to be in the blast radius. The seniors are worried less about starting the next chapter of their lives, and more about surviving the one they are currently in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Duffield</strong>’s <em><strong>Spontaneous</strong> </em>gives us a taste of what one of those explosions looks like at the very top of the film. As Maya (<strong>Katherine Langford</strong>) tries to keep her eyes open during homeroom, Katelyn (<strong>Mellany Barros</strong>), the girl sitting in front of her, suddenly combusts. No screams, no warning signs, just a teenager with her whole life ahead of her is here one minute and, in the blink of an eye, gone in the next. Her life snuffed out by a senseless act of random violence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the students stare wide-eyed at the spot that Katelyn once occupied, their shock transforms into screams that drive them out of the classroom and into the parking lot. We see huddles of teens checking-in with each other, calling their parents, and making sure their bestie isn&#8217;t the one who died. It’s a scene that should feel familiar because it’s the same one we saw in the parking lots of Columbine or Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the immediate aftermath of their tragic school shootings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, this is what <em>Spontaneous</em> is about: teens trying to process and move forward after being hapless bystanders to a violent tragedy. What Duffield smartly does is distance us from the realities and politics of mass shootings and centers his film on something so outrageous that we can’t help but find it fun, even though it&#8217;s alluding to a gravely serious subject. In 2020, it may feel too soon to center a high school teen romance on the shared trauma of a school shooting, but Duffield engages with all of the themes we would expect to explore with such a story, just through the gonzo conceit of teens that explode like watermelons at a Gallagher show. That the film can strike such a delicate balance between being both a romantic horror-comedy for the YA crowd and a brutally honest look at the trauma so many teenagers know all too well in contemporary high school – without losing a shred of its humor and heart – is a testament to just how truly unique this film is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Spontaneous</em>’s warmth comes out of its love story between the wryly witty Maya, who would rather take shrooms than think about the girl who blew up in front of her, and Dylan (<strong>Charlie Plummer</strong>), who uses this reminder of his own mortality to gather his courage and ask out Maya, whom he’s been crushing on since moving to their small town. The chemistry between the duo is cutesy but relatable and surely will make the target teenage audience’s heart yearn for their own unrequited high school romances. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A large part of this relatability comes from Duffield’s script, which is based on <strong>Aaron Starmer</strong>’s YA novel of the same name. Best known for the Satanic Panic horror-comedy <em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-babysitter-review-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Babysitter</a></em> as well as the deep-sea monster mash <em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/underwater-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Underwater</a></em>, Duffield has clearly taken inspiration from John Hughes&#8217; and Diablo Cody’s version of teenage banter, but rather than using stylized dialogue to make his characters feel wise beyond their years, he injects it with honest realism so you can actually picture these words coming out of a teenager&#8217;s mouth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Langford and Plummer may have a Manic Pixie Dream Character quality to them, but it doesn’t feel forced or gimmicky. We may feel ourselves cringe as we watch the two lovebirds share lightning-fast quips back and forth, trying to one-up each other with movie quotes and their own self-confident charm, but it’s only because Duffield’s dialogue reminds us of all the things we did in high school that we thought terribly clever. Maya and Dylan have all the joy that comes with the reckless abandon of young love, only magnified ten-fold as their romance blossoms amidst a cloud of chaos and death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The central relationship is the heart of the film, but <em>Spontaneous</em> is at its best when drawing astute allusions between Duffield&#8217;s mysterious explosions and real-world tragedies. Having been produced in the immediate years following the Parkland shooting, it’s clear the intent of the film is to be a commentary on the trauma and anxiety survivors of mass school shootings must face. It’s tragic to watch Maya, Dylan, and the rest of their class have to grow up so fast. They should be concerned about what they’ll wear to prom, and what colleges they want to get into, but as more bodies are eviscerated in front of their eyes, the teens grow increasingly more hopeless that they’ll be alive long enough to even go to college. &#8220;We&#8217;re never going to be old,&#8221; Maya tells her best friend Tess (<strong>Hayley Law</strong>). &#8220;But we&#8217;re already really, <em>really</em> old.&#8221; she replies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, the way the United States has processed the never-ending stream of stories about school shootings is mirrored in the way Maya, Dylan, and Tess cope with the explosions. At first, we are shocked and horrified, trying to make sense of the senseless, but after more and more teenagers are shot in schools – or in Covington High&#8217;s case, inexplicably blown up – we, unfortunately, find ourselves growing numb to the tragedies, especially once it becomes clear nothing is being done to stop them from occurring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Midway through the film, <em>Spontaneous</em> takes a turn into more timely territory that can only be described as unintentional. Doctors and the federal government believe that the Covington High teenagers are exploding because of some virus, or a disease, so they unceremoniously scoop all the teens up and place them in quarantine. They are cut off from their families, monitored around the clock, and given cocktails of experimental drugs all in hopes of finding a cure. The correlations between this and the COVID-19 pandemic couldn’t be plainer, but as the YA novel was written in 2016, and the film shot in 2018, the creators couldn’t have predicted that we’d have such a nuanced understanding of what these characters are going through. Before the pandemic, we could have empathized with Maya, Dylan, and the rest of their classmates&#8217; anxiety over being forced into quarantine, but we have a whole different level of perception now that we’ve been in similar situations for so long ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the depressing place <em>Spontaneous</em> goes, Duffield leaves us with a message that we should all remember as we remain stuck in a dangerous time. We can’t allow ourselves to get lost in a sea of hopelessness, believing that nothing will ever get better now that everything’s changed. Things may never go back to the way that they were before, but our lives will move on, and we’ll likely come out of it stronger than we were before. We just need to take this moment as a reminder to live each day to the absolute fullest. Hug your family, laugh with our friends, and remember to cherish every day you have. You never know when it might be your last.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Spontaneous is available now on VOD. </em></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/MEgioOH1FXQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 01:16:07 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d042754b8dac21cede15166c747630bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jacob Trussell","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/MEgioOH1FXQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn62@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-33-038_3c7890901ecd8d02.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522251254},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:11","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:11","title":"10 Most Eye Poppin’ Moments of Eyeball Horror","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=357573","description":"<p><em>October is defined in Webster’s Dictionary as “31 days of horror.” Don’t bother looking it up; it’s true. Most people take that to mean highlighting one horror movie a day, but here at FSR, we’ve taken that up a spooky notch or nine by celebrating each day with a top ten list. This article looking at the best and most egregious scenes of eyeball horror is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<p>This will be remembered as the year everyone got to know the unusual sensation of having a cue-tip rammed up your nose. It’s nothing to – ahem – sneeze at, for sure, but it doesn’t hold a candle to having something get in your eye, an image horror movies <em>love </em>to indulge in.</p>\n<p>Even when it is as relatively harmless as sand, watching something violent happen to a character&#8217;s eye in a film makes our bodies cringe in a uniquely somatic way. We’ve all got something in our eyes at one point, but our knee-jerk squeamishness to abject eyeball horror is triggered by our deeply ingrained ommetaphobia, the fear of anything involving eyes.</p>\n<p>Why do our bodies react so viscerally to seeing someone get their eyes poked out? You can blame that cold sweat on mirror neurons. These neurons help our minds develop as children, but it’s also what makes us wince when we see anything that looks remotely painful.</p>\n<p>Think of it like this: when you carve a pumpkin, mirror neurons fire off, but they also fire when you see someone else carve a pumpkin. This means that when we observe an action, we are able to understand, to a degree, the physical sensation of the action.</p>\n<p>If you apply that concept to watching a big ol’ splinter pierce into someone’s eyeball, we respond as if it’s actually happening to us.

First of all: congratulations; you have good friends. Second: brace yourself for the best goddamn cold open in horror history. Am I exaggerating? Shut up. A good cold open kicks the door down and says: &#8220;THIS IS WHAT SIGHTS I HAVE IN STORE FOR YOU.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Did someone say sights? Well, well, well. How convenient, because <em>Re-Animator</em>’s big door kick happens to be all about sight. Or rather, the fact that Herr Doctor Hans Gruber (yep) isn’t going to be seeing much of anything thanks to the pulsating flesh sacks where his eyes should be.</p>\n<p>Did I mention they pop horribly as the doctor frantically grasps his steadily exploding face? Because they do. Guess the dosage on Herbert West’s re-agent needs some finagling. Then again, West didn’t kill him, he gave him life! Queue the kick drum. (Meg Shields)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>9. Demonia (1990)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358327\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Demonia1.jpg\" alt=\"Eyeball Horror Demonia\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Demonia1.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Demonia1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Demonia1-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Demonia1-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>To a cat, we’re all gigantic hairless cats. Why else do you think they nip and nibble at us like we’re one of their own, playfully chomping our ankles or pecking at our chins? Sometimes it’s playful, sometimes it’s lovingly, but <em>sometimes</em> a cat is just being a cat: which is to say a little bit of an asshole who won&#8217;t bat an eye at eating you if you ever die alone in your house.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for the cat lady (Carla Cassola) in <strong>Lucio Fulci</strong>’s tale of demon nuns, <em>Demonia</em>, she didn’t die before her herd of mini-carnivores decided to devour her face whole. Part of the fun of Fulci&#8217;s optical horror moments is watching the less-than-believable special effects work; quickly cutting from the actor&#8217;s face to what’s clearly a rubber cast primed to be destroyed, or noticing the hand of a puppeteer scratching the camera with a stuffed cat&#8217;s faux-paw.</p>\n<p>As wave on wave of fake kittens is hurled at the cat lady, they use their phony little paws to claw at the rubber mask until her eye is pulled completely out of the socket in a glorious moment of eyeball horror excess. It’s wholly unrealistic, but it doesn’t really matter. This is so ludicrous that it transcends realism into unadulterated mondo art. (Jacob Trussell)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>8. Event Horizon (1997)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-358326\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EventHorizon.jpg\" alt=\"Eyeball Horror Eventhorizon\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EventHorizon.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EventHorizon-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EventHorizon-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EventHorizon-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Where we’re going, we won’t need eyes to see. In this audacious sci-fi schlock-fest, eyes are found to be unnecessary when it comes to staring into the void and embracing all that the violent, trippy hellscape of space has to offer.</p>\n<p>Seven years after the titular ship vanished into the vastness of the universe, it begins to send out a distress signal, and a group of astronauts is sent to investigate. One of the astronauts is William Weir (Sam Neill), designer of the <em>Event Horizon</em> and a man eager to uncover the secrets of its journey.</p>\n<p>As Weir&#8217;s own sanity unravels, so too does his need for vision, leading him to gouge his own eyes out. The film loses points for this happening off-screen, but it gets those points back for the terrifying and daring way that shit hits the fan following said gouging. Final score: 10/10, or, rather, 20/20.

There’s an inherent squeamishness that comes with eye-related horror because nobody likes to think about the fact that one’s vision could be lost in a squishy, disgusting instant.</p>\n<p>That being said, let’s get this over with before I throw up. There’s a part during the climax of <em>28 Days Later</em> when Cillian Murphy’s character shoves his fingers through a guy’s eyes. This sequence of eyeball horror is extra awful because we don’t see it right away, just hear the shrill screams of agony, and when we finally get the money shot, he’s full-on knuckles-deep in this dude’s peepers.</p>\n<p>In a movie that’s filled to the brim with fast-zombie carnage, this moment of human-on-human violence is a horrifying standout. Anyway, if you need me, I’ll be in the corner wearing safety goggles. (Valerie Ettenhofer)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>6. Final Destination 5 (2011)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357703\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FD5.jpg\" alt=\"Eyeball horror Fd5\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FD5.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FD5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FD5-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FD5-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>A lot of the ocular trauma moments on this list would never happen. Undead arms aren’t bursting through walls ready to pop your peepers out of their sockets, and hordes of cats aren’t sharpening their claws set to scratch you blind. But the same can’t be said for this moment in <em>Final Destination 5</em>.</p>\n<p>People regularly have eye surgery, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that you too could one day find yourself with your head clamped in place as Kubrickian lid locks keep your eyes open. The Grim Reaper maybe isn’t hunting you down, but having all of that medical equipment up in your grill would make anyone’s blood run cold.</p>\n<p>As a laser run amok begins burning and tearing into Olivia’s (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) cornea, we have a sick fascination that forces us to not look away. There&#8217;s no other explanation for the top comment on a YouTube clip of this scene to be, “I am doing Lasik in five hours. Why am I here..?”</p>\n<p>Indulging in fears can make us overcome our own phobias, but sometimes it’s like scratching an itch you know you shouldn’t: we just can’t help ourselves, no matter how much it hurts to watch.

In this installment, she highlights The Old Dark House.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>For many horror movies, appreciation doesn&#8217;t come until years after its release. <em><strong>The Old Dark House</strong> </em>is a great example of this journey that horror movies take to finally reach the right audience. Despite being among the legendary early Universal horror movies of the 1930s, it didn&#8217;t remain one of the must-see releases of the era like <em>Dracula</em>, <em>Frankenstein</em>, and <em>The Mummy</em>. This odd thriller was buried in the filmographies of director <strong>James Whale</strong> and lead actor <strong>Boris Karloff</strong> after they had both moved on from their classic monsters. Thankfully, <em>The Old Dark House </em>was unearthed from Universal&#8217;s vault decades later. Now, we can enjoy the atmospheric, off-beat horror of this pre-Code look at a haunted house.</p>\n<p>Adapted from the J.B. Priestly novel <em>Benighted</em>, <em>The Old Dark House </em>finds married couple Philip (<strong>Raymond Massey</strong>) and Margaret (<strong>Gloria Stuart</strong>) and their bachelor friend Roger (<strong>Melvyn Douglas</strong>) stuck driving in a horrendous storm. The rain pours into their bumping jalopy, and they barely miss a landslide that prevents them from turning back. Luckily, they come upon a house with a light on inside. Once past the boorish butler, Morgan (Karloff), the troupe realizes that the Femm family has some dark secrets hiding in the house. <span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">Their safe haven is really filled with a dysfunctional and violent family that could keep them and another pair of travelers from making it to daylight.  </span></p>\n<p>Where most haunted house stories use ghosts and evil spirits to frighten strangers, <em>The Old Dark House</em>&#8216;s scares come from those still alive in the house. Siblings Rebecca and Horace Femm are weird, even hostile hosts to their guests. They take them to scary parts of the house and traumatize them worse than any intangible ghost could. In one of the most memorable scenes, Rebecca brings Margaret to an empty bedroom so that she can change out of her wet clothes. As Margaret changes into a totally out-of-place cocktail gown, Rebecca chastises her for embracing her beauty and ultimately her sexuality, just like Rebecca&#8217;s dead sister did years ago. She implies that her sister&#8217;s sinful ways were the cause of her death and Margaret is soon to follow. The beauty she holds dear will soon fade and so will Margaret herself.</p>\n<p>The camera shows Rebecca through distorted broken mirrors, giving her an evil and haggish look as she berates Margaret. When Rebecca leaves the room, Margaret stares at her own distorted reflection in the mirror and is horrified at what she sees. Margaret has visions of Rebecca laughing at her in the broken mirrors and Morgan&#8217;s predatory gaze. Even if just for a scene, Rebecca has driven Margaret to her level of madness. She doesn&#8217;t do this by convincing Margaret that her sister&#8217;s ghost will haunt her. She brings a more existential terror to Margaret by having her fear the end to everything Rebecca didn&#8217;t have in life: beauty, sex, and love. The result is a more long-lasting trauma than any ghost could incite.</p>\n<p>Both Rebecca and Horace warn their guests that their &#8220;dumb&#8221; butler is one to be feared. Morgan is oftentimes a docile barbarian for the family to take advantage of. When he drinks, though, he wreaks havoc on their family and ravages anything in sight. He even tends to drunkenly let out an even more dangerous member of the family. Coincidentally, he is drinking tonight.</p>\n<p>In gruesome makeup, Karloff groans and slowly embarks on his victims in this role, as he does as his other monsters. The underlying humanity in Karloff&#8217;s creatures from <em>Frankenstein</em> or <em>The Mummy</em> is not as pronounced in Morgan. The family makes it clear that he has no conscience to appeal to, which makes him an unreachable violent offender. Morgan resembles the indestructible slashers that came decades later in <em>Halloween </em>and the <em>Friday the 13th </em>sequels more than the other characters Karloff is remembered for. There is no evil science or supernatural reason for his preying on the strangers in the house. We are made to believe that he is just a violent human being because he wants to be, and there is no stopping him.</p>\n<p><em>The Old Dark House </em>has a plot set-up that has since become a horror staple. Travelers, usually young people, get lost and stumble upon a house they think will be their saving grace, but becomes their personal hell. Think of how <em>The </em><em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, </em>and <em>Wrong Turn </em>all use this kind of story to set up a violent killing spree. <em>The Old Dark House </em>doesn&#8217;t aim for that same violent conquest. It traumatizes its guests by way of torture that leaves them all living, but it&#8217;s interesting that this movie foreshadowed a kind of horror story that would become popular much later in history.</p>\n<p>Remarkably, the movies that in retrospect seem to be influenced by <em>The Old Dark House </em>actually came out before the movie had a significant place in horror history. Upon its initial release in 1932, <em>The Old Dark House </em>didn&#8217;t draw the crowd that Universal was expecting by pairing up Whale and Karloff just a year after their hit <em>Frankenstein</em>. It did very well in England, partly because most of the actors as well as the source material were English. However, audience numbers plummeted by the second week of its run in the United States. Some theaters pulled the movie from playing after just ten days, and it faded from view.</p>\n<p>Universal then buried the film in its archives while Whale and Karloff went on to make more popular movies, both together and apart, like <em>The Bride of Frankenstein</em>, <em>The Invisible Man, </em>and <em>The Black Cat</em>. The allure of the Universal horror films that were popular during the 1930s soon became out of style once World War II began and showed the world scarier monsters than any mummy or vampire. To make matters worse for <em>The Old Dark House</em>, Universal then lost the rights to the story in 1957, preventing the sort of rerelease that kept old movies in the minds of audiences as time passed.</p>\n<p>This also came just before the 1930s horror movies had a resurgence in the 1960s and 1970s. Karloff and Bela Lugosi, once thought to be washed up stars of the past, became a campy delight for young people. As other old horror movies were airing on television for a new generation of horror fans, <em>The Old Dark House </em>stayed buried. That is until 1968 when Whale&#8217;s friend Curtis Harrington begged Universal to give him a copy of the original negative. It was in very poor condition and still could not air on television. For a long time, the only way to see <em>The Old Dark House </em>was to watch poor, often bootlegged prints of the film in late-night screenings. The George Eastman House film archive eventually duplicated and restored the negative, and it was finally broadcast on television in 1994.</p>\n<p>Since then, it has given us a funny, yet still chilling Universal film to explore. <em>The Old Dark House </em>is the kind of kitschy, creepy Old Hollywood movie that is a delight to watch with a modern eye. That eye may have more of a knack at sensing gay undertones in the characters than did 1930s audiences, which brings a whole new meaning to this film today. <em>The Old Dark House </em>holds its own against the other Universal classics in terror and provides a self-awareness that the classics lack.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/OJaUdM1y6Zo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 11:16:29 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"72ad250f5f6ab286661b8d3d785e4745","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Emily Kubincanek","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/OJaUdM1y6Zo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn64@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-04-33-032_ca74534253f27868.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522251249},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:11","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:11","title":"Re-Imagining ‘The Thing’ as a Big-Band Musical","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=358023","description":"\n<p id=\"block-04637504-093d-4be3-a121-b1015ed34453\"><br><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web.

Its failure to launch was a combination of several factors, but chiefly: folks just weren&#8217;t in the mood. A despondent chiller punctuated with reputable excess didn&#8217;t sit right. Audiences wanted something more uplifting, and <em>The Thing </em>had the misfortune of debuting on the same month as <em>E.T.</em> <em>the Extra-Terrestrial</em>. So, Carpenter&#8217;s shape-shifting infection from another world did the box office equivalent of a pratfall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, most of Carpenter&#8217;s career has big &#8220;your kids are gonna love it&#8221; energy. Cable re-runs may have eviscerated all of <strong>Dean Cundey</strong>&#8216;s beautiful split diopters, but small screen showings effectively ensured <em>The Thing</em>&#8216;s survival and inevitable cult following. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And adoration, not unlike the titular Thing, takes many shapes, from sold-out Mondo board games to adoring compilations of <strong>Kurt Russell</strong> cackling like a maniac throughout the film&#8217;s<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-36-things-we-learned-from-john-carpenters-the-thing-commentary-track-a73f470d969/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> commentary track</a>. But every good cult-movie lover knows one expression of love tops the rest: turning a film into a musical. And if you&#8217;re thinking the upbeat medium of song and dance is at odds with <em>The Thing</em>&#8216;s vibe, think again. The audiences of 1982 were right about <em>The Thing</em>&#8216;s hopeless, apocalyptic gait. But they lacked the imagination, let&#8217;s say, to see the (bloody, depraved) joy at the heart of it all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, without further ado: here&#8217;s <em>The Thing </em>re-imagined as a big-band musical number. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-b5ac606c-b74a-4cab-a663-701ec85c7024\">Watch “<strong>John Carpenter&#8217;s <em>The Thing</em>:<em> </em>The Musical</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"John Carpenter&#039;s THE THING: THE MUSICAL\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8faq5amdK30?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-da44f2c0-01e5-442d-b111-649cfba1b5a9\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-97ab8436-7bdb-4e43-8f3e-4e4c57043b5e\">According to <strong>Legolambs</strong>, they&#8217;re the world&#8217;s number one source for internet musicals of both classic and modern cinema.

Encounters of the Spooky Kind (1980)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-357844 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Encounters-of-the-Spooky-Kind-1980-2.jpg\" alt=\"Kung Fu Horror Encounters Of The Spooky Kind\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Encounters-of-the-Spooky-Kind-1980-2.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Encounters-of-the-Spooky-Kind-1980-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Encounters-of-the-Spooky-Kind-1980-2-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Encounters-of-the-Spooky-Kind-1980-2-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Jiangshi movies make up one of the strangest and most entertaining subgenres of horror cinema. These films are inspired by ancient Chinese mythology that pertains to hopping vampires, which is a fascinating element in and of itself. However, what makes the movies really special is their genre-mashing goofiness, combining horror, slapstick comedy, and martial arts to entertaining effect. <em>Encounters of the Spooky Kind</em> sits alongside the <em>Mr. Vampire</em> series as the pinnacle of Jiangshi fare. In the movie, Sammo Hung plays a poor sap who encounters the hopping creatures after his wife and boss hire an evil wizard to curse him. But he’s a kung fu master, and he uses his skills to overcome the supernatural threats. The fight choreography is outstanding and also allows Hung to showcase his prowess for physical comedy.

Silent Rage (1982)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357845\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Silent-Rage-Chuck-Norris.jpg\" alt=\"Silent Rage Chuck Norris\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Silent-Rage-Chuck-Norris.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Silent-Rage-Chuck-Norris-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Silent-Rage-Chuck-Norris-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Silent-Rage-Chuck-Norris-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>We get it. <strong>Chuck Norris</strong> isn&#8217;t &#8220;cool&#8221; anymore. Happily, plenty of his earlier movies still are, and that includes his first foray into the horror genre: <em>Silent Rage </em>(his second and last, 1994&#8217;s <em>Hellbound</em>, is not worth discussing). Norris plays a small-town sheriff known for shutting down bad guys with a series of roundhouse kicks, but a genetically modified killer impervious to pain and capable of healing his wounds decides it&#8217;s time to vote this sheriff out of office. Permanently. Ron Silver plays the mad scientist, Brian Libby plays the mute killer, and Stephen Furst is also in it for some reason.</p>\n<p>Norris&#8217; martial arts are great fun. He&#8217;s doing spin kicks in jeans, people! It&#8217;s a creepily entertaining slasher that builds to an entertaining one-on-one fight scene with punches, chops, kicks, chokeholds, flips, throws, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW1PoAi3Khc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">slow-motion to die for</a>. And if all that&#8217;s not enough? How about the fact that Norris&#8217; character is named Dan Stevens, and a few months after the film&#8217;s release in 1982, a newborn boy was not-so-coincidentally named Daniel Jonathan Stevens, and that boy grew up to be&#8230; well, he kept the name, so he grew up to be Dan Stevens, director of <em>The Guest</em>. Anyway, <em>Silent Rage</em> is pretty damn cool. (Rob Hunter)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>8. Rigor Mortis (2013)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357846\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rigor-Mortis-2013.jpg\" alt=\"Rigor Mortis\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rigor-Mortis-2013.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rigor-Mortis-2013-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rigor-Mortis-2013-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rigor-Mortis-2013-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Juno Mak</strong>’s moody movie isn’t clear-cut horror or simply a kung fu movie, but it’s a visually arresting film that pays tribute to the classic jiangshi saga <em>Mr. Vampire</em> and other greats of the subgenre. Actor Chin Siu-ho of the original film franchise plays a depressed version of himself who moves into an apartment building that turns out to be filled with ghostly neighbors. An endlessly intriguing, strange, and bleak movie, <em>Rigor Mortis</em> pulls off some seriously freaky visuals. Former <em>Mr. Vampire</em> actors and jiangshi film stars Anthony Chan, Billy Lau, Richard Ng, and Chung Fat round out the cast. (Valerie Ettenhofer)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>7. A Chinese Ghost Story (1987)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-357847 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/A-Chinese-Ghost-Story-1987.jpg\" alt=\"Kung Fu Horror A Chinese Ghost Story\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/A-Chinese-Ghost-Story-1987.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/A-Chinese-Ghost-Story-1987-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/A-Chinese-Ghost-Story-1987-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/A-Chinese-Ghost-Story-1987-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Ching Siu-Tung</strong>’s <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> is unlike any movie you’ve ever experienced. It follows the naive scholar and debt collector Ling Choi-San (Leslie Cheung), who, by happenstance, falls in love with Lip Siu-Sin (Joey Wong), the ghost of a magistrates daughter bound to an afterlife of servitude to a Tree Demoness (Lau Siu-Ming) and forced into an arranged marriage with a giant mountain monster. When she tries to escape after falling for Ling Choi-San, the Demoness drags her to the underworld, forcing her lover and a Taoist monk to bring her back and put her soul to rest.</p>\n<p>This film is brimming with ingenuity and imagination, pulling together classic 17th-century Chinese ghost stories with <em>Evil Dead</em> inspired cinematography, hyper stylistic lighting, and stop motion monsters straight out of Ray Harryhausen. Hell, the Taoist monk even has his own musical number, which is as charming as it is out of the fucking blue. The kung fu scenes are more of the <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em> variety, with actors bounding between trees while zooming through the air, but it’s really the images in <em>A Chinese Ghost Story</em> that make it such a must-watch. You’ll never be able to unsee thousands of disembodied heads bursting out of a monster&#8217;s chest or a tongue that splits into a fleshy beak that reveals a face filled with tendrils, but I don’t think that’ll be a problem for you horror fans. (Jacob Trussell)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>6. Versus (2000)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-357848\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Versus-2000.jpg\" alt=\"Versus\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Versus-2000.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Versus-2000-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Versus-2000-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Versus-2000-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Versus</em> is a simple flick. A gang of yakuza wants the mysterious Prisoner KSC2-303 dead. They&#8217;ve trapped him in the Forest of Resurrection. No one is leaving until the job is done. Enter: zombies. Director <strong>Ryuhei Kitamura</strong> is a damn madman, and he makes movies that feel like they shouldn&#8217;t be around other movies. His flicks deserve their own shelf, and probably their own list for that matter. <em>Versus</em> sets up a bunch of rules early on but quickly dismisses them when necessary. The most important element of the film is its energy. As long as it&#8217;s moving and the characters are wailing and clashing against each other, everything else doesn&#8217;t matter. You sweat when you watch <em>Versus</em>. It&#8217;s mayhem, and it&#8217;s a workout.

This article, about the best horror remakes, is part of our ongoing series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/31-days-of-horror-lists/\"><strong>31 Days of Horror Lists</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Remakes and reboots have been part of cinema for <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/hollywood-remake-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">as long as the medium has existed</a>. Filmmakers have always loved to tell new versions of the same stories. And yet, few things frighten film fans more than remakes. This is especially true for horror fans &#8212; whenever new remakes are announced, you can hear a collective groan ripple through the horror community.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a bizarre phenomenon, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s not like a remake replaces the film that came before it. One of your beloved movies is getting remade? Guess what, your movie is still there. Worst case scenario, the remake is bad and quickly forgotten. But the best case? The remake is awesome, and now you have two great versions of the same movie to love.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t say for certain that horror remakes occur more often than remakes in other genres, but they feel more frequent. And their success rate is similar to any other film in the genre. Some work and some don&#8217;t. Most end up somewhere in between. Since we&#8217;re here to <em>celebrate</em> horror remakes, though, you can just push aside those middling films and those that are terrible.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve put together a collection of remakes that you can enjoy and use to win arguments with your annoying friends who tell you remakes are <em>never</em> any good. A quick note: this is a remake list, not a list of new adaptations of stories, novels, etc. So no, you won&#8217;t see John Carpenter&#8217;s <strong><em>The Thing</em></strong> or David Cronenberg&#8217;s <strong><em>The Fly </em></strong>anywhere below.</p>\n<p>Keep reading for a look at the best horror remakes as voted on by <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/swanson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anna Swanson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/brad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brad Gullickson</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/meg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meg Shields</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/trussell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jacob Trussell</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/fisher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kieran Fisher</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rob Hunter</a>, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a>, and myself.

My Bloody Valentine (2009)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358193 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/My-Bloody-Valentine.jpg\" alt=\"My Bloody Valentine\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/My-Bloody-Valentine.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/My-Bloody-Valentine-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/My-Bloody-Valentine-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/My-Bloody-Valentine-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>The 3D gimmick has never been my thing, but now and then it works. And in 2009, it worked for <strong>Patrick Lussier</strong> and his remake of 1981&#8217;s <em>My Bloody Valentine</em>. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) returns to the small mining town he grew up in after the death of his father. His return coincides with the tenth anniversary of a Valentine&#8217;s Day massacre, from which Tom barely escaped. Much to his surprise, Tom is now viewed as a suspect.</p>\n<p>Lussier shifts things a bit from the original, particularly with the killer, turning this one into more of a murder mystery. The kills are plentiful, with the 3D element used to celebrate the film&#8217;s gory carnage, throwing it straight out of the screen and right into our slasher-loving faces. And then there&#8217;s Tom Atkins. You always win with Tom Atkins. (Chris Coffel)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">9. The Hills Have Eyes (2006)</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-358192 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Hills-Have-Eyes.jpg\" alt=\"The Hills Have Eyes\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Hills-Have-Eyes.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Hills-Have-Eyes-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Hills-Have-Eyes-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/The-Hills-Have-Eyes-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>The best remakes improve on the film that came before, and in that regard, <em>The Hills Have Eyes</em> succeeds. Not to discount a single frame of <strong>Wes Craven</strong>’s classic 1977 shocker – it still shreds every nerve you’ve got four decades later – but by leaning fully into the nuclear-anxiety the original touches upon, <strong>Alexandre Aja</strong>’s remake has the metaphorical framework to build a blood-soaked story that (dare I say it) elevates it from being just another shocking rehash.</p>\n<p>As much as you want the widowed father to kill ‘em all, you also feel a modicum of pity for these mutants caught between their shitty lot in life and the machines of war that created them. With Aja’s white-knuckled hand on the wheel, <em>The Hills Have Eyes</em> is a sticky, sweaty onslaught that proved in 2006 the mid-aughtss remake train could be so much more than a blind money grab.

We&#8217;ve been burned too many times by remakes. The original <em>Fright Night</em> from 1985 is a gosh darn delight. Who would dare put their spin on it? Say hi, <strong>Craig Gillespie</strong>. Huh. The guy who directed <em>Lars and the Real Girl</em>? Yup. He would also go on to helm <em>I, Tonya</em>. That&#8217;s a little unexpected, and that&#8217;s exciting.</p>\n<p>Gillespie&#8217;s <em>Fright Night</em> achieves all the giddy bits of nostalgia that the original film was going for, but it does so with a different kind of bouncy glee. This <em>Fright Night</em> leans even further into the perpetual awkwardness that all teenagers face, and the courage we all must adapt to make our way out of high school and into adulthood. Ten minutes into this flick, and your arms will uncross and relax. The 2011 <em>Fright Night</em> is here to have a good time, and you will, too, if you allow it. And frankly, there are too few Anton Yelchin films in this world, and the heart he supplies in <em>Fright Night</em> is a pure blessing. (Brad Gullickson)</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"p5\">7.

On the surface, that sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, and yet it works brilliantly. Elijah Wood stars as Frank Zito, a disturbed young man with mommy issues searching for love.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Frank&#8217;s idea of love includes murdering his partners, scalping them, and attaching their scalps to mannequins. Khalfoun directs with style, Wood gives a chilling performance, and the POV perspective puts us in the killer&#8217;s shoes, giving us an intimate relationship with an onscreen killer rarely seen.

Then how do you explain the scenes in <strong>Jaume Collet-Serra</strong>’s <em>House of Wax</em> redux that’ll absolutely make your skin crawl? This is a gnarly take on the original that’s mostly remembered for its cast of mid-2000s TV heart-throbs, among them Chad Michael Murray, Paris Hilton, Jared Padalecki, and Elisha Cuthbert.</p>\n<p>Instead, it should be remembered for the squirm-inducing sequence where one character tries to help free another from his wax encasing and instead peels off the guy&#8217;s skin while he sits helplessly immobile. Or the scene where a character whose mouth is super-glued shut tries to wave for help through a grate and gets her fingertips clipped off. The film overall might be less-than-perfect, but <em>House of Wax</em> deserves a spot in the body horror hall of fame for its most creatively excruciating moments.

Today, we&#8217;re watching a video about the time Ridley Scott set fire to the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios while shooting Legend.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok, so <strong>Ridley Scott</strong> didn&#8217;t burn down <em>all </em>of <strong>Pinewood Studios</strong>. It&#8217;s not as bad as that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I won&#8217;t spoil the details because hearing Scott recount the story himself—in a tone that I think qualifies as &#8220;chaotically calm&#8221;—is a unique delight. Anything that starts with the phrase &#8220;the day the set burned down&#8230;&#8221; deserves to be experienced first hand. Suffice to say: it involves pigeons, polystyrene, and a lot of gas.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event in question took place on the forest set of <em><strong>Legend</strong></em>, which was built on Pinewood&#8217;s famously enormous 007 Stage. In Scott&#8217;s 1985 high-fantasy epic, the devil (<strong>Tim Curry</strong>) attempts to shroud the world in eternal darkness by killing the last unicorns. Our two leads, Jack (Tom Cruise) and Lili (Mia Sara), must thwart his plan to save their woodland paradise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like everything else in the film, <em>Legend</em>&#8216;s forest set is the definition of extravagant. Pollen wafts through the trees like a flock of birds, woodland animals abound, and the density of the underbrush underlines the film&#8217;s mythical overtones. All told: the forest is a textbook example of Scott doing what he does best: going big or going home.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there are risks to going <em>this hard </em>on set-design. Namely: fire hazards. The video clips below tell two stories of the film&#8217;s production. The first unpacks the technical wizardry of <strong>Rob Bottin</strong>&#8216;s special effects makeup for Curry. And the second concerns the&#8230; fiery&#8230; event in question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-b5ac606c-b74a-4cab-a663-701ec85c7024\">Watch the special feature chapters &#8220;<strong>Shadows of Darkness</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>A Dark Day</strong>&#8221; (cut to 00:08:35 for the story about Pinewood):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Ridley Scott &#38; Tim Curry commentary from LEGEND\" width=\"700\" height=\"525\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GOpAv57ln4A?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-da44f2c0-01e5-442d-b111-649cfba1b5a9\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the proud owner of a VHS tape of <em>Legend</em>, I cannot confirm which edition of the film these special features originate from. That said, gun to my head, I’d put money on this being from 2002’s “Ultimate” edition, which was full of documentaries, interviews, and other extra features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-97ab8436-7bdb-4e43-8f3e-4e4c57043b5e\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.85714rem; font-weight: 900;\">More Videos Like This</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul id=\"block-bdc19c38-9c94-4b2d-8f76-f0bc617cf692\"><li>First, via Queue favorite <strong>Eyes on Cinema</strong>, here’s Scott, <strong>H.R.

He aims to achieve the same with his 2020 follow-up, <em><strong>French Exit</strong></em>, but while the absurd class satire is funny at times, it never goes far enough with the ridiculousness that&#8217;s promised and instead leans on its lesser qualities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adapted by <strong>Patrick DeWitt</strong> from his own best-selling novel, <em>French Exit</em> follows New York socialite Frances Price (<strong>Michelle Pfeiffer</strong>), her childish adult son, Malcolm (<strong>Lucas Hedges</strong>), and their extraordinary cat, Small Frank, as they rush off to Paris upon learning they&#8217;re broke. Twenty years earlier, Frances&#8217; husband, Frank (<strong>Tracy Letts</strong>), died and left the family a fortune, but Frances paid no mind to that money&#8217;s end.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite finding out she has lost her wealth, Frances still spares no expense on her travels to her friend&#8217;s empty apartment awaiting them overseas. She and Malcolm embark on a luxury cruise ship, and as they float through a series of outlandish events, mother and son must come to terms with a past that has led to their unfulfilling and directionless lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>French Exit</em> begins with a flashback showing Frances’ first real attempt at a relationship with an adolescent Malcolm. It’s an effort that’s twelve years too late, but as she abruptly pulls him out of boarding school, he doesn’t question her sudden decision to be a proper mother. She speaks to him like he’s an adult and asks about his experience in school like he’s old enough to have an eloquent opinion on it. He gives a shrug of an answer, and she ushers him out the door into his new life under his mother’s wing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frances exhibits the same boldness decades later, in the present, even as she is being told she has finally run out of their inheritance. She had been warned this would happen, but she’s not the type of woman who acts sensibly. “My plan was to die before the money ran out, but I kept &#8212; and keep &#8212; not dying,” she laments when she is told to sell all her things and find a new way to live. It’s clear she has no plans of changing her opulent ways and is willing to die rather than do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malcolm, meanwhile, is just as unsure of his own wants and needs as he was when he was twelve, even within his engagement to the lovely Susan (<strong>Imogen Poots</strong>). He delays telling his mother about their relationship and their plans to be married. Frances beats him to the punch with her own revelation that they are going to live in Paris, and Malcolm completely forgets he had news of his own. He never questions whether or not he needs to join his mother; he just idly goes along with her. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The voyage to Paris offers mildly entertaining scenes in which Frances and Malcolm show just how out of touch they are with the reality of the situation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They encounter odd characters, including a clairvoyant (<strong>Danielle Macdonald</strong>) who is apprehended for predicting an old woman’s death (which obviously makes her appear complicit) and an uncaring coroner dealing with all of the bodies of the old folks who die on the cruise ship (his scene plays particularly uncomfortably due to the imagery of the COVOD-19 pandemic losses). At times, the coming together of such variant personalities makes for some good laughs, but the awkward and quirky vibe that these scenes try to achieve only delays the most interesting aspect of the film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>French Exit</em> is best when it embraces its surreal side and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pushes the story outside of the realm of a regular drama, rather than commenting on the lives of its upper-class characters. Most notably, Small Frank is eventually revealed to be a telepathic cat (also voiced by Letts) housing the reincarnated spirit of the late Frank Price. Unfortunately, the film holds back on this bizarre development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film&#8217;s other asset is Pfeiffer&#8217;s captivating performance. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She delivers Frances&#8217; unfiltered thoughts in the sort of unbothered tone needed for the character to be funny. And there are even moments when the actress hints at a bit of humanity left in Frances, even if the woman within the story does not recognize it herself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a flashback to the day on which she found her husband, Frances talks about how she couldn&#8217;t face his death at that moment. She felt hopeless and ran away from it, making it appear to police that she was complicit in his death. This is the only moment in <em>French Exit</em> when Frances shows any concern for her emotions. Even though she is uncaring and detached most of the film, Pfeiffer’s performance makes her seem almost redeemable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comparatively, Malcolm, who is there to give to her every whim, despite there never being a good explanation for why he is so hopelessly devoted to her, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">becomes a dull addition to every scene that he’s in, even with Hedges behind the role. The weird characters the two meet on the journey to Paris are also never given the opportunity to truly make a difference in the plot since they cannot get in the way of Frances’ spot at center stage. Pfeiffer&#8217;s work is impressive, but the sacrifices that the film makes to enable that performance inhibit our appreciation of her role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is because, in order to provide Pfeiffer such a prestigious starring role, the filmmakers allow Frances to continually upstage everyone else she shares a scene with, her unwavering pride never challenged until the very end. The character is allowed to be a brash and commanding force, which Pfeiffer embodies very well. Without anything in the way of that, though, it’s hard to find the point of her story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest problem I have with <em>French Exist</em>, however, is that seeing how bereft wealthy people are of consequences just doesn&#8217;t feel all that funny right now, in 2020. We see this played out every day in the news. Maybe </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there are other people who can connect with a nihilistic view of society at the moment, though. After all, there can be some value in being able to laugh at those who have power. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does feel like this film could be more enjoyable in another social climate, and that isn&#8217;t its fault. Yet, to laugh at how these rich, callous characters treat the people around them, and how they get away with it, feels like a surrendering of your own conscience. That is something that I can’t see myself able to do at any time in history.</span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/JB7x06b0UOo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"
