It was produced by <a href=\"http://www.accurat.it/\">Accurat</a>, a design agency in Milan and New York that does amazing work.</p>\n<p>Later I discovered Figure 1 was translated into English and discussed in <a href=\"http://piim.newschool.edu/journal/issues/2012/04/pdfs/ParsonsJournalForInformationMapping_Lupi_Giorgia.pdf\">Parson’s Journal for Information Mapping.</a> There I learned that the circles represent the distance you can travel underground from the center of cities using their subway systems. Overlapping symbols show that you can get from one city to the other underground. I can’t think of a better way to show distances from the center of a city than with a circle.</p>\n<p>The visualization then provides lots of other information by which each city’s subway system could be compared. Pictograms show the number of passengers, the stroke width of the circles shows the cost of a one-way ticket, and the little colored squares show the colors of the lines.</p>\n<p>There is more than one takeaway from this story. First, our first impressions are not always correct. Second, exceptions exist for many graphical principles. There are examples where circles are an excellent choice to show the data we want to display.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 15 Jan 2013 14:44:18 +0000","feedId":46447,"bgimg":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/03_european_subterranean_veins-281x300.png","linkMd5":"6258e2ca91df7335a1f79152d734f41d","author":"Naomi Robbins","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/01/03_european_subterranean_veins-281x300.png":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603046314278}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 02:38:34","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 02:38:34","feedId":46447,"fetchDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 18:38:34 +0000","fetchMs":53,"handleMs":15,"totalMs":243173,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"08cc7d7b1ce844c0994701dd817046a1","hostName":"us-51*","requestId":"188ac0f2be4e46a8922cfbfcac789b9e_46447","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:41:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:04:20","id":46447,"name":"Effective Graphs","url":"http://blogs.forbes.com/naomirobbins/feed/","subscriber":69,"website":null,"icon":"https://blogs.forbes.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn61@2020_4/2020/09/06/21-59-59-205_df10b0c8fbc25b62.ico","description":"[Please go to 'Settings' to change your Tagline]","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 02:42:37","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 02:42:37","id":null,"feedId":46447,"linkMd5":"6258e2ca91df7335a1f79152d734f41d"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603046314208,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":55,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":15,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":120316,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":120333,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
