You can sign up for the email <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/newsletters\">here</a>.</i></p>\n<p>It was an active week in the technology world broadly, with big news from Facebook and Twitter and Apple. But past the headline-grabbing noise, there was a steady drumbeat of bullish news for unicorns, or private companies worth $1 billion or more.</p>\n<h2>A bullish week for unicorns</h2>\n<p>The Exchange spent a good chunk of the week looking into different stories from unicorns, or companies that will soon fit the bill, and it’s surprising to see how much positive financial news there was on tap even past what we got to write about.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/databricks\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"databricks\">Databricks, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> for example, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/databricks-crossed-350m-run-rate-in-q3-up-from-200m-one-year-ago/%5C\">disclosed a grip of financial data to TechCrunch</a> ahead of regular publication, including the fact that it grew its annual run rate (not ARR) to $350 million by the end of Q3 2020, up from $200 million in Q2 2019. It’s essentially IPO ready, but is not hurrying to the public markets.</p>\n<p>Sticking to our theme, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/calm-com\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"calm-com\">Calm <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/news-that-calm-seeks-more-funding-at-a-higher-valuation-is-not-transcendental-thinking/\">wants more money</a> for a huge new valuation, perhaps as high as $2.2 billion <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/news-that-calm-seeks-more-funding-at-a-higher-valuation-is-not-transcendental-thinking/\">which is not a surprise</a>. That’s more good unicorn news. As was the report that “<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/razorpay-100-million-billion-valuation-unicorn/\">India’s Razorpay [became a] unicorn after its new $100 million funding round</a>” that came out this week.</p>\n<p>Razorpay is only one of <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/indian-startup-ecosystem-recovering-faster-4-new-unicorns-in-lockdown-report/articleshow/78655932.cms\">a number of Indian startups</a> that have become unicorns during COVID-19. (And here’s <a href=\"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/these-six-startups-turned-unicorns-amidst-the-pandemic-094708789.html\">another digest out this week</a> concerning a half-dozen startups that became unicorns “amidst the pandemic.”)</p>\n<p>There was enough good unicorn news lately that we’ve lost track of it all. Things like <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/story/2020-09-29/san-diegos-unicorn-startup-seismic-gets-additional-92m-raising-valuation-to-1-6b\">Seismic raising $92 million</a>, pushing its valuation up to $1.6 billion from a few weeks ago. How did that get lost in the mix?</p>\n<p>All this matters because while the IPO market has captured much attention in the last quarter or so, the unicorn world has not sat still. Indeed, it feels that unicorn VC activity is the highest we’ve seen since 2019.</p>\n<p>And, as we’ll see in just a moment, the grist for the unicorn mill is getting refilled as we speak. So, expect more of the same until something material breaks our current investing and exit pattern.</p>\n<h2>Market Notes</h2>\n<p>What do unicorns eat? Cash. And many, many VCs raised cash in the last seven days.</p>\n<p>A partial list follows. It could be that investors are looking to lock in new funds before the election and whatever chaos may ensue. So, in no particular order, here’s who is newly flush:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$450 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/openview-venture-partners-raises-450m-for-sixth-fund-its-largest-to-date/\">for OpenView</a>, $800 million <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-13/venture-investor-canaan-raises-800-million-for-new-fund\">for Canaan</a>, $840 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/true-ventures-has-840-million-more-to-invest-in-nascent-and-breakout-startups/\">for True Ventures</a>, $950 million <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/lead-edge-capital-just-closed-on-950-million-from-whopping-500-investors/\">for Lead Edge Capital</a></li>\n<li>Something called Benson Capital Partners has put together a $50 million fund. Gayle Benson, for whom the firm is named, owns several New Orleans sports teams, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherdodson/2020/10/15/gayle-bensons-leadership-in-gulf-coast-goes-far-beyond-new-orleans-saints-pelicans/#7ef7fb9c314c\">per Forbes</a>.</li>\n<li>Plus Venture Capital, built by two former 500 Startups Mena investors <a href=\"http://www.fundsglobalmena.com/news/new-vc-fund-targets-mena-startups\">according to fundsglobalMENA</a>, has raised $60 million.</li>\n<li>First Round is <a href=\"https://www.altassets.net/private-equity-news/by-pe-sector/venturegrowth/first-round-capital-launches-biggest-fundraise-yet-eyes-up-to-220m-for-fund-viii.html\">looking for $220 million</a>, former Google exec Kai-Fu Lee’s Sinovation Ventures is <a href=\"https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/sinovation-ventures-vc-fund-211387/\">looking for a billion</a>, while <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/khosla-ventures-seeks-1-1-billion-for-its-latest-fund/\">Khosla wants a bit more</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All that capital needs to go to work, which means lots more rounds for many, many startups. The Exchange also caught up with a somewhat new firm this week: Race Capital. Helmed by Alfred Chuang, formerly or BEA who is an angel investor now in charge of his own fund, the firm has $50 million to invest.</p>\n<p>Sticking to private investments into startups for the moment, quite a lot happened this week that we need to know more about. Like API-powered Argyle raising $20 million from Bain Capital Ventures <a href=\"https://finledger.com/2020/10/15/argyle-raises-20-million-to-be-the-plaid-for-employment-records/\">for what FinLedger calls</a> “unlocking and democratizing access to employment records.” TechCrunch is currently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/api-startups-are-so-hot-right-now/\">tracking the progress</a> of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/whats-driving-api-powered-startups-forward-in-2020/\">API-led startups</a>.</p>\n<p>On the fintech side of things, M1 Finance <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/\">raised $45 million</a> for its consumer fintech platform in a Series C, while another roboadvisor, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-13/robo-adviser-wealthsimple-gets-unicorn-status-with-tcv-backing?sref=gni836kR\">Wealthsimple, raised $87 million</a>, becoming a unicorn at the same time. And while we’re in the fintech bucket, Stripe <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/\">dropped $200 million this week for Nigerian startup Paystack</a>. We need to pay more attention to the African startup scene. On the smaller end of fintech, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/alpaca-raises-10m-series-a-for-its-api-powered-equities-trading-service/\">Alpaca raised $10 million more</a> to help other companies become Robinhood.</p>\n<p>A few other notes before we change tack. Kahoot <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/kahoot-picks-up-215m-from-softbank-for-its-user-generated-gamified-e-learning-platform/\">raised $215 million</a> due to a boom in remote education, another trend that is inescapable in 2020 as part of the larger edtech boom (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold/\">our own Natasha Mascarenhas has more</a>).</p>\n<p>Turning from the private market to the public, we have to touch on SPACs for just a moment. The Exchange got on the phone this week with Toby Russell from Shift, which is now a public company, trading after it merged with a SPAC, namely Insurance Acquisition Corp. Early trading is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shift-tech-listing-idUSKBN2702AY\">only going so well</a>, but the CEO outlined for us precisely why he pursued a SPAC, which was actually interesting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shift could have gone public via an IPO, Russell said, but prioritized a SPAC-led debut because his firm wanted to optimize for a capital raise to keep the company growing.</li>\n<li>How so? The private investment in public equity (PIPE) that the SPAC option <a href=\"https://spacinsider.com/2020/06/29/insurance-acquisition-corp-to-combine-with-shift-technologies/\">came with</a> ensured that Shift would have hundreds of millions in cash.</li>\n<li>Shift also wanted to minimize what the CEO described as market risk. A SPAC deal could happen regardless of what the broader markets were up to. And as the company made the choice to debut via a SPAC in April, some caution, we reckon, may have made some sense.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So now Shift is public and newly capitalized. Let’s see what happens to its shares as it gets into the groove of reporting quarterly. (Obviously, if it flounders, it’s a bad mark for SPACs, but, conversely, successful trading could lead to a bit more momentum to SPAC-mageddon.)</p>\n<p>A few more things and we’re done. Unicorn exits had a good week. First, Datto’s IPO continues to move forward. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/datto-sets-initial-ipo-price-range-indicating-a-valuation-of-around-4b/%5C\">set an initial price this week</a>, which could value it above $4 billion. Also this week, Roblox <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/free-to-play-gaming-giant-roblox-confidentially-files-to-go-public/\">announced that it has filed to go public</a>, albeit privately. It’s worth billions as well. And finally, DoubleVerify is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-13/providence-backed-doubleverify-said-to-prep-5-billion-ipo?sref=gni836kR\">looking to go public</a> for as much as $5 billion early next year.</p>\n<p>Not all liquidity comes via the public markets, as we saw this week’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/\">Twilio purchase of Segment</a>, a deal <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/is-the-twilio-segment-deal-expensive/\">that The Exchange dug into to find out if it was well-priced or not</a>.</p>\n<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>\n<p>We’re running long naturally, so here are just a few quick things to add to your weekend mental tea-and-coffee reading!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/1317115362580705280\">Operator Collective + @BLCKVC + @SalesforceVC mashup</a> caught our attention.</li>\n<li>Accel has notes <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2020-accel-euroscape-decacorn-unleashed-philippe-botteri/%5C\">here</a> on the EU startup scene, especially its later stages.</li>\n<li>Here’s a TechCrunch piece we helped put together that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/17/three-views-on-the-future-of-media-startups/\">digs into the current state of media startups</a>.

Current video conferencing tools like Zoom and WebEx are great for standalone video, but they have their own ecosystems and don&#8217;t integrate into thousands of enterprise workflows. That means that API tools that do integrate, like Agora and Twilio, still require manual work from developer teams to customize and maintain. AccessBell is aiming to provide the scalability and reliability of Zoom, as well as the customizability and integrations of Twilio, in a low code integration and no code extensible customization platform.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a big market the team is chasing, one that&#8217;s expected to grow to <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-video-conferencing-market\">$8.6 billion</a> by 2027.

The startup&#8217;s API links to farmers&#8217; bank accounts, where its algorithm assesses financials to provide a &#8220;farm read,&#8221; scoring the farms&#8217; financial health. It then regularly monitors farm data to continuously provide clean financials and recommendations on how to improve its customers&#8217; farms, as well as to connect farmers with capital in order to improve their score. (It might suggest that a farm invest in certain sustainability practices, for example.)</p>\n<p>Eventually, the idea is to also use the granular insights it&#8217;s garnering and sell these to hedge funds, state governments, and other outfits that want a better handle on what&#8217;s coming &#8212; be it around food security or climate changes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>3.)<b> Sequel</b></p>\n<p>What it does: Re-engineering life&#8217;s essential products &#8211; starting with tampons</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://thesequelisbetter.com/\">thesequelisbetter.com</a></p>\n<p>Founders: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gretameyer/\"> Greta Meyer (CEO</a>),  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/acalabre/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanda Calabrese (COO)</span></a></p>\n<p>The pitch: Founded by student athletes from Stanford, Sequel argues that seven<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> out of 10 women don&#8217;t trust tampons, which were first designed in 1931 (by a man). New brands like Lola have catchy brands, but the primary difference is in the material and not the design and performance of the product. Sequel has focused instead on fluid mechanics and specifically on slowing flow rates so a tampon won&#8217;t leak before it&#8217;s full, instilling more confidence in its customers, whether they&#8217;re in the &#8220;boardroom or the stadium.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The company says it has already filed patents and secured manufacturing partners and that it expects that the product will be available to buy directly from its website, as well as in other stores, next year.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p>4.)<b> Interface Bio</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What it does: Unlocking the therapeutic potential of the microbiome with a high-throughput pipeline for characterizing microbes, metabolites, and therapeutic response, based on years of research at Stanford</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founders: </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-van-treuren-7549b752/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will Van Treuren</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahwastyk/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hannah Wastyk</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pitch: The microbiome plays a major role in a wide range of human diseases, including heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer. In fact, Interface&#8217;s founders &#8212; both of whom are PhDs &#8212;  say that microbiome-influenced diseases are responsible for four of the top 10 causes of death in the United States. So how do they better seize on the opportunity to identify therapeutics by harnessing the microbiome?

There&#8217;s also an improved wide-angle lens, larger sensor, the addition of sensor-level image stabilization and a revamped Night Mode. Photographers will appreciate the new Apple ProRAW format, as well.

The scanner measures how long it takes for light to reach an object and reflect back. The new depth-sensing technology has big implications for AR, as it allows augmented reality objects to interact with objects in the real world. AR apps will be more user-friendly, too, as they won&#8217;t need to first scan the room to place the AR object in the real world. It can be placed instantly.</p>\n<p>Apple is leveraging the sensor for the iPhone 12 Pro camera to offer up to 6x faster focus in low-light conditions. Developers, meanwhile, can leverage lidar for use cases like AR-enabled games that work in the real world, social media (like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/snapchat-among-first-to-leverage-iphone-12-pros-lidar-scanner-for-ar/\">Snapchat&#8217;s new lidar-powered Lens</a>), home design and improvement apps involving room scans, spatial layout planning (like <a href=\"https://jig.space/\">JigSpace</a>), better AR shopping experiences and more.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3oEqXNSqa8\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/snapchat-among-first-to-leverage-iphone-12-pros-lidar-scanner-for-ar/\">Snapchat among first to leverage iPhone 12 Pro&#8217;s LiDAR Scanner for AR</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Snapchat among first to leverage iPhone 12 Pro&#8217;s LiDAR Scanner for AR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/snapchat-among-first-to-leverage-iphone-12-pros-lidar-scanner-for-ar/embed/#?secret=3oEqXNSqa8\" data-secret=\"3oEqXNSqa8\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The company also announced an affordable version of its HomePod smart speaker, the $99 HomePod Mini. The item works best for those fully locked inside the Apple universe, as it will stream a handful of music services, but not one of the most popular &#8212; Spotify. However, Apple also introduced a nifty feature for the HomePod devices, Intercom, which lets you send announcements across the speakers. While Apple and Google have offered a similar feature for their smart speakers, Intercom also works across other Apple devices, including iPhone, iPod, AirPods and even CarPlay.

crew this week <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/when-was-the-last-time-you-worked-out-your-soul/\">chewed through a trio of media stories</a>, each dealing with private companies and their successes. The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-news-startup-axios-weathers-covid-with-sponsored-newsletters-11601463601\">recently reported</a> that Axios was growing rapidly and near profitability. The paper also broke news that Morning Brew <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/13/21515418/morning-brew-business-insider-deal-acquisition\">might exit to Business Insider </a>for a hefty $75 million potential payout. Meanwhile, we covered the news that The Juggernaut <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/the-juggernaut-seed/\">raised $2 million</a> for its paywalled publication focused on South Asian news.</p>\n<p>The conversation, as a result, was a fairly indulgent and nerdy affair. It’s always fun to celebrate other journalists finding success in different ways, and this week felt like a moment for the media news landscape. Because the topic is so near to our hearts, for better or worse, we’re fitting our broader thoughts into this post about the future of media.</p>\n<p>Our own Natasha Mascarenhas writes about how inequity in media and who gets to succeed, Danny Crichton has some pretty strong feelings about digital advertising and Alex Wilhelm writes about how the varied methods of recent media success are themselves heartening.</p>\n<p>So this weekend let’s pause for a minute to ruminate on the upstart media world, a place where too often private capital and media economics have had a falling out.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmasc_\">Natasha Mascarenhas</a></h2>\n<p>This week, it was announced that advertising might not be a bad idea after all. Axios is reportedly expected to become profitable this year, and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/morning-brew\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"morning-brew\">Morning Brew, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> a free newsletter about business insights, could get acquired for between $50 million to $75 million by Business Insider. Both of these media companies make money off of newsletters. And if you end the story there, it’s clear that news isn’t simply a fundamental aspect of our democracy &#8212; it makes money, too.</p>\n<p>But, the story shouldn’t end there.</p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AxHlQPLiQtY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 12:45:27 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"e7b5a493acab0b0d309169a4e58b9c42","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn43@2020_6/2020/10/19/02-04-05-166_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn43@2020_6/2020/10/19/02-04-05-166_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn28@2020_1/2020/10/19/02-04-06-395_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/19/02-04-28-976_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn63@2020_5/2020/10/19/02-04-06-564_5b6deed1bcae76d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=AxHlQPLiQtY:fOcbBXJDH74:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn84@2020_3/2020/10/19/02-04-06-582_74080fca54027849.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn43@2020_3/2020/10/19/02-04-28-973_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/AxHlQPLiQtY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn99@2020_4/2020/10/19/02-04-20-504_818cb3d38150e08e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603073024875},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 10:03:44","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 10:03:44","title":"Original Content podcast: It’s hard to resist the silliness of ‘Emily in Paris’","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2062177","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">“Emily in Paris,” a new series on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"netflix\">Netflix, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has provoked <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/style/Emily-in-Paris.html\">skeptical responses from actual Parisians</a> who are happy to point out the abundant clichés in its story of a young American (played by Lily Collins) who takes a last-minute transfer to a marketing agency in Paris.</p> \n<p>Some fairly obvious culture clash moments ensue, along with equally implausible storylines where Emily’s extremely basic ideas about social media are treated as controversial and groundbreaking by her employer.</p> \n<p>And yet, as we discuss on the latest episode of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/\">the Original Content podcast</a>, we actually found the show delightful — or at the very least, highly watchable.</p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div> \n<p>Yes, the show’s Paris is a fantasy, but it’s a fantasy that we’re happy to visit, particularly now.

If one founder ends up quitting a year or two before the last cliff, they still own a large share of the cap table through many rounds to come. The departing founder might consider that fair, but the remaining founder(s) are the ones adding on the additional value — and resentment is not the only issue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The opportunity cost of dead equity is talent and capital,&#8221; Jake Jolis of Matrix Partners explains in a guest post for us this week. &#8220;Compensating talent and raising capital are the (only) two things you can use your startup’s equity for, and you need to do both in order for your company to grow large. If you want to build a big business, the road ahead is still long and windy, and you’re going to need every bit of help you can get. If your competitors don’t have dead equity you’re literally competing with a handicap.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Instead, he argues that founders who are just starting out should consider doubling the vesting schedule to eight years or so. In one example he gives, a founder who leaves after two and a half years on a four-year plan could end up with 22% of the company even after a big new funding round, the creation of an employee stock option pool, and additional shares set aside for a replacement cofounder-level hire. On an eight-year plan, that would be only 11%, and there would be a lot more remaining to entice new cofounders.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2059257\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8yearfoundervesting.jpg\" alt=\"Example cap table with eight-year cofounder vesting.\" width=\"497\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8yearfoundervesting.jpg 497w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8yearfoundervesting.jpg?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8yearfoundervesting.jpg?resize=300,281 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8yearfoundervesting.jpg?resize=50,47 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/4-year-founder-vesting-is-dead/\">full article is on Extra Crunch</a>, but I&#8217;m including more key parts here given the broad value:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Given the risks still ahead of the business, this level of compensation is often much more fair from a value-creation standpoint. With less dead equity on the cap table, the startup is still attractive in the eyes of VCs and well-positioned to attract a strong co-founder replacement to take the company forward. The alternative can cripple the company, and even co-founder B won’t be happy owning a larger percent of zero. While it’s better to do it when you start the company, a co-founder unit can elongate their vesting later on as well. The main requirement is that all the co-founders believe it’s in their best interest and agree to it. Most repeat founders I’ve talked to agree that four years is too short. Personally, if I started another company, I’d pick something like eight. <i>You</i> definitely don’t need to. You might decide four or six is better for your co-founder unit and your company.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One final thought, from my startup cofounder years. The departing cofounder should still want to see the company succeed as big as possible to maximize the value of their own shares. On the steep slope between failure and success in this business, vesting longer is a powerful way to help the company will deliver the most back to them after the hard work of the early days.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2059619\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2059619\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2059619\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FM-bell-ring.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FM-bell-ring.jpeg 6857w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FM-bell-ring.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FM-bell-ring.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FM-bell-ring.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FM-bell-ring.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FM-bell-ring.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FM-bell-ring.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FM-bell-ring.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2059619\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> FirstMark</p></div></p>\n<h2>Why one successful early-stage VC firm is getting into SPACs now</h2>\n<p>SPACs are an exciting development for any type of investor, public or private, Amish Jani of FirstMark Capital tells Connie Loizos. Indeed, his firm has historically focused on writing early-stage checks, so at first it is a bit jarring to see the FirstMark Horizon Acquisition SPAC raise $360 million and head out looking for the right unicorn. But he explains it all quite well an extensive interview this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>TC: Why SPACs right now? Is it fair to say it’s a shortcut to a hot public market, in a time when no one quite knows when the markets could shift?</strong></p>\n<p>AJ: There are a couple of different threads that are coming together. I think the first one is the possibility that [SPACs] work, and really well. [Our portfolio company] <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/draftkings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"draftkings\">DraftKings </a> [reverse-merged into a SPAC] and did a [private investment in a public equity deal]; it was a fairly complicated transaction and they used this to go public, and the stock has done incredibly well.</p>\n<p>In parallel, [privately held companies] over the last five or six years could raise large sums of capital, and that was pushing out the timeline [to going public] fairly substantially. [Now there are] tens of billions of dollars in value sitting in the private markets and [at the same time] an opportunity to go public and build trust with public shareholders and leverage the early tailwinds of growth.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to explain why public markets are likely to stay hot for the right SPACs far into the future.</p>\n<blockquote><p>AJ: I think a bit of a misconception is this idea that most investors in the public markets want to be hot money or fast money. There are a lot of investors that are interested in being part of a company’s journey and who’ve been frustrated because they’ve been frozen out of being able to access these companies as they’ve stayed private longer. So our investors are some of are our [limited partners], but the vast majority are long-only funds, alternative investment managers and people who are really excited about technology as a long-term disrupter and want to be aligned with this next generation of iconic companies.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/why-are-vcs-launching-spacs-amish-jani-of-firstmark-shares-his-firms-rationale/\">Check out the whole thing on TechCrunch</a>.</p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1878216\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Peter-Reinhardt-SegmentDSC00311.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Reinhardt SegmentDSC00311\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Peter-Reinhardt-SegmentDSC00311.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Peter-Reinhardt-SegmentDSC00311.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Peter-Reinhardt-SegmentDSC00311.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Peter-Reinhardt-SegmentDSC00311.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Peter-Reinhardt-SegmentDSC00311.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Peter-Reinhardt-SegmentDSC00311.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Peter-Reinhardt-SegmentDSC00311.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Peter-Reinhardt-SegmentDSC00311.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></h2>\n<h2>SaaS continues to boom with Databricks funding, Segment acquisition</h2>\n<p>Maybe Segment would have gone public sometime soon, but <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/\">instead Twilio has scooped it up for $3.2 billion this week</a>.
