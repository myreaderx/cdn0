Abstract paintings lined the white walls, and the whole room was aflutter with excitement. No one could stop talking about the artist of the night — a child no more than three feet tall. This was Marla Olmstead, and as her legend grew in the fine art world, so did the questions surrounding her awe-inspiring creativity. Was this little girl concealing a big secret?</p> \n<p class=\"btcaption\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong> Marla was born at the turn of the millennium in Binghamton, New York. Early on, she enjoyed playing in her backyard, watching cartoons, and hanging out with her parents, Mark and Laura, as well as her younger brother, Zane. Then, at age 3, everything changed.</strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img class=\"lazy aligncenter\" data-src=\"https://images.boredomfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/bolt/2020/08/young-girls-paintings-raise-questions-7-731w-731w.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://images.boredomfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/bolt/2020/08/young-girls-paintings-raise-questions-7-731w-375w.jpg 375w,https://images.boredomfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/bolt/2020/08/young-girls-paintings-raise-questions-7-731w-731w.jpg 731w,https://images.boredomfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/bolt/2020/08/young-girls-paintings-raise-questions-7-731w-768w.jpg 768w\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://boredomtherapy.com/wp-content/themes/boredom/images/lazy-image.jpeg\" /></p> \n<p class=\"btcaption\" style=\"text-align: center\"><strong> Her grandfather passed away.
