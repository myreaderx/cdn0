Do you imagine nightmare scenarios and then get worked up and anxious about them? Does your mind get caught in a horrible spiral of catastrophizing over even the smallest of things? Worrying, particularly imagining the worst case scenario, seems to be a natural part of being human and comes easily to a lot of us. It's awful, perhaps even dangerous, when we do it.</p>\n<p>But, there might just be an ancient wisdom that can help. It involves reframing this attitude for the better, and it comes from Stoicism. It's called \"premeditation,\" and it could be the most useful trick we can learn.</p>\n<h2>Practical Stoicism</h2>\n<p>Broadly speaking, Stoicism is the philosophy of choosing your judgments. Stoics believe that there is nothing about the universe that can be called good or bad, valuable or valueless, <em>in itself.</em> It's we who add these values to things. As Shakespeare's Hamlet says, \"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\" Our minds color the things we encounter as being \"good\" or \"bad,\" and given that we control our minds, we therefore have control over all of our negative feelings.</p>\n<p>Put another way, Stoicism maintains that there's a gap between our experience of an event and our judgment of it. For instance, if someone calls you a smelly goat, you have an opportunity, however small and hard it might be, to pause and ask yourself, \"How will I judge this?\" What's more, you can even ask, \"How will I respond?\" We have power over which thoughts we entertain and the final say on our actions. Today, Stoicism has influenced and finds modern expression in the hugely effective \"cognitive behavioral therapy.\"</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"34b9bf12be3b451ed5f39ceb106d4b13\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1NzY5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0OTgyNDI4N30.6U0r_3yhPx5UXexIFg_uL3ECa3qLqpa-3xwLrjmZRcM/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"5000\" id=\"727ca\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%207501%205000'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"7501\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Helping you practice Stoicism</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/goats-graze-on-a-hillside-as-part-of-fire-prevention-news-photo/1171383564?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: Robyn Beck via Getty Images</small></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>One of the principal fathers of ancient Stoicism was the Roman statesmen, Seneca, who argued that the unexpected and unforeseen blows of life are the hardest to take control over. The shock of a misfortune can strip away the power we have to choose our reaction. For instance, being burglarized feels so horrible because we had felt so safe at home. A stomach ache, out of the blue, is harder than a stitch thirty minutes into a run. A sudden bang makes us jump, but a firework makes us smile. Fell swoops hurt more than known hardships.</p>\n<h2>What could possibly go wrong?</h2>\n<p>So, how can we resolve this? Seneca suggests a Stoic technique called \"premeditatio malorum\" or \"premeditation.\" At the start of every day, we ought to take time to indulge our anxious and catastrophizing mind. We should \"rehearse in the mind: exile, torture, war, shipwreck.\" We should meditate on the worst things that could happen: your partner will leave you, your boss will fire you, your house will burn down. Maybe, even, you'll die. </p>\n<p>This might sound depressing, but the important thing is that we do not stop there. </p>\n<blockquote>\n Stoicism has influenced and finds modern expression in the hugely effective \"cognitive behavioral therapy.\"\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Stoic also rehearses how they will <em>react</em> to these things as they come up. For instance, another Stoic (and Roman Emperor) Marcus Aurelius asks us to imagine all the mean, rude, selfish, and boorish people we'll come across today. Then, in our heads, we script how we'll respond when we meet them. We can shrug off their meanness, smile at their rudeness, and refuse to be \"implicated in what is degrading.\" Thus prepared, we take control again of our reactions and behavior.</p>\n<p>The Stoics cast themselves into the darkest and most desperate of conditions but then realize that they can and will endure. With premeditation, the Stoic is prepared and has the mental vigor necessary to take the blow on the chin and say, \"Yep, l can deal with this.\"</p>\n<h2>Catastrophizing as a method of mental inoculation</h2>\n<p>Seneca wrote: \"In times of peace, the soldier carries out maneuvers.\" This is also true of premeditation, which acts as the war room or training ground. The agonizing cut of the unexpected is blunted by preparedness. We can prepare the mind for whatever trials may come, in just the same way we can prepare the body for some endurance activity. The world can throw nothing as bad as that which our minds have already imagined. </p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p>Stoicism teaches us to embrace our worrying mind but to embrace it as a kind of inoculation. With a frown over breakfast, try to spend five minutes of your day deliberately catastrophizing. Get your anti-anxiety battle plan ready and then face the world.</p>\n<p><em>Jonny Thomson teaches philosophy in Oxford.

Along the way, they analyzed over 100 reflective materials, trying them out in about 50 experimental formulations. </p>\n<p> Lead author, postdoc Xiangyu Li explains, \"We looked at various commercial products, basically anything that's white. We found that using barium sulfate, you can theoretically make things really, really reflective, which means that they're really, really white.\" </p>\n<p> The whitest white paint before — developed by the same team just last autumn — depended on calcium carbonate, a compound commonly found in seashells, rocks, and blackboard chalk. </p>\n<p> The team crammed as many tiny BaSO<sub>4</sub> particles into the paint as possible. Says Li: \"Although a higher particle concentration is better for making something white, you can't increase the concentration too much. The higher the concentration, the easier it is for the paint to break or peel off.\" </p>\n<p> Another factor that makes the team's BaSO<sub>4</sub> formulation so reflective is that the researchers used barium sulfate particles of many different sizes. When it comes to reflecting light, size matters. </p>\n<p> Co-author and PhD student Joseph Peoples said, \"A high concentration of particles that are also different sizes gives the paint the broadest spectral scattering, which contributes to the highest reflectance.\" </p>\n<p> The team's formulation method, they report, is compatible with commercial paint production. </p>\n<h2>Cool support for the planet</h2>\n<p> Purdue has applied for patents relating to BaSO<sub>4</sub>, though there are as yet no plans to make it commercially available. </p>\n<p> However, the sooner they release it, the better. Air conditioning currently accounts for <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=36692\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">12% of U.S. energy consumption</a>. Also, many air conditioners use hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). While HFCs constitute just a small percentage of greenhouse gases, they trap thousands of times the amount of heat as carbon dioxide. </p>\n<p> Therefore, BaSO<sub>4</sub> can play a role in combating global warming by reducing energy consumption and the emission of HFCs. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/l6GCScFuqsY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA2Nzc3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMjA3Njg1OX0.lvJQU60LhZ_7yvx1XMaZphMERV6h1yG0zPBZCrXDt7k/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"1014e83d4555e2cbb038c72bfa23e07f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn45@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-38-17-451_56cdeb3423667d36.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":98474,"destBytes":98474,"author":"Robby Berman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA2Nzc3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMjA3Njg1OX0.lvJQU60LhZ_7yvx1XMaZphMERV6h1yG0zPBZCrXDt7k/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn45@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-38-17-451_56cdeb3423667d36.webp","https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201440%20959'%3E%3C/svg%3E":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/l6GCScFuqsY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn55@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-38-18-391_41baf626e959dca3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199333841},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","title":"Why Aristotle didn't invent modern science","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/aristotle-didnt-invent-modern-science","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1MzM3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MDA1NzY4MX0.p-Fs0fXyueyc5w9oft7z3OFz9tQi4XaTGf46a0XbvkE/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C132%2C0%2C132&amp;height=700\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"> \n <li>Modern science requires scrutinizing the tiniest of details and an almost irrational dedication to empirical observation. </li>\n <li>Many scientists believe that theories should be \"beautiful,\" but such argumentation is forbidden in modern science. </li>\n <li>Neglecting beauty would be a step too far for Aristotle.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><span></span>Modern science has done astounding things: sending probes to Pluto, discerning the nature of light, vaccinating the globe. Its power to plumb the world's inner workings, many scientists and philosophers of science would say, hinges on its exacting attention to empirical evidence. The ethos guiding scientific inquiry might be formulated so: \"Credit must be given to theories only if what they affirm agrees with the observed facts.\"</p>\n<p>Those are the words of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, writing in the fourth century BCE. Why, then, was it only during the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century, two thousand years later, that science came into its own? Why wasn't it Aristotle who invented modern science?</p>\n<p>The answer is, first, that modern science attends to a different kind of observable fact than the sort that guided Aristotle. Second, modern science attends with an intensity — indeed an unreasonable narrow-mindedness — that Aristotle would have found to be more than a little unhinged. Let's explore those two ideas in turn.</p>\n<h2>Excruciating minutiae</h2>\n<p>In 1915, Albert Einstein proposed a new theory of gravitation — the general theory of relativity. It told a story radically different from the prevailing Newtonian theory; gravity, according to Einstein, was not a force but rather the manifestation of matter's propensity to travel along the straightest possible path through twisted spacetime. Relativity revised the notion of gravitation on the grandest conceptual scale, but to test it required the scrutiny of minutiae.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"science einstein relativity eddington\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"3b9290dca8dbd8c834b58f7e081df0cf\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1MzI0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MTUwODU4M30.A-voduUpV6QIJWTbw6iqMtaPxYsT9t3MsXrLcIwL6x4/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1849\" id=\"7127e\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201915%201849'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1915\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Einstein's general relativity predicts gravitational lensing.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_general_relativity#/media/File:Einstein_cross.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: NASA, ESA, and STScI / Public Domain via Wikipedia</small></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>When Arthur Eddington sought experimental evidence for the theory by measuring gravity's propensity to bend starlight, he photographed the same star field both in the night sky and then in close proximity to the eclipsed sun, looking for a slight displacement in the positions of the stars that would reveal the degree to which the sun's mass deflected their light. The change in position was on the order of a fraction of a millimeter on his photographic plates. In that minuscule discrepancy lay the reason to accept a wholly new vision of the nature of the forces that shape galaxies.</p>\n<p>Aristotle would not have thought to look in these places, at these diminutive magnitudes. Even the pre-scientific thinkers who believed that the behavior of things was determined by their microscopic structure did not believe it was possible for humans to discern that structure. When they sought a match between their ideas and the observed facts, they meant the facts that any person might readily encounter in the world around them: the gross motions of cannonballs and comets; the overall attunement of animals and their environs; the tastes, smells, and sounds that force themselves on our sensibilities without asking our permission. They were looking in the wrong place. The clues to the deepest truths have turned out to be deeply hidden.</p>\n<blockquote>\n Modern science attends with an intensity — indeed an unreasonable narrow-mindedness — that Aristotle would have found to be more than a little unhinged.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even in those cases where the telling evidence is visible to the unassisted eye, the effort required to gather what's needed can be monumental. Charles Darwin spent nearly five years sailing around the world on a 90-foot-long ship, the <em>Beagle</em>, recording the sights and sounds that would prompt his theory of evolution by natural selection. Following his famous footsteps, the Princeton biologists Rosemary and Peter Grant have spent nearly 50 years visiting the tiny Galápagos island of Daphne Major every summer observing the local finch populations. In so doing, they witnessed the creation of a new species.</p>\n<p>Similarly excruciating demands are made by many other scientific projects, each consumed with the hunt for subtle detail. The LIGO experiment to measure gravitational waves commenced in the 1970s, was nearly closed down in the 1980s, began operating its detectors only in 2002, and then for well over a decade found nothing. Upgraded machinery revealed the waves at last in 2015. The scientists who had spent their entire careers working on LIGO were by then retired from their long-time university positions.</p>\n<h2>The \"iron rule\" of modern science</h2>\n<p>What pushes scientists to undertake these titanic efforts? That question brings me to the second way in which modern science's attitude to evidence differs from Aristotle's. There is something about the institutions of science, as the philosopher and historian Thomas Kuhn wrote, that \"forces scientists to investigate some part of nature in a detail and depth that would otherwise be unimaginable\". That something is an \"iron rule\" to the effect that, when publishing arguments for or against a hypothesis, <em>only empirical evidence counts</em>. That is to say, the only kind of argument that is allowed in science's official organs of communication is one that assesses a theory according to its ability to predict or explain the observable facts.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"da0c89210feed89a088cf82c1be6197f\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1MzI3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NzQ1OTExMX0.3NhsxtX9h9Om3zEJSVe7rsC_818DsCZAYPE4XUYs7Yc/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"696\" id=\"084f5\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20870%20696'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"870\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Aristotle and Alexander the Great</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle#/media/File:Alexander_and_Aristotle.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: Charles Laplante / Public Domain via Wikipedia</small></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Aristotle said that evidence counts, but he did not say that <em>only</em> evidence counts. To get a feel for the significance of this additional word, one of modern science's most significant ingredients, let me return to Eddington's attempt to test Einstein's theory by photographing stars during a solar eclipse.</p>\n<p>Eddington was himself as much of a theoretical as an experimental physicist. He was struck by the mathematical beauty of Einstein's theory, which he took as a sign of its superiority to the old, Newtonian physics. He might have devoted himself to promoting relativity theory on these grounds, proselytizing its aesthetic merits with his elegant writing style and his many scientific connections. But in scientific argument, only empirical evidence counts. To appeal to a theory's beauty is to transgress this iron rule.</p>\n<p>If Eddington was to advocate for Einstein, he would have to do so with measurements. Consequently, he found himself on a months-long expedition to Africa, where he and his collaborators sweated over their equipment day after day while praying for clear skies. In short, the iron rule forced Eddington to put beauty aside and to get on the boat. That is how scientists are pushed to hunt down the fine-grained, often elusive observations that endow science with its extraordinary power.</p>\n<h2>Irrational but effective</h2>\n<p>Though it may be a resounding success, there is something very peculiar about the iron rule. For Eddington and many other physicists, beauty is an important, even a crucial, consideration in determining the truth: \"We would not accept any theory as final unless it were beautiful,\" wrote the Nobelist Steven Weinberg.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the iron rule stipulates that beauty may play no part in scientific argument, or at least, in official, written scientific argument. The rule tells scientists, then, to ignore what they take to be an immensely valuable criterion for assessing theories. That seems oddly, even irrationally, narrow-minded. It turns out, then, that science's knowledge-making prowess is owed in great part to a kind of deliberate blindness, an unreasonable insistence that inquirers into nature consider nothing but observed fact.</p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.strevens.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Strevens</a> writes about science, understanding, complexity, and the nature of thought, and teaches philosophy at New York University.

How can anyone hope to express ideas so terrible when doing so will only reduce those ideas?</p>\n<p>These are some of the things that inspired the Dada movement, and in its absurd, surreal, and chaotic nonsense, we find the voice of the voiceless.</p>\n<h2>The origin of Dadaism</h2>\n<p>Dada was a response to the madness of World War I. Reasonable, intelligent, and sensitive people looked at the blood and mud graveyards of the trenches and wondered how any meaning or goodness could ever be found again. How can someone make sense of a world where millions of young, happy, hopeful men were scythed down in a spray of bullets? How could life go back to normal when returning soldiers, blinded and disfigured from gas, lay homeless in the streets? Out of this awful revulsion, there came one bitter voice, and it said: \"Everything is nonsense.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n Dada is the art of the nihilist. It smashes accepted wisdom, challenges norms and values, and offends, upsets, and provokes us to re-examine everything.\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so, the Dada movement expressed itself in absurdity. Tzara, the closest you get to a Dadaist philosopher, put it like this: \"Like everything in life, Dada is useless. Dada is without pretension, as life should be.\" Dada rejects all systems, all philosophy, all definite answers, and all truth. It is the living embrace of contradictions and nonsense. It seeks \"to confuse and upset people, to shake and jolt\". It aims to shout down the \"shamefaced sex of comfortable compromise and good manners,\" when actually \"everything happens in a completely idiotic way.\"</p>\n<p>In short, Dada is a response to the world when all the usual methods have broken down. It's the recognition that dinner party conversations, Hollywood blockbusters, and Silicon Valley are not how life actually is. This is a false reality and order, like some kind of veneer. </p>\n<p>The Dada response to life is to embrace the personal and passionate madness of it all, where \"the intensity of a personality is transposed directly, clearly into the work.\" It's to recognize the unique position of an artist, who can convey ideas and feelings in a way that goes beyond normal understanding. Art goes straight to the soul, but the intensity of it all can be hard to \"enjoy\" in the strictest sense.</p>\n<h2>Where is this Dada?</h2>\n<p>For instance, Dada is seen in the poems of Hugo Ball who wrote in meaningless <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_8Wg40F3yo&amp;ab_channel=Mr.DSCH\" target=\"_blank\">foreign-sounding words</a>. It's in Hausmann, who wrote works in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sat0LIaOVTM&amp;ab_channel=MorsMea\" target=\"_blank\">disconnected phonemes</a>. It's found in Duchamp's iconoclastic \"<a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/duchamp-fountain-t07573\" target=\"_blank\">Fountain</a>\" that sought to question what art or an artist really meant. It's in Hans Richter's short film \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJoBf_pNdt4\" target=\"_blank\">Ghost before Breakfast</a>,\" which has an incoherent montage of images, loosely connected by the theme of inanimate objects in revolt. And, it's in <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/kurt-schwitters-1912\" target=\"_blank\">Kurt Schwitters'</a> \"psychological collages\" which present fragments of objects, juxtaposed together.</p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"kurt schwitters dada dadaism\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"5cb88dbd582162a6b4cf9dc4535e8762\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3NzE0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyODMxNTkzOH0.mZfOUvicQY4dtolxygvFD1VoJNwbRX0x7XCwb6Oi7RM/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"671\" id=\"c3f92\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20578%20671'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"578\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Kurt Schwitters, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merz_(art_style)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Merz (art style)\">Merz</a>-drawing 85, Zig-Zag Red, 1920, collage</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schwitters#/media/File:MERZZEICHNUNG_85_ZICKZACKROT_(MERZDRAWING_85_ZIG-ZAG_RED).PNG\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: Kurt Schwitters / Public Domain via Wikipedia</small></p>\n<p>Dada is intended to shock. It's an artistic jolt asking, or <em>demanding</em>, that the viewers reorient themselves in some way. It is designed to make us feel uncomfortable and does not make for easy appreciation. It's only when we're thrown so drastically outside of our comfort zone in this way that Dada asks us to question how things are. It shakes us out of a conformist stupor to look afresh at things.<br /></p>\n<h2>The paradox of Dadaism</h2>\n<p>Of course, like all avant-garde art, Dada needs to address one major problem: how do you <em>stay </em>so provocative, so radical, and so anti-establishment when you also seek success? How can maverick rebels stay so as they get a mortgage and want a good school for their kids? The problem is that young, inventive, and idealistic artists are inevitably sucked into the world of profit and commodity. </p>\n<p>As Grayson Perry, a British modern artist,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/27/grayson-perry-the-most-popular-art-exhibition-ever\" target=\"_blank\"> wrote</a>: \"What starts as a creative revolt soon becomes co-opted as the latest way to make money,\" and what was once fresh and challenging \"falls away to reveal a predatory capitalist robot.\" With Dada, how long can someone actually <em>live</em> in a world of nonsense and nihilistic absurdity?</p>\n<p>But there will always be new blood to keep movements like Dada going. As the revolutionaries of yesterday become the rich mansion-owners of today, there will be hot, young things to come and take up the mantle. There will always be something to challenge and questions to be asked. So, art movements like Dada will always be in the vanguard.</p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p>Dada is the art of the nihilist. It smashes accepted wisdom, challenges norms and values, and offends, upsets, and provokes us to re-examine everything. It's an absurd art form that reflects the reality it perceives — that life is nothing more than a dissonant patchwork of egos floating in an abyss of nothing.</p>\n<p><em>Jonny Thomson teaches philosophy in Oxford.

All species of these plants contain a group of neurotoxic compounds called grayanotoxins. When bees feed on the nectar and pollen of certain types of rhododendrons, the insects ingest grayanotoxins, which eventually make their way into the bees' honey, effectively making it \"mad.\" </p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Mad honey\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"3a1bf0aa1e7bd7cbc71ad1399b12a127\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA5MTM3MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNzkzMDYxNn0.RqaK1Z6Mv1Iql27YEeAfqEgWSPbWiFegmQeOUaNSVpo/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1440\" id=\"83ebd\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1920\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Rhododendron ferrugineum</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhododendron#/media/File:Alpenroos.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">albert kok</a> </small> </p>\n<p> Bees are more likely to produce mad honey when and where rhododendrons are dominating. The reason has to do with scarcity: With fewer types of plants to feed on, the insects feed almost solely on rhododendrons, so they consume more grayanotoxins. The result is especially pure mad honey.<br /> </p>\n<p> But accessing honeycombs that contain mad honey can be difficult.

One of the oldest accounts comes from 401 BCE, when Greek soldiers were marching through the Turkish town of Trabzon and came across a bounty of mad honey. The Athenian military leader and philosopher Xenophon wrote in his book <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=_9cwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=ground,+in+consequence,+in+great+numbers,+as+if+there+had+been+a+defeat;+and+there+was+general+dejection.+The+next+day+no+one+of+them+was+found+dead;+and+they+recovered+their+senses+about+the+same+hour+that+they+had+lost+them+on+the+preceding+day;+and+on+the+third+and+fourth+days+they+got+up+as+if+after+having+taken+physi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Cp5IYPWb_&amp;sig=ACfU3U3aNR755pNxlIbimm3HTEf-WZiABw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiz7cD2no7wAhXDGM0KHcbGBKcQ6AEwAnoECAEQAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ground%2C%20in%20consequence%2C%20in%20great%20numbers%2C%20as%20if%20there%20had%20been%20a%20defeat%3B%20and%20there%20was%20general%20dejection.%20The%20next%20day%20no%20one%20of%20them%20was%20found%20dead%3B%20and%20they%20recovered%20their%20senses%20about%20the%20same%20hour%20that%20they%20had%20lost%20them%20on%20the%20preceding%20day%3B%20and%20on%20the%20third%20and%20fourth%20days%20they%20got%20up%20as%20if%20after%20having%20taken%20physi&amp;f=false\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Anabasis</em></a>: </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"> <em>\"The number of bee-hives was extraordinary, and all the soldiers that ate of the combs, lost their senses, vomited, and were affected with purging, and none of them were able to stand upright; such as had eaten only a little were like men greatly intoxicated, and such as had eaten much were like mad-men, and some like persons at the point of death.\" </em></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em> \"They lay upon the ground, in consequence, in great numbers, as if there had been a defeat; and there was general dejection. The next day no one of them was found dead; and they recovered their senses about the same hour that they had lost them on the preceding day; and on the third and fourth days they got up as if after having taken physic.\"</em> </p>\n<p> Centuries later, in 67 BCE, Roman soldiers weren't so lucky. As the soldiers pursued King Mithridates of Pontus and his Persian army, they stumbled across mad honey that the Persians had intentionally left behind, intending to use the substance as a bioweapon. Vaughn Bryant, a professor of anthropology at Texas A&amp;M University, explained in a <a href=\"https://research.tamu.edu/2014/11/03/how-eating-mad-honey-cost-pompey-the-great-1000-soldiers/#:~:text=Mad%20honey%20originated%20in%20the,called%20grayanotoxin%20in%20their%20nectars.&amp;text=Near%20Trabzon%20(in%20Northeastern%20Turkey,stolen%20from%20some%20nearby%20beehives.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>: </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"> <em>\"The Persians gathered pots full of local honey and left them for the Roman troops to find. They ate the honey, became disoriented and couldn't fight. The Persian army returned and killed over 1,000 Roman troops with few losses of their own.\"</em> </p>\n<p> But mad honey was more often used for nonviolent purposes. People in the Black Sea region have long consumed small amounts of the substance (about a teaspoon's worth), in boiling milk or on its own, both for pleasure and as a folk medicine. </p>\n<p> In the 18th century, merchants in the Black Sea region sold honey to the Europeans, who infused liquor with a bit of the substance to enjoy its milder effects. </p>\n<p> <strong>Mad honey today</strong> </p>\n<p> Today, beekeepers in Nepal and Turkey still harvest mad honey, though it represents a small fraction of the nations' total honey production. Both countries allow the production, sale, and exportation of mad honey, but the substance is illegal in other nations, like South Korea, which <a href=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/ra/c8ra01924j\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">banned the substance in 2005</a>. </p>\n<p> While interested buyers in the U.S. can purchase mad honey from countries like Nepal and Turkey, it might be worth sticking with the regular stuff. After all, the handful of experiences posted on the website of the non-profit psychedelic research organization Erowid.org don't sound too enticing. </p>\n<p>One user <a href=\"https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=114041\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> they \"wouldn't even recommend trying it.\" Another user suffered mad honey poisoning after taking too much, <a href=\"https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=110677\" target=\"_blank\">writing</a> that the \"symptoms can seem life threatening\" and that they hope their report might help \"some poor bastard out there not make the same mistake.\"</p>\n<div> \n</div>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"> \n</ul>\n<div> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/kQqJ0MGGx3E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:02:22 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA5MTM1OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMzQ4MDc4MX0.W5lOy-ZlnGdgIuQSOK4U0nHOzY1rms10yBZMHZuoNJU/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C83%2C0%2C83&height=700","linkMd5":"f366b3a08552eaaa537a7fa2cb60aadd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn23@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-38-17-470_023da3be38a6a4b1.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":203190,"destBytes":203190,"author":"Stephen Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA5MTM1OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMzQ4MDc4MX0.W5lOy-ZlnGdgIuQSOK4U0nHOzY1rms10yBZMHZuoNJU/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C83%2C0%2C83&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn23@2020_2/2021/04/23/17-38-17-470_023da3be38a6a4b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/kQqJ0MGGx3E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn40@2020_5/2021/04/23/17-38-18-751_1e91c11392e61005.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199333835},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","title":"How gratitude makes you more attractive","link":"https://bigthink.com/john-templeton-foundation/attitude-of-gratitude","description":"<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.rebelmouse.com/res/scraper/embed/?jwplayer_video_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.jwplatform.com%2Fplayers%2FREpy88Mi-FvQKszTI.js\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<br />\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\">\n <li>When someone says thank you, who is it for?

As researchers launch new cluster-hunting telescopes, they must heed these findings or risk having an incomplete picture of the universe.</p>\n<p>Galaxy clusters contain hundreds to thousands of galaxies bound together by gravity. They move through a hot soup of gas called the intracluster medium, which contains more mass than all the stars in all the galaxies within it. This hot gas fuels star formation as it cools and emits X-ray radiation that we can observe with space-based telescopes. </p>\n<p>This bright gas cloud creates a fuzzy halo of X-rays around galaxy clusters, making them stand out from more discrete point sources of X-rays produced by, for example, a star or quasar. However, some galactic neighborhoods break this mold, as MIT Associate Professor Michael McDonald learned nine years ago.</p>\n<p>In 2012, McDonald discovered a cluster unlike any other, which shone bright like a point source in the X-ray. Its central galaxy hosts a ravenous black hole that consumes matter and spews X-rays so bright as to drown out the diffuse radiation of the intracluster medium. In its core, the cluster forms stars at a rate roughly 500 times higher than most other clusters, giving it the blue glow of a young star population instead of the typical red hue of aging stars.</p>\n<p>\"We'd been looking for a system like this for decades,\" McDonald says of the Phoenix cluster. And yet, it had been observed and passed over years prior, assumed to be a single galaxy instead of a cluster. \"It'd been in the archive for decades and no one saw it. They were looking past it because it didn't look right.\"</p>\n<p>And so, McDonald wondered, what other unusual clusters might be lurking in the archive, waiting to be found? Thus, the Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (CHiPS) survey was born.</p>\n<p>Taweewat Somboonpanyakul, a graduate student in McDonald's lab, devoted his entire PhD to the CHiPS survey. He began by selecting potential cluster candidates from decades of X-ray observations. He used existing data from ground-based telescopes in Hawaii and New Mexico, and visited the Magellan telescopes in Chile to take new images of the remaining sources, hunting for neighboring galaxies that would reveal a cluster. In the most promising cases, he zoomed in with higher-resolution telescopes such as the space-based Chandra X-Ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope.</p>\n<p>After six years, the CHiPS survey has now come to a close. Today in <em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>, Somboonpanyakul published the survey's <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe1bc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cumulative results</a>, which include the discovery of three new galaxy clusters. One of these clusters, CHIPS1911+4455, is similar to the rapidly-star-forming Phoenix cluster and was described in a <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abd540\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> in January in <em>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. It's an exciting finding since astronomers know of just a few other Phoenix-like clusters. This cluster invites further study, however, as it has a twisted shape with two extended arms, whereas all other rapidly-cooling clusters are circular. The researchers believe it may have collided with a smaller galaxy cluster. \"It's super unique compared to all the galaxy clusters that we now know,\" says Somboonpanyakul.</p>\n<p>In all, the CHiPS survey revealed that older X-ray surveys missed roughly 1 percent of galactic neighborhoods because they look different than the typical cluster. This can have significant implications, since astronomers study galaxy clusters to learn about how the universe expands and evolves. \"We need to find all the clusters to get those things right,\" McDonald explains. \"Ninety-nine percent completion isn't enough if you want to push the frontier.\"</p>\n<p>As scientists discover and study more of these unusual galaxy clusters, they may better understand how they fit into the broader cosmic picture. At this point, they don't know whether a small number of clusters are always in this strange, Phoenix-like state, or if this is perhaps a typical phase that all clusters undergo for a short period of time — roughly 20 million years, a fleeting moment by spacetime standards. It's difficult for astronomers to tell the difference, as they only get a single snapshot of each cluster nearly frozen in time. But with more data, they can make better models of the physics governing these galactic neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>The conclusion of the CHiPS survey coincides with the launch of a new X-ray telescope, eROSITA, which aims to grow our catalogue of clusters from a few hundred to tens of thousands. But unless they change the way they look for those clusters, they will miss hundreds that deviate from the norm. \"The people that are building out the cluster searches for this new X-ray telescope need to be aware of this work,\" says McDonald. \"If you miss 1 percent of the clusters, there's a fundamental limit to how well you can understand the universe.\"</p>\n<p>This research was supported, in part, by the Kavli Research Investment Fund at MIT, and by NASA through the Guest Observer programs for the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope.</p>\n<p>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT News</a>.

No, I'm so busy.'\"</p>\n<p>Most of the digital nomads we studied had been lured into what urbanist <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60042.The_Rise_of_the_Creative_Class\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Florida termed “creative class\" jobs</a> – positions in design, tech, marketing and entertainment. They assumed this work would prove fulfilling enough to offset what they sacrificed in terms of time spent on social and creative pursuits. </p>\n<p>Yet these digital nomads told us that their jobs were far less interesting and creative than they had been led to expect. Worse, their employers continued to demand that they be “all in\" for work – and accept the controlling aspects of office life without providing the development, mentorship or meaningful work they felt they had been promised. As they looked to the future, they saw only more of the same. </p>\n<p>Ellie, 33, a former business journalist who is now a freelance writer and entrepreneur, told us: “A lot of people don't have positive role models at work, so then it's sort of like 'Why am I climbing the ladder to try and get this job? This doesn't seem like a good way to spend the next twenty years.'\"</p>\n<p>By their late 20s to early 30s, digital nomads were actively researching ways to leave their career-track jobs in top-tier global cities. </p>\n<h2>Looking for a fresh start</h2>\n<p>Although they left some of the world's most glamorous cities, the digital nomads we studied were not homesteaders working from the wilderness; they needed access to the conveniences of contemporary life in order to be productive. Looking abroad, they quickly learned that places like Bali in Indonesia, and Chiang Mai in Thailand had the necessary infrastructure to support them at a fraction of the cost of their former lives. </p>\n<p>With more and more companies now offering employees the choice to work <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/22/870029658/get-a-comfortable-chair-permanent-work-from-home-is-coming\" target=\"_blank\">remotely</a>, there's no reason to think digital nomads have to travel to southeast Asia – or even leave the United States – to transform their work lives.</p>\n<p>During the pandemic, some people have already <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-remote-work-is-reshaping-americas-urban-geography-11614960100\" target=\"_blank\">migrated away from the nation's most expensive real estate markets</a> to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/16/931400786/small-cities-are-a-big-draw-for-remote-workers-during-the-pandemic\">smaller cities and towns</a> to be closer to nature or family. Many of these places still possess vibrant local cultures. As commutes to work disappear from daily life, such moves could leave remote workers with more available income and more free time.</p>\n<p>The digital nomads we studied often used savings in time and money to try new things, like exploring side hustles. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2018.0164\" target=\"_blank\">One recent study</a> even found, somewhat paradoxically, that the sense of empowerment that came from embarking on a side hustle actually improved performance in workers' primary jobs. </p>\n<p>The future of work, while not entirely remote, will undoubtedly offer more remote options to many more workers. Although <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/10/14/923428794/from-the-folks-who-brought-you-boring-meetings-ceos-want-to-ditch-sterile-zoom-c\" target=\"_blank\">some business leaders are still reluctant</a> to accept their employees' desire to leave the office behind, local governments are embracing the trend, with several U.S. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/how-small-cities-are-trying-to-lure-remote-workers\" target=\"_blank\">cities</a> and <a href=\"https://wajr.com/morgantown-one-of-three-cities-selected-for-remote-work-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\">states</a> – along with <a href=\"https://www.etiasvisa.com/etias-news/digital-nomad-visas-eu-countries\" target=\"_blank\">countries</a> around the world – developing plans to attract remote workers. </p>\n<p>This migration, whether domestic or international, has the potential to enrich communities and cultivate more satisfying work lives.<img alt=\"The Conversation\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/157485/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\" width=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/rachael-a-woldoff-1195801\">Rachael A.

Discovered in China, the dinosaur was a darwinopteran pterosaur, a subgroup of pterosaurs, which first appeared 215 million years ago during the Triassic Period. Pterosaurs, like the pterodactyl, were the first vertebrates to evolve the ability of powered flight. </p>\n<p>But unlike other pterosaurs, the Monkeydactyl was the only species in its group known to have opposable thumbs. It's a rare adaptation for non-mammals: The only extant examples are chameleons and some species of tree frogs. (Most birds have at least one opposable digit, though that digit is usually classified as a hallux, not a pollex, which means \"thumb\" in Latin.)</p>\n<p>To analyze the anatomy of <em>K. antipollicatus, </em>an international team of researchers used microcomputed tomography scanning, which generates images of the inside of the body.</p>\n<p>\"The fingers of 'Monkeydactyl' are tiny and partly embedded in the slab,\" study co-author Fion Waisum Ma said in a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/uob-njf041221.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. \"Thanks to micro-CT scanning, we could see through the rocks, create digital models, and tell how the opposed thumb articulates with the other finger bones.\"</p>\n<p>\"This is an interesting discovery. It provides the earliest evidence of a true opposed thumb, and it is from a pterosaur — which wasn't known for having an opposed thumb.\"</p>\n<p>As a tree-dwelling reptile, the Monkeydactyl probably evolved opposable thumbs so it could grasp tree branches, which would have helped it hang, avoid falls, and obtain food. This <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboreal_locomotion#:~:text=Arboreal%20locomotion%20is%20the%20locomotion,but%20others%20are%20exclusively%20arboreal.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">arboreal (tree-dwelling) locomotion</a> would help the Monkeydactyl adapt to its home ecosystem, the subtropical forests of the Tiaojishan Formation in China during the Jurassic Period.</p>\n<p>The researchers noted that the forests of the Tiaojishan Formation were likely warm and humid, thriving with \"a rich and complex\" diversity of tree-dwelling animals. But while the forests were home to multiple pterosaur species, the Monkeydactyl was likely the only one that was arboreal, spending most of its time in the treetops, while other pterosaurs occupied different levels of the forest.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"3f40d4ee70617aa8ffb95327c7be4765\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1NzcxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0OTEzMzIwNX0.kkhNMX3Xl1Dfy6N6a8t85eQEFSSf6CZlFG6YPs_aSgs/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"754\" id=\"9b7ea\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20750%20754'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"750\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">K. antipollicatus and its phylogenetic position.

As pioneers of vertebrate flight, pterosaurs had strong and lightweight skeletons that ranged widely in size, with some boasting wingspans of more than 30 feet. The largest pterosaurs weighed more than 650 pounds and had jaws twice the length of <em>Tyrannosaurus rex. </em></p>\n<p>Unlike birds, which jump into the air using only their hind limbs, pterosaurs used their exceptionally strong hind limbs and forelimbs to push off the ground and gain enough launch power for flight.

When she is three years old, Sophie's parents buy her a smart doll that uses facial recognition and artificial intelligence (AI) to watch, listen to, and learn from her.</p>\n<p>Like many children, Sophie will come to love this toy. And like previous generations of children with a favorite doll or teddy bear, she will carry it around with her, talk with it, and sleep with it beside her for many years.</p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p>If the smart doll is designed responsibly, this toy could be her best friend; if not, it will be a surveillance tool that records her every move and word spoken in its presence by her, her friends, and even her parents.</p>\n<p>Smart toys use AI to learn about the child user and personalize the play or learning experience for them. They can learn a child's favourite colour, song, and learn to recognize that child and other familiar people in that child's life. While this may sound futuristic, there are many smart toys that already provide these capabilities. The market for these toys is rapidly expanding and will grow to <a href=\"https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/smart-toy-revenues-grow-almost-200pc-by-2023\" target=\"_blank\">$18 billion</a> by 2023.</p>\n<p>To address this urgent use of AI, the World Economic Forum recently launched the <a href=\"https://www.smarttoyawards.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Toy Awards</a> to recognize ethically and responsibly designed AI-powered toys that create an innovative and healthy play experience for children.</p>\n<p>Smart toys provide enormous promise for children. They can customize learning based on data they gather about children; they can teach computer programming skills to children; and they can help children with disabilities develop cognitive, motor, and social skills.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, smart toys provide large potential risks if they are not designed to protect children's data, safety, and cybersecurity.</p>\n<h2>A cautionary tale</h2>\n<p>The example of Sophie's smart doll is not far-fetched. In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/05/generation-ai-what-happens-when-your-childs-invisible-friend-is-an-ai-toy-that-talks-back/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">My Friend Cayla</a> – an early smart toy that used facial and voice recognition – was declared an illegal surveillance tool in many countries.</p>\n<p>If the Cayla doll was connected to a phone, data was sent to the manufacturer and a third-party company for processing and storage. And anyone with the My Friend Cayla app on their phone within 30 feet of a toy could access the toy and listen to the child user.</p>\n<p>Germany issued a \"<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-issues-kill-order-for-a-domestic-spycayla-the-toy-doll-1492098755\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">kill order</a>\" for the doll and required parents to destroy it \"with a hammer.\" Today, the only surviving Cayla dolls in Germany reside in the Spy Museum in Berlin.</p>\n<h2>The risks posed by smart toys</h2>\n<p>Sophie applies to college when she is 18 years old. If her smart doll had collected data on her from the age of 3 to 9, the company who built the toy could know her better than her parents. Without adequate data protections, the company could also sell this data to the colleges to which she is applying or other third parties.</p>\n<p>After college, Sophie applies to a job. If the employer bought data gathered on Sophie as a child, they could learn about her strengths and weaknesses. What if Sophie bullied her younger sister, yelled at her parents, or refused to do her homework as a child? All these actions conducted in the privacy of the family's home could be known by the company and sold to third parties who could use this information to discriminate against Sophie. The family's life is no longer private.</p>\n<p>Today, data is gold but gathering data on children is inherently problematic. As a company gathers data about children through Sophie's doll, they may have a responsibility to act or intervene. Imagine that Sophie tells her doll about suicidal thoughts and self-harm. Should the company be required to alert the parents and call 911?</p>\n<p>The more data that a smart toy gathers the more complex scenarios smart toy companies will likely face. Every company designing a smart toy with the capabilities to gather this information must consider these worst-case scenarios as they develop toys to protect the safety of the child user and those around them.</p>\n<h2>Developing responsible and ethical smart toys</h2>\n<p>Despite these significant risks, ethical and responsible smart toys <em>are</em> being developed. The <a href=\"https://www.smarttoyawards.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Toy Awards</a> have developed <a href=\"https://www.smarttoyawards.org/learn-more.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">four key governance criteria</a> for companies developing AI-powered toys: data privacy and cybersecurity; accessibility and transparency; age appropriateness; and healthy play.</p>\n<p>Sophie's smart doll illustrates the importance of strong data privacy and clearly communicating to adults buying the toy what the smart doll does and how it operates. This must be communicated in the Terms of Service in language understandable by non-technologically literate audiences. At minimum, Smart Toys should meet <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">COPPA</a> requirements in the US and <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GDPR</a> in the EU.</p>\n<p>Parents and guardians should understand with whom children's data is being shared and for what purpose. Companies should empower parents, guardians, and children to make their own decisions about how children's data is being used. And companies should not sell children's data to third parties.</p>\n<p>Data privacy is a foundation for ethical and responsible smart toys, but they must also be designed to be accessible, transparent, age appropriate, and promote healthy play and children's mental health.</p>\n<h2>The future of childhood</h2>\n<p>Sophie's doll doesn't necessarily pose concern for her and her parents, and data collected on her won't hinder her future if the data is carefully protected. In the EU, GDPR provides the <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">right to be forgotten</a>, and a similar policy could allow children like Sophie to request that all data collected on them as children by their smart toys be deleted when they turn 18 years old, so they would have a fresh start as they begin adulthood.</p>\n<p>Sophie and all children should have a fair shot at childhood, education, careers, and life. The data collected on them as children should not be used to discriminate against them in the future.</p>\n<p>Smart toys like Sophie's doll can play a pivotal role in childhoods, catalyzing creativity and critical thinking skills. Many companies are developing smart toys with careful consideration for ethics and responsibility. We urge companies to adopt our <a href=\"https://www.smarttoyawards.org/learn-more.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">governance criteria</a> as they're designing and developing smart toys.</p>\n<p>Childhood is a sacred time and parents will do everything they can to protect their children's experiences. This won't be possible unless stakeholders work together across the private, public, and nonprofit sectors to develop ethical, responsible, and innovative smart toys that protect and foster the essence of childhood.</p>\n<p>Reprinted with permission of the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">World Economic Forum</a>.

This virus, which coincidentally appeared in late 2019 and began to concern veterinarians in early 2020, is not related to the virus which causes COVID-19, but can make your four-legged friend feel quite ill.</p>\n<h2>Novel coronavirus in dogs</h2>\n<p>The term \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\"><u>coronavirus</u></a>\" doesn't refer to a single disease, but a family of viruses (more formally, <em>Coronaviridae</em>) that share a shape similar to a crown (hence the name, \"corona\"). They infect many different kinds of animals and cause various diseases from COVID-19 and SARS to the common cold.</p>\n<p>This new coronavirus, a variant of canine enteric coronavirus, was first noticed in January 2020 when a veterinarian in the United Kingdom treated \"an unusually high number\" of dogs with severe vomiting and other gastrointestinal issues at his office. Concerned about this spike in doggy indigestion, they reached out to other veterinarians to see if they were reporting a similar outbreak.</p>\n<p>Online questionnaires were sent out to more than a thousand vets and pet owners to map the outbreak and collect information on which animals were being affected. Analysis of this data showed that nearly all of the cases involved vomiting and a loss of appetite, and half of them also involved diarrhea. Most of the cases took place in south and northwest England, though a large outbreak also occurred in and around the Scottish city of Edinburgh.</p>\n<p>The data also suggested that male dogs in contact with other dogs were most likely to be infected, hinting at \"either transmission between dogs or a common environmental source.\" The dogs recovered in more than 99 percent of cases.</p>\n<p>Hoping to move beyond the questionnaire, the authors also turned to records to piece together what happened.</p>\n<p>While public health data for animals is less frequently gathered than it is for humans, electronic records of pet admissions to veterinarian offices and pet insurance payouts do exist. The researchers accessed these records and found that the number of dogs recorded with stomach problems rose between December 2019 and March 2020, with nearly double the number of expected cases occurring during that time. There was also a concomitant rise in prescriptions for drugs to treat those conditions.</p>\n<p>A later comparison of samples from dogs that were sick and healthy control dogs confirmed the presence of the novel coronavirus in the ill dogs. All of this was later compiled into a<a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/2/20-2452_article\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>study</u></a> that was recently published in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>, which is produced by the CDC.</p>\n<h2>Should I be concerned?</h2>\n<div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\">\n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4qEqesmUWio\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>This coronavirus only affects dogs, and the researchers didn't find anything to suggest that humans could become infected. </p>\n<p>However, the scale of the outbreak and the lack of tools immediately available to determine what was happening led the researchers to suggest that better organization is needed.

This program allows Alaska residents who qualify for dividends from the Alaska Permanent Fund, a yearly payment ranging from $800 to $2000 in recent years, to donate a portion of it to various in-state non-profit organizations.</p>\n<p>The researchers randomly assigned households to either a control group or to receive a postcard in the mail encouraging them to donate a portion of their dividend to charity. That postcard could come in one of two forms, either highlighting the benefits to others or the benefits to themselves.</p>\n<p>Those who got the postcard touting self-benefits were 6.6 percent more likely to give than those in the control group and gave 23 percent more on average. Those getting the benefits-to-others postcard were slightly more likely to give than those receiving no postcard, but their donations were no larger.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the researchers were able to break the subject list down into a \"warm list\" of those who had given at least once before in the last two years and a \"cold list\" of those who had not. Those on the warm list, who were already giving, saw only minor increases in their likelihood to donate after getting a postcard in the mail compared to those on the cold list. </p>\n<p>Additionally, the researchers found that warm-list subjects who received the self-interest postcard gave 11 percent more than warm-list subjects in the control group. Amazingly, among cold-list subjects, those who received a self-interest postcard gave 39 percent more.</p>\n<p>These are substantial improvements. At the end of the study, the authors point out, \"If we had sent the benefits to self message to all households in the state, aggregate contributions would have increased by nearly US$600,000.\"</p>\n<p>To put this into perspective, in 2017 the <a href=\"https://www.pickclickgive.org/about-pick-click-give/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>total donations</u></a> to the program were roughly $2,700,000.</p>\n<h2>Is altruism dead?</h2>\n<div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\">\n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xn8o3h-B4vU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Are all actions inherently self-interested? Thankfully, no. The study focuses entirely on effective ways to increase charitable donations above levels that currently exist. It doesn't deny that some people are giving out of pure altruism, but rather that an appeal based on self-interest is effective. Plenty of people were giving before this study took place who didn't need a postcard as encouragement. It is also possible that some people donated part of their dividend check to a charity that does not work with Pick.Click.Give and were uncounted here. </p>\n<p>It is also important to note that Pick.Click.Give does not provide services but instead gives money to a wide variety of organizations that do. Those organizations operate in fields from animal rescue to job training to public broadcasting. The authors note that it is possible that a more specific appeal to the benefits others will receive from a donation might prove more effective than the generic and all-inclusive \"Make Alaska Better For Everyone\" appeal that they used.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world, charity is its own reward.

Flexibility at these connections is a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820836117\" target=\"_blank\">major driver of learning and memory</a>, but things can go wrong if it isn't tightly regulated. For example, in people, too much plasticity at the wrong time is linked to brain disorders such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.040\" target=\"_blank\">epilepsy</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(00)81109-5\" target=\"_blank\">Alzheimer's disease</a>. Additionally, reduced levels of the two neuroplasticity-controlling proteins we identified are linked to increased susceptibility to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2018.00470\" target=\"_blank\">autism</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-00944-8\" target=\"_blank\">schizophrenia</a>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in our fruit flies, removing the cellular brakes on plasticity permanently impaired their crawling behavior. While fruit flies are of course different from humans, their brains work in very similar ways to the human brain and can offer valuable insight.</p>\n<p>One obvious benefit of discovering the effect of these proteins is the potential to treat some neurological diseases.

These control movements like <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13064-018-0103-z\" target=\"_blank\">crawling</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.903400311\" target=\"_blank\">flying</a> in fruit flies. To figure out how astrocytes controlled neuroplasticity, we used genetic tools to turn off specific proteins in the astrocytes one by one and then measured the effect on motor neuron structure. We found that astrocytes and motor neurons communicate with one another using a specific pair of proteins called neuroligins and neurexins. These proteins essentially function as an off button for <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03441-2\" target=\"_blank\">motor neuron plasticity</a>.</p>\n<h2>What still isn't known</h2>\n<p>My team discovered that two proteins can control neuroplasticity, but we don't know how these cues from astrocytes cause neurons to lose their ability to change.</p>\n<p>Additionally, researchers still know very little about why neuroplasticity is so strong in younger animals and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820836117\" target=\"_blank\">relatively weak in adulthood</a>. In our study, we showed that prolonging plasticity beyond development can sometimes be <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03441-2\" target=\"_blank\">harmful to behavior</a>, but we don't yet know why that is, either. </p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>I want to explore why longer periods of neuroplasticity can be harmful. Fruit flies are great study organisms for this research because it is very easy to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1567\" target=\"_blank\">modify the neural connections in their brains</a>. In my team's next project, we hope to determine how changes in neuroplasticity during development can lead to long–term changes in behavior.</p>\n<p>There is so much more work to be done, but our research is a first step toward treatments that use astrocytes to influence how neurons change in the mature brain. If researchers can understand the basic mechanisms that control neuroplasticity, they will be one step closer to developing therapies to treat a variety of neurological disorders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/sarah-degenova-ackerman-1223343\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah DeGenova Ackerman</a>, Postdoctoral Fellow, UO Institute of Neuroscience and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-oregon-811\" target=\"_blank\">University of Oregon</a></em></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

Under these conditions, a strong greenhouse gas effect means there will be no water on the exoplanet's surface. When hit by ultraviolet (UV) light, water vapor in the upper atmosphere can occasionally split into hydrogen and oxygen. The lighter hydrogen gas escapes into space, leaving the heavier oxygen gas behind. </p>\n<p>In the second scenario, an exoplanet \"waterworld\" contains anywhere from 10 to 230 times as much water as the Earth has today. Under these conditions, the<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/61080/oxygen-cycle/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>oxygen cycle</u></a> — which involves the circulation of oxygen through the atmosphere, lifeforms, and rocks — essentially doesn't exist. Pressure from the massive oceans on the crust would shut down the geological activity necessary to recycle oxygen, leaving it in the atmosphere. </p>\n<p>In the third scenario, an exoplanet \"desertworld\" has conditions exactly the opposite of those in the \"waterworld.\" This type of exoplanet has very little water, no more than a third of what Earth has in its oceans. Under these conditions, the molten surface of a young exoplanet can freeze while the limited water supply is still found only as steam (vapor) in the atmosphere. This prevents oxygen from being absorbed by the crust. Then, as with the first scenario, UV light breaks up water into hydrogen and oxygen.</p>\n<h2>Implications for the hunt for E.T.</h2>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"b80ad392243f4f953b89bd0db7737892\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA2NzgwOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MzU3NDI5Mn0.-dAf49ZSF1yAW9U_b2s0yXcv8SeOBkMbplg0X2XqxHk/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1080\" id=\"5ef94\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201440%201080'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1440\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">An infographic illustratingthe three planets described above and how they might form.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Illustration by J.

The reluctance we see in some to get the COVID vaccine is greater amongst those <a href=\"https://www.counterhate.com/post/covid-vaccine-polling-reveals-links-to-age-race-and-political-values\" target=\"_blank\">who rely on social media rather than traditional media</a> for their information. In a pandemic, lies cost lives, and it has felt like a new conspiracy theory has sprung up online every day.</p>\n<p>How we, as social media users, behave in response to misinformation can either enable or prevent it from being seen and believed by more people.</p>\n<h2>The rules are different online</h2>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"129bff11476fa4c625187585b2b51287\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA4MjU4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NTY3NDI1OX0.djePvXKIvgGZ9FHTzXmv1w7dbHtMqHn-npfRQArgKV4/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"2333\" id=\"9324b\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/coronavirus/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%203500%202333'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"3500\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/dr-doreen-brown-receives-the-first-of-two-pfizer-biontech-news-photo/1230008516?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: Pool via Getty Images</small></p>\n<p>If a colleague mentions in the office that Bill Gates planned the pandemic, or a friend at dinner tells the table that the COVID vaccine could make them infertile, the right thing to do is often to challenge their claims. We don't want anyone to be left believing these falsehoods.</p>\n<p>But digital is different. The rules of physics online are not the same as they are in the offline world. We need new solutions for the problems we face online.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine that in order to reply to your friend, you must first hand him a megaphone so that everyone within a five-block radius can hear what he has to say. It would do more damage than good, but this is essentially what we do when we engage with misinformation online.</p>\n<p>Think about misinformation as being like the coronavirus — when we engage with it, we help to spread it to everyone else with whom we come into contact. If a public figure with a large following responds to a post containing misinformation, they ensure the post is seen by hundreds of thousands or even millions of people with one click. Social media algorithms also push content into more users' newsfeeds if it appears to be engaging, so lots of interactions from users with relatively small followings can still have unintended negative consequences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n The trend of people celebrating and posting photos of themselves or loved ones receiving the vaccine has been far more effective than any attempt to disprove a baseless claim about Bill Gates or 5G mobile technology. \n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, whereas we know our friend from the office or dinner, most of the misinformation we see online will come from strangers. They often will be from one of two groups — true believers, whose minds are made up, and professional propagandists, who <a href=\"https://www.counterhate.com/anti-vaxx-industry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">profit</a> from building large audiences online and selling them products (including false cures). Both of these groups use trolling tactics, that is, seeking to trigger people to respond in anger, thus helping them reach new audiences and thereby gaming the algorithm.</p>\n<p>On the day the COVID vaccine was approved in the UK, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheOndrakGuy/status/1334096126304247810\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">anti-vaccine activists were able to provoke pro-vaccine voices into posting about thalidomide</a>, exposing new audiences to a reason to distrust the medical establishment. Those who spread misinformation understand the rules of the game online; it's time those of us on the side of enlightenment values of truth and science did too.</p>\n<h2>How to fight online misinformation</h2>\n<p>Of course, it is much easier for social media companies to take on this issue than for us citizens. Research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate and Anti-Vax Watch last month found that <a href=\"https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">65% of anti-vaccine content on social media is linked to just twelve individuals</a> and their organizations. Were the platforms to simply remove the accounts of these superspreaders, it would do a huge amount to reduce harmful misinformation.</p>\n<p>The problem is that social media platforms are resistant to do so. These businesses have been built by constantly increasing the amount of time users spend on their platforms. Getting rid of the creators of engaging content that has millions of people hooked is antithetical to the business model. It will require intervention from governments to force tech companies to finally protect their users and society as a whole.</p>\n<p>So, what can the rest of us do, while we await state regulation?</p>\n<p>Instead of engaging, we should be outweighing the bad with the good. Every time you see a piece of harmful misinformation, share advice or information from a trusted source, like the WHO or BBC, on the same subject. The trend of people celebrating and posting photos of themselves or loved ones receiving the vaccine has been far more effective than any attempt to disprove a baseless claim about Bill Gates or 5G mobile technology. In the attention economy that governs tech platforms, drowning out is a better strategy than rebuttal.</p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p><em>Imran Ahmed is CEO of the <a href=\"https://www.counterhate.com/our-people\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Countering Digital Hate</a>.</em></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/fjZGq3uGUqg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA4MjU1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxOTMzOTUzM30.gT8JLMF10uYAuAeTbIplDenaOzReVdy2yKUJPG0zLqo/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C142%2C0%2C172&height=700","linkMd5":"84c4b024462199484cab6edb77b07f76","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn80@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-38-17-479_dd5f6b53372f3aaa.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":19336,"destBytes":19336,"author":"Imran Ahmed","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA4MjU1Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxOTMzOTUzM30.gT8JLMF10uYAuAeTbIplDenaOzReVdy2yKUJPG0zLqo/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C142%2C0%2C172&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn80@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-38-17-479_dd5f6b53372f3aaa.webp","https://bigthink.com/coronavirus/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%203500%202333'%3E%3C/svg%3E":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/fjZGq3uGUqg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn19@2020_4/2021/04/23/17-38-18-385_da71279a1cef6b21.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199333839},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","title":"Study: Tripping might not be required for psychedelic therapy","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/tripping-not-required","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3NzM5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MjYyNjc5OX0.C3NJM4JMHvINXnok5LtUBXEiXjmr4mQC6wWC0Dgj0Ps/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;height=700\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\">\n <li>A phase 2 clinical trial by Imperial College London found psilocybin to be as effective at treating depression as escitalopram, a commonly prescribed antidepressant.</li>\n <li><span></span>A different study by the University of Maryland showed that blocking the hallucinogenic effects of magic mushrooms in mice did not reduce the antidepressant effect.</li>\n <li>Combined, these studies could lead to new ways of applying psychedelics to patient populations that don't want to trip.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Due to stigma, their illegal status and difficulty in finding control groups, research with psychedelics has been a challenge.

The escitalopram (control) group received six weeks of daily escitalopram in addition to two tiny (1-mg) doses of psilocybin — a dose so low that it is unlikely to produce hallucinogenic effects. The psilocybin (experimental) group received two 25-mg doses of psilocybin three weeks apart with placebo given on all the other days.<br /></p>\n<p>At the end of the study, both groups saw a decrease in depressive symptoms, though the results were not statistically significant. (That isn't necessarily bad because if the two drugs have similar effects, then they would <em>not</em> produce statistically significant results. Still, a larger study is needed to confirm that psilocybin is \"just as good as\" escitalopram.) </p>\n<p>Additionally, several other outcomes favored psilocybin over escitalopram. For instance, 57 percent in the psilocybin group saw a remission of symptoms compared to 28 percent in the escitalopram group. This result was significant.</p>\n<h3>Psychedelics without tripping</h3>\n<p>As psychedelics become decriminalized and potentially legalized for therapeutic use, however, a large population of people might desire the antidepressant effects without the hallucinations. For example, the psychedelic ibogaine may be useful for treating addiction, so the company Mindmed is developing an analog that works without producing the unwanted hallucinogenic side effects.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/118/17/e2022489118\" target=\"_blank\">new research article</a>, published in the journal <em>PNAS</em>, investigated the antidepressant effects of psilocybin on a group of chronically stressed mice. (Under immense stress, mice develop something resembling human depression.) As with humans, depressed mice lose a sense of joy, which can be assessed by determining their preference for sugar water over tap water. Normal mice prefer sugar water, but depressed mice simply don't care. </p>\n<p>Once the mice were no longer juicing up on the sweetened water, the team dosed them with psilocybin alongside a drug called ketanserin, a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonist that eliminates psychedelic effects. Within 24 hours of receiving the dose, the mice were rushing back to the sugar water, indicating that tripping is not necessary for psilocybin to work as an antidepressant.</p>\n<p>While the team is excited about these results, they realize it needs to be replicated in a different population. </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"The possibility of combining psychedelic compounds and a 5-HT2AR antagonist offers a potential means to increase their acceptance and clinical utility and should be studied in human depression.\"</p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-16x9\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"67646a3e32ead0208a81b6b5e56f63c9\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3NzQwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNDk5MDEzNH0.VIFu1Fyp6hWfG51kbOMAi7u3dWAG5Sw5Hn0sjmLG940/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C188%2C0%2C17&amp;height=700\" height=\"700\" id=\"e6d07\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201245%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1245\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Photo: Cannabis_Pic / Adobe Stock</small></p>\n<h3>The future of psychedelic therapy<br /></h3>\n<p>Psychedelics such as psilocybin and LSD have a long track record of efficacy in clinical trials and anecdotal experiences. Almost all volunteers of the famous <a href=\"http://buquad.com/2013/02/18/remembering-the-marsh-chapel-experiment/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marsh Chapel experiment</a> claimed their experience on Good Friday in 1962 was one of the most significant events of their lives — and this was a quarter-century after the fact. A <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-017-4771-x\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more recent, controlled study</a> found that a single dose of psilocybin showed antidepressant effects six months later. </p>\n<p>Proponents of macrodosing and ritualistic experiences sometimes argue that the full-blown mystical trip <em>is</em> the therapy, though this is anecdotal, not clinical research. As the Maryland team noted, a number of people are contraindicated for psychedelics, whether through a family history of schizophrenia or current antidepressant treatments. </p>\n<p>Senior author Scott Thompson is excited for future research on this topic. As <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/uoms-pem041321.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> of his team's findings:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"The psychedelic experience is incredibly powerful and can be life-changing, but that could be too much for some people or not appropriate… These findings show that activation of the receptor causing the psychedelic effect isn't absolutely required for the antidepressant benefits, at least in mice.\"</p>\n<p>Hopefully, with more research occurring in psychedelics than even in the 1950s (when studies predominantly relied on anecdotal evidence and little government support), the longstanding stigmatization of psychedelics is beginning to recede. This could open up new possibilities for both clinical research and, for those curious about the ritual effects, a continuation of introspective experiences.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p><em>Stay in touch with Derek on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/derekberes\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.

My team is one of several working within the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, located in an elegant town house in Queen Square in London. The basement of our building houses large machines for brain imaging, and each group in the Centre uses this technology to study how different aspects of the mind and brain work: how we see, hear, remember, speak, make decisions, and so on. The students and postdocs in my lab focus on the brain's capacity for self-awareness. I find it a remarkable fact that something unique about our biology has allowed the human brain to turn its thoughts on itself.</p>\n<p>Until quite recently, however, this all seemed like nonsense. As the nineteenth-century French philosopher Auguste Comte put it: \"The thinking individual cannot cut himself in two — one of the parts reasoning, while the other is looking on. Since in this case the organ observed and the observing organ are identical, how could any observation be made?\" In other words, how can the same brain turn its thoughts upon itself?</p>\n<p>Comte's argument chimed with scientific thinking at the time. After the Enlightenment dawned on Europe, an increasingly popular view was that self-awareness was special and not something that could be studied using the tools of science. Western philosophers were instead using self-reflection as a philosophical tool, much as mathematicians use algebra in the pursuit of new mathematical truths. René Descartes relied on self-reflection in this way to reach his famous conclusion, \"I think, therefore I am,\" noting along the way that \"I know clearly that there is nothing that can be perceived by me more easily or more clearly than my own mind.\" Descartes proposed that a central soul was the seat of thought and reason, commanding our bodies to act on our behalf. The soul could not be split in two — it just was. Self-awareness was therefore mysterious and indefinable, and off-limits to science.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d42c844ad828aa444fbf1222a25f9160\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3Nzk5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzk2MzUyNX0.XiSSigDo8Um14aFlYlRv0zUxtXGuaydaDPy09CfsD7o/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"3712\" id=\"8ab99\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%205568%203712'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"5568\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/picture-of-a-human-brain-taken-by-a-positron-emission-news-photo/1079950976?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Credit</a>: <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;photographer=FRED+TANNEAU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FRED TANNEAU</a> via Getty Images</small></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>We now know that the premise of Comte's worry is false. The human brain is not a single, indivisible organ. Instead, the brain is made up of billions of small components — neurons — that each crackle with electrical activity and participate in a wiring diagram of mind-boggling complexity. Out of the interactions among these cells, our entire mental life — our thoughts and feelings, hopes and dreams — flickers in and out of existence. But rather than being a meaningless tangle of connections with no discernible structure, this wiring diagram also has a broader architecture that divides the brain into distinct regions, each engaged in specialized computations. Just as a map of a city need not include individual houses to be useful, we can obtain a rough overview of how different areas of the human brain are working together at the scale of regions rather than individual brain cells. Some areas of the cortex are closer to the inputs (such as the eyes) and others are further up the processing chain. For instance, some regions are primarily involved in seeing (the visual cortex, at the back of the brain), others in processing sounds (the auditory cortex), while others are involved in storing and retrieving memories (such as the hippocampus).</p>\n<p>In a reply to Comte in 1865, the British philosopher John Stuart Mill anticipated the idea that self-awareness might also depend on the interaction of processes operating within a single brain and was thus a legitimate target of scientific study. Now, thanks to the advent of powerful brain imaging technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we know that when we self-reflect, particular brain networks indeed crackle into life and that damage or disease to these same networks can lead to devastating impairments of self-awareness.</p>\n<p>I often think that if we were not so thoroughly familiar with our own capacity for self-awareness, we would be gobsmacked that the brain is able to pull off this marvelous conjuring trick. Imagine for a moment that you are a scientist on a mission to study new life-forms found on a distant planet. Biologists back on Earth are clamoring to know what they're made of and what makes them tick. But no one suggests just asking them! And yet a Martian landing on Earth, after learning a bit of English or Spanish or French, could do just that. The Martians might be stunned to find that we can already tell them something about what it is like to remember, dream, laugh, cry, or feel elated or regretful — all by virtue of being self-aware.</p>\n<blockquote>\n I find it a remarkable fact that something unique about our biology has allowed the human brain to turn its thoughts on itself.\n</blockquote>\n<p>But self-awareness did not just evolve to allow us to tell each other (and potential Martian visitors) about our thoughts and feelings. Instead, being self-aware is central to how we experience the world. We not only perceive our surroundings; we can also reflect on the beauty of a sunset, wonder whether our vision is blurred, and ask whether our senses are being fooled by illusions or magic tricks. We not only make decisions about whether to take a new job or whom to marry; we can also reflect on whether we made a good or bad choice. We not only recall childhood memories; we can also question whether these memories might be mistaken.</p>\n<p>Self-awareness also enables us to understand that other people have minds like ours. Being self-aware allows me to ask, \"How does this seem to me?\" and, equally importantly, \"How will this seem to someone else?\" Literary novels would become meaningless if we lost the ability to think about the minds of others and compare their experiences to our own. Without self-awareness, there would be no organized education. We would not know who needs to learn or whether we have the capacity to teach them. The writer Vladimir Nabokov elegantly captured this idea that self-awareness is a catalyst for human flourishing:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Being aware of being aware of being. In other words, if I not only know that I am but also know that I know it, then I belong to the human species. All the rest follow s— the glory of thought, poetry, a vision of the universe. In that respect, the gap between ape and man is immeasurably greater than the one between amoeba and ape.\"</p>\n<p>In light of these myriad benefits, it's not surprising that cultivating accurate self-awareness has long been considered a wise and noble goal. In Plato's dialogue <em>Charmides</em>, Socrates has just returned from fighting in the Peloponnesian War. On his way home, he asks a local boy, Charmides, if he has worked out the meaning of sophrosyne — the Greek word for temperance or moderation, and the essence of a life well lived. After a long debate, the boy's cousin Critias suggests that the key to sophrosyne is simple: self-awareness. Socrates sums up his argument: \"Then the wise or temperate man, and he only, will know himself, and be able to examine what he knows or does not know…No other person will be able to do this.\"</p>\n<p>Likewise, the ancient Greeks were urged to \"know thyself\" by a prominent inscription carved into the stone of the Temple of Delphi. For them, self-awareness was a work in progress and something to be striven toward. This view persisted into medieval religious traditions: for instance, the Italian priest and philosopher Saint Thomas Aquinas suggested that while God knows Himself by default, we need to put in time and effort to know our own minds. Aquinas and his monks spent long hours engaged in silent contemplation.

The founder of Chinese Taoism, Lao Tzu, captured this idea that gaining self-awareness is one of the highest pursuits when he wrote, \"To know that one does not know is best; Not to know but to believe that one knows is a disease.\"</p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p>Today, there is a plethora of websites, blogs, and self-help books that encourage us to \"find ourselves\" and become more self-aware. The sentiment is well meant. But while we are often urged to have better self-awareness, little attention is paid to how self-awareness actually works. I find this odd. It would be strange to encourage people to fix their cars without knowing how the engine worked, or to go to the gym without knowing which muscles to exercise. This book aims to fill this gap. I don't pretend to give pithy advice or quotes to put on a poster. Instead, I aim to provide a guide to the building blocks of self-awareness, drawing on the latest research from psychology, computer science, and neuroscience. By understanding how self-awareness works, I aim to put us in a position to answer the Athenian call to use it better.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/AGxYmLKBlmg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3Nzk4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMDc5MzQ4OH0.9US6XRjm_6aDnzlqPHizuJdZUSe43zZLgUiC6eqH2dg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C45%2C0%2C356&height=700","linkMd5":"d1d56d14d9c26909365b722e65b15f2c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn61@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-38-17-451_9f12e11e90be70c3.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":60602,"destBytes":60602,"author":"Stephen Fleming","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3Nzk4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMDc5MzQ4OH0.9US6XRjm_6aDnzlqPHizuJdZUSe43zZLgUiC6eqH2dg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C45%2C0%2C356&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn61@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-38-17-451_9f12e11e90be70c3.webp","https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%205568%203712'%3E%3C/svg%3E":null,"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%203000%202000'%3E%3C/svg%3E":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/AGxYmLKBlmg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn100@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-38-18-397_0854d1cdd85584a7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199333837},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","title":"Brain mapping: explained","link":"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/brain-mapping","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA2NDU4NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MTM5MzMzM30.TR3eYwlW-XRV4nj3RZl6f1Gskst5Eco2kNmAH-E-XR8/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;height=700\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\">\n <li>Brain mapping is an attempt to identify the location of everything in the brain.</li>\n <li><span></span>An accurate map of the brain would immeasurably enhance our ability to understand how it works.</li>\n <li>The project is massive, involving multiple fields of biomedical research and expensive cutting-edge technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p> Brain mapping is one of the hottest current areas of research. <br /> </p>\n<p> The brain is nothing short of amazing.

For instance, what is the biological mechanism that encodes memories? On a computer, files are encoded digitally with a series of ones and zeroes, a type of discrete storage. Cassette tapes are analog recordings, and information is stored magnetically. How does the brain store information? <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/05/21/142804/does-the-brain-store-information-in-discrete-or-analog-form/\" target=\"_blank\">We don't know</a>.

But those tiny (in brain terms) pieces of information have not led neuroscientists to the big picture: what we mean by human consciousness, what makes us our individual selves or why some people develop psychiatric disorders. Neuroscientists need to be able to join the dots — and there are a lot of dots.\"</em> </p>\n<p> As intimidating as this is, neuroscience is making incremental progress.

The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4892319/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">jury's still out</a> on this type of brain mapping. </p>\n<h2>What kind of map could map the brain?</h2>\n<p> A brain map, therefore, could be something like an atlas — a collection of maps that document various neural pathways. But, unlike a road map, it can't be two-dimensional. A brain map of the cortex alone would have to be three-dimensional. </p>\n<blockquote>\n The number of interconnections, or synapses, across which neurons communicate via chemical and electrical signals is believed to be about \n <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101117121803.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">125 trillion</a>. \n</blockquote>\n<p> The cortex, or gray matter, which contains billions of neurons and synapses is <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/62892-why-brains-have-folds.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">folded</a> in such a way that sections that would be distant from each other come into close proximity.

He raises three concerns:<br /> </p>\n<ol class=\"ee-ol\"> \n <li><strong>Maps have always betrayed the bias of their creators.</strong> Even neural cartographers will inevitably develop maps that depict the brain according to their understanding of its workings. At the same time, it's exciting to imagine breakthroughs that could occur should a map unexpectedly not conform to its makers expectations.</li> \n <li><strong>One size does not fit all.</strong> Scientists strongly suspect each brain is at least somewhat unique. To construct brain maps that encompass differences between us, researchers will have to engage in some generalizing that will inevitably reduce their accuracy as it enhances their universality.</li> \n <li><strong>Financial considerations make the requisite collaboration between scientists and institutions difficult. </strong>The hardware and expertise required mean that brain mapping will be costly. However, for those who discover new medical treatments or technologies along the way, the endeavor could prove profitable. Thus, some will no doubt feel that they have financial incentives not to share information.</li> \n</ol>\n<p> Ultimately, La Monica's third consideration touches upon what may be the human brain mapping's biggest underlying challenge. As <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/neurology/brain-mapping\" target=\"_blank\">UCLA Health</a> notes, the project is the polar opposite of \"reductionistic approaches in medical science.\" Instead, \"brain mapping integrates many sources of information to produce a holistic view, the value of which is greater than the sum of its parts.\" </p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"brain mapping\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"27277cabe351c5283958730268136a95\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA2NDU5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzI4NzEyMH0.5dc_3Ytmh75IPHAFQcrXDuoBunTk5MuBYsICUpltarw/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"900\" id=\"90a4a\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201440%20900'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1440\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/206290892/gerasimov174?load_type=author&amp;prev_url=detail\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">gerasimov174</a> / Adobe Stock</small> </p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n <img alt=\"brain mapping\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"7763ebe8fcfce7d695e03eabca4d6acf\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA2NDU5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzI4NzEyMH0.5dc_3Ytmh75IPHAFQcrXDuoBunTk5MuBYsICUpltarw/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"900\" id=\"90a4a\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201440%20900'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1440\" />\n</div>\n<p> This will demand an unprecedented level of collaboration and cooperation between organizations and scientists from a broad swath of scientific disciplines. </p>\n<h2>Brain mapping for the win</h2>\n<p> There is almost nothing about mapping the human brain that will be easy.

What if you could play it purely with your mind? Given how immersive chess is, can you imagine leaving the physical world behind and truly entering a mind palace? </p>\n<h2>A game of the mind</h2>\n<p>It turns out a number of researchers have had such a vision. In a paper published in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8856965\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>IEEE Xplore</em></a>, German professors David Hubner, Albrecht Schall, and Michael Tangermann discuss the evolution of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) as applied to two-player chess games. Incredibly, 96 percent of moves were correct — and most errors were technical issues that they believe can be fixed. </p>\n<p>Chess is played by an estimated <a href=\"https://www.chess.com/news/view/how-popular-is-chess-8306\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">605 million people</a> around the world. While face-to-face interactions will always be an integral component of the intimacy of chess, the game was adopted early on the internet. The ability to play at a distance increased its popularity and accessibility as players found suitable opponents across the planet.</p>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-16x9\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"df90f15eca6deebfa4e4c92e1240d8c9\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1MzUxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1OTQ1ODkwN30.GlT6Vbi0_iKjeDBlQgh_1YwZYD9DyGmzKjV3dojcqPw/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C732%2C0%2C205&amp;height=700\" height=\"700\" id=\"673f9\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201245%20700'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1245\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Photo: Anusorn / Adobe Stock</small></p>\n<p>The BCI is based on a two-step process: first, identifying the piece a player wants to move, then moving it on the board. In this study, six players used a BCI chess application (which was based on an open-source Java app) along with an electroencephalogram (EEG) equipped with 31 passive electrodes that detected the chess piece and board position in the player's mind.<br /></p>\n<p>Before the game, each player performed predefined chess moves to calibrate the BCI. During play, they also had a predefined amount of time for thinking about their next move. Specifically, they were given 15 seconds to consider the piece that they were going to move and five seconds to \"move\" the piece. If the player only had one possible move, the BCI automatically executed it. </p>\n<h2>Hands-free chess has real-world applications</h2>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p>Beyond the excitement of controlling a computer with your mind, the researchers recognize a variety of potential applications. For instance, BCI games aid in cognitive training and help motor-impaired people express themselves. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p><em>Stay in touch with Derek on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/derekberes\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.

Yes, the father of the nation, he who could tell no lie. Even under POTUS #1, there was corruption so venal and egregious that it changed the very map of America. In other words, without the Yazoo Land Scandal, the political geography of the United States might have looked quite different. Yet despite its catchy name and far-reaching consequences, few now remember the affair.</p> \n<p>The scandal centered on Georgia, the last holdout in the process of state cessions. Of the original 13 colonies-turned-states, seven had entered into the Union with vague, contested, and often overlapping land claims, mainly in the region between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River.</p> \n<p>The six states without claims did not want to be overshadowed by their expanding neighbors. And the federal government did not want them to get into fights where their claims overlapped. So the U.S. government spent its first few years convincing and cajoling those seven states to abandon their claims. When New York relinquished its claim to Vermont in 1790 (for a mere $30,000), that process was complete. With one exception.</p> \n<p><strong>Yazoo Land Fraud</strong></p> \n<p>Georgia continued to claim territory all the way to the Mississippi River. For various reasons, the state was loath to give up its interest in these so-called Yazoo Lands, corresponding to the larger part of the present-day states of Mississippi and Alabama. Not least because of money. Land developers were eager to acquire large chunks of the country, their guiding principle being: bribe high, pay low.</p> \n<p>In 1794, four companies, set up especially for the purpose, paid half a million dollars for about 40 million acres of land. Even taking into account all the bribes — another half a million — that was a ridiculously low amount: four acres to a dollar.</p> \n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8a60b452782c82cb9c441e6fbdadcf33\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1ODgzMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxOTMyNzgxOX0.yC0LtpqFy2UZqdWgMzo25v8NXcwRH2pLQinLldLX9xI/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"600\" id=\"13933\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"800\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\" spellcheck=\"false\">Following the Rescinding Act, Georgia's governor and legislators burn all copies of the Yazoo Act (except one).</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/yazoo-land-fraud\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">New Georgia Encyclopedia</a> via public domain</small></p> \n<p>Infuriated by the deal, Georgians booted out the legislators who had their palms greased to approve the Yazoo Act, by which Georgia had sold all that land on the cheap. In 1795, a new state legislature voted a Rescinding Act, overturning the sale. All extant copies of the original Act were collected and burned at high noon on the grounds of the state capitol under construction, then in Louisville. (One copy escaped destruction — the one sent to President Washington).<br /></p> \n<p><strong>The Yazoo hits the fan</strong></p> \n<p>But that was far from the end of the unpleasantries. In fact, this is where the actual scandal started. For the land companies did not admit defeat. They continued printing bonds that were being traded and sold on the financial markets of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, raking in tidy profits.</p> \n<p>Thousands of bond buyers acquired a stake in the Yazoo Lands. Eventually, though, the market smelled a rat. Investors started to worry: had they thrown away their money on a fraudulent land scheme?</p> \n<p>Georgia paid back some of the duped buyers, but unable to handle the escalating scale of the scandal, the state eventually did surrender its claims to the Yazoo Lands to the federal government. Under the so-called Compact of 1802, the U.S. paid Georgia $1.25 million, took over any remaining liability for the Yazoo Lands, and promised to rid Georgia of any remaining Native American land claims.</p> \n<p>So, the duped investors could now sue the federal government instead of Georgia. The land companies, for their part, wanted the U.S. to uphold their claims, which they continued to consider legal and valid. Who was right?</p> \n<p>In 1810, the case reached the highest court in the land. Pronouncing on <em>Fletcher v. Peck</em>, the Supreme Court ruled that the Rescinding Act was unconstitutional and the original land deals remained legal. For although those deals were corrupt and not in the best interest of Georgians, the contracts were made by the Georgia legislature, which had the authority to do so. The Supreme Court ordered the U.S. government to pay out $4.5 million in compensation to the claimants.</p> \n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"b604eeefe5c47a246cc9d6c8ece149e9\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1ODgzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMTcwMjgyMH0.dd9D9-GOMW4dPkRqe7Pc8_SACtOt2wrU4bNYFs67_vQ/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1461\" id=\"2412b\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201208%201461'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1208\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\" spellcheck=\"false\">Overview of the four separate Yazoo Act land deals that together constitute 40 million acres of land, sold for just $1 million (including bribes).</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/yazoo-land-fraud\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">New Georgia Encyclopedia</a> via public domain</small></p> \n<p><strong>Yazoo changed the course of American history</strong><br /></p> \n<p><em>Fletcher v. Peck</em> was a landmark case in more ways than one. For the first time ever, the Supreme Court had ruled against a state law, that is, Georgia's Rescinding Act. This established the principle that federal laws were supreme over state laws. The case also firmly established that a legal contract could not be nullified by a later law, which became an important principle in contract law.</p> \n<p>The Yazoo Land Scandal had two further, major consequences for the United States. Without the scandal, Georgia might conceivably have managed to hold on to its western lands. This hypothetical Greater Georgia, running from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, would have comprised most or all of the current states of Mississippi and Alabama. That would make it one of America's most populous states, its 20 million inhabitants on par with Florida and New York and surpassed only by Texas (30 million) and California (40 million).</p> \n<p>Georgia could also have avoided one of the most ignominious events in its history. In 1830, the federal government fulfilled its promise in the Compact of 1802 to rid Georgia of all extant Native American land claims by the Indian Removal Act. Signed into law by President Andrew Jackson, the Act led to the \"Trail of Tears,\" the forcible removal of the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Seminole, and Chickasaw tribes — about 100,000 people in all — to reservations west of the Mississippi, in what would later become Oklahoma.</p> \n<p>Although now largely forgotten, the Yazoo Land Scandal helped shape the territory, laws, and institutions of the early United States. But the affair has another lesson for our times. If there are no good old days, then our current ones perhaps aren't so bad either.</p> \n<p><strong>Strange Maps #1079</strong></p> \n<p><em>Got a strange map?

A rampaging pandemic, dangerous political instability, weather catastrophes, and a profound change in lifestyle that most have never experienced or imagined. </p>\n<p>But was it the worst year ever? </p>\n<p>Nope. Not even close. In the eyes of the historian and archaeologist Michael McCormick, the absolute \"worst year to be alive\" was 536.</p>\n<p>Why was 536 so bad? You could certainly argue that 1918, the last year of World War I when the Spanish Flu killed up to 100 million people around the world, was a terrible year by all accounts. 1349 could also be considered on this morbid list as the year when the Black Death wiped out half of Europe, with up to 20 million dead from the plague. Most of the years of World War II could probably lay claim to the \"worst year\" title as well. But 536 was in a category of its own, argues the historian.</p>\n<p><strong>It all began with an eruption...</strong></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/michael-mccormick\" target=\"_blank\">McCormick</a>, Professor of Medieval History at Harvard University, 536 was the precursor year to one of the worst periods of human history. It featured a volcanic eruption early in the year that took place in Iceland, as established by a study of a Swiss glacier carried out by McCormick and the glaciologist Paul Mayewski from the Climate Change Institute of The University of Maine (UM) in Orono.</p>\n<p>The ash spewed out by the volcano likely led to a fog that brought an 18-month-long stretch of daytime darkness across Europe, the Middle East, and portions of Asia. As <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/11/why-536-was-worst-year-be-alive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> the Byzantine historian Procopius, \"For the sun gave forth its light without brightness, like the moon, during the whole year.\" He also recounted that it looked like the sun was always in eclipse.</p>\n<p>Cassiodorus, a Roman politician of that time, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=LRhwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392&amp;dq=%22we+marvel+to+see+no+shadows+of+our+bodies+at+noon%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f2r9-3sIC0&amp;sig=sqedxRKc7JepUErZJH8doFJ5jRE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGiaCQufreAhVJh-AKHS_vDhwQ6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22we%20marvel%20to%20see%20no%20shadows%20of%20our%20bodies%20at%20noon%22&amp;f=false\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> that the sun had a \"bluish\" color, the moon had no luster, and \"seasons seem to be all jumbled up together.\" What's even creepier, he described, \"We marvel to see no shadows of our bodies at noon.\"</p>\n<p><strong>...that led to famine...</strong></p>\n<p>The dark days also brought a period of coldness, with summer temperatures falling by 1.5° C. to 2.5° C. This started the coldest decade in the past 2300 years, <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/11/why-536-was-worst-year-be-alive\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> <em>Science</em>, leading to the devastation of crops and worldwide hunger.</p>\n<p><strong>...and the fall of an empire</strong></p>\n<p>In 541, the bubonic plague added considerably to the world's misery. Spreading from the Roman port of Pelusium in Egypt, the so-called Plague of Justinian caused the deaths of up to one half of the population of the eastern Roman Empire. This, in turn, sped up its eventual collapse, writes McCormick.</p>\n<p>Between the environmental cataclysms, with massive volcanic eruptions also in 540 and 547, and the devastation brought on by the plague, Europe was in for an economic downturn for nearly all of the next century, until 640 when silver mining gave it a boost.</p>\n<p><strong>Was that the worst time in history?</strong> </p>\n<p>Of course, the absolute worst time in history depends on who you were and where you lived. </p>\n<p>Native Americans can easily point to 1520, when smallpox, brought over by the Spanish, killed millions of indigenous people.

Among other things, the researchers showed that their clothes can actually <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0hoh7coh5wx3w9e/AABt4A08vFyty4j9_hBrQ6j-a?dl=0&amp;preview=SupplementaryVideo5.mp4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">determine things like if someone is sitting, walking, or doing particular poses</a>.</p>\n<p>The group from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) says that their clothes could be used for athletic training and rehabilitation. With patients' permission, they could even help passively monitor the health of residents in assisted-care facilities and determine if, for example, someone has fallen or is unconscious. <em> </em></p>\n<p>The researchers have developed a range of prototypes, from socks and gloves to a full vest. The team's \"tactile electronics\" use a mix of more typical textile fibers alongside a small amount of custom-made functional fibers that sense pressure from the person wearing the garment.</p>\n<p>According to CSAIL graduate student Yiyue Luo, a key advantage of the team's design is that, unlike many existing wearable electronics, theirs can be incorporated into traditional large-scale clothing production. The machine-knitted tactile textiles are soft, stretchable, breathable, and can take a wide range of forms. </p>\n<p>\"Traditionally it's been hard to develop a mass-production wearable that provides high-accuracy data across a large number of sensors,\" says Luo, lead author on a new paper about the project that is appearing in this month's edition of <em>Nature Electronics</em>. \"When you manufacture lots of sensor arrays, some of them will not work and some of them will work worse than others, so we developed a self-correcting mechanism that uses a self-supervised machine learning algorithm to recognize and adjust when certain sensors in the design are off-base.\"</p>\n<p>The team's clothes have a range of capabilities. Their socks predict motion by looking at how different sequences of tactile footprints correlate to different poses as the user transitions from one pose to another. The full-sized vest can also detect the wearers' pose, activity, and the texture of the contacted surfaces.</p>\n<p>The authors imagine a coach using the sensor to analyze people's postures and give suggestions on improvement. It could also be used by an experienced athlete to record their posture so that beginners can learn from them. In the long term, they even imagine that robots could be trained to learn how to do different activities using data from the wearables. </p>\n<p>\"Imagine robots that are no longer tactilely blind, and that have 'skins' that can provide tactile sensing just like we have as humans,\" says corresponding author Wan Shou, a postdoc at CSAIL. \"Clothing with high-resolution tactile sensing opens up a lot of exciting new application areas for researchers to explore in the years to come.\"</p>\n<p>The paper was co-written by MIT professors Antonio Torralba, Wojciech Matusik, and Tomás Palacios, alongside PhD students Yunzhu Li, Pratyusha Sharma, and Beichen Li; postdoc Kui Wu; and research engineer Michael Foshey. </p>\n<p>The work was partially funded by Toyota Research Institute.</p>\n<p>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT News</a>.

If and when all projects on this map are up and running, Europe will have a battery cell production capacity of around 700 gigawatt hours (GWh). That's crucial for two reasons: (1) those battery cells will power the electric vehicles (EVs) that will soon replace our fossil-fuel cars; and (2) a production capacity of that magnitude would break China's current near-monopoly.<br /></p> \n<p><span></span>Say what you will about state-run economies, but they're great at concentrating effort on a particular target. About a decade ago, Beijing directed huge resources towards its photovoltaic industry. Today, <a href=\"http://solarindustryforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Izumi_PVIndustryTrends_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">nine of the world's 10 largest solar panel manufacturers are at least partly Chinese</a>. China is similarly resolved to become the global leader in EVs, including EV battery production.</p> \n<p><span></span>And so far, it's working. At present, about 80% of the world's lithium-ion battery cells are made in China. Lithium-ion batteries are the ones used in EVs. In sufficient numbers, lithium-ion batteries can also be used for large-scale energy storage, which would help even out power supply fluctuations from sources like solar and wind.</p> \n<p><span></span>China's dominance in this area is making many outside China nervous. In previous decades, OPEC had a similar stranglehold on producing the oil that makes cars run and factories hum. Then the organization had a political point to make and turned off the tap. During the oil crisis of the 1970s, oil prices skyrocketed and economies crashed.</p> \n<p><strong><span></span>Battery wars</strong></p> \n<p>Avoiding a 21st-century version of that scenario requires a strategy for EV battery self-sufficiency, and Europe has one. In 2018, the EU launched its Battery Action Plan, a concerted effort to increase its battery production capacity. Realizing they couldn't beat China on price, the Europeans resolved that their batteries would be greener and more efficient.</p> \n<p>Easier said than done. Setting up battery production is complex, expensive, and slow. And as the EU's woefully slow vaccine rollout demonstrates, the organization's strength-in-numbers argument doesn't always work in its favor. Indeed, by 2020, only four of the dots on this map were up and running: </p> \n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"> \n <li>a facility by Envision AESC in Sunderland (UK - now ex EU)</li> \n <li>a Samsung factory in Göd (Hungary)</li> \n <li>an LG Energy Solution plant in Wroclaw (Poland)</li> \n <li>a factory by Leclanché in Willstätt (Germany)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>But in this case, slow and steady may win the race. At least two dozen battery plants are in the works across Europe (i.e. EU and its near abroad), and four of those should come online in 2021 alone, including Tesla's plant near Berlin. Tesla, incidentally, coined the term \"gigafactory\" for its facility in Sparks, Nevada. As the title of this map suggests, it's becoming the generic description for any large battery cell production facility. </p> \n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"4a44f6a35d77c5362f0eba89e35122d2\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA4NTkxNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTU2MzcxNX0.b6KXBpWdKmNQ66t2374Ng8oiZSpNYtHUMBTylZn1iUQ/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"3316\" id=\"43d1e\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"4096\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">By the end of the decade, Europe will have around 30 gigafactories.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: <a href=\"https://cicenergigune.com/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CIC energiGUNE</a></small></p> \n<p>Despite the fact that Tesla's Nevada plant is on its way to becoming <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/03/we-went-inside-teslas-gigafactory-heres-what-it-looked-like.html\" target=\"_blank\">the world's largest building</a>, battery production capacity is growing fastest in Europe. Predictions vary, but all observers agree that Europe is on the verge of a Great Leap Forward. Here's why:<br /></p> \n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"> \n <li>Europe's current production capacity is about 30 GWh.</li> \n <li>One forecast puts that figure at 300 GWh by 2029, another even at 400 GWh by 2025.</li> \n <li>Adding up the maximum capacity of all facilities on this map comes close to 700 GWh by 2028.</li> \n <li>In terms of global capacity, BloombergNEF predicts Europe's share could increase from 7% now to 31% in 2030. </li> \n <li>According to <a href=\"https://www.eurobat.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Eurobat</a> — disappointingly, not the Gauloises-smoking, Nietzsche-quoting counterpart to Batman — the value of the battery industry will increase from €15 ($18) billion in Europe and €75 ($90) billion worldwide in 2019 to €35 ($42) billion in Europe and €130 ($156) billion worldwide by 2030.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>So, who will be Europe's answer to CATL (short for Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd.), China's main battery manufacturer? There are several pretenders to the crown. Here are some:</p> \n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"> \n <li>Britishvolt, set to go online with Britain's first and largest gigafactory in Northumberland (UK) in 2023, with a maximum capacity of 35 GWh per annum. </li> \n <li>Northvolt, led by former Tesla execs, supported by the Swedish government and the European Investment Bank. Also funded by Volkswagen and Goldman Sachs. Aims to be green and big. One plant coming online in Sweden this year, another in Germany in 2024. Combined maximum capacity is 64 GWh. </li> \n <li>Tesla. Not content with its one gigafactory (40 GWh) opening this year, the company has already announced that it will build a second plant in Europe.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>That second plant is not yet on the map. Also missing are the half dozen gigafactories that Volkswagen aims to open in the coming years. If Europe is to become self-sufficient in EV batteries, even more will be needed.</p> \n<p><strong>Europe's path to battery supremacy</strong></p> \n<p>In 2020, 1.3 million EVs were sold in Europe, edging past China to become the world's largest EV market. In 2021, Europe looks set to maintain that lead. By 2025 at the latest, EVs <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/electric-cars-reach-price-parity-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">will have achieved price parity</a> with fossil-fuel vehicles, not just in terms of total cost of operation but also in upfront cost.</p> \n<p>Add to that the increasingly hostile environment — namely, higher taxes and stricter regulations — to fossil-fuel cars in Europe, and the pace of electrification will increase dramatically by mid-decade. Going by EU requirements for CO2 emissions alone, the EV share of the total vehicle market would need to be between 60% and 70% pretty soon.</p> \n<p>While that may seem an impossibly high target today, things could start looking different very soon. Volkswagen aims to have full-electric cars make up <a href=\"https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/vw-brand-will-accelerate-electric-vehicle-shift\" target=\"_blank\">more than 70 percent of its European sales</a> by 2030. Volvo and Ford even aim to present entirely electric lineups by 2030 at the latest. And that year is also when the UK government intends to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2020/11/18/britains-accelerated-ice-vehicle-sales-ban-aims-to-speed-co2-progress-with-unintended-consequences/?sh=465906421ffa\" target=\"_blank\">ban the sale</a> of new fossil-fuel cars.</p> \n<p>All of which could translate into base demand for EV batteries in Europe as high as 1,200 GWh by 2040. Even with all planned factories on the map running at maximum capacity, that still leaves a production capacity gap of about 40%.</p> \n<p>To avoid batteries becoming a bottleneck for electrification, the EU likely will pour even more money into the industry via the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\" target=\"_blank\">European Green Deal</a> and Europe's post-COVID recovery plan. Battery production is not just strategically sound; it also boosts employment.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://deinenergieportal.de/?p=12892\" target=\"_blank\">A study by Fraunhofer ISI</a> says for each GWh added in battery production capacity, count on 40 jobs added directly and 200 in upstream industries. The study forecasts battery manufacturing could generate up to 155,000 jobs across Europe by 2033 (although it doesn't mention how many would be lost due to reduced production of fossil-fuel cars).</p> \n<p><strong>Coming to America</strong></p> \n<p>And how fares America? Electrification is coming to the U.S. as well. By <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/20/lithium-ev-battery-forecasts-for-europe-us-china-2025-2030-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">one estimate</a>, EVs will have a market penetration of about 15% by 2025. Deloitte <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2021/04/20/lithium-ev-battery-forecasts-for-europe-us-china-2025-2030-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">predicts</a> EVs will take up 27% of new car sales in the US by 2030. The Biden administration is keen to make up for past inaction in terms of switching to post-fossil energy. But it has its work cut out.</p> \n<p>Apart from Tesla's Gigafactory, the U.S. has only two other battery production facilities. If current trends continue, there would be just ten by 2030. At that time, China will have 140 battery factories and Europe, according to this map, close to 30. If U.S. production can't keep up with demand, electrification will suffer from the dreaded battery bottleneck.

But for a 58-year-old guy who didn't start playing until about ten years ago, this bifurcation explains why so many people miss what is truly revolutionary in these revolutionary technologies. I find myself spending a lot of time explaining to my non-gamer friends (both young and old) that in the midst of all the alien shooters, battle royales, and side-scrolling melee fighters — FYI, these are game genres — there lies a radically potent new method for storytelling. And it's storytelling that provides one path by which a great video game can become great art. To illustrate this point, let me introduce <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p>\n<p>Released during COVID-19, <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> (TLOU2) tells a story in a world fallen to a pandemic. The subject matter certainly seems timely, but by itself, that doesn't mean much. Post-apocalyptic pandemic video games are a dime a dozen. There are a zillion titles out there that will let you spend 20 or 30 hours of game time mowing down zombies of one form or another while upgrading your weapons, health, and skills.</p>\n<h2>The sublime art of TLOU2</h2>\n<p>Now, don't get me wrong. The mowing down of zombies and the upgrading of skills common to many video games are just fine. Not every game has to be great art, just like not every movie you watch or novel you read has to be great art. There is, most definitely, a place in this world for mindless escape, entertainment, and fun. That's because — if you are into it — sneaking around some last-outpost-of-humanity while trying to take out dangerous zombies can be a delicious waste of time at the end of a hard day. But with TLOU2, there is all that and more. </p>\n<blockquote>\n The creators of TLOU2 take players on a difficult, exhausting journey through the consequences of violence.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given the \"Part II\" in its title, TLOU2 is obviously the continuation of a story laid down in <em>The Last of Us</em>. That game followed Joel, a survival-hardened middle-aged smuggler who's been tasked with shepherding teenaged Ellie across the country 20 years after the pandemic outbreak. Ellie is immune to the infection that turns people into zombies. Joel is given his mission by a resistance group that hopes to use Ellie to find a final cure. The journey of Ellie and Joel (who lost his own teenaged daughter two decades earlier in the outbreak) is harrowing and makes <em>The Last of Us</em> almost universally recognized as one of the greatest video games ever made. I've written <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/04/28/402741863/why-video-games-matter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">before</a> about how TLOU's innovative use of game-playing mechanics redefined what was possible for storytelling. In TLOU2, creator Naughty Dog Studio manages to make lightning strike twice, finding an entirely new path to transformative innovation.</p>\n<p><u>Warning</u>!

The story is set in motion with the brutal murder of Joel as Ellie is forced to watch. It's an act of vengeance, a retribution for Joel's own choices at the end of the first game. So, what does TLOU2 do to make this game rise above a thousand other stories of vengeance and retribution? The answer lies in the most basic mechanics of game play: perspective.</p>\n<p>When you play a video game like TLOU2, you take on the role of the character. This means you literally take control of their actions, seeing through their eyes (or over their shoulder) as you navigate them through the world and the story. This is where the digital technologies of video games take storytelling into new domains. In the hands of lesser creators, the possibilities of that power are lost, and you just get another ho-hum shooter with a weak story. That's not what happens in TLOU2.</p>\n<p>The first half of the game follows Ellie as she tracks down Joel's killer and seeks her own vengeance. Her quarry is Abby, the daughter of a doctor that Joel killed at the end of the first game. Abby is now part of a paramilitary group in Seattle, and you, playing as Ellie, must work your way through the city to find her over the course of three days. Using stealth and combat, fighting both the infected (really terrifying zombies) and Abby's compatriots, the effort is unnerving and exhausting. Unlike most games, TLOU2 does not let you off the hook in its depiction of violence. The brutality of what you are doing cannot be avoided. Characters struggle for their lives and call to each other by name if you take one down. They are friends, and <em>you</em> are the one ending that friendship forever.</p>\n<h2>The big plot twist</h2>\n<p>Which you <em>are</em> doing because, in a stunning design choice, TLOU2 switches that all-important perspective on you right in the middle of the game. With an impressive narrative mechanism, the clock gets reset to three days earlier, and you are now Abby, greeting one friend after another at the stadium that serves as the paramilitary group's base of operations. You get breakfast at the commissary and chat with folks in the line. You check out gear for the upcoming patrol and take responsibility for a playful guard dog named Alice. </p>\n<p>As you move Abby through these often intimate interactions, you come to realize that these are all the people that you just murdered (including the dog) in the first half of the game when you were Ellie. It's a terrible, harrowing shift that colors the rest of the game as it goes on to unpack deeper issues about the strictures of our tribalism, our capacities for choice, and the possibilities of forgiveness. In the end, I was just blown away. </p>\n<p>What matters for our discussion today is that the immense power of TLOU2 — namely, its ability to haunt me months after I finished the game — is due to the medium. Yes, a novel or film can force a change in perspective and that can be arresting. But it's the immersion, the agency, and the appearance of choice (even if limited) in video games that radically shifts the experience of perspective in a story. And in that shift comes a transcendence, a reframing, and a learning that are all the reasons why we turn to art. Ultimately, one reason we create art, one reason we participate in art, is an effort to learn something. Through it, we hope to find something deeper, something <em>more</em> about this mystery of being human. </p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p>That is what TLOU2 accomplishes. Through the medium of video games, the creators of TLOU2 take players on a difficult, exhausting journey through the consequences of violence. Given that medium's usual careless treatment of violence, making such a journey possible was not a small thing. It was revealing, and that is what we can, and should, ask from true art.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ti5V8Kmg-T8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1MjcwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MzE1OTI5MH0.WQ9TvKV1OwGx-uZgCgfGC5V-8odN3iNtGwxj98v93_c/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"8714549b4ee889f36057d57727501904","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn26@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-38-17-456_dfd84ef804deef9b.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":51414,"destBytes":51414,"author":"Adam Frank","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA1MjcwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MzE1OTI5MH0.WQ9TvKV1OwGx-uZgCgfGC5V-8odN3iNtGwxj98v93_c/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn26@2020_6/2021/04/23/17-38-17-456_dfd84ef804deef9b.webp","https://bigthink.com/13-8/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202000%201125'%3E%3C/svg%3E":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ti5V8Kmg-T8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn32@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-38-18-412_72c17476fa597a3b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199333842},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","title":"Does science tell the truth?","link":"https://bigthink.com/13-8/science-what-is-truth","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3NzMxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1ODUzOTkxNn0.5uhRd-1X4Ea4eiBU1MIpTJTdsGEyu_gf4V5s-eUob2Q/img.jpg?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;height=700\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"> \n <li>What is truth?

The answer to this question is not as simple as it seems, and my 13.8 colleague Adam Frank took a look at it in his <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/13-8/science-truth\" target=\"_self\">article</a> about the complementarity of knowledge. There are many levels of complexity to what truth is or means to a person or a community. Why?</p>\n<h2>It's complicated</h2>\n<p>First, \"truth\" itself is hard to define or even to identify. How do you know for sure that someone is telling you the truth? Do <em>you</em> always tell the truth? In groups, what may be considered true to a culture with a given set of moral values may not be true in another. Examples are easy to come by: the death penalty, abortion rights, animal rights, environmentalism, the ethics of owning weapons, etc.</p>\n<p>At the level of human relations, truth is very convoluted. Living in an age where fake news has taken center stage only corroborates this obvious fact. However, not knowing how to differentiate between what is true and what is not leads to fear, insecurity, and ultimately, to what could be called worldview servitude — the subservient adherence to a worldview proposed by someone in power. The results, as the history of the 20<sup>th</sup> century has shown extensively, can be catastrophic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n Proclamations of final or absolute truths, even in science, shouldn't be trusted. \n</blockquote>\n<p>The goal of science, at least on paper, is to arrive at the truth without recourse to any belief or moral system. Science aims to go beyond the human mess so as to be value-free. The premise here is that Nature doesn't have a moral dimension, and that the goal of science is to describe Nature the best possible way, to arrive at something we could call the \"absolute truth.\" The approach is a typical heir to the Enlightenment notion that it is possible to take human complications out of the equation and have an absolute objective view of the world. However, this is a tall order.</p>\n<p>It is tempting to believe that science is the best pathway to truth because, to a spectacular extent, science does triumph at many levels. You trust driving your car because the laws of mechanics and thermodynamics work. NASA scientists and engineers just managed to have the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-succeeds-in-historic-first-flight\" target=\"_blank\">Ingenuity Mars Helicopter</a> — the first man-made device to fly over another planet — hover above the Martian surface all by itself.</p>\n<p>We can use the laws of physics to describe the results of countless experiments to amazing levels of accuracy, from the magnetic properties of materials to the position of your car in traffic using GPS locators. In this restricted sense, science does tell the truth. It may not be the absolute truth about Nature, but it's certainly a kind of pragmatic, <em>functional truth</em> at which the scientific community arrives by consensus based on the shared testing of hypotheses and results.</p>\n<h2>What is truth?</h2>\n<p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"675ead3e32679738f7b28db8243586c0\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3NzMyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDcxNTQ2OH0.-1Kv3m7y-Br6YzsDj21EPfzg-CS1hfrXsItXhdKizcI/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1125\" id=\"7e191\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://bigthink.com/13-8/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202000%201125'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"2000\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: Sergey Nivens / 242235342</small></p>\n<p>But at a deeper level of scrutiny, the meaning of truth becomes intangible, and we must agree with the pre-Socratic philosopher Democritus who declared, around 400 years BCE, that \"truth is in the depths.\" (Incidentally, <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/ancient-physics-democritus-predicted-atom\" target=\"_self\">Democritus predicted</a> the existence of the atom, something that certainly exists in the depths.)<br /></p>\n<p>A look at a dictionary reinforces this view. \"Truth: the quality of being true.\" Now, that's a very circular definition. How do we know what is true? A second definition: \"Truth: a fact or belief that is accepted as true.\" <em>Acceptance</em> is key here. A belief may be accepted to be true, as is the case with religious faith. There is no need for evidence to justify a belief. But note that a fact as well can be <em>accepted</em> as true, even if belief and facts are very different things. This illustrates how the scientific community arrives at a consensus of what is true by acceptance. Sufficient factual evidence supports that a statement is true. (Note that what defines sufficient factual evidence is also accepted by consensus.) At least until we learn more.</p>\n<p>Take the example of gravity. We know that an object in free fall will hit the ground, and we can calculate when it does using Galileo's law of free fall (in the absence of friction). This is an example of \"functional truth.\" If you drop one million rocks from the same height, the same law will apply every time, corroborating the factual acceptance of a functional truth, that all objects fall to the ground at the same rate irrespective of their mass (in the absence of friction).</p>\n<p>But what if we ask, \"What is gravity?\" That's an ontological question about what gravity is and not what it does. And here things get trickier. To Galileo, it was an acceleration downward; to Newton a force between two or more massive bodies inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them; to Einstein the curvature of spacetime due to the presence of mass and/or energy. Does Einstein have the final word? Probably not.</p>\n<h2>Is there an ultimate scientific truth?</h2>\n<p>Final or absolute scientific truths assume that what we know of Nature can be final, that human knowledge can make absolute proclamations. But we know that this can't really work, for the very nature of scientific knowledge is that it is incomplete and contingent on the accuracy and depth with which we measure Nature with our instruments. The more accuracy and depth our measurements gain, the more they are able to expose the cracks in our current theories, as I illustrated last week with the <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/13-8/muons-new-particle-physics\" target=\"_self\">muon magnetic moment experiments</a>.</p>\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul>\n<p>So, we must agree with Democritus, that truth is indeed in the depths and that proclamations of final or absolute truths, even in science, shouldn't be trusted. Fortunately, for all practical purposes — flying airplanes or spaceships, measuring the properties of a particle, the rates of chemical reactions, the efficacy of vaccines, or the blood flow in your brain — functional truths do well enough.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/5SNNbrFCdQ8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3NzMxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1ODUzOTkxNn0.5uhRd-1X4Ea4eiBU1MIpTJTdsGEyu_gf4V5s-eUob2Q/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"9f438396627b606f9de734c43710e9d7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn84@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-38-17-459_d9a80e7695db705f.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":211968,"destBytes":211968,"author":"Marcelo Gleiser","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3NzMxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1ODUzOTkxNn0.5uhRd-1X4Ea4eiBU1MIpTJTdsGEyu_gf4V5s-eUob2Q/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn84@2020_3/2021/04/23/17-38-17-459_d9a80e7695db705f.webp","https://bigthink.com/13-8/data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202000%201125'%3E%3C/svg%3E":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/5SNNbrFCdQ8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn86@2020_1/2021/04/23/17-38-18-394_b0158b03b8052abc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619199333839},{"createdTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","updatedTime":"2021-04-24 01:35:33","title":"‘Hidden’ magma pools under volcanoes may pose alarming eruption threats","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/volcano-eruptions","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjA3MjE4My9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzOTIyMzg5Mn0.SfaRbBXGdC9MhnA-8S206rxx1jwDrFyqr5hhinomtLY/img.png?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C13%2C0%2C14&amp;height=700\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\">\n <li>The study analyzed magma collected from a 2009 incident in which geothermal drillers encountered magma that geophysical surveys failed to detect.</li>\n <li>Currently, magma imaging technology can't accurately detect magma pools under a certain size.</li>\n <li>Hidden magma pools pose safety concerns because magma from other sources might combine with the hidden magma, which could trigger unexpectedly explosive eruptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>In 2009, scientists with the Deep Drilling Project were drilling a mile-deep borehole into Iceland's Krafla volcanic caldera when magma suddenly began creeping into the hole.

He wrote in multiple styles, including essays, aphorisms, poems, and fiction. \n<hr />\n<p>He introduced idiosyncratic concepts such as the free spirit, the <em>Übermensch</em>, eternal recurrence, <em>ressentiment</em>, the ascetic ideal, the revaluation of values, and the affirmation of life. He shifted allegiances: writing books, for example, in support of the composer Richard Wagner and the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, but later delivering blistering critiques of both. Not surprisingly, scholars range widely in their interpretations of Nietzsche: was he a poet or a philosopher? A nihilist, moral relativist, or Nazi sympathiser? A critic or a system builder? Anti-Christian or Christian? Answers frequently depend on which portions of Nietzsche's work a reader deems most important.</p>\n<p>In the face of this complexity, Nietzsche offers an interpretive key: his references to dance (<em>Tanz</em>). Taken together, these references light a path that begins in Nietzsche's first book, <em>The</em> <em>Birth of Tragedy</em> (1872), and wends through every major work into his final book, the posthumous <em>Ecce Homo</em> (1908). These references not only link his ideas and styles, they also shed light on Nietzsche's enduring motivation: to teach readers how to affirm life here and now on Earth as human bodily selves. Nietzsche's dance references call attention to the sensory education that he insists is necessary for creating values that 'remain faithful to the Earth'.</p>\n<p>When Nietzsche wrote his first book, he was unaware of the significance that dance would have for his philosophy, in part because he was deeply enamoured with Wagner. The musician had begun composing a cycle of four operas – his now-famous <em>Ring</em> – intending to revive the tradition of Ancient Greek tragedies. In so doing, Wagner hoped to realise the power of music that Schopenhauer described: to save humans from the cravings and suffering of Will.</p>\n<p>During visits paid by Nietzsche, Wagner and his wife Cosima encouraged the younger man to write a scholarly book to justify these claims. Yet, as Nietzsche later admits, in his rush to laud Wagner (and Schopenhauer), he shortchanged one of his own insights – namely, that, in the tragedies of Ancient Greece, the dancing of the chorus was essential for ensuring that stories of madness, suffering and death nonetheless produce in spectators a rousing affirmation of life.</p>\n<p>In <em>The</em> <em>Birth of Tragedy,</em> Nietzsche analyses this paradoxical experience. He explains that the dancing and singing of the chorus move spectators to identify viscerally with what the chorus represents: elemental rhythms of an endlessly creative Nature. As they are moved by these rhythms, spectators feel joy. They know their bodily selves as members of an endlessly generative whole. And from this sensory vantage point, they are not devastated by the tragic death of their hero, god or ideal; instead, they perceive this death as a mere moment in an ongoing flow of appearances. Nietzsche calls the effect a 'magic transformation': spectators' sensations of suffering and terror yield to feelings of 'metaphysical comfort' and the notion that 'life is at the bottom of things, despite all the changes of appearances, indestructibly powerful and pleasurable'.</p>\n<p>Later, in <em>Human, All Too Human</em> (1878), Nietzsche elaborates that all human symbolism – even music – is rooted in the 'imitation of gesture' at work in ancient tragedy. He writes that the human impulse to move with others 'is older than language, and goes on involuntarily … [even] when the language of gesture is universally suppressed,' as he observed among Christians of his day. When humans don't learn how to move their bodily selves, Nietzsche insists, their senses grow dull and they lose the capacity to discern what is good for them. He asks: where are the 'Books that teach us to dance'? Here, dance assumes a role it will play throughout Nietzsche's writing as a litmus test for any value, idea, practice or person. <em>Does it dance? Does it catalyse a joyful affirmation of life?</em></p>\n<p>On the heels of <em>Human</em>, Nietzsche's poor health forced him to retire from teaching, and he began to conceive plans for writing his own tragedy – a book designed to awaken in his readers a sensory vantage point from which they might experience the death of a god – in this case, the Christian God – as good for them, and a reason to love life. A book that would teach us to dance.</p>\n<p>Nietzsche began writing his tragedy only after breaking off relations with his friends, the psychologist Paul Rée and Lou Andreas-Salomé, the woman they both loved. Nietzsche believed that he had found in Andreas-Salomé the one person who understood his quest for a radical affirmation of life. He made plans with her and Rée to live together in an intellectual society that she called their 'Unholy Trinity'. However, due primarily to suspicions planted by Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth, the trio's plans did not materialise. A despondent Nietzsche wrote to his dear friend Franz Overbeck: 'Unless I can discover the alchemical trick of turning this – muck into gold, I am lost.'</p>\n<p>Nietzsche's own 'magic transformation' appeared a month later: Part One of <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> (1883). Three more parts soon followed. In this story, Zarathustra is a man who has lived alone on a mountaintop for 10 years, and comes down to teach people how to love themselves and their humanity. All four parts are saturated with references to dance, dancers and dancing. Zarathustra is a dancer, and dance is what he admonishes others to do. As Zarathustra exhorts: 'You higher men, the worst about you is that you have not learned to dance as one must dance – dancing away over yourselves! What does it matter that you are failures? How much is still possible!' And when Zarathustra states: 'I would only believe in a god that knows how to dance,' he confirms that even our highest ideals must encourage us to affirm bodily life.</p>\n<p>After <em>Zarathustra</em>, Nietzsche continued to evoke dance as a touchstone for life-affirming values. In his critique of western European Christian morality, <em>On the</em> <em>Genealogy of Morals</em> (1887), dance appears as an activity practised by the strong to preserve their ability to digest their experiences; those who dance are not burdened by <em>ressentiment</em>, or need for revenge. They have the sensory discernment needed to resist pernicious applications of the ascetic ideal. In <em>Twilight of the Idols</em> (1889) and <em>The</em> <em>Antichrist</em> (1895), dance appears as a discipline for training sensory awareness and cultivating skills of perception and responsibility, so that one is able to participate responsibly in the creation of values, conscious of what one's movements are making.</p>\n<p>Nietzsche's ubiquitous references to dance are ever-present reminders that the work of overcoming oneself – of freeing oneself enough from anger, bitterness and despair to say 'Yes!' to life – is not just an intellectual or scientific task. An ability to affirm life demands bodily practices that discipline our minds to elemental rhythms, to the creativity of our senses, and to the 'great reason', our body, 'that does not say “I\" but does 'I\".' Only when we engage in such practices will we have the sensory awareness we need in order to discern whether the values we create and the movements we make express love for ourselves and the Earth.<img alt=\"Aeon counter – do not remove\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://metrics.aeon.co/count/13f8bc87-27dc-466a-a459-ee4d7a308320.gif\" width=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Kimerer LaMothe</p>\n<p>This article was originally published at <a href=\"https://aeon.co?utm_campaign=republished-article\" target=\"_blank\">Aeon</a> and has been republished under Creative Commons.
