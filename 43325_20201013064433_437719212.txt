Researching both the attacker’s infrastructure and tooling, we believe the nexus of the attack to be DPRK’s Kimsuky group (aka Velvet Chollima).  Kimsuky is notorious for their phishing efforts; researchers even dubbed this group the “King of Spear Phishing” in a <a href=\"https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/03/vb2019-paper-kimsuky-group-tracking-king-spearphishing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2019 VirusBulletin paper</a>. They are also believed to be behind the attacks on <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nuclear-southkorea-northkorea/south-korea-blames-north-korea-for-december-hack-on-nuclear-operator-idUSKBN0MD0GR20150317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Korea Hydro &#38; Nuclear Power in 2014</a>. The potential targets identified in this research range from journalism to civil society organizations. We suspect the activity discussed here to be part of Kimsuky’s efforts to harvest credentials for espionage purposes though we can’t rule out for certain that they aren’t other objectives.</p>\n<p>The international NGO requested that we not share the contents of the phish or point out the organization they are working with. To protect their identity we will share our findings starting from the Kimsuky nexus, which emanates from <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&#38;tl=en&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.alyac.co.kr%2F3052\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research</a> published by Korean security firm ESTSecurity on a malicious document.

Starting with a domain, we&#8217;ll look at the IP that hosts the domain and how many other domains are hosted there. In cases where very few and/or similar domains are hosted at the IP, we can assess with a reasonable level of confidence that the IP is dedicated to a single user.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_24546\" style=\"width: 811px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-24546\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-24546\" src=\"https://threatconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/ThreatConnect-Kimsuky-Phishing-Operations-Putting-In-Work-Figure-2-Domain-to-Hosted-On-IP-to-Hosts-Domains.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"801\" height=\"626\" srcset=\"https://3hyr133hoba8cg1mqt4pktdd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/ThreatConnect-Kimsuky-Phishing-Operations-Putting-In-Work-Figure-2-Domain-to-Hosted-On-IP-to-Hosts-Domains.png 1394w, https://3hyr133hoba8cg1mqt4pktdd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/ThreatConnect-Kimsuky-Phishing-Operations-Putting-In-Work-Figure-2-Domain-to-Hosted-On-IP-to-Hosts-Domains-300x235.png 300w, https://3hyr133hoba8cg1mqt4pktdd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/ThreatConnect-Kimsuky-Phishing-Operations-Putting-In-Work-Figure-2-Domain-to-Hosted-On-IP-to-Hosts-Domains-1030x805.png 1030w, https://3hyr133hoba8cg1mqt4pktdd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/ThreatConnect-Kimsuky-Phishing-Operations-Putting-In-Work-Figure-2-Domain-to-Hosted-On-IP-to-Hosts-Domains-768x601.png 768w, https://3hyr133hoba8cg1mqt4pktdd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/ThreatConnect-Kimsuky-Phishing-Operations-Putting-In-Work-Figure-2-Domain-to-Hosted-On-IP-to-Hosts-Domains-450x352.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-24546\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Figure 2: Domain to Hosted On IP to Hosts Domains</p></div>\n<p>The second primary technique used is pivoting off of similar subdomain values which use reasonably unique strings. Think of this as searching on the beginning or middle of a multilevel domain name. Using login.un-phish.bad[.]com as a contrived example we’d search on login.un-phish.* to see what other domains this subdomain was used under. The trick here is not searching on a common string. Subdomain inspection can also hint at the activity behind the domain or even who might be targeted. For example, seeing a URL starting with login suggests that the URL is being used to harvest credentials. Finally, while infrastructure hunting may seem more like an art than a science; remember to always look for additional data points like registrar or hosting information to corroborate the results.</p>\n<p>VirusTotal (VT) provides additional information on the malicious document. Here we are looking for any In The Wild (ITW) file origin URLs listed. These URLs sometimes show IPs or domains that  served up the file. VT returns this ITW file origin URL:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hxxp://onedrive.sslport[.]work/share/file/interview%20with%20a%20north%20korean%20defector.doc (</span><a

domains and subdomains in this article and mapping it to a timeline, we can see the continuous efforts Kimsuky is going through to gather credentials.  The activity covered here, according to DomainTool’s Iris, goes back as far as December of 2019 and is as recent as August of this year.</p>\n      <div class=\"iframe-wrapper\" style=\"margin: 20px auto; width: 743px; height: 819px; position: relative;\">\n          <iframe style=\"position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://threatconnect.com/tables/kimsuky/figure12.html\"></iframe>\n      </div>\n    \n<h2>Potential Targets Uncovered</h2>\n<p>Based on the identified subdomains, the following organizations are possible targets of this campaign, or their likeness was spoofed in targeting other organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amani Africa</li>\n<li>Radio Free Asia</li>\n<li>American Enterprise Institute</li>\n<li>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these, Korean Studies Institute at George Washington University didn’t have a subdomain that was indicative of them being targeted; however, they were still found via infrastructure pivoting along with a public report of them being targeted.  For the rest, we acknowledge that the subdomains used could be indicative of the target; they could also be used to go after third parties that might trust those organizations.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>ThreatConnect believes that Kimsuky will continue to target journalism and civil society organizations, particularly those focusing on North Korean issues.  Organizations reporting on North Korea human rights violations or working with North Korean defectors need to remain especially vigilant of phishing attacks that take advantage of the information sharing culture they are part of.  Be wary of any link and/or attachment, especially those asking for credentials, and enable two factor authentication to mitigate actors’ access with compromised credentials.</p>\n<h2>Appendix</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/incident/incident.xhtml?incident=4101914816#/\"
