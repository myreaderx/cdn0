The quality of the audio experience is too easy to overlook, but if your audio is bad, then you're just not going to enjoy yourself as much. Regardless of your budget, spending on the wrong headset for you is a waste.</p> \n     <p>The first thing you should consider is just what type of PC gaming you do most. If you're a regular competitive shooter player, for example, you're going to have different preferences compared to someone who plays sports games. The former would look for good directional audio capabilities, while the latter can get away without a lot of it.</p> \n     <p>It's also worth considering how you want to connect to your PC. Wired has many advantages over wireless, not least that you don't have to worry about battery life. However, it's also not as convenient as having no cables dangling from your head, especially if you don't sit incredibly close to your PC. If you also want to play on a console as well as PC, wired becomes a much easier solution to live with.</p> \n     <p>There's also the little matter of the microphone. While this doesn't directly benefit your experience, your gaming buddies will thank you a whole lot if your voice is loud enough, clear, and free of background noise. Harmony among your team is well worth it! There's also the matter of a detachable microphone if you, for example, plan to use your headset as a regular pair of headphones. Retractable would be a bare minimum in this case, but detachable is best.</p> \n     <hr> \n      <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Alpha-Leatherette-HX-HSCAS-BK/dp/B081D8TPZZ?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40843YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-pc-gaming-headsets\" title=\"Best PC Gaming Headset 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/hyper-x-cloud-alpha-blackout-sehero-1.jpg\" /></a></p> \n      <h2 id=\"hyperx\">2.

They're among the best in the business, and <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-hyperx-headsets\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">we've recommended plenty</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/hyperx-cloud-alpha-s-blackout-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">HyperX Cloud Alpha S Blackout</a> is almost the same as the lower-priced Cloud Alpha, but with the addition of a mixer remote that delivers <strong>7.1 surround sound</strong> and a new \"Blackout\" color scheme. It costs a little more, but it's worth it.</p> \n      <p>The Cloud Alpha S Blackout sports a sturdy aluminum frame with replaceable ear cups, and you can choose between leatherette or foam. Regardless of which you opt for, both options are <strong>comfortable for even longer gaming sessions</strong>. Utilizing dual 50mm drivers and HyperX's \"dual-chamber\" design, you'll be able to enjoy music and in-game effects without the headset muddying the highs and lows.</p> \n      <p>The <strong>bass is pretty punchy</strong>, too, and you can control it by using physical switches on each earcup to set your desired level. Overall, the audio quality, especially given this mid-tier price for gaming headsets, is amazing.

And that starts with being comfortable to wear for long periods, and the BlackShark V2 is about the lightest headset you'll ever put around your ears. Paired with large memory foam cushions and breathable flowknit fabric, you can wear it for up to 14 hours at a time without feeling any fatigue.</p> \n       <p>Sound quality is also essential, and that starts with superb passive noise cancellation provided by creating a tight seal around your ears. Inside, Razer's all-new TriForce driver has dedicated tuning for highs, mids, and lows, ensuring best-in-class clarity and volume. The microphone has also been given some upgrades, with a new focused pickup pattern that rejects more sound than ever before from the back and sides.</p> \n       <p>The party piece is the THX Spatial Audio, which in conjunction with the dedicated game profiles created by THX in partnership with game developers, helps deliver either an immersive or a competitive edge.

As we found in our <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/razer-nari-ultimate-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Razer Nari Ultimate review</a>, the haptic feedback isn't a gimmick. But its implementation, like a vibration in controllers, may still be better excluded in competitive scenarios.</p> \n        <p>Furthermore, the haptics won't play perfectly with some titles out of the box, though tweaking various game settings usually does the trick. While the Nari Ultimate has support for a wide variety of platforms, the best experience is to be had by PC gamers with access to Razer's Synapse companion application to tune it properly. When running on a PC and playing titles with full support for the onboard haptics vibration technology, you'll have an experience <strong>unlike anything else</strong> around today.</p> \n        <p>While the Razer Nari Ultimate sells an unusual proposition, its <strong>HyperSense haptics</strong> aren't only fun; they make immersive games <strong>even more impactful</strong>. Paired with excellent audio, high build quality, and considerable flexibility via software, this headset is an ideal companion for any PC gamer.</p> \n        <p>While you're certain to appreciate the impressive audio quality, you may find wireless over USB a little restrictive, particularly with laptops.

It does precisely what the marketing states, allowing you to utilize audio tuning to gain the upper hand in shooters while enjoying <strong>ultimate comfort</strong> for long sessions. Best of all, if you're looking to go completely wire-free, this is the best PC gaming headset to get.</p> \n          <p>It's the little things Turtle Beach added that set this headset apart from the rest. It's easy to spot the small touches that show it <strong>cared about the design</strong>, like the dongle that stops flashing after a short while when not in use. The software is also pretty good, which is not something we can say for all PC accessory makers. You can fine-tune the Elite Atlas Aero to your liking.</p> \n          <p>The <strong>battery life</strong> is also really good, especially so if you happen to play for more than a couple of hours. It's not all amazing, however. There are a few things that might frustrate. The volume dials are just... weird. There's limited wireless versatility in that it's only worthwhile for PC gaming, so you can't double up and use it this way with your console, either.</p> \n          <p>It's also a little on the pricey side, but Turtle Beach headsets are known for quality, and that's precisely what you're getting here.</p> \n          <div class=\"rows left collection\"> \n           <h3 class=\"product reco-block\">Turtle Beach Elite Atlas Aero</h3> \n           <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-pc-gaming-headsets\" title=\"Best PC Gaming Headset 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/01/turtle-beach-elite-atlas-aero-se.jpg\" /></a></p> \n           <p>For what it lacks in versatility, it makes up for with big sound, all-day battery life, and rock-solid build quality.

However, the Xbox version does have built-in support for Microsoft's Xbox Wireless protocols. However, this does all mean you get excellent audio without being tethered to one single device.</p> \n           <p>If you don't want to use the dongle, there's a 3.5mm cable that can be used. As well as this cable, SteelSeries includes a <strong>USB-A to USB-C converter</strong> for the dongle, and USB-A to micro USB cable to charge the headset itself. For the design, it's very much an Arctis headset. The only significant difference between the Arctis 1 and other headsets from SteelSeries is the lack of a ski-band.</p> \n           <p>This is a bit of a bummer, but understandable given the price of the Arctis 1. It's still a <strong>comfortable headset</strong> to use, just not as comfy as, say, the Arctis Pro. There's also the microphone, which is a little underwhelming, but so long as you're not planning to start streaming, you should be good to go.</p> \n           <div class=\"rows left collection\"> \n            <h3 class=\"product reco-block\">SteelSeries Arctis 1 Xbox</h3> \n            <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-pc-gaming-headsets\" title=\"Best PC Gaming Headset 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/05/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-xbox-cyberpunk-2077-edition-cropped.jpg\" /></a></p> \n            <p>Whether you're an Xbox, Switch, or PC gamer, the Arctis 1 is a headset you can take with you everywhere thanks to its lossless wireless quality and awesome sound drivers.</p> \n            <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-Console/dp/B086M4DQ7R?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU40843YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop no-alt-cta norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$100 at Amazon</a></p> \n            <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU40843YYr%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fsteelseries-arctis-1-wireless-stereo-gaming-headset-for-xbox-one-windows-10-and-android-with-detachable-clearcast-microphone-black%252F6414381.p%253FskuId%253D6414381&amp;token=ieosWBom\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop no-alt-cta norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$100 at Best Buy</a></p> \n            <p class=\"end\"><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048247%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUwpUdUnU40843YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fwork%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fapd%2Fab024736&amp;token=X9ogZ5pT\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop no-alt-cta norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$99 at Dell</a></p> \n           </div> \n           <hr> \n            <h2>What about all the other PC gaming headsets?</h2> \n            <p>Shopping for the best PC gaming headset will involve checking out a host of products on the market today from brands you've heard of and brands you haven't, including those not mentioned here.

Do you want a wireless option, or is wireless fine for you? Do you need the absolute best in sound quality for competitive play (that way, you can hear all those footsteps and which direction they might be coming from), or are you alright with a budget headset with solid sound for general play?</p> \n             <p>There's plenty more to factor in, too, even if you limit your search to gaming headsets alone. This is why we put together this collection of headsets from top vendors. There are some high-end, premium options, as well as more affordable and budget orientated cups. You can't go wrong by choosing one of our recommendations. We've tried them all and enjoyed each experience.</p> \n             <p>The final decision should come down to a combination of the type of games you want to play, whether you're looking for things like console support as well or want to go wireless, and yes, your budget. No matter how good a headset is, if it's over what you want to pay, then it's not a good headset for you.</p> \n             <h2>What to look for in a new PC gaming headset</h2> \n             <p>Use this handy checklist to cover off the key features you should consider when you're shopping for a new headset.</p> \n             <ul class=\"col2\"> \n              <li>Budget</li> \n              <li>Directional audio / Virtual surround sound</li> \n              <li>Gaming only or media use</li> \n              <li>Just PC or console also</li> \n              <li>Wired or wireless</li> \n              <li>Microphone quality</li> \n              <li>Detachable microphone</li> \n              <li>Battery life on wireless headsets</li> \n             </ul> \n             <h2 class=\"no-amazon\">Credits — The team that worked on this guide</h2> \n             <p class=\"credit\"><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-pc-gaming-headsets\" title=\"Best PC Gaming Headset 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2018/08/richard-avatar.jpg\" /></a></p> \n             <p class=\"end\"><strong>Richard Devine</strong> Richard Devine is an Editor at Windows Central.

It utilizes DXR and DirectX 12 (Microsoft's industry standards for ray tracing and other gaming technologies) so that Minecraft can, for the first time, accurately portray lighting, shadows, shaders, textures, and even reflections with perfect accuracy, all in real-time.</p> \n   <p>The announcement was a little sudden and unexpected but welcomed by Minecraft's passionate community. With ray tracing, Minecraft takes realism to a whole new level without losing anything (even mod support!).</p> \n   <p>The reveal trailer above really says it all, and it's definitely worth a watch.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"what\">What can <em>ray tracing do</em> for Minecraft with RTX?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing\" title=\"Minecraft with RTX: Ray tracing, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/minecraft-rtx-screenshot-02.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Before ray tracing was introduced to the gaming world, particle effects and lighting were simulated and artificial, and therefore lacked a dynamic feel. That isn't to say games still couldn't be breathtakingly beautiful without ray tracing, but it did mean there was always a limit that no amount of coding could overcome. With ray tracing, games can track the paths of light through an environment dynamically and in real-time, meaning things like reflections, shading, and patterns of light could look more life-like and authentic.</p> \n   <p>For most games, this leads to a subtle effect that is incredibly striking when noticed but doesn't necessarily alter the entire feel of a scene. A lot of games are already designed to be realistic, and clever tricks and techniques mean modern \"AAA\" games can look better than real life with enough power behind them.</p> \n   <p>Minecraft, of course, has never been built to look realistic or even conventionally beautiful. Minecraft's graphics are meant to be straightforward, flexible, and simple enough that even lower-end hardware can handle them with aplomb. They're not something you forget, but they certainly don't take your breath away.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-hands\" title=\"\" class=\"cta large norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Hands-on: Minecraft with RTX upgrades got me addicted to ray tracing</a></p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing\" title=\"Minecraft with RTX: Ray tracing, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/minecraft-rtx-screenshot-03.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <blockquote class=\"big pull right\"> \n    <p>Ray tracing completely alters Minecraft, leading to a very different game.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>In Minecraft with RTX, ray tracing is far more dramatic. Instead of barely-noticeable lighting effects and reflections, ray tracing completely alters Minecraft at its core, leading to a very different feeling game. Minecraft with RTX goes from simple and unassuming graphics to blowing your mind every time you turn a corner. Every screenshot of Minecraft with RTX and ray tracing turned on feels like a talented fan's custom render rather than something that can actually be real. And <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44270%26u1%3DUUwpUdUnU75570YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nvidia.com%252Fen-us%252Fgeforce%252Fnews%252Fminecraft-rtx-trailer-screenshots-partnership%252F&amp;token=k6vsziOg\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">NVIDIA's site</a> is full of side-by-side comparisons to alleviate your cravings.</p> \n   <div class=\"article-body__video\">\n    <div class=\"video_iframe\">\n     <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_4QaWbntUQ?modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autohide=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;start=0\" width=\"682\" height=\"400\" class=\"video-filter video-youtube vf-4qawbntuq\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <!--/video--> \n   <p>NVIDIA and Minecraft haven't been shy about showing the tech off either. Last November, and even earlier this year, they invited a few lucky (and very skilled) Minecraft players to experience Minecraft with RTX, and see what they could build. The result was a showcase of some impressive designs that shows ray tracing even shifts the way you have to think when building in Minecraft. Much like in real life, details become even more critical, with simple things like natural light changing how a scene looks and feels. Updated textures and shading make different blocks give off new emotions and ambiances.</p> \n   <p>And then, NVIDIA turned around and gave players access to these carefully designed worlds, letting anyone with the necessary hardware explore Minecraft with ray tracing turned on. The results are appropriately stunning, if unpolished and rough around the edges in early beta.</p> \n   <p>What can ray tracing do for Minecraft? The answer is simple: a lot. The reason behind the answer? Not quite as simple.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"how\">How does <em>ray tracing work</em> in Minecraft with RTX?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing\" title=\"Minecraft with RTX: Ray tracing, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/minecraft-rtx-screenshot-04.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Ray tracing in Minecraft isn't as simple as flipping a switch (at least, not until it's finished) and accomplishes a lot more than a simple shader pack. Shader packs use pre-existing code and build on top of it, trying to alter the appearance of Minecraft with a rendered layer on top of everything. Ray tracing will be built into the foundation of Minecraft with RTX and will work from the inside out to dynamically alter all of Minecraft. This means better visual fidelity, superior performance, and a subtle shift from pre-generated guesswork to accurate and real-time tracking of lighting and texture information. Those intimately familiar with shader packs may not see as dramatic a shift, but the difference is there.</p> \n   <p>The effect is most obvious when you're in motion. Static screenshots do a fair job of displaying the tech's more alluring qualities, but those familiar with shaders will claim they've seen it before. When you're in the game, the ability for ray tracing to alter scenes in real-time dynamically is powerful, and clear to see.</p> \n   <p>So how does all of this work?</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing\" title=\"Minecraft with RTX: Ray tracing, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/minecraft-rtx-screenshot-05.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Getting the technology up and running in Minecraft with RTX comes down to one main thing: NVIDIA's RTX-capable graphics cards—like those in our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-graphics-cards\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">best graphics cards</a>—and Mojang's Render Dragon engine. Ray tracing is just coming to the Windows 10 version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition at first because only the Render Dragon engine present in Bedrock supports such technologies like DXR ray tracing through Microsoft's DirectX 12, which don't exist in Java right now.</p> \n   <blockquote class=\"big pull left\"> \n    <p>The Render Dragon engine is more modern, flexible, and powerful than the old Minecraft engine.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>When Mojang set out to build the Bedrock Edition, they needed an engine that could span platforms, no matter the architecture of the processor (like the difference between a phone and a desktop computer), the power available, or the technologies being used. The Render Dragon can support a ton of awesome features, which is evident by looking at the AR magic of <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-earth/home\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Minecraft Earth</a> and its new lighting techniques. At the end of the day, the Render Dragon engine in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is more modern, flexible, and powerful than the old engine in Minecraft: Java Edition. It runs great if you're on a low-end Android phone or a high-end gaming PC.</p> \n   <p>It also supports DirectX 12 and Microsoft's industry-standard ray tracing APIs. So, with some work, the Render Dragon engine can tap directly into NVIDIA's powerful RTX graphics cores to deliver real-time hardware-accelerated ray tracing.</p> \n   <p>A Windows 10 PC + a powerful NVIDIA GPU + Minecraft: Bedrock Edition = a gorgeous and dynamic experience.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"beta\">How can I <em>play the beta</em> for Minecraft with RTX?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing\" title=\"Minecraft with RTX: Ray tracing, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/minecraft-rtx-screenshot-06.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Minecraft with RTX is a pretty big deal, and if you have the setup it's understandable that you'd want to jump in and check out what all the fuss is about. Fortunately, we've already covered everything players need to try out Minecraft with RTX, and while there are a few steps involved (and potential upgrades for your computer), it's relatively straightforward to get ray tracing turned on in Minecraft. To play the beta for Minecraft with RTX, you'll need to:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>Check to make sure your computer can handle it.</strong> Minecraft with RTX is more resource-hungry than normal Minecraft, but more than that it requires very specific hardware to run. Check the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-requirements\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">minimum and recommended requirements for Minecraft with RTX</a> to ensure your computer can make the cut.</li> \n    <li><strong>Follow these steps to enroll and receive the update.</strong> The Minecraft with RTX beta runs through the Xbox Insider Hub, and you may need to install some specific Game Ready drivers from NVIDIA as well. <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-beta\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Follow these steps to play the Minecraft with RTX beta</a>, and you should be good to go.</li> \n   </ul> \n   <h2 id=\"release\">When is the <em>release date</em> for Minecraft with RTX?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing\" title=\"Minecraft with RTX: Ray tracing, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/minecraft-rtx-screenshot-07.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>If you came here seeking a definitive day that you can mark on your calendars, you might walk away disappointed. Mojang and NVIDIA haven't given an exact date for the release of Minecraft with RTX, only that it's coming \"within the next year.\" Considering that ray tracing was officially announced in mid-August 2019, this would put Minecraft with RTX up for a Summer 2020 release date, although that obviously didn't happen. We did get the beta for Minecraft with RTX within that first year, so it's possible that's what NVIDIA and Mojang Studios were referring to. For anything regarding a full release, we'll have to wait for more information.</p> \n   <p>There is one bright side though: NVIDIA and Mojang have already announced that this update will be completely free. If you have the setup for it, you'll be able to reap the benefits of RTX ray tracing the moment it comes out. Yay! Mojang also confirmed that while ray tracing will launch exclusively on Windows 10 PCs, it will eventually come to other platforms that also support the technology.</p> \n   <p>Additionally, the Render Dragon engine allows Minecraft to do platform-specific updates to improve graphics or performance depending on the device. Even if your device can't handle ray tracing, you may still notice improvements over time.</p> \n   <p>There's more information to be found on <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44270%26u1%3DUUwpUdUnU75570YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nvidia.com%252Fen-us%252Fgeforce%252Fnews%252Fminecraft-ray-tracing-your-questions-answered%252F&amp;token=ltULgeN7\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">NVIDIA's Q&amp;A post</a> if you want to take a peek.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"xbox\">Will the <em>Xbox Series X</em> get Minecraft with RTX?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing\" title=\"Minecraft with RTX: Ray tracing, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/03/xbox-series-x-with-controller.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>A question on everyone's mind since the moment the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Xbox Series X</a> was revealed was \"Will Minecraft get ray tracing support?\" After all, up until this point ray tracing had been all NVIDIA, with AMD claiming support was coming <em>in the future</em>, but with no definitive information. With ray tracing being touted as a next-gen feature in Microsoft's newest console, which runs on AMD hardware, things were starting to get exciting. But will Minecraft, a very public partner with NVIDIA on ray tracing technology, recieve the same treatment on Xbox Series X?</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-xbox-series-x\" title=\"\" class=\"cta large norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Related: Everything you need to know about Minecraft on the Xbox Series X</a></p> \n   <p>The answer is a resounding <em>probably</em>. Microsoft demoed ray tracing on an Xbox Series X using Minecraft, but later reached out to us and commented that the demonstration was technical only, and not indicative of a product announcement. While this doesn't officially confirm Minecraft with RTX on the Xbox Series X, the fact that it <em>is</em> running in limited fashion makes us extremely hopeful that it is, in fact, coming. Minecraft is one of Microsoft's biggest games, and it only makes sense to make sure Minecraft takes full advantage of the Xbox Series X and it's seriously impressive hardware.</p> \n   <p>However, even if we can safely assume that Minecraft will receive the next-gen treatment on Xbox Series X, complete with ray tracing, we have no way of knowing when it'll happen. Ray tracing with NVIDIA cards on Windows 10 is still very early on, with missing textures, unstable performance, and general bugs and glitches. There's little reason to believe that ray tracing will be farther along on AMD hardware, which has much less real-world experience running ray tracing in video games.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing\" title=\"Minecraft with RTX: Ray tracing, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/minecraft-rtx-screenshot-08.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>On that note, it's also possible it won't be considered \"Minecraft with RTX\" on next-gen consoles like the Xbox Series X, just because RTX is strictly an NVIDIA feature, even if ray tracing technically isn't. So while AMD's newest hardware is ray tracing capable, AMD can't claim to be using NVIDIA's RTX cores in their GPU's.</p> \n   <p>I would expect ray tracing and other next-gen specific features to come to <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-xbox-series-x\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Minecraft on Xbox Series X</a> in a future update, after launch, through Xbox's <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x-smart-delivery\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Smart Delivery</a>. Microsoft will want to make sure that the experience is a flawless showcase of their new hardware, so it'll probably need a little extra time in the oven. That's alright, because Minecraft itself should be on Xbox Series X day one, thanks to backwards compatibility, and can still benefit from the speed and power of Xbox Series X in other ways.</p> \n   <p>As for ray tracing, or other visual and performance upgrades, we might have to wait just a little bit longer.</p> \n   <h2>Ray tracing and Minecraft—a perfect fit</h2> \n   <p>Combining the timeless joy of Minecraft with RTX and the breathtaking graphics of modern games seems like a no-brainer, and ray tracing will make that a reality. As you can see from pretty much every example of the tech in Minecraft, it's an impressive transition that makes me a little incredulous, but excited nonetheless. Ray tracing is a big shift for Minecraft, and as it comes to Windows 10 computers everywhere (and hopefully next-gen consoles like the Xbox Series X), players are in for a serious treat.</p> \n   <h4>Are you excited for ray tracing in Minecraft?

With Project Cars 3 releasing just earlier this month, some may be looking to invest more into their racing titles and looking to pick up a racing wheel.

Not only does it sport a reasonably affordable price, but Logitech's track record with design and longevity are also key here, as the G920 should last anyone who buys it a long time in their virtual racing career.</p>\n\n<p>The G920 is a well-built wheel with all the creature comforts you need to go racing. It includes a built-in vibration motor that aims to provide accurate feedback according to whatever in-game surface you're driving on and also features 900-degree rotation, leather grip, and sports a full three-pedal setup. This will allow players to race in nearly any way they'd like, including having the option to buy a separate gearshift to make things feel even more real.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent design and construction</li>\n<li>Attractive price</li>\n<li>Three-pedal setup</li>\n<li>Great force feedback</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stick shift additional purchase</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Overall</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Logitech G920</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-race-wheel-project-cars-3-xbox-and-pc\" title=\"Best Race Wheel for Project Cars 3 on Xbox and PC 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2018/10/g920-se.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">On balance, an excellent wheel for all</p>\n\n<p>The Logitech G920 is well made, well priced, and performs to such a high standard any virtual racer will be happy with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Dual-Motor-Feedback-Driving-Responsive/dp/B00Z0UWV98?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU80123YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$320 at Amazon</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU80123YYr%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Flogitech-g920-driving-force-racing-wheel-for-xbox-one-and-windows-black%252F4223402.p%253FskuId%253D4223402&#38;token=aAMoKg4n\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$400 at Best Buy</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUwpUdUnU80123YYr%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FLOGITECH-G920-Drvng-Racing-Whe%252F49071785&#38;token=6FcA-hCx\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$350 at Walmart</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"serious\" class=\"separator\">Best Wheel for Hardcore fans - <em>Thrustmaster TS-XW</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-race-wheel-project-cars-3-xbox-and-pc\" title=\"Best Race Wheel for Project Cars 3 on Xbox and PC 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2017/11/ts-xw-1.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The Thrustmaster TS-XW isn't a cheap wheel by any stretch of the imagination, which means if you're in the market for this, you're someone who is fully dedicated to the realism of racing games.</p>\n\n<p>TS-XW's price isn't the only thing that makes it a realistic wheel, though. While designing the wheel, Thrustmaster partnered with Sparco, making sure the TS-XW was essentially a recreation of a real-life racing wheel. The exact model they aimed to recreate, the P310, is one of Sparco's best, and Thrustmaster has faithfully copied nearly everything over for racing games fans to pick up.</p>\n\n<p>Force feedback on the TS-XW is also great, and it comes equipped with a dual belt-pulley system and metal ball-bearing axle, and has 1080 degrees of full rotation. Thrustmaster also includes a fully adjustable pedal set that are 100% metal, meaning you're getting incredibly high-quality materials to last you a long time.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent design and construction</li>\n<li>Modeled on a real-life wheel</li>\n<li>Three-pedal setup</li>\n<li>Incredible accuracy from force feedback</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Very high price</li>\n<li>Heavy compared to other wheels</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Best for Hardcore fans</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Thrustmaster TS-XW</h4>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">As close to real as you can get</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-race-wheel-project-cars-3-xbox-and-pc\" title=\"Best Race Wheel for Project Cars 3 on Xbox and PC 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2018/10/tsxw-se.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This wheel from Thrustmaster is as close as you can get to the real thing without having to go outside and put a helmet on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\"><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048247%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUwpUdUnU80123YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fapd%2Faa056591&#38;token=_hpyFDak\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$700 at Dell</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"beginners\" class=\"separator\">Best for Beginners - <em>Thrustmaster TMX</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-race-wheel-project-cars-3-xbox-and-pc\" title=\"Best Race Wheel for Project Cars 3 on Xbox and PC 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2017/07/tmx.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>If you've just picked up Project Cars 3 and want to get a bit more serious, or are ready to upgrade from the controller and onto something a bit more advanced, then the Thrustmaster TMX is for you.</p>\n\n<p>Thrustmaster has become one of the go-to brands for racing wheels precisely because of its wide variety of options. While they may have some premium products for diehard fans, the TMX is a perfectly acceptable entry-level wheel that manages to retain many of the great features and design integrity of other Thrustmaster wheels.</p>\n\n<p>The TMX comes complete with a 900-degree rotation, leather trim, and paddle shifts, which are big pluses for those looking to up their racing game.

For those, Hori's Overdrive wheel may be the best option, as it provides an incredibly affordable price, albeit with some limitations.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most of the other racing wheels listed here, the Hori Racing Wheel Overdrive only supports 270-degree rotation, which isn't a whole lot but should be enough for mostly every racing game, including Project Cars 3. It comes equipped with adjustable output options and a mount security for those who may need to secure their wheel somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>However, the biggest drawback to the Overdrive is the fact that it's not compatible with PC. This means that if you're looking to pick up this wheel for Project Cars 3 or any other racing game, you'll have to be sure that you're playing on an Xbox One.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fantastic price</li>\n<li>Licensed by Microsoft</li>\n<li>Grippy rubber trim</li>\n<li>Solid build quality</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only two-pedal setup</li>\n<li>Rotation limited to 270-degrees</li>\n<li>Not compatible with PC </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Budget</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Hori Racing Wheel Overdrive</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-race-wheel-project-cars-3-xbox-and-pc\" title=\"Best Race Wheel for Project Cars 3 on Xbox and PC 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/04/hori-rwo-wheel-se-crop.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">A super-affordable way to get into using a wheel</p>\n\n<p>An incredibly affordable way to have a more immersive and enjoyable experience in your Xbox One racing games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Racing-Wheel-Overdrive-Officially-Licensed-Microsoft/dp/B01N5QBT08/?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU80123YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$100 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n<h2>Best Direct Drive: <em>Fanatec Podium Racing Wheel Formula</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-race-wheel-project-cars-3-xbox-and-pc\" title=\"Best Race Wheel for Project Cars 3 on Xbox and PC 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/05/dd1_reflection.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The final wheel on our list is one that's meant for those who take racing games and simulations extremely serious. A direct drive wheel attaches the wheel right onto the motor, resulting in the highest quality force feedback, unlimited rotation, and the best accuracy that you'll get on any wheel.</p>\n\n<p>As far as features go, the Podium is packed with them. It boasts peak torque of 20nm and a holding torque of 15nm, a built-in hub, carbon fiber, and Alcantara in its construction and a built-in OLED display on the base for easy tuning. There's also a wide variety of mappable buttons, as well as an integrated display on the wheel itself.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, wheels like the Fanatec Podium Racing come at a premium, and the price tag for Fanatec's wheel is incredibly high as far as all things are considered.

Sure, it's old technology at this point, but with high-capacity SSDs still costing significantly more in some cases, it's no wonder that HDDs have stuck around. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H28QRKS?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU73814YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Seagate's FireCuda</a> is still one of the best ones you can buy right now. Its flash-accelerated disk means that load times ought to be faster than traditional hard drives, and it goes up to a 2TB capacity. It also comes in either a 3.5-inch or a compact 2.5-inch size, meaning it'll fit nicely in your case or enclosure.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Best Overall: <em>Seagate FireCuda</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-internal-hard-drives\" title=\"Best Internal Hard Drives (HDD) in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2018/07/seagate-firecuda-2.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Not quite a hard drive, not quite an SSD, the Seagate FireCuda blends both storage types into one unit, an SSHD, if you will. It features an embedded 8GB NAND along with up to 2TB of traditional storage to create an enhanced drive. The flash unit speeds up read/write speeds. With SATA 6Gb/s support onboard, Seagate promises a 140MB/s read speed. At 5400rpm, the drive itself is quieter and generates less heat.</p>\n\n<p>The benefits of the 8GB NAND aren't always readily apparent since the drive effectively learns your most used applications and loads them faster. For games, it might help with initial load times after you've launched the game a few times. It's easy to get excited about the possibilities with this drive, but even a SATA SSD will still outpace it by a considerable margin.</p>\n\n<p>The whole point of the FireCuda is to enhance the traditional mechanical hard drive. You can still get higher capacities without breaking the bank, all while experiencing improved performance that is noticeably better than even a 7200rpm HDD.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Great value</li>\n<li>Faster than traditional HDDs</li>\n<li>Five-year warranty</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Still outclassed by SSDs</li>\n<li>Flash-acceleration results don't always appear immediately</li>\n<li>Not as many storage options</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Overall</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">Seagate FireCuda</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-internal-hard-drives\" title=\"Best Internal Hard Drives (HDD) in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/07/seagate-firecuda-2tb-sshd-cropped-33ti.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<ul class=\"cta shop\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H28QRKS/ref=twister_B082N84NZ2?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU73814YYr\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">From $50 at Amazon</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Faster than an HDD</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">The FireCuda is the perfect option if you want an inexpensive storage option that blends HDD and SSD technology into one package.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Runner-up: <em>Western Digital Black</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-internal-hard-drives\" title=\"Best Internal Hard Drives (HDD) in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/01/wd_black-3.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Western Digital's cream of the crop, the Black line, represents some of the best the company has to offer with traditional mechanical hard drives. While not the fastest performer, outdone by both the FireCuda and WD VelociRaptor, the Black drives are trustworthy and reliable. They're great for game storage, especially titles that don't need to load super quick like single-player games.</p>\n\n<p>In a world where the FireCuda SSHD doesn't exist, the WD Black would be my top choice, not only for its performance and reliability but also for its price. More expensive than its Blue cousin — which we'll get to in a bit — the Black still represents a tremendous performance-to-value ratio.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, Western Digital dropped the \"Caviar\" moniker, opting for just naming its HDD lines by their respective colors. You can start at as little as 500GB or get up to 6TB, depending on your budget. These are the drives I run in my rig, and I've never had a problem.

Sporting Seagate's most robust reliability claims and a higher warranty than the regular BarraCuda — again, we'll get to that shortly — the Pro series aims to last for years to come.</p>\n\n<p>The BarraCuda Pro features a 300TB/year workload maximum, so like the WD Black, it's best left for things like games where you're not going to be moving them back and forth. It's a 7200rpm drive that supports SATA 6Gb/s for that fast transfer speed.</p>\n\n<p>Where the BarraCuda Pro outclasses, the WD Black is the storage options available.

Western Digital is a massive name in the hard drive market, best known for a variety of product categories, including internal hard drives. There are several different WD options — Blue for budget, Red for NAS, Black for performance, Purple for surveillance — but the 10,000rpm VelociRaptor is the king among hard disk drives.</p>\n\n<p>However, this drive is pricy and comes in lower storage sizes, not to mention the SSDs still outclass it. The 2TB Kingston A400 SSD, for example, is roughly the same price and runs laps around this drive at double the space. There's no longer a place for a drive like this.</p>\n\n<p>But, I suppose if you're set on sticking with HDDs, and don't want to go with an SSHD, then the VelociRaptor is the best you'll get in terms of performance.

One of its most significant downsides from all reports is that it lacks robustness when it comes to random read/write speeds — arguably a better indication of real-world use.</p>\n\n<p>The BarraCuda HDD starts at 1TB and goes up to 8TB, with the value proposition getting better and better at the higher capacities.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Incredible value</li>\n<li>Plenty of storage options</li>\n<li>Two-year warranty</li>\n<li>Generally a quiet drive</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sketchy reliability in the past</li>\n<li>Lower random read/write speeds</li>\n<li>Shorter warranty than the Pro</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Value</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">Seagate BarraCuda</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-internal-hard-drives\" title=\"Best Internal Hard Drives (HDD) in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/01/seagate_barracuda.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<ul class=\"cta shop\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D99KFPK/?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU73814YYr\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">From $45 at Amazon</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Best bang for your buck</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">If you need to add storage to your PC and want to keep the price down, the Seagate BarraCuda is the best option.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Most Reliable: <em>Western Digital Blue</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-internal-hard-drives\" title=\"Best Internal Hard Drives (HDD) in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/01/wd_blue-2.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Coming in hot behind the BarraCuda is the WD Blue, Western Digital's budget line of HDDs.

That's where a NAS (network-attached storage) comes in. Whether you're building your own or buying one ready to go, you'll need some hard drives to keep everything backed up. And my pick for that is Seagate's IronWolf.</p>\n\n<p>I run these personally in my own NAS, and they're great. NAS drives are a bit different than desktop-class HDDs because they're designed to run 24/7 while maintaining a higher level of performance. According to Seagate, the IronWolf comes in storage sizes ranging from 1TB up to 16TB with a three-year warranty. There's also the IronWolf Pro line, but that's aimed more at the business and otherwise professional level.</p>\n\n<p>If you opt for the 3TB or above, you'll get Seagate's IronWolf Health Management, which works well with some NAS manufacturers to make sure that the drive is running at its best. Also, bear in mind that the 4TB drives and below run at 5,900rpm rather than 7,200rpm. The 1TB and 2TB models lack the vibration sensing features. The Pro line doesn't feature these disparities, but you pay a bit more of a premium to compensate.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Excellent value</li>\n<li>Multiple storage options</li>\n<li>Three-year warranty</li>\n<li>Solid reliability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lower capacity drives lack some features</li>\n<li>Shorter warranty than the IronWolf Pro</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Best for a NAS</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Seagate IronWolf</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/article_images/2019/07/ironwolf-12-4lsr.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"1155\" alt=\"Seagate IronWolf\" title=\"\" data-source=\"Amazon\" class=\"image-large image-neutral \"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-5900RPM-Internal-3-5-Inch/dp/B07H28PKLX/?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU73814YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">From $60 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Great NAS performance</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">If you're building a NAS or expanding your existing one's storage, the Seagate IronWolf is the best drive for the job.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2>Best Enterprise HDD: <em>Seagate Exos X</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-internal-hard-drives\" title=\"Best Internal Hard Drives (HDD) in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/05/seagate_exos_x16.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Once again, Seagate has come out with a drive that matches Western Digital's offering and beats it on price. Above the IronWolf, and even the IronWolf Pro, is the Exos X. These enterprise-grade HDDs are meant for servers and are a bit outside the scope of the consumer market unless you're a \"prosumer\" who's running a home lab or just want some of the best and most reliable performance you can get.</p>\n\n<p>The Exos X ranges from 8TB to 16TB, with the top of the line X16 models sporting 14TB and 16TB capacities. It's much easier to find the X16, though the X10 model (a few steps down) and X14 are available, too. All told, the Exos X16 can handle 550TB of workload per year and has a Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF) of <em>2.5 million hours</em>. That's pretty awesome. Seagate also includes a 5-year warranty.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you go with a Seagate or a Western Digital — or even HGST — enterprise drive depends on your brand loyalty and what's on sale when you're shopping; the performance is nearly identical between the brands. Keep in mind that these enterprise-grade drives come at quite a cost over NAS or desktop HDDs.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Good performance</li>\n<li>Five-year warranty</li>\n<li>Power efficient</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pricey</li>\n<li>Lacks some of the IronWolf features</li>\n<li>Fewer smaller storage options</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Enterprise HDD</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Seagate Exos X</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-internal-hard-drives\" title=\"Best Internal Hard Drives (HDD) in 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/05/exos_x-2.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-12TB-7200RPM-256MB-SATA/dp/B07MRLCWSQ/?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU73814YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">From $284 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Enterprise-grade</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">Seagate seemingly one-upped Western Digital again with the Exos X enterprise hard drives.

Seagate and Western Digital remain the big players in this space. Yet, ultimately, our recommendation for the best HDD for your money isn't an HDD at all, but the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H28QRKS?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU73814YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">SSHD FireCuda</a>. It packs a great value with <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/seagate-firecuda-sshd-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">some extra performance</a>, outpacing the next runner-up.</p>\n\n<p>As I've said multiple times, a SATA SSD will still outclass each of the drives mentioned on this list, even the FireCuda, and VelociRaptor. While you don't get quite the spacious storage options, you can pick up an SSD as a boot drive for pretty cheap these days. Assuming you want to just bulk up your storage for your games library without breaking the bank, then the Seagate FireCuda is the way to go.</p>\n\n<p>And if you want to move beyond desktop-class drives for a NAS or home server rack, Seagate's got the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-5900RPM-Internal-3-5-Inch/dp/B07H28PKLX?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU73814YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">IronWolf</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-12TB-7200RPM-256MB-SATA/dp/B07MRLCWSQ/?tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU73814YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Exos X</a> drives to do what you need them to. I run four IronWolf drives in my NAS, and I have found that they're great performers, plus they sport some useful features.</p></div></div></div><img

NFL 21's Franchise Mode.</li>\n<li>Changes include a revamped stats UI, playoff brackets, and more.</li>\n<li>EA hopes to have the update out by mid-November.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After promising to fix some of the issues regarding its longstanding Franchise Mode, Electronic Arts has recently detailed some of the changes that will be coming to <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/madden-nfl-21\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Madden NFL 21</a>'s Franchise mode in a future update.</p>\n\n<p>In a brand new <a

changes, EA has announced that after some time carefully planning and implementing the changes, they have come up with some changes to the mode. This includes a re-tooled way of handling the game's X-Factor and Superstar abilities, allowing commissioners to assign X-Factors to any player, a revamped stats UI, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>Electronic Arts says that it's currently targeting a mid-November release for the patch, which will be the first of three post-launch franchise updates. According to them, users also won't have to restart a franchise to have access to the additions made in the updates, meaning that you can freely play through franchise mode now and not worry about losing any progress. In our <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/madden-nfl-21-review-familiar-face\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">review of Madden NFL 21</a>, some of the biggest issues holding the game back was its many bugs and glitches and lack of franchise mode additions, so it's nice to see EA attempting to fix things at a fairly rapid pace.</p>\n\n<p>For a more detailed look at what's coming in the new update to Franchise Mode when it drops later this year, check out below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>X-Factor/Superstar Ability Customization: This highly requested feature by the community allows commissioners to assign X-Factors to any player via the edit player feature.

Using cloud-based technology, data streams in real-time.  The game uses AI to extrapolate geometry, landscaping, foliage density, meteorological data, and air traffic updates. These features make every flight feel as real as possible. Yes, you can really see your house from up there, and you can also see what the weather's like as well.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator offers 24 landing challenges that task players with landing specific aircraft in a variety of locations, from the most popular airports to the most dangerous landing strips in the world. The goal is to land the plane as smoothly and as accurately as possible. You're graded on how close to the center of the runway you land, how long it takes your plane to come to a full stop, and the touchdown's smoothness. Also, there are no assists in this mode — you'll have to manage it all by yourself. Trying to land your plane is difficult, so here are some tips and tricks that will make the landing challenges a little less scary.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">The Latest and Greatest</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Microsoft Flight Simulator</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-landing-challenge-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Microsoft Flight Simulator: Landing challenge tips and tricks\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-box-art-square.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D24542%26u1%3DUUwpUdUnU80069YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fp%252Fmicrosoft-flight-simulator-standard---preorder%252F9NXN8GF8N9HT&#38;token=z31zfS3z\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">From $60 at Microsoft</a>\n<a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250410/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">From $60 at Steam</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 offers a cloud-powered globe, with authenticity on an unmatched scale.

Getting into the sky is much easier said than done. Microsoft Flight Simulator is not a game where you can jump into the cockpit and wing it. It offers an extensive training program that'll teach you the ins and outs of a Cessna 152. You'll learn the fundamentals of plane control, flight instruments, and other essential basics before concluding training with a full takeoff and landing.</p>\n\n<p>The most useful tutorial level for prepping for landing challenges is the fourth tutorial; it's all about landing. If you are having trouble, replay that level until you've got it down to a science. Each plane handles differently, but being comfortable in the cockpit is the first step to learning and mastering the other airplanes and beating their respective challenges.</p>\n\n<h2>Master your control</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-landing-challenge-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Microsoft Flight Simulator: Landing challenge tips and tricks\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/microsoft-flight-simulator-tbm-snow.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator is playable with an Xbox controller, a mouse and keyboard, or if you're really serious about flying, a combination of a <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-yokes-microsoft-flight-simulator\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">yoke</a> and a pair of pedals. Learning the subtleties of an aircraft takes time, and if you're having trouble wrapping your head around everything, I found that breaking out an Xbox controller helped me out a lot. If you do go that route, turn the sensitivity down.</p>\n\n<p>The default sensitivity is fine, but for the challenges that involve heavy winds, you'll find yourself swinging back and forth while flying. When you want to make smaller adjustments to your aircraft, you're going to want more sensitive controls. Here's how to find them.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Find the Controls in the <strong>Options tab</strong> in the main menu.</li>\n<li>Click on your controller input, and find Sensitivity on the <strong>left side of the screen</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Dropping the sensitivity down by at least 10% helps a lot, but you can afford to drop it further for smaller aircraft, which are a lot more sensitive. It helps to set up profiles based on the plane you're flying, so you can easily swap sensitivity when you swap planes.</p>\n\n<h2>Stay on target</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-landing-challenge-tips-and-tricks\" title=\"Microsoft Flight Simulator: Landing challenge tips and tricks\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/microsoft-flight-simulator-1.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Landing in Microsoft Flight Simulator might be the hardest thing you do on your whole flight; there are so many things that can go wrong. You could come in too fast, or too slow, or at the wrong angle. While there are no crash animations in the game, the black screen that hits after a crash somehow hurts even more.</p>\n\n<p>The key to landing is to maintain about 65 knots; target the number at the front of the runway in your dashboard. Begin descending on a path where that number stays as level as it can. If the number is rising, then you're falling too quickly, and you need more throttle. If it's falling, you're flying too fast, and you'll want to reduce your speed. Target the middle of the runway and point the nose of the aircraft down. Just as you're about to make contact with the runway, pull the nose of the aircraft up gently, and the plane should hit the ground with no problem.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Practice makes perfect</h2>\n\n<p>The landing challenges are a fun way to try out all of the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/list-microsoft-flight-simulator-planes\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">different planes</a> available and learn how they handle. With some practice, you'll be able to make smooth and safe landings all over the world — maybe even take a trip into the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-let-people-fly-hurricane-laura\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">eye of a storm</a>!

The deal will see Microsoft working with the Department of Defense (DoD) to modernize its IT infrastructure. The contract was awarded to Microsoft in 2019, a decision that was challenged by Amazon, who was among the bidders.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement issued today, <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2337557/dod-reaffirms-original-jedi-cloud-award-to-microsoft/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">DoD said</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Department has completed its comprehensive re-evaluation of the JEDI Cloud proposals and determined that Microsoft's proposal continues to represent the best value to the Government.  The JEDI Cloud contract is a firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract that will make a full range of cloud computing services available to the DoD.  While contract performance will not begin immediately due to the Preliminary Injunction Order issued by the Court of Federal Claims on February 13, 2020, DoD is eager to begin delivering this capability to our men and women in uniform.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"We appreciate that after careful review, the DoD confirmed that we offered the right technology and the best value,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/pentagon-says-it-will-stick-with-microsoft-for-jedi-cloud-contract.html\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">CNBC</a>. \"We're ready to get to work and make sure that those who serve our country have access to this much needed technology.\"</p>\n\n<p>As the DoD notes, the contract is still on hold due to an injunction issued earlier this year. The court proceeding was initiated by Amazon, another bidder in the selection process, which claims that the DoD's decision was influenced by bias against Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, by President Donald Trump.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/jedi-why-we-will-continue-protest-politically-corrupted-contract-award/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">lengthy blog post</a> responding to DoD's decision, Amazon stated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the DoD announced its plans for corrective action in March, we objected because it was clear this was nothing more than a \"do-over\" for Microsoft to fix its non-compliant proposal. Given the DoD did not agree to meaningfully review the many evaluation flaws outlined in our protest, we said the corrective action was likely to result in another contract award based on politics and improper influence and not based on the relative strengths of the two offerings. That is exactly where we find ourselves today, with the DoD's re-evaluation nothing more than an attempt to validate a flawed, biased, and politically corrupted decision. It's also important to point out that the DoD cited price as a major factor in the previous decision. This time, AWS offered a lower cost by several tens of millions of dollars. The DoD's decision to intentionally ignore the clear cost benefits offered by AWS, reinforces the fact that this corrective action was never meant to be fair.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the JEDI contract is held up in courts, recent reporting suggests Microsoft is currently pursuing <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-seeks-expand-jedi-cloud-contracts-foreign-governments\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">similar contracts</a> with foreign governments.</p></div></div></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wmexperts/~4/4wqvUJRa6g8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 21:10:29 +0000","feedId":13006,"bgimg":"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2018/03/microsoft-logo-ignite-2017.jpg","linkMd5":"e9230e354b660f64af39ae05b28036a6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-44-12-565_56e692587f5d5b24.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":95216,"destBytes":95216,"author":"Dan Thorp-Lancaster","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2018/03/microsoft-logo-ignite-2017.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-44-12-565_56e692587f5d5b24.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wmexperts/~4/4wqvUJRa6g8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn12@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-44-17-738_768067efe0f57c4d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295452282},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:12","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:12","title":"Roborock's E4 smart robot vacuum and mop is over $50 off with this code","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wmexperts/~3/opTnQ2bG2rE/roborocks-smart-e4-robot-vacuum-and-mop-over-50-code","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p>You don't need to spend a fortune to get a smart robot vacuum cleaner these days, especially with deals like this one on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0825NN2FM?mnsid=mbnx3-20&#38;tag=mbnx33-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU80160YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Roborock E4</a>.

Adding insult to injury, Microsoft refused to provide any kind of timeframe for the fans who have been saving to buy one.</p>\n\n<p>In the United States, customers can <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D24542%26u1%3DUUwpUdUnU80156YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fsurface%252Fdevices%252Fsurface-duo&#38;token=5ygluTE-\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">pre-order the Surface Duo</a> now for $1,399 and have it by September 10. Outside the United States, customers have simply been told that Microsoft is taking \"a measured and phased approach to availability to meet customer demand.\" Essentially, Microsoft doesn't want to make too many and sell too few.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is a valid concern for Microsoft to have. It doesn't want another Surface RT failure by building more devices than it can sell. But, as one of the Surface Duo's biggest followers that also resides outside the United States, I've been extremely disappointed with Microsoft's lack of real communication regarding its plans for Surface Duo elsewhere in the world.</p>\n\n<p>I've since done some digging, and according to my sources Microsoft is looking to begin shipping Surface Duo in external markets in the first half of 2021 after seeing if the product surpasses internal expectations in the United States first. This plan is fluid, however, and Microsoft could decide to bring its release in other markets forward if circumstances change.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-specs-camera-ram-storage-soc-battery#:~:text=Surface%20Duo%20specs%20%20%20%20Category%20,256GB%20UFS%203.0%20%2013%20more%20rows%20\" title=\"\" class=\"cta large norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Surface Duo specs</a></p>\n\n<p>The longer Microsoft waits, the harder it will be to sell a product with a Snapdragon 855 with 6GB RAM and without wireless charging or NFC capabilities to new customers. The lack of NFC support in countries like the United Kingdom is a big miss, as tap and pay is everywhere and is most people's default way of paying for things.</p>\n\n<p>The product is already certified for Canada, EU, and Japanese markets, and I'm told BT/EE in the UK has already agreed to carry the device when it does arrive.

After creating three entries in that series, with the latest being The Golf Club featuring PGA Tour, 2K Sports announced that it took over publishing rights and promptly changed the games name to PGA Tour 2K21.</p> \n   <p>Much like other sports titles, PGA Tour 2K21 promises to offer a realistic simulation golf experience, allowing players to feel like they're really out on the course while playing. PGA Tour 2K21 will feature 12 PGA Tour pros, including the cover star Justin Thomas, and will also feature a PGA Tour career mode, course designer, and much more when it launches.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"gameplay\">What is PGA Tour 2K21's <em>gameplay</em> like?</h2> \n   <div class=\"article-body__video\">\n    <div class=\"video_iframe\">\n     <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4g0ZWHYyXGA?modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autohide=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"682\" height=\"400\" class=\"video-filter video-youtube vf-4g0zwhyyxga\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <!--/video--> \n   <p>Similar to other golfing video games, PGA Tour 2K21 will focus heavily on the realistic aspects of golf, including choosing which club to use at various points in the game, timing up shots, and more. In a brief gameplay trailer released by 2K Sports, we also get to see what the overhead camera will look like, which will allow players to get a better look at what type of terrain they will be hitting the ball onto.</p> \n   <p>One of the key aspects to being a successful golfer is how you handle a putt, and PGA Tour 2K21 looks to have that covered as well. Once on the green, PGA Tour 2K21 has a grid cover the entire green, giving you a good layout of the angles and incline of the patch of grass you'll be shooting over. It isn't revolutionary by any means, but it is good to see PGA Tour 2K21 giving players the full golfing experience that fans have come to expect.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"consoles\">What <em>game modes</em> does PGA Tour 2K21 have?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/pga-2k21\" title=\"PGA 2K21: Everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/pga-tour-2k21-2.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>The <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/nba-2k21\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">NBA 2K series</a> has become known for its wide variety of game modes and features, and it looks like PGA Tour 2K21 will be no different. Players will be able to hit the links with their friends in local and online multiplayer, run full seasons and tournaments with the Online Societies feature, and also be able to play out their dreams of becoming a PGA Tour Champion with the all new PGA Tour Career Mode.</p> \n   <p>Much like the MyCareer mode in the NBA 2K series, the PGA Tour Career Mode will allow players to create their own character and take them from humble beginnings to the ranks of greatest golfer ever. Throughout the mode, you'll customize your MyPlayers appearance, skill, and much more, all while trying to take down the games 12 other professional golfers as you strive to become the FedEx Cup Champion.</p> \n   <p>PGA Tour 2K21 also promises to have some other modes that fans may love, including a course design mode that lets you create your own golf course. This will give players the chance to recreate some of the most iconic courses in golf history, as well as make some fun and less traditional courses as well.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"myplayer\">Will PGA 2K21 have a <em>MyPlayer</em> feature?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/pga-2k21\" title=\"PGA 2K21: Everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/06/pga-tour-2k21-hero.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Thanks to HB Studios partnering with 2K Sports, PGA Tour 2K21 will feature some things that fans of the NBA 2K series will recognize. Along with an overhauled Career mode, PGA 2K21 will also include the ability for players to create their own MyPlayer. Similar to how 2K usually operates, players can choose from a variety of preset options, or build their own golfer from scratch. Customizing the height, weight, gender, and other features will allow players to make the perfect counterpart for themselves.</p> \n   <p>Just like the NBA 2K series, everyones MyPlayer will be available across all of PGA 2K21's game modes, including its multiplayer modes and Career mode. Alongside being able to create your own MyPlayer, PGA 2K21 also includes a ton of apparel and gear upgrades that can be made throughout your time playing. Whether it be earning awards through sponsorships or performing well in various tournaments, your MyPlayer will be a huge part of how you play PGA 2K21.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"golfers\">Are there professional golfers in PGA 2K21?</h2> \n   <p>While previous iterations of The Golf Club franchise didn't have any professional golfers for players to go up against, HB Studios fixed that. In PGA Tour 2K21, players will be able to go up against 12 real world professional golfers, including Justin Thomas, the current #1 ranked golfer in the world. Alongside being in the game, the professionals will also serve as rivals to your MyPlayer, with players being able to form rivalries with various stars and take them on throughout your Career. Outperforming your rivals can result in big rewards for you, and getting to see real pros actually participate in the game is a huge step forward for the franchise.</p> \n   <p>The full list of PGA Tour professionals that have been scanned into the game include:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Justin Thomas</li> \n    <li>Cameron Champ</li> \n    <li>Bryson DeChambeau</li> \n    <li>Matt Kuchar</li> \n    <li>Kevin Kisner</li> \n    <li>Gary Woodland</li> \n    <li>Billy Horschel</li> \n    <li>Ian Poulter</li> \n    <li>Tony Finau</li> \n    <li>Jim Furyk</li> \n    <li>Sergio Garcia</li> \n    <li>Patrick Cantlay</li> \n   </ul> \n   <h2 id=\"courses\">How many courses are there in PGA 2K21?</h2> \n   <p>PGA Tour 2K21 will feature 15 officially licensed courses when the game launches.

While AMD has undoubtedly cut into NVIDIA's claim to the GPU throne with its Radeon RX 5000 cards, a few of which are included in this roundup, the top-tier options still belong to Team Green. The RTX 2080 Super isn't the <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wmexperts/~3/44JGrw-4ZQo/best-graphics-cards#2080TI\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">most powerful GPU in this roundup</a>, but it still delivers smooth 4K performance for hundreds of dollars less.</p> \n    <p>The RTX 2080 Super outperforms the standard RTX 2080 and the previous-gen GTX 1080 Ti, plus it delivers the extra benefits that make RTX cards so sought after. <strong>Ray tracing</strong>, the first main feature, isn't as widespread as many people would like it, but it's still available in popular games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Control, Minecraft, and more. And the RTX 2080 Super includes 48 dedicated cores for ray tracing.</p> \n    <p><strong>DLSS 2.0</strong> is perhaps the more impressive feature that comes standard with this GPU. It employs dedicated Tensor cores to run AI rendering in real-time, effectively boosting frame rates while also making frames come out at a much higher resolution. Because ray tracing can be detrimental to performance, DLSS 2.0 is the perfect pairing.</p> \n    <p>The Founders Edition version of the RTX 2080 Super includes 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM and speedy 496GB/s memory bandwidth, plus a boost clock that can hit 1,815MHz. Those are some beefy numbers, but you will need a decent amount of power to run the card in your gaming PC; NVIDIA recommends at least a 650W power supply unit (PSU). This card is compatible with G-Sync monitors, which have the adaptive sync technology to reduce screen tearing. It will also work with any <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/list-all-nvidia-g-sync-compatible-freesync-monitors\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">FreeSync monitors that are \"G-Sync compatible.\"</a> Whether you're looking to game at 4K or 1440p, the RTX 2080 Super remains one of the best graphics cards for a lot of people.</p> \n    <div class=\"rows left collection\"> \n     <h3 class=\"product reco-block\">NVIDIA RTX 2080 Super Founders Edition</h3> \n     <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-graphics-cards\" title=\"Best Graphics Card 2020: Top GPUs for Gaming\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/08/nvidia-rtx-2080-super-founders-edition-se-crop-01.png\" /></a></p> \n     <p>With stellar 4K and 1440p performance at price hundreds less than the RTX 2080 Ti, the RTX 2080 Super is our pick for the best overall GPU for your custom gaming PC.

You'll want to look at investing in one of our picks for the best graphics card. It's responsible for rendering everything you see on-screen, as well as taking workloads off the CPU when powering through calculations. The last thing you want to do when purchasing a new GPU is to waste your money on an older model or one that's not powerful enough to do what you need. You also don't want to overspend.</p> \n     <p>There are several questions you need to ask yourself. What kind of games are you playing? Love low-impact indie titles or well-optimized esport games? Or do you wish to take full advantage of current-gen AAA gaming and want to enjoy the best graphics at a 4K resolution? If the answer is the former, you'll need to think about more affordable graphics cards that don't require advanced components to get the most out of the GPU.</p> \n     <p>As for more demanding games, it's generally down to your budget and what your current PC has in terms of a processor (CPU), RAM, and more. If your PC build is rocking anything less than a recent Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 CPU, it's probably not worth forking out on top-of-the-line and most expensive GPU options. You'll most likely experience what is known as a bottleneck, where a separate piece of hardware isn't capable of keeping up with the GPU's ability.</p> \n     <p>For which resolution and frame rate are you shooting? Entry-level budget GPUs are ideal for 1080p (FHD) gaming, mid-range is best for 1440p (QHD) gaming, and the top-tier options are cut out for 4K (UHD). Of course, you can always drop down to a lower resolution with a top-tier GPU just to get better frame rates, or if you don't want to shell out the cash for a 4K gaming monitor.</p> \n     <p>How long would you like the GPU to last? Going with a budget option now is going to save you money, but it won't be relevant as long as a mid- or upper-range GPU. If you don't want to replace the GPU any time soon, you will want to spend a bit more now to ensure you can continue playing games as they're released in the next few years.

Like the RTX 2080 Super, the 2070 Super has 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, though its memory is a bit slower, it has fewer CUDA cores, and it doesn't have as high of a clock speed. Still, performance nearly matches that of the standard RTX 2080.</p> \n        <p>If you're in search of a GPU that can deliver a quality 4K experience, the RTX 2080 Super or 2080 Ti are still better choices, though the 2070 Super will allow you to dabble at the higher resolution. Where it really shines, though, is at 1440p. You should be able to max out most modern game settings and still achieve high, smooth frame rates. And thanks to <strong>G-Sync technology</strong>, pairing the GPU up with a compatible monitor will further reduce any screen tearing.</p> \n        <p>The fact that the RTX 2070 Super costs hundreds less again than our top pick no doubt makes it quite appealing to many gamers who just don't have nearly $1,000 to spend on a single piece of hardware in their gaming PC. NVIDIA does recommend at least a 650W PSU to pair with the 2070 Super, so that might be a necessary upgrade. In any case, this is a stellar card for anyone wanting to stick with 1440p and <em>absolutely crush frame rates</em>.</p> \n        <div class=\"rows left collection\"> \n         <h3 class=\"product reco-block\">NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super Founders Edition</h3> \n         <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-graphics-cards\" title=\"Best Graphics Card 2020: Top GPUs for Gaming\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/07/geforce-rtx-2070-super-shop-d.png\" /></a></p> \n         <p>It costs considerably less than the RTX 2080 Super, yet it can still deliver 4K and 1440p gaming.

It will dabble in 4K gaming, though it will truly shine as a more affordable GPU for high-refresh 1440p displays.</p> \n         <p><strong>Memory:</strong> 8GB GDDR6 | <strong>Memory bandwidth:</strong> 448GB/s | <strong>Memory bus:</strong> 256-bit | <strong>Base clock:</strong> 1,670MHz | <strong>Boost clock:</strong> 1,925MHz | <strong>Stream processors:</strong> 2,560 | <strong>Process:</strong> 7nm | <strong>Power:</strong> 241W</p> \n         <table class=\"alternating\"> \n          <thead> \n           <tr> \n            <th>Manufacturer</th> \n            <th>Version</th> \n            <th>Vendor</th> \n           </tr> \n          </thead> \n          <tbody> \n           <tr> \n            <td><strong>Sapphire</strong></td> \n            <td><strong>Pulse</strong></td> \n            <td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sapphire-11293-01-20G-Radeon-Backplate-Graphics/dp/B07WC7683C?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU44996YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$400 at Amazon</a></td> \n           </tr> \n           <tr> \n            <td>XFX</td> \n            <td>RAW II</td> \n            <td><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU44996YYr%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fxfx-amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt-raw-ii-8gb-gddr6-pci-express-4-0-graphics-card-with-zero-db-black%252F6375963.p%253FskuId%253D6375963&amp;token=3b6RVhr4\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$410 at Best Buy</a></td> \n           </tr> \n           <tr> \n            <td>MSI</td> \n            <td>Gaming X</td> \n            <td><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048247%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUwpUdUnU44996YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fapd%2Fab077980&amp;token=z7kdFZaM\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$481 at Dell</a></td> \n           </tr> \n           <tr> \n            <td>MSI</td> \n            <td>Mech</td> \n            <td><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUwpUdUnU44996YYr%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FMSI-Radeon-RX-5700-XT-Mech-OC-Fan-Cooler-Graphics-Card-Black%252F796485696&amp;token=NvrnpiEL\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$390 at Walmart</a></td> \n           </tr> \n          </tbody> \n         </table> \n         <p class=\"caption\">Sapphire makes some beautiful graphics cards, and this <strong>Pulse version</strong> of the RX 5700 XT that we recommend offers all-around good cooling and performance.</p> \n         <h3 class=\"pros\">Pros</h3> \n         <ul> \n          <li>Unreal value</li> \n          <li>Power for smooth 1440p gaming</li> \n          <li>FreeSync technology</li> \n          <li>Efficient 7nm process</li> \n         </ul> \n         <h3 class=\"cons\">Cons</h3> \n         <ul> \n          <li>Lacks some NVIDIA RTX features</li> \n          <li>Performance won't compare to our top pick</li> \n         </ul> \n         <p>AMD's RDNA GPUs with 7nm process were a huge step forward in terms of taking a bite out of NVIDIA's supremacy and also making the older AMD Radeon cards look a bit power-hungry and antiquated. The former AMD boss, the Radeon VII, essentially delivers the same or worse performance compared to the <strong>RX 5700 XT</strong>, yet it sucks up far more power and costs a lot more dollars. That's a big win for AMD.</p> \n         <p>The available performance means you will be able to dabble in 4K, though not at a high framerate or with high game settings. The card is intended for use at 1440p, where it will deliver high frame rates in most games with maxed-out settings. And thanks to FreeSync technology, compatible monitors will see far less screen tearing. Do note that AMD recommends a 650W PSU, so an upgrade may be necessary if you're coming from a lesser card. This GPU is also our top pick of the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/which-graphics-card-do-you-need-vr\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">best graphics cards for VR</a>.</p> \n         <p>Compared to the NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super, the RX 5700 XT can be expected to deliver about the same performance. Unfortunately, the AMD GPUs don't offer the same ray tracing or DLSS 2.0 benefits as NVIDIA cards. If those extra goodies don't matter to you and you'd like to save a good chunk of change, the RX 5700 XT remains one of the <strong>best value graphics cards on the market</strong>.</p> \n         <div class=\"rows left collection\"> \n          <h3 class=\"product reco-block\">Sapphire Pulse RX 5700 XT</h3> \n          <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-graphics-cards\" title=\"Best Graphics Card 2020: Top GPUs for Gaming\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/sapphire-pulse-rx-5700-xt-se-crop-01.png\" /></a></p> \n          <p>The RX 5700 XT is a budget-wise performance GPU that genuinely excels at 1440p.

True, it doesn't offer ray tracing, though many people find the RTX 2060 to be lacking enough performance to make a viable run with the technology.

Performance-wise it sits somewhere near the standard RTX 2070, meaning it has the power to handle a quality 1440p gaming experience. Most AAA games will be able to be played on high or, in some cases, ultra settings without sacrificing frame rates. And if you're working with a 1080p monitor, this card will deliver a smooth, ultra experience no matter the title.</p> \n           <p>Ray tracing and DLSS 2.0 technologies are included, though if you're really into ray tracing, you still probably want to go with one of the higher-end NVIDIA cards. The 2060 Super will get the job done, but you will sacrifice performance in other areas with it enabled.</p> \n           <p>There's also the matter of cost. AMD's RX 5700 XT, which performs slightly better, won't have you spending as much money. If it's just raw performance you're after and don't mind the lack of extra NVIDIA RTX features, it's probably the better buy. In any case, the RTX 2060 Super remains an attractive card for those on Team Green who are looking for an introductory GPU for ray tracing and high-quality 1440p gaming.</p> \n           <div class=\"rows left collection\"> \n            <h3 class=\"product reco-block\">GIGABYTE Gaming OC RTX 2060 Super</h3> \n            <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-graphics-cards\" title=\"Best Graphics Card 2020: Top GPUs for Gaming\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/gigabyte-gaming-oc-rtx-2060-super-se-crop-01.png\" /></a></p> \n            <p>Those who love NVIDIA and its extra RTX features should find the RTX 2060 Super to be a solid introductory card for 1080p or 1440p gaming.</p> \n            <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0842SJT36/?smid=A2V0AUEHW8YS8B&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU44996YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$551 at Amazon</a></p> \n            <p><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1559500-REG/gigabyte_gv_n206sgaming_oc_8gd_rev2_0_geforce_rtx_2060_super.html/BI/20079/KBID/13844/SID/UUwpUdUnU44996YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$420 at B&amp;H</a></p> \n            <p class=\"end\"><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUwpUdUnU44996YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fgigabyte-geforce-rtx-2060-super-gv-n206sgaming-oc-8gd%252Fp%252F1FT-00AC-00010&amp;token=W75UBRQ5\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$720 at Newegg</a></p> \n           </div> \n           <hr> \n            <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048247%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUwpUdUnU44996YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fapd%2Fab076007&amp;token=rTuYKWFL\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-graphics-cards\" title=\"Best Graphics Card 2020: Top GPUs for Gaming\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/msi-gaming-x-gtx-1660-super-se-hero-01.png\" /></a></p> \n            <h2 id=\"1660S\">7.

Those are some big numbers, and with that performance comes a price tag somewhere around $1,499.</p> \n              <h2>Do you need to upgrade graphics cards?</h2> \n              <p>Trying to figure out whether or not it's time to upgrade your GPU can be challenging. Of course, if you're seeing signs that your GPU is dying — screen artifacts, PC crashes, whining — it's no doubt time to upgrade. But if your current GPU is working fine, do you really need something new?</p> \n              <p>That depends on what types of games you want to play and at what resolution. If you were satisfied with low-impact indie games and built a PC to handle them, you'll no doubt find that your PC struggles to keep up with a hot new AAA title that snagged your eye. The same goes for resolution. If you're upgrading your monitor from 1080p to 1440p or 4K, a new GPU is likely required to make the most of the higher-resolution display.</p> \n              <p>Whenever a new generation of GPUs is released, the previous generation seems to look disproportionately old. Say, for example, you have an NVIDIA GTX 980 in your PC. It's a great GPU, but it's going to be four generations behind once the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/geforce-rtx-3080-ti-leak-reveals-30-performance-uplift-over-2080-ti\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">RTX 30-series GPUs are released</a>. And that brings up another issue: should you wait until the next generation is released? NVIDIA and AMD are usually tight-lipped when it comes to new hardware, but leaks and rumors will usually indicate that something is coming soon. And if you do indeed have a concrete release date, it's likely best to wait for the new cards to come out.</p> \n              <p>Finally, you don't want to upgrade your GPU if you can't also afford to upgrade the rest of your PC components to keep up. Buying an AMD RX 5700 XT GPU and installing it alongside 8GB of RAM and a 4th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU is not going to allow the GPU to realize its full potential. Plus, you might not have a large enough PSU unit to provide enough power to your system, or the cooling system might not be beefy enough to keep the PC running optimally. Always be sure you can upgrade sufficient to avoid bottlenecking the system.</p> \n              <h2>How to check what PC hardware you already have</h2> \n              <p>Whenever you look at investing in a new component for your PC, it's good practice to run a piece of software to have a gander at what you have already. This will help determine just how recent other components are and whether or not they will become a bottleneck for your upcoming GPU purchase. To have a look at what makes everything tick inside the PC case, there are many software options available; <a href=\"https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">CPU-Z</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048247%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUwpUdUnU44996YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.piriform.com%2Fspeccy&amp;token=i3j1CF5Y\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Speccy</a> are two we would recommend.</p> \n              <p>These apps will tell you what motherboard you have, as well as CPU, RAM, and other bits and pieces. We'll mainly need to see what CPU you have, and a good measurement to use to determine how good your CPU will be with a new GPU purchase is <a href=\"https://benchmarks.ul.com/compare/best-cpus?redirected=true\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">3DMark</a>. The higher the 3DMark score, the better a CPU generally is in gaming and other intensive applications. It shouldn't be used as a definitive value, but the 3DMark score of a specific chip will give you an idea as to how powerful it is.</p> \n              <p>As well as the score, one should also consider the age of the processor, the generation it's part of, the manufacturing process used, the cooler installed, whether or not it's overclocked, and how many cores you're rocking. Intel has its <a href=\"https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">ARK platform</a> available for conveniently searching its portfolio of CPUs. If you're on #TeamRed, AMD has a similar feature on its <a href=\"http://products.amd.com/en-us/search?k=DesktopProcessors\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">own website</a>.</p> \n              <h2>How to choose a display resolution for PC gaming</h2> \n              <p>If you're building a new PC from the ground up, you might be wondering for which resolution to aim. There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-gaming-monitors\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">great gaming monitors</a> in 1080p, 1440p, and 4K, so it can be tough to choose. What you need to consider is price, fidelity, and the power of the PC hardware you're interested in including.</p> \n              <p>A 1080p gaming monitor will generally cost the least, but will still include high refresh rate and low response time, both of which are features gamers search out. It's not going to look as crisp as 1440p or 4K, but it will also take quite a bit less power to run games at a high frame rate. You're going to be able to get away with a lower-tier GPU and CPU, saving you more money.</p> \n              <p>Bumping things up to 1440p is going to make everything look better. Once you've made the switch to QHD, dropping back down to 1080p is noticeable. The issue with 1440p, however, is that monitors generally cost more, plus you're going to want beefier hardware to achieve high frame rates. The better the GPU and CPU, the better performance you will see at 1440p. Even the high-end RTX 2070 Super and RX 5700 XT that can dabble with 4K will do much better running with a 1440p display.</p> \n              <p>And finally, we have 4K. It's a rather big jump, even from 1440p, and you should have top-tier hardware to get the most of it. 4K displays are expensive, so buying one and pairing it with a subpar PC is not advised. Even with a high-end GPU and CPU, don't expect frame rates to get anywhere near what you can achieve at 1080p and 1440p.</p> \n              <h2 class=\"no-amazon\">Credits — The team that worked on this guide</h2> \n              <p class=\"credit\"><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-graphics-cards\" title=\"Best Graphics Card 2020: Top GPUs for Gaming\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/2018/05/cale-hunt-avatar-01.jpg\" /></a></p> \n              <p class=\"end\"><strong>Cale Hunt</strong> is a staff writer at Windows Central.

href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/apple-vs-epic-made-me-explore-open-source-software\" title=\"The Apple vs. Epic saga put me on the path to open source\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2020/09/iphone-xr-fortnite.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"intro\">The Epic Games vs. Apple war highlights how you can't really rely on any of the big tech firms. And it prompted me to go looking once more at open-source software.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/apple-responds-judges-temporary-order-lawsuit-against-epic-games\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Epic Games vs. Apple saga</a> is well storied already so that I won't be going over old ground here. But the whole sorry tale did prompt me to rethink how I use my tech, both for work and for personal use. Because big tech companies can burn you, and often do.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not really a Fortnite player, so the loss of access on iOS doesn't really affect me, but not being able to use xCloud on there certainly does. All of these big companies have their ecosystem plays, and it seems you're not entirely safe locking into any of them.</p>\n\n<p>And while it's impossible to avoid in many cases, there's plenty of software out there that doesn't rely on the shackles of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and so on. Free and open-source software (FOSS) doesn't just come without a price tag; it comes free of any required attachments to a big ecosystem, and in probably more cases than you think, it can change the way you use a PC.</p>\n\n<h2>Big tech cancels or changes products at its user's cost</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/apple-vs-epic-made-me-explore-open-source-software\" title=\"The Apple vs. Epic saga put me on the path to open source\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/field/image/2016/09/hp-elite-x3-hero-window.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Remember Windows Phone? The biggest example of a tech cancellation in recent memory for regulars to this site, but it's proof of how big things can get when it comes to pulling the rug out from under the users, from under us. By contrast, Android is open source, so even if Google, for some reason, decided to stop making a phone OS, someone else would likely pick up the reigns. Indeed custom versions have been a thing since pretty much the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>It isn't quite the same as what's going on between Epic and Apple, of course, but its impact was very similar. A bunch of people who relied on this thing being around then had to start looking elsewhere. Had Microsoft open-sourced Windows for phones, I guarantee there would be a community still building and supporting devices.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull right\">\n  <p>These companies all make changes or closures, and it's you and I that suffer for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But it happens on a smaller scale, too. Most recently, Apple acquired Dark Sky and has since shut down its Android app, and the API will cease to function from the end of next year. Affecting users and affecting developers, both of which will have to transition to something else.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook recently announced that Oculus owners will be forced to login with a Facebook account soon. And some of us never got over the closure of Google Reader. Even today.</p>\n\n<p>All different examples, but there's a common theme. All of these ecosystem plays come at a cost. All the big tech companies want, no, need to lock you in to continue a steady source of revenue, but it's not necessarily in your best interests.</p>\n\n<h2>FOSS doesn't just mean Linux</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/apple-vs-epic-made-me-explore-open-source-software\" title=\"The Apple vs. Epic saga put me on the path to open source\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2019/05/gimp.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The part of the Epic vs. Apple argument I agree with the most is that there's no alternative on iOS to buying apps. No alternative means no competition, which means Apple can keep charging developers 30%, and the users of the platform ultimately pay the price.</p>\n\n<p>Android, of course, is a little more open, with alternatives to acquire apps that don't involve Google, such as Samsung's own store, the Amazon Appstore, and of course, Huawei's AppGallery since they don't even have access to Google. But there are options out there.</p>\n\n<p>Options are what you get with FOSS. And it doesn't mean you have to use Linux. Open-source software is prevalent across Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as mobile and the web. I've been dabbling more recently with Linux and Chrome OS alongside my regular Windows 10 use. I have already found several amazing applications that work on all those platforms that are capable of replacing software I've been using for years.</p>\n\n<h2>Open source apps can be amazing</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/apple-vs-epic-made-me-explore-open-source-software\" title=\"The Apple vs. Epic saga put me on the path to open source\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/vs-code-chromebook-install7.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Many years ago, I used <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">GIMP</a>, a popular cross-platform open-source image editor along the lines of Photoshop. Then, for reasons I can't really understand, I moved to paying for an Adobe CC subscription. Now I'm back on GIMP, or more specifically, a forked version called <a href=\"https://glimpse-editor.github.io/#:~:text=Glimpse%20Image%20Editor,use%20of%20free%2Flibre%20software.\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Glimpse</a>. This is an incredibly impressive piece of software with plugins galore available, supporting Windows, Mac, and Linux and costing absolutely nothing. No subscription to Adobe, just great software built by people who just want to make it as good as it can be. Video editors would do well to check out the impressive <a href=\"https://kdenlive.org/en/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">KDenLive</a>, which can also be used on all the major platforms as an alternative to Adobe Premiere.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't stop there, either. Microsoft 365 is a great package, but if all you want is something lighter, free, and compatible with Office files, there are suites like <a href=\"https://www.libreoffice.org/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">LibreOffice</a>. Once again, this is available on all the major platforms, completely free and open source.  Microsoft has been contributing more to the open-source community of late, too, with one example being its <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-microsoft-visual-studio-code-chromebook\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Visual Studio Code</a> application. A personal favorite is <a href=\"https://stackedit.io/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">StackEdit</a>, a web-based open-source markdown editor which has become my new place for writing all my work.</p>\n\n<p>And did you know that the Telegram app is open source? It's also a much better service than WhatsApp and can be used on many platforms all at once.</p>\n\n<h2>The future is open source</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/apple-vs-epic-made-me-explore-open-source-software\" title=\"The Apple vs. Epic saga put me on the path to open source\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/kdenlive-screen.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Obviously, there will always be ecosystem tie ins and places you're unable to avoid \"the man.\" Gaming is a big one, of course, and content. But in those cases, you should always keep your options open. If you buy all your content in Microsoft's store, then what happens if, as has happened in the past, Microsoft decides to pull the plug?</p>\n\n<p>I'm hardly an expert; I'm only just beginning to find my feet in the world of open-source software. But this whole debacle where one enormous company has stopped another enormous company using its services because it wants to keep more money for itself shines a golden glow on the FOSS community.</p>\n\n<p>These folks are making good software for the sole purpose of making good software. If you choose to toss a few bucks their way to help cover costs and keep the development train rolling, that's great; I've done that regularly.</p>\n\n<p>The issue isn't things costing money, I'm happy to pay, and I'm happy to donate to developers offering a free product to help them keep doing good work.

The slimline design touts versatility, with the company hoping to deliver a new approach to mobile productivity. But the convergence of hardware and software remains crucial to that promise, enabling a variety of scenarios, which Microsoft describes as \"postures.\"</p> \n   <p>Postures on Surface Duo relate to both the physical hardware positioning and the on-screen experience. It launches alongside six predefined postures, adapting to how the user poses, orients, and operates the device.</p> \n   <p>Surface Duo provides a glimpse into how Microsoft is approaching foldables creatively, augmenting the Android operating system with in-house tweaks. The result looks to contextually respond to your workflow, adapting content for the twin-screen setup. Below is every Microsoft Surface Duo posture and how it works.</p> \n   <!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK --> \n   <h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Preorder today</h3> \n   <h4 class=\"product\">Microsoft Surface Duo</h4> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-postures\" title=\"Surface Duo postures: Every bend and fold you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/08/surface-duo-reco1.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D24542%26u1%3DUUwpUdUnU80067YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fsurface%252Fdevices%252Fsurface-duo&amp;token=sB15QR6F\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">From $1,400 at Microsoft</a> <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU80067YYr%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-128gb-unlocked%252F6419335.p%253FskuId%253D6419335&amp;token=8Oks0KFm\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">From $1,400 at Best Buy</a> <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048247%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUwpUdUnU80067YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-128gb-glacier.html&amp;token=_XamA1i8\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">From $1,400 at AT&amp;T</a></p> \n   <p class=\"subtitle\">Two screens are better than one</p> \n   <p class=\"end\">Microsoft delves into the future of foldables with an ambitious dual-screen device, featuring two ultra-thin 5.6-inch AMOLED displays bound by a 360-degree hinge.

The setup evokes an experience akin to a traditional paperback, ideal for reading, scrolling, and consuming content across the twin displays.</p> \n   <p>It's the natural posture after opening the device, ideal for experiencing two separate apps side-by-side. It also supports apps optimized for its dual-screen \"spanning\" feature, with content and menus contextually spread across. Third-party apps like Amazon Kindle also explore their own interpretation, emulating the layout of your favorite novels.</p> \n   <p><strong>Best for: Using two apps simultaneously, reading, notes, and documents.</strong></p> \n   <h2 id=\"composemode\">Compose Mode: <em>Laptop in your pocket</em></h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-postures\" title=\"Surface Duo postures: Every bend and fold you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/08/surface-duo-press-pen-horizontal.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Compose Mode means rotating the Surface Duo onto its side, using its virtual keyboard to get things done. The posture looks to deliver an ultra-portable laptop alternative, with a full-screen typing experience for added immersion. You enter this form by orienting the device, which pushes the app up top, with the keyboard docked below.</p> \n   <p>Extending the virtual keyboard to landscape triggers it to occupy the full 5.6-inch screen, suited for cranking out longer emails or working on documents. The device uses a dual-screen spin on Microsoft SwiftKey, which includes tweaks like a split keyboard for added ergonomics. It's the most robust typing experience available on Duo, akin to a mini PC.</p> \n   <p><strong>Best for: Writing longer emails, documents, and general typing.</strong></p> \n   <h2 id=\"duallandscapemode\">Dual Landscape Mode: <em>Full screen experience</em></h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-postures\" title=\"Surface Duo postures: Every bend and fold you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/surface-duo-pinterest.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Microsoft Surface Duo also allows for spanning one experience across both displays, delivering what the company describes as \"Dual Landscape Mode.\" The feature lets apps bridge the full 8.1-inches of the screens when spanned, providing a space to view content on a larger scale.</p> \n   <p>Dual Landscape Mode works with various apps, ideal for viewing long webpages or endless scrolling feeds. Microsoft has shown off the mode with apps like Pinterest and Instagram, where a feed of visual content pops across the twin panels. Looking past the hinge may be a struggle for some, but leverages the entire screen real estate at its best.</p> \n   <p><strong>Best for: Web pages, social media, and viewing other content.</strong></p> \n   <h2 id=\"singlescreenmode\">Single Screen Mode: <em>Back to basics</em></h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-postures\" title=\"Surface Duo postures: Every bend and fold you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/08/surface-duo-press-hand.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Microsoft's dual-screen design also includes a 360-degree hinge, allowing one to swing behind the other. Putting the displays back-to-back transforms the device into a usual single-screen phone, confining the experience to just one panel, and improving one-handed usability.</p> \n   <p>The single-screen mode may cut the Surface Duo's defining features but remains crucial to some interactions. Typing one-handed and taking a phone call is near-impossible when wrangling both screens, making this simple posture valuable in everyday usage.</p> \n   <p>The single-screen mode also plays a crucial role in the Surface Duo camera setup, limited to a single 11MP front-facing shooter. The more restricted configuration allows you to reorient its camera, overcoming the need for a rear sensor. The compromise comes from its ultra-thin design, with this handy trick ensuring flexibility for selfies or landscape shots.</p> \n   <p><strong>Best for: Camera, phone calls, one-handed use.</strong></p> \n   <h2 id=\"tentmode\">Tent Mode: <em>Hassle-free video calls and entertainment</em></h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-postures\" title=\"Surface Duo postures: Every bend and fold you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/surface-duo-tent.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>This aptly-named mode leverages the hinged design, allowing you to prop up the Surface Duo in a v-shaped posture. Tent Mode best suits hands-off experiences, angling the display without a separate stand for, or tight grip on, the device.</p> \n   <p>This works well for entertainment, accommodating video apps like YouTube or Netflix in landscape orientation, or cloud gaming like Project xCloud. Video conferencing apps like Microsoft Teams or Zoom also fit, positioning the front-facing camera to keep you in-frame. You can also use it to share content, pulling up documents for friends or clients in-person.</p> \n   <p><strong>Best for: Video playback and conferencing.</strong></p> \n   <h2 id=\"peekmode\">Peek Mode: <em>Check your notifications</em></h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-postures\" title=\"Surface Duo postures: Every bend and fold you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/08/surface-duo-press-peek.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>When the Surface Duo is locked and partially open, the device enters what Microsoft describes as \"Peek Mode.\" The feature serves a thin vertical bar down the right-hand side of the display, rounding up the time, app notifications, and other key status icons at a glance. To activate, steadily open your device until the white-on-black preview appears.</p> \n   <p>Peek Mode integrates with Android to serve up system notifications without committing to fully opening the device. It's the company's solution to no outward-facing display, compiling events of interest into an easily consumable panel, instead. It might not be as convenient as an external display but provides the next best solution with the hardware.</p> \n   <p><strong>Best for: Quickly viewing notifications and time.</strong></p> \n   <p>Understanding the Surface Duo's postures provides a glimpse into best using its dual-screen setup. While it's only the foundations of the refreshed Android experience, Microsoft proposes some novel concepts with its modern mobile form factor.

end support for Adobe Flash Player at the end of 2020.</li>\n<li>Adobe Flash Player is being replaced by more secure technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Microsoft shared an update today on the end of support for Adobe Flash Player. Microsoft already announced that support for Adobe Flash Player would end in December 2020, but a <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/09/04/update-adobe-flash-end-support/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">new blog post</a> from the company outlines how enterprise users can get continued support. It also provides a more exact timeline of how support will end.</p>\n\n<p>Adobe Flash Player is less secure than alternatives such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly. Both the legacy version of Microsoft Edge and the new Microsoft Edge will lose support for Adobe Flash Player at the end of 2020. Additionally, Internet Explorer 11 will lose Adobe Flash support at the end of the year.</p>\n\n<p>While many sites have already migrated away from Adobe Flash Player, some enterprises still rely on it. Enterprise customers can contact Adobe's official partner, <a href=\"https://services.harman.com/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">HARMAN</a>, if they still need support for Adobe Flash Player beyond the end of 2020.

versatile gaming headsets, Sennheiser has officially rebranded its gaming series as EPOS. Sennheiser aims to bring its legacy of audio expertise to the gaming space with a wide range of purposely designed headsets. This smart business move now gives consumers a more clear distinction between the company's studio focused equipment and gaming accessories.</p>\n\n<p>I was fortunate enough to spend some time with the latest addition to this line — the EPOS 602 Gaming Headset. As someone who typically prefers wired headsets, I was very excited to test out one of the more premium offerings from the EPOS line. Immediatelly upon opening the packaging, it became clear the EPOS 602 was built with quality in mind. After hours of use and several extended gaming sessions, it's safe to say I have finally found my new go-to gaming headset.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Crystal clear audio and pillowy comfort</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">EPOS GSP 602</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/epos-gsp-602-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"EPOS GSP 602 Gaming Headset review: My new go-to gaming headset\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_gsp_602_gaming_headset.png\"></a></p>\n\n<p>\n<span itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\" class=\"article-rating article-rating--inline app-none\">\n  <span class=\"article-rating-stars\">\n                  \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar-half\"></span>\n      </span>  <meta itemprop=\"bestRating\" content=\"5.0\">\n  <meta itemprop=\"worstRating\" content=\"0.0\">\n  <meta itemprop=\"ratingValue\" content=\"4.5\">\n</span>\n\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: The EPOS GSP 602 is now the best gaming headset in my home.

The EPOS GSP 602 delivers notably better audio thanks to some incredible hi-fi drivers with a range of 10-30,000Hz, whereas the GSP 300 sat at a respectable, but inferior 15-26,000Hz. This noticeable superior extended frequency response range maintained audio clarity even during the most intense action sequences. High-end focused sounds like glass shattering or metallic scraping were bright and distinct, and low-end centric noises like roars or footsteps were present and pronounced.</p>\n\n<p>While replaying the campaign for Gears 5, the character's voices were never lost in the cacophonous wall of constant explosions, which is something I had experienced with previous bass-heavy headsets. If you are accustomed to extremely boosted low-end headsets however, you may be disappointed as those same explosions from Gears 5 lacked the concussive impact of my <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/hyperx-cloud-alpha-headset-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">HyperX Cloud Alphas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As somewhat of an audio purist, I appreciated the GSP 602's focus on natural audio quality without artificial boosts to sub-bass frequencies. The closed-acoustic design also does a remarkable job of naturally isolating background noise. Even without active noise cancelation, I was able to get fully immersed in my gaming experiences thanks to Sennheiser's expertise in this area.</p>\n\n<h2>What I like about the EPOS GSP 602 <em>design</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/epos-gsp-602-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"EPOS GSP 602 Gaming Headset review: My new go-to gaming headset\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_volume_knob.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The GSP 602 strikes the perfect design balance between modern, flashy gaming headsets and sleek minimalism. The deep blue color and vivid orange cushions add personality without diving headfirst into the gaudy cliches of many modern gaming headset manufacturers. Subtle, sharp edges, and splashes of a matte metallic finish give it a very premium look and feel. A sizeable volume control knob on the right side of the headset and an adjustable microphone arm on the left side keeps all controls contained to the headset itself.</p>\n\n<p>I also found the fairly sleek frame very reminiscent of something a pilot might wear, so there's some great roleplay potential for all the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Flight Simulator</a> fans out there. For folks who maybe aren't as excited about the orange and blue color scheme of the GSP 602, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPOS-Sennheiser-GSP-602-Noise-Cancelling/dp/B08DFXYB2T/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&#38;keywords=gsp+602&#38;qid=1599068710&#38;sr=8-3&#38;mnsid=linkomatic&#38;tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=linkomatic\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">EPOS GSP 600</a> is the same great headset in a more neutral black with red option.</p>\n\n<h2>How <em>comfortable</em> is the EPOS GSP 602?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/epos-gsp-602-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"EPOS GSP 602 Gaming Headset review: My new go-to gaming headset\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_side.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In regards to comfort and overall feel, the GSP 602 is an absolute win. The faux-leather ear cushions are thick and cozy. Wearing this headset is like pressing two mini memory foam pillows on either side of your face. The openings for these cushions are also incredibly large, allowing your entire ear to be surrounded. This huge design perk kept the headset feeling great even during lengthy grind sessions in <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles-remastered-edition-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Remastered</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There's also a fairly dense strip of cushion along the top of the headband, delivering even more sustained comfort. The only issue I ran in to with the band, and really the comfort of the GSP 602 in general, was a gap in the center of the foam, which sometimes pressed my hair in the wrong direction creating the sore \"hat-hair\" sensation, but to be fair I have a pretty massive head compared to the average person, so that could be more of an isolated issue.</p>\n\n<h2>How is the <em>microphone</em> quality on the EPOS GSP 602?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/epos-gsp-602-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"EPOS GSP 602 Gaming Headset review: My new go-to gaming headset\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_head_on.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As a low-key audiophile, my expectations for gaming headset microphones are always very low. That being said, I was remarkably surprised by the clarity delivered by the microphone of the GSP 602. It's a massive improvement over the GSP 300 in almost every way and even competes with the shockingly solid performance of the HyperX Cloud II.</p>\n\n<p>There is not much to report in regards to the extreme high or low end here, but doing side by side tests in an Xbox Party chat, my friend group all seemed to agree that of the GSP 300, GSP 602, and HyperX Cloud Alpha, the GSP 602 had the clearest microphone quality. It wasn't able to deliver the same low-end presence of the Cloud Alphas, but during action-oriented multiplayer sessions, that low-end response just gets lost in the chaos anyway. As someone who frequently plays communication-focused PVP games like Gears 5, Smite, and Bleeding Edge, mic clarity is very important and I'm happy to report that the GSP 602 beautifully delivered in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>There's also a clever mute-toggle linked to the arm microphone that offers an obvious indicator for whether or not your mic is muted. Just remember to lower that arm before delivering any crucial in-game battle plans.</p>\n\n<h2>How <em>compatible</em> is this headset?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/epos-gsp-602-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"EPOS GSP 602 Gaming Headset review: My new go-to gaming headset\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_profile.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Far and away my biggest critiques of previous models in Sennheiser's gaming headset series have been odd and clunky cable solutions. Thankfully, the team at EPOS has made enormous strides in this department with the GSP 602. The headset includes two completely detachable 2.5mm to 3.5mm cables — one with a single 3.5mm jack for consoles or mobile devices and a second with a dual 3.5mm connectors for PC gaming.</p>\n\n<p>These versatile cable options have made this my new defacto headset for gaming on any of my devices. I've been able to fairly seamlessly use this on my PC, Xbox One X, Nintendo Switch, and even just for listening to music on my phone. The included audio cables are high quality, woven-fiber with respectable lengths for basically any use case. If you're looking for a great all-in-one gaming headset, the EPOS GSP 602 can confidently fill that role.</p>\n\n<h2>Bottom line: Should you buy the EPOS GSP 602 Gaming Headset?</h2>\n\n<p>With a background in studio audio production earlier on in life, I've been fairly spoiled when it comes to headsets. In the gaming space, I've found myself frustrated because many gaming-oriented headsets producers focus on bright gimmicks and tacky buzzwords to market their products to a younger audience. While Sennheiser is officially releasing these products under the EPOS banner, the 70 years of experience in studio-quality audio equipment remains intact with the GSP 602.</p>\n\n<p>    </p><div itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\" class=\"article-rating article-rating--full app-none\">\n    <span class=\"article-rating-score\">4.5</span>\n    <span class=\"article-rating-outof\">out of 5</span>\n    <span class=\"article-rating-stars\">\n                  \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar-half\"></span>\n      </span>    <meta itemprop=\"bestRating\" content=\"5.0\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"worstRating\" content=\"0.0\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"ratingValue\" content=\"4.5\">\n  </div>\n\n\n<p>This headset delivers crystal clear audio, pillowy comfort, extreme versatility, and a minimalistic design I absolutely love. All of these great features do come with a hefty price tag however and this will ultimately be the biggest deciding factor for many customers. At around $220, this is certainly a premium wired headset, but the beautifully crafted headset EPOS GSP 602 now stands proudly as the best gaming headset in my house.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Quality meets comfort</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">EPOS GSP 602</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/epos-gsp-602-gaming-headset-review\" title=\"EPOS GSP 602 Gaming Headset review: My new go-to gaming headset\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_gsp_602_gaming_headset.png\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPOS-Sennheiser-GSP-602-Noise-Cancelling/dp/B08DFXYB2T/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&#38;keywords=gsp+602&#38;qid=1599068710&#38;sr=8-3&#38;mnsid=linkomatic&#38;tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=linkomatic\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$219 at Amazon</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">An absolutely standout gaming headset</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">For folks who are in the market for a quality gaming headset and have the money to spend, the GSP 602 is worth every penny.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK --></div></div></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wmexperts/~4/k4oWtA2RxZM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 20:00:39 +0000","feedId":13006,"bgimg":"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_microphone.jpg","linkMd5":"d834ca10b05b65f8ec99eb3902d624ca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn20@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-44-12-468_effe1c4826ec1614.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":499,"sourceBytes":24852,"destBytes":24852,"author":"Miles Dompier","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_microphone.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn20@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-44-12-468_effe1c4826ec1614.webp","https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_gsp_602_gaming_headset.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn47@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-44-18-048_ec5fc4bdb394b37f.webp","https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_gsp_602_gaming_headset_top_down.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-44-18-643_1a367e3c98783080.webp","https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_volume_knob.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn16@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-44-18-631_e9e4f0a15cffaac6.webp","https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_side.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-44-16-914_bcf5f74f8c6c3393.webp","https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_head_on.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn47@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-44-14-313_e8bdcdadfbc26267.webp","https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/epos_602_gaming_headset_profile.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn5@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-44-15-141_a4e36d6caabc2b13.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/wmexperts/~4/k4oWtA2RxZM":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295452309},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:12","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:12","title":"HONOR announces MagicBook Pro at IFA 2020","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wmexperts/~3/IQCJy8Qw7Jw/honor-announce-magicbook-pro","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p class=\"intro\">HONOR's latest laptop features a large screen as its biggest draw.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/honor-announce-magicbook-pro\" title=\"HONOR's MagicBook Pro packs a big screen into a little body\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/honor_magicbook_pro-02.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"aside news-summary\">What you need to know</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"end\">\n<li>HONOR announced the MagicBook Pro laptop today at IFA 2020.</li>\n<li>The laptop features an AMD Ryzen 5 and integrated Radeon graphics.</li>\n<li>The MagicBook Pro will be available from September 7, 2020 starting at €899.9.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>HONOR announced the <a href=\"https://www.hihonor.com/germany/product/honor-magicbook-pro\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">MagicBook Pro</a> today during its IFA 2020 event.

The <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-specs-camera-ram-storage-soc-battery\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">final hardware specifications</a> include the Snapdragon 855 processor, 6GB RAM, and up to 256GB storage, which shapes up to be decent, albeit slightly dated.

That's only just thick enough to fit its USB-C port, making an ultra-thin foldable that's easily pocketable when just 9.6mm when closed. Microsoft has also baked in inking for notetaking and sketching, with support for Surface-branded pens out of the box.</p>\n\n<p>But the Surface Duo does have some well-documented limitations, namely forgoing wireless charging, NFC, and 5G support. That helps drive down the cost, even if many features are commonplace on other premium flagships.</p>\n\n<h2>Where to buy the Surface Duo Pen</h2>\n\n<p>With the Surface Duo also boasting inking capabilities, purchasing an accompanying pen completes that dual-screen experience. But the phone doesn't ship with a pen, supporting existing Surface inking accessories, like the Surface Pen, Surface Slim Pen, and the Surface Hub 2 Pen.

Preorders for the device come via the Microsoft Store, Best Buy, and AT&#38;T, before its U.S.-exclusive debut.</p>\n\n<p>The base Duo features 128GB onboard storage, under that $1,399 price tag. Microsoft also provides the option of a secondary 256GB model, priced at $1,499.</p>\n\n<p>You've likely noticed, the Microsoft Surface Duo isn't cheap. The device falls firmly within the premium smartphone bracket, outpacing rival flagships from Apple, Samsung, and more. It's easy to find an equally capable device in a traditional form factor for a lot less, including the new, top-of-the-line Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra at $1,299.</p>\n\n<p>But the Duo's premium price comes from its distinct design, pioneering an experimental dual-screen setup. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 comes in at $2,000, although with a price further inflated by that single, folding screen technology. But it's the expected cost for an early adopter of such devices.</p>\n\n<h2>What's in the <em>box</em> with Surface Duo?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-preorder-where-buy\" title=\"Surface Duo preorders: Price, release date, and where to buy\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/08/surface-duo-press-in-box-accessories.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Microsoft Surface Duo ships with all the essentials, with the box containing the dual-screen device itself, a USB-C to USB-C cable, and the power adaptor. The package also has an included bumper case, which helps protect the edges of its glass screen and rear panels from scuffs and small drops.</p>\n\n<p>While the Surface Duo boasts inking support, Microsoft isn't shipping it with the required pen. Any Microsoft Surface pen will function, whether from an existing device, or purchased separately.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"countries\">Which <em>countries</em> will Surface Duo be available in?</h2>\n\n<p>The Surface Duo launches exclusively in the U.S. for now, but Microsoft hasn't ruled out additional regions with time. The company's roots guaranteed the U.S. release, but its overseas absence is likely to disappoint more than a few budding buyers.</p>\n\n<p>We know Microsoft has additional markets on the roadmap, with past international documentation suggesting it's not exclusively U.S.-bound. The device's model number has popped up at both <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-will-likely-ship-outside-us-based-new-certification\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Canada's UL LLC</a> and <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-surface-duo-passes-through-japanese-regulator-ahead-launch\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications</a>, with launches in further regions expected.</p>\n\n<p>Launching a phone in new markets has its unique challenges, including consideration for popular cellular bands, and navigating local carriers. Expect more to come in the months ahead, as Surface Duo clears its U.S. arrival.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"colors\">Which Surface Duo <em>colors</em> will be available?</h2>\n\n<p>While Microsoft's Surface family is famed for the brushed-platinum finish, other options such as burgundy, blue, gold, and black have emerged in time. However, with the Surface Duo, launch only offers a light-grey colorway dubbed \"Glacier.\"</p>\n\n<p>We know Microsoft has experimented with various dual-screen form factors over the years, including a black prototype in the hands of Microsoft Chief Product Officer, Panos Panay. But as with other Surface products, don't rule out the potential for additional colors with time — maybe for Surface Duo 2?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"carriers\">Which <em>carriers</em> will Surface Duo come to?</h2>\n\n<p>Microsoft has confirmed the Surface Duo will support all major carriers, including AT&#38;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless in the United States. The unlocked model from Microsoft and Best Buy will likely work with your existing plan, while devices from AT&#38;T will be tied up with the service. The broad range of supported bands suggests that the Surface Duo will function overseas, allowing for a seamless transition into new markets.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Preorders Live</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Microsoft Surface Duo</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-duo-preorder-where-buy\" title=\"Surface Duo preorders: Price, release date, and where to buy\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/08/surface-duo-reco1.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D24542%26u1%3DUUwpUdUnU79409YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fsurface%252Fdevices%252Fsurface-duo&#38;token=99bVNscz\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">From $1,400 at Microsoft</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU79409YYr%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-128gb-unlocked%252F6419335.p%253FskuId%253D6419335&#38;token=YP1FIkaF\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">From $1,400 at Best Buy</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048247%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUwpUdUnU79409YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-128gb-glacier.html&#38;token=r1i9GcJ9\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">From $47/mo at AT&#38;T</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Two screens are better than one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">Microsoft delves into the future of foldables with an ambitious dual-screen device, featuring two ultra-thin 5.6-inch AMOLED displays bound by a 360-degree hinge.

These servers can start relatively affordable, but the prices can quickly balloon into the thousands. The next most crucial factor is the number of drive bays. The higher the number, the more drives you could install, and the more capacity you can have for storing all your stuff.</p> \n    <p>Numerous vendors make NAS enclosures with some of the best models croming from Synology, QNAP, TerraMaster, and ASUSTOR. For most people, however, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Synology-Bay-DiskStation-DS220-Diskless/dp/B087ZCBWFH/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU47272YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Synology DiskStation DS220+</a> is the best choice overall.

The company revamped this enclosure for 2020, and the end result is the DS220+ with improved internals and a better CPU. It's a fantastic NAS enclosure for the price.</p> \n    <p><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Celeron J4025 | <strong>Drive bays:</strong> 2 | <strong>RAM:</strong> 2 GB DDR4 (max 6 GB) | <strong>Features:</strong> 2x 1Gb LAN, 2x USB 3.0, upgradable RAM</p> \n    <table class=\"alternating no-amazon\"> \n     <thead> \n      <tr> \n       <th>Manufacturer</th> \n       <th>Version</th> \n       <th>Vendor</th> \n      </tr> \n     </thead> \n     <tbody> \n      <tr> \n       <td>Synology</td> \n       <td>DiskStation DS220+</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Synology-Bay-DiskStation-DS220-Diskless/dp/B087ZCBWFH/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU47272YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$300 at Aamzon</a></td> \n      </tr> \n      <tr> \n       <td>Synology</td> \n       <td>DiskStation DS220+</td> \n       <td><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUwpUdUnU47272YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fsynology-ds220%252Fp%252FN82E16822108743&amp;token=NDXqWI2U\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$300 at Newegg</a></td> \n      </tr> \n     </tbody> \n    </table> \n    <h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Powerful Intel processor</li> \n     <li>2x drive bays (32TB capacity)</li> \n     <li>2x 1Gb LAN with link aggregation</li> \n     <li>Upgradable DDR4 RAM</li> \n     <li>Excellent Synology OS</li> \n    </ul> \n    <h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3> \n    <ul> \n     <li>No M.2 slots</li> \n     <li>Limited capacity with RAID</li> \n     <li>No 2.5Gb LAN</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>I may have come across a little too strongly with the \"you could get the NAS purchase wrong\" since any enclosure you pick up will be able to be configured as a home file storage hub. But picking one that has the capabilities for Plex playback at 4K or can be kitted out with ten hard drives for up to 160TB of capacity, that's when you need to pay attention to the specifications and marketing.</p> \n    <p>If we were to choose a NAS for the home that strikes a good balance between price and performance, it would be the <strong>Synology DiskStation DS220+</strong>. This powerful enclosure houses an <strong>Intel Celeron J4025</strong> CPU with <strong>2GB of DDR4 RAM</strong>, making it suitable for even the busiest of homes with numerous simultaneous connections. Want to enjoy some movies through Plex? You could even do that here.</p> \n    <p>The <strong>2 drive bays</strong> make it easy to throw a few drives into the enclosure and enjoy up to 32TB of storage capacity, though you'll more likely see 16TB with RAID enabled (and we recommend doing so for data redundancy). With two 1Gb LAN ports, you're able to connect both to your router or switch that will then allow the connection to be doubled up for enhanced bandwidth.</p> \n    <p>Its hot-swappable drive tray design allows for easy installation and maintenance, destroying the requirement for a screwdriver to remove or install a hard drive. Simply pull out, swap, re-insert, and you're good to go. There are a few USB 3.0 ports, and you can upgrade the RAM, making this a NAS you could even expand upon and use for more demanding tasks.

Do you intend to use the NAS for simply storing files? If so, what kind of files will you be storing? If you only plan on backing up several devices, you can get away with enclosures with but a few drive bays. If you want to replace your online cloud storage subscription service, you'll likely need four bays or more.</p> \n     <p>Price is essential with any purchase you make. No one wants to be spending more than they should on a product they may not get the most out of. We wouldn't want that either, which is why this collection of NAS exists to aid you in making the right decision. Whether or not you can upgrade the RAM inside a NAS, install an M.2 SSD to act as a cache and increase system performance, or hook up a 10Gb network line are all notable features.</p> \n     <p>The issue with going for a NAS enclosure that supports all the aforementioned, while coming with a powerful Intel CPU, is the price. The cost of enclosures can get real high, <em>real fast</em>. Luckily, once you've purchased a NAS, the chances of you missing out on anything in the successor range is slim, which means you should be able to get anywhere up to a decade with a single enclosure. The price doesn't look too bad now, right?</p> \n     <p>A NAS can remain relevant, especially if it has faster LAN ports, M.2 slots, plenty of drive bays, and one of the best processors you can buy right now.

If you need portable storage that offers more than an external drive, this is the NAS for you.</p> \n             <p class=\"end\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Synology-Bay-2-5-DS419slim-Diskless/dp/B07T43VDMM/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU47272YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$330 at Amazon</a></p> \n            </div> \n            <hr> \n             <h2>What about all other NAS enclosures?</h2> \n             <p>There are so many NAS enclosures available; it's difficult to throw them all into a single collection. If, for some reason, you're not a fan of the DiskStation DS220+ from Synology, but desire a similar enclosure, you could pick a similar model from ASUSTOR, TerraMaster, or another vendor.</p> \n             <p>Regardless of what you plan on doing with the NAS enclosure, you can pick a model from any vendor and have a pleasant experience. Some operating systems are more refined (Synology) than others (TerraMaster), but largely they all operate similarly, which makes switching between vendors a breeze.</p> \n             <h2>What makes a good NAS enclosure?</h2> \n             <p>A good home NAS has a few drive bays (I'm talking between 1 and 4) with enough RAM to handle more than a single connection. 512MB of RAM can be enough, but if you intend to get everyone online in the home, you may want 1GB or more for better performance. For the CPU, it's all dependant on what you plan to use the NAS for.</p> \n             <p>There are so many NAS enclosures to choose from, which span different price points and specifications. You can find one that costs very little but gets you connected with smart storage, and another that costs far more and comes with more powerful hardware. Luckily, there's not a whole lot to a NAS enclosure, aside from these few specifications.</p> \n             <p>The speed of the Ethernet ports is of no concern since there's a strong possibility your LAN is restricted to just 1Gb. USB ports are handy if you plan on connecting accessories, external storage, or other devices, and eSATA is only handy if you plan on external using hard drives.</p> \n             <h2>How much performance do you need?</h2> \n             <p>Deciding on the processor of your NAS is a tricky one to make. ARM processors are pretty good and are used in a wide variety of hardware, including the smartphones we love to glue our eyes to each day. The thing is, they don't make for particularly good NAS servers if you aim to install Plex Media Server, run surveillance, and want to do more than a single task on the same NAS.</p> \n             <p>Intel processors are outstanding, much like their laptop- and desktop-class counterparts. Even Celeron and Atom processors are pretty good. Most modern Celeron CPUs in the latest models from vendors will even be able to handle 4K transcoding of movies on Plex. If you genuinely want to go all out with your NAS experience, try to pick one with an Intel Core series CPU.</p> \n             <p>Really, it all comes down to what you plan on doing with the NAS. If you will only store files and use it as a source for storing backups, an ARM processor is more than good enough. For anything else, it's best to go with an Intel CPU.</p> \n             <h2>What makes for a good Plex NAS?</h2> \n             <p>I've added an option in this collection for <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-nas-plex\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">best NAS for Plex</a>, but what if you didn't have enough funds to cover the cost? Luckily for you, I also rounded up some fine NAS choices for running Plex Media Server. You don't need an enclosure with an Intel Core processor, so be sure to give that shortlist a look if you want something a little more affordable.</p> \n             <h2 class=\"no-amazon\">Credits — The team that worked on this guide</h2> \n             <p class=\"credit\"><img src=\"https://passport.mobilenations.com/avatars/000/001/025/1025269.jpg\" /></p> \n             <p class=\"end\"><strong>Rich Edmonds</strong> is a staff reviewer at Windows Central, which means he tests out more software and hardware than he cares to remember.

If we're choosing one that strikes a delicate balance between performance and price for AMD fans, it would be the <strong>ASUS ROG Strix X570-E Gaming</strong>. AMD's Ryzen generation of processors are dominating Intel, and the best motherboard for us from ASUS is a perfect match.</p> \n    <p>This isn't the <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wmexperts/~3/CMQeEyOZF9Y/best-motherboards#enthusiastamd\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">most capable AMD motherboard</a>, but you likely won't require all the additional features that come with splashing out on the most premium motherboards around. The <strong>AM4</strong> platform is what has been used by AMD since Ryzen launched in 2017, and the <strong>X570</strong> is the latest high-end chipset from the company. This platform will support not only Ryzen 3000 processors that are out now but also 4000 series set to launch sometime in the future.</p> \n    <p>It's possible to install up to a <strong>maximum of 128GB RAM</strong>, using the four DIMM slots provided, though the likelihood of you requiring any more than 32GB is a stretch since only intensive workstations that handle huge files (video editing, for instance) need such large amounts.</p> \n    <p>The best part about the ROG Strix X570-E is the high-quality components used throughout. This is one of the more critical factors of choosing a motherboard, as well as a solid power delivery setup. Capacitors and other performance components should be part of a premium batch for enhanced reliability and better support for overclocking.</p> \n    <p>The rear port selection is pretty good for 2020 too. ASUS included DisplayPort and HDMI (for Ryzen CPUs with integrated graphics), Optical S/PDIF out, 2.5Gb LAN, Wi-Fi, seven USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, as well as an additional USB 3.2 Gen 2 USB-C port.

The first is which platform do you intend to use: Intel or AMD? Next is the chipset. These determine the features (and pricing) the motherboard can have, with the X570 and Z490 being the best choice for AMD and Intel, respectively. More budget-friendly chipsets like the B450 offer incredible value.</p> \n     <p>Speaking of value, price is a consideration worth making. It's recommended you spend a fair amount on a motherboard. You want to make sure you're getting high-quality components and decent cooling for the voltage regulator modules (VRM), which can get incredibly hot during operation, especially if you plan to push the system further through overclocking. Components like the VRMs come in all shapes and sizes, and it's down to the vendor to pick high-quality electronics for a more stable motherboard.</p> \n     <p>The processor you plan on using can also be of importance. Our enthusiast pick will be overkill for an AMD Ryzen 3 3100, for instance. On the flip side, you wouldn't want to install an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X on a B450 budget-friendly motherboard, since this would prevent you from overclocking the CPU, and the system may encounter stability issues with other components, like activating an XMP profile for RAM.</p> \n     <p>Motherboards can remain relevant for as long as your processor can keep up with what you require it to do. So long as you do not need to upgrade the CPU, it's usually safe to stick with your motherboard and install some faster, higher-capacity RAM, upgrade the storage, and get one of the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-graphics-cards\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">best graphics cards</a>. If you tend to only buy motherboards once in a blue moon and would prefer not to buy another for a good number of years, going with our best or enthusiast recommendations provide ample headroom for expansion in the future.</p> \n     <hr> \n      <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Strix-Gaming-Motherboard/dp/B086QSH67R?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU44470YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-motherboards\" title=\"Best Motherboards 2020: For Gaming, AMD Ryzen, Intel\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/asus-rog-strix-z490-cropped.jpg\" /></a></p> \n      <h2 id=\"bestintel\">2.

This opens up support for 10th Gen Intel processors, but without the high price tag found with our top Intel motherboard recommendation. You do lose a few features with this motherboard, but it's more than capable of being used in a high-end PC.</p> \n            <p>We've got some pretty good VRM passive cooling, and MSI opted to include an additional four-pin PSU connector to go alongside your usual 4+4 socket. This isn't required but will come in handy if you plan to push the motherboard, RAM, CPU, and other components into overclocking territory.</p> \n            <p>MSI's BIOS is also pretty good, allowing you to change a whole host of settings without booting into Windows. A slight drawback to this motherboard is just how large the I/O cover is. It's likely not going to cause an issue if you have a huge full tower PC case, but if you plan on fitting the MPG Z490 Gaming Plus inside a mid-tower case, be sure to double-check clearances, especially with AIO solutions.</p> \n            <p>Ports-wise, we're talking PS/2, one USD 3.2 Gen 2 port, 2.5Gb LAN, two USB 2.0 ports, HDMI, DisplayPort, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, Optical S/PDIF, and finally two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports. You'll be able to hook up plenty of PC accessories.</p> \n            <div class=\"rows left collection\"> \n             <h3 class=\"product reco-block\">MSI MPG Z490 Gaming Plus</h3> \n             <p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-motherboards\" title=\"Best Motherboards 2020: For Gaming, AMD Ryzen, Intel\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/07/msi-mpg-z490-gaming-plus-cropped.jpg\" /></a></p> \n             <p>Motherboards come in all shapes and sizes, but more affordable ones can be just as good without sacrificing on essential features.

We've previously looked at motherboards for specific processors like the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-motherboards-for-amd-ryzen-9-3900x\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">AMD Ryzen 9 3900X</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-motherboards-intel-core-i7-10700k\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Intel Core i7-10700K</a>, as well as platforms like <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/best-motherboards-intel-cpus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Intel-only motherboards</a>.</p> \n             <p>Motherboards are available from different vendors, regardless of whether you go with Intel or AMD. For each of our picks, you could choose an alternative from another vendor and enjoy a similar experience. Usually speaking, motherboards tend to be more similar, though various factors like power delivery, component type, and features switched up to differentiate them.</p> \n             <hr> \n              <h2>Best Motherboards FAQ</h2> \n              <h3>How to choose the best motherboard</h3> \n              <p>Choosing the best motherboard for your <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/how-build-pc-ultimate-step-step-guide\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">PC build</a> largely depends on which processor you wish to use. Intel processors require motherboards with Intel sockets and chipsets, while AMD CPUs only work with respective AMD socket and chipset-touting boards. From there, you can look at price and chipset features, though so long as you spend a fair amount, you'll be buying an excellent motherboard.</p> \n              <p>The two best motherboards for either platform also allow for you to get much more from the processor than what's available from the factory, mostly with the included software handling everything for you. Other recommendations in our collection include solutions for enthusiasts, Mini-ITX builds, and those on a tighter budget. There really is a motherboard for almost everyone.</p> \n              <p>Usually, the more expensive the motherboard, the better the support for stable overclocking and the chance of high-quality components used.</p> \n              <h3>What you should look for in a new motherboard</h3> \n              <p>There are a few essential factors that should sway your decision making for a new motherboard. So long as you're not buying the lowest-priced boards, you'll generally be okay with the latest Intel and AMD processors. Here are a few things to bear in mind:</p> \n              <ul class=\"col2\"> \n               <li>Voltage regulator module (VRM) cooling.</li> \n               <li>Power delivery if you plan to overclock.</li> \n               <li>The rear port selection.</li> \n               <li>Form factor (ITX, microATX, ATX).</li> \n               <li>Choosing the right chipsets for AMD and Intel.</li> \n               <li>Matching said chipsets with the correct, supported CPU generation.</li> \n               <li>RAM support.</li> \n               <li>Features like M.2 slots.</li> \n              </ul> \n              <p>The VRMs and cooling them are both equally important. You want the power being delivered to the CPU to be clean and stable, especially if you plan on overclocking, which requires beefy VRMs for additional headroom. The power delivery with a high number of phases is also ideal, which is usually reserved for more expensive motherboards.</p> \n              <p>The rear port selection simply determines what ports will be available to you and your accessories. It's the least important factor in choosing a motherboard since most of the choices come with similar ports. Form factor determines the physical size of the motherboard, while chipsets from Intel and AMD are what help provided additional functionality.</p> \n              <p>It's important to match these to processors that are supported; the same goes for RAM. An Intel CPU won't work with an AMD motherboard and vice-versa. Some processors won't play well with slower or faster RAM, so be sure to double-check with Intel or AMD's website for additional details. Other features, like M.2 slots, are optional.</p> \n              <p>Our recommendations are a great place to start. We rounded up the very best for Intel and AMD processors, as well as options for Mini-ITX, budget, and enthusiast builds.</p> \n              <h2 class=\"no-amazon\">Credits — The team that worked on this guide</h2> \n              <p class=\"credit\"><img src=\"https://passport.mobilenations.com/avatars/000/001/025/1025269.jpg\" /></p> \n              <p class=\"end\"><strong>Rich Edmonds</strong> is a staff reviewer at Windows Central, which means he tests out more software and hardware than he cares to remember.

However, after nearly two years off from their last release, EA Vancouver is back with UFC 4, and aiming to give fans a UFC game that keeps them sticking around, while also making newcomers to the sport and game feel welcome.</p>\n\n<table class=\"spec-table right\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th>Category</th>\n  <th>Spec</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td>Developer</td>\n  <td>EA Vancouver</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Publisher</td>\n  <td>EA Sports</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Players</td>\n  <td>Single-Player, Local/Online Multiplayer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Genre</td>\n  <td>Sports</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Platforms</td>\n  <td>Xbox, PlayStation 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Cross-play</td>\n  <td>No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Age-rating</td>\n  <td>Teen</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Price</td>\n  <td>$60</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>One of the biggest aspects of any sports game is in its presentation, and UFC 4 passes the test with flying colors. While Joe Rogan's voice may not be in the game anymore, the commentary for fights and broadcast-style match the real-life aspects of UFC perfectly. Pre-fight walk-ins, social media posts of weigh-ins, and breaks in between rounds all feel like you're watching a real fight, which is something that every sports game should strive to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of actual gameplay, UFC 4 hasn't changed a whole lot, but some things are a bit easier. Fighting is still done with a series of button presses, and you'll still be able to string together various combos to land some killer kicks and punches on your opponents. The stand-up game of the UFC games has always been some of the best, and that's no different in UFC 4, as the striking seems to be on par with that of its real-life counterpart. While fighting may seem easy at face value, learning the intricacies of each fighter or mastering your own bag of moves takes some time, leaving a ton of replay value there for folks who love to get into the ring and train.</p>\n\n<p>Battling it out in the Octagon is one thing, but UFC 4 isn't just about that type of fighting. EA Vancouver spent a ton of revamping many of the modes found in UFC 4 and came back with a few new modes, including a re-tooled Online World Championships and the brand new Blitz Battles. The Online World Championship mode has seen a bit of a change, with players getting a bit more flair to their online belts with each win they get. There's also a relegation system involved, so if you start failing, you'll be dropped down in your division.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/ea-sports-ufc-4-review-return-form\" title=\"EA Sports UFC 4 review: Hyper-realism and a deeper career mode makes UFC 4 a winner\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/ufc-4-6.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As for Blitz Battles, this might be UFC 4's best mode to date. Similar to modes found in games like Madden NFL 21, Blitz Battles are smaller, bite-sized fights that pit players against each other in 1-minute matches. Each battle has its own rotating set of rules, ranging from boxing only to MMA style fighting. Either you knock out or submit your opponent, or the fight goes to a decision. If you win, you'll advance deeper into the tournament, and if you don't, you're free to join another one immediately. The goal of Blitz Battles seems to be keeping players engaged and always involved in a match, and it worked flawlessly. Not only does it result in a ton of chaotic fights, but it also forces you to think differently each time you step into a match, which makes you a better fighter overall.</p>\n\n<p>UFC's Knockout Mode has also gone through a bit of a makeover, turning it more into something you'd see out of Mortal Kombat. Players meet in the new Kumite arena, and battles are filled with old school, classic sound effects as you try to beat each other up. It might not be for everyone, but it is a nice change of pace from the hyper-realism found elsewhere in the game, and it's always funny hearing players punch each other to the sound of thunder crashing.</p>\n\n<p>UFC 4 also comes packed with a new and improved career mode. Right at the start of the game, you'll be asked to make an avatar for your fighter, and customization is fairly deep. You can choose between various presets or completely build your player to be as realistic (or unique looking) as possible, and then you'll be thrust into this game's version of a campaign. The career mode centers around your character rising in the ranks to become one of the greatest UFC fighters ever. While this isn't exactly different from the past games, UFC 4 incorporates some key aspects to break up the mundane aspects of the mode.</p>\n\n<p>New to the game is the NPC Coach Davis, a former MMA fighter who acts as your in-game coach. His appearances mainly come via small cutscenes between fights and practices, and he'll help guide you through the early stages of your career as you take on amateur fights. A more in-depth rivalry system and decision-based mechanics are also incorporated into UFC 4's career mode, with players able to build relationships with fighters via the in-game social media or text message options present. All in all, UFC 4's career mode may not be the best of any sports title, but it's a huge step up from the more boring option offered up in UFC 3.</p>\n\n<h3>A simplified approach</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/ea-sports-ufc-4-review-return-form\" title=\"EA Sports UFC 4 review: Hyper-realism and a deeper career mode makes UFC 4 a winner\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/ufc-4-5.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest changes to UFC 4 seems to have focused on was making the game a bit more welcoming for newcomers. While a complex fighting system can still be found if you dig deep enough, players who are new to the series won't have anywhere close to the challenge getting used to things that they used to. UFC 4 comes packed with more tutorial options and allows for in-game popups, allowing you to get tips and tricks as you go through a fight. In the Octagon, gameplay has also been tweaked, starting with on the mat fighting.</p>\n\n<p>In previous iterations of UFC, fights that occurred on the ground could be tweaked depending on a variety of analog stick movements, allowing players to change between getting up, trying to submit someone, or getting into a ground and pound session. While this still exists in UFC 4, the ways you do it are much simpler. Instead of having to memorize the older system, UFC 4 simply asks players to use the left analog stick to make decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Pressing it up, left, or right will result in your fighting doing one of three things, with more options branching out from there. It's probably one of the single biggest changes to the game, and it's handled very well. In previous entries, taking fights to the ground used to result in some major moments of frustration on my end. Now, though, I'm able to maneuver through them with more ease, and can get back into the fight without losing or sacrificing too much stamina.</p>\n\n<h2>What you might <em>not</em> love about EA Sports UFC 4</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/ea-sports-ufc-4-review-return-form\" title=\"EA Sports UFC 4 review: Hyper-realism and a deeper career mode makes UFC 4 a winner\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/ufc-4-3.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Many of the core functions and aspects of UFC 4 have changed for the better. There's still not a whole lot to do once you're deep into the game. Offline modes can offer some fun moments - especially in the new Stand &#38; Bang outdoor fighting mode - but the predictability of the AI opponents and general receptiveness of the fights can get a bit boring. Thankfully, the online modes of UFC 4 offer various ways to change up the pace, but if you're someone who would rather not play against real people, you're stuck to a limited set of options.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of the game modes, one of the more frustrating aspects of UFC 4 has to do with its gameplay. While the simplified fighting and general tuning of things has been very well done, the on the mat fighting - when you're on the ground with an opponent - still don't seem quite there. EA Vancouver has done a great job making it easier to get into and out of grapples, but locking someone into a submission or successfully taking someone to the ground just doesn't feel as satisfying as the stand-up fighting does. Luckily, EA Vancouver seems on the right track in this department, so this is more of a fixable problem than something that will hinder the game longterm.</p>\n\n<h2><em>Should you</em> buy EA Sports UFC 4?</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/ea-sports-ufc-4-review-return-form\" title=\"EA Sports UFC 4 review: Hyper-realism and a deeper career mode makes UFC 4 a winner\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/ufc-4-4.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>With not many other fighting game options even available to players, UFC 4 almost becomes a must-buy regardless. Thankfully, though, the game offers more than enough improvements to warrant serious fans of the sport buying it, and even has enough for newcomers to the sport or fans just looking for a fun time to check out.</p>\n\n<p>    </p><div itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\" class=\"article-rating article-rating--full app-none\">\n    <span class=\"article-rating-score\">3.5</span>\n    <span class=\"article-rating-outof\">out of 5</span>\n    <span class=\"article-rating-stars\">\n                  \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar-half\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar-empty\"></span>\n      </span>    <meta itemprop=\"bestRating\" content=\"5.0\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"worstRating\" content=\"0.0\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"ratingValue\" content=\"3.5\">\n  </div>\n\n\n<p>The tweaks to the various game modes and simplified approach to the fighting make for a much better experience than in years past. Blitz Battles and the new Knockout and Stand &#38; Bang modes are also great additions that succeed in keeping things from getting too stale too fast. All in all, EA Vancouver has succeeded in taking a franchise that looked ready for a knockout and taking the right steps in getting back into the fight.</p>\n\n<p>EA Sports UFC 4 retails for $60 and is available on Xbox and PlayStation 4.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Enter the octagon</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">EA Sports UFC 4</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/ea-sports-ufc-4-review-return-form\" title=\"EA Sports UFC 4 review: Hyper-realism and a deeper career mode makes UFC 4 a winner\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/sites/wpcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/09/ufc-4-box-art.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D24542%26u1%3DUUwpUdUnU80153YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fen-us%252Fp%252Fufc-4%252Fbpbv3pcb0x44%253Factivetab%253Dpivot%25253Aoverviewtab&#38;token=sPVHE3jF\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$60 at Microsoft</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EA-SPORTS-UFC-4-Xbox-One/dp/B08BTGSVGL/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ufc+4&#38;qid=1599192370&#38;sr=8-1&#38;tag=wpcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU80153YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$60 at Amazon</a> \n<a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU80153YYr%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fea-sports-ufc-4-xbox-one%252F6415367.p%253FskuId%253D6415367&#38;token=kkWGLFMZ\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$60 at Best Buy</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Jump into the ring.</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">EA Sports UFC 4 offers a return to form for the classic fighting game.
