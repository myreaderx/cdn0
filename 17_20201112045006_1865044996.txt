A late bloomer by every common measure, he published his first poetry collection in the gloaming hour of his thirties and married the love of his life — Greg, his partner of forty years — in the gloaming hour of life, at 81. But oh how splendidly, how fragrantly, how soulfully he bloomed. </p> \n <p>Shortly after he resigned his work with the church in his mid-thirties, Pintauro commenced a series of wonder-smiting collaborations with artists, bringing his existentially enormous poems to life in small objects of shimmering delight that can best be described as children’s books for grownups. Four of them, illustrated by the graphic artist Norman Laliberté, he called “boxes” and dedicated to a particular emotional season of life — among them <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/?p=71922/brainpickings.org/2015/07/02/the-magic-box-pintauro-laliberte/\"><em>The Magic Box</em></a> (autumn) and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/19/the-rabbit-box-pintauro-laliberte/\"><em>The Rabbit Box</em></a> (spring). </p> \n <p>But Pintauro’s most inspired collaboration, both poetically and aesthetically, was with the artist, designer, printmaker, pop art pioneer, and unstoppable force of social justice <strong>Sister Corita Kent</strong> (November 20, 1918–September 18, 1986). Entirely self-taught, she became one of the most innovative silkscreen artists of the 1960s and 1970s, suffusing her stunning prints with messages of solidarity with the civil rights and environmental movements of the era, messages of peace and harmony and love — love, as the poet Elizabeth Alexander might say, and <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/17/elizabeth-alexander-verses-for-hope/\">did say</a> half a century later, “beyond marital, filial, national, love that casts a widening pool of light.”</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Things-Joseph-Pintauro-Corita/dp/B002EK7J6W/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img

href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-God-Joseph-Pintauro/dp/0060666404/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><em>To Believe in God</em></a>, which unspooled a “trilogy of beliefs,” proceeding with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Man-Trilogy-Belief/dp/B0006CUC96/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><em>To Believe in Man</em></a> in 1970 and culminating with the out-of-print treasure <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Things-Joseph-Pintauro-Corita/dp/B002EK7J6W/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>To Believe in Things</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/to-believe-in-things/oclc/205838&amp;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>) in 1971. </p> \n <p>Corita — whose now-iconic <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/08/10/10-rules-for-students-and-teachers-john-cage-corita-kent/\">“Rules for Students and Teachers”</a> have inspired generations of artists, including John

/></a></p> \n <p>Pintauro’s poem itself is an uncommonly beautiful, buoyant, and largehearted celebration of life — of the ecstatic improbability of it, the self-enlarging and unselfing interconnectedness of it, the luminous fulness of it across the entire spectrum of joys and sorrows. </p> \n <p>With a feeling-tone evocative of Marie Howe’s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/04/23/singularity-marie-howe-animated/\">superb “Singularity,”</a> the poem opens the way it ends — by bridging science and the human spirit:</p> \n <blockquote>\n  <p>Millions of years ago, there<br /> was blackness,<br /> pure and beautiful Nothing. There<br /> was no thing<br /> in it, no star, no wind,<br /> no light, no word, no broken heart.</p> \n  <p>But a time came when perfect,<br /> restful Nothing<br /> was to vanish forever. Something was<br /> about to be.</p> \n  <p>Suddenly, there it was. Something,<br /> all alone,<br /> king of everything. Killer of ancient,<br /> beautiful Nothing. There was<br /> a silence.</p> \n  <p>…till Nothing screamed a death<br /> scream and<br /> that scream is still screaming, an<br /> expanding ring into the universe<br /> that will never end.</p> \n  <p>Nothing is dead…</p>\n </blockquote> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Things-Joseph-Pintauro-Corita/dp/B002EK7J6W/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro11.jpg?resize=680%2C346&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"346\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71928\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Things-Joseph-Pintauro-Corita/dp/B002EK7J6W/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro3.jpg?resize=680%2C436&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"436\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71935\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro3.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro3.jpg?resize=240%2C154&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro3.jpg?resize=320%2C205&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro3.jpg?resize=768%2C492&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro3.jpg?resize=600%2C385&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Things-Joseph-Pintauro-Corita/dp/B002EK7J6W/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro12.jpg?resize=680%2C706&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"706\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71929\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro12.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro12.jpg?resize=240%2C249&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro12.jpg?resize=320%2C332&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro12.jpg?resize=768%2C797&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro12.jpg?resize=600%2C623&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p> \n <p>Like any great work of art, the poem makes the personal the portal into the universal, into the beautiful bittersweet dance of life and death. Nested in the narrative sweep as wide as spacetime are a handful of poignant vignettes pinned to particular moments in time from a particular life. With exquisite subtlety, Pintauro captures his dying mother’s hopeless, hopeful cosmic bid against mortality:</p> \n <blockquote>\n  <p>My sister was told to do her typing away from the<br /> rest of us,<br /> where it wouldn’t disturb us.</p> \n  <p>We did our homework at the dining-room table while<br /> our mother crocheted big white stars according to plan<br /> on the<br /> instruction sheet. When she finished one, she would tie<br /> the yarn and flatten the star on the table: “Look boys,<br /> that makes eleven.”</p> \n  <p>We looked up, as bored by the stars as our<br /> homework. We<br /> were too young to understand, she had<br /> decided between<br /> dying and making a bedspread and her stars were<br /> all very<br /> important.</p> \n  <p>We went to bed those nights with Julius Caesar on<br /> our minds,<br /> with Napoleon, Spartacus, photosynthesis, zinc,<br /> granite,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br /> names of all the rocks of the earth and of<br /> the constellations.<br /> All that knowledge inside us, we fell asleep,<br /> assured that<br /> there are forty million mornings in unheard-of places.</p> \n  <p>While she lay awake, vaguely wishing there<br /> were angels<br /> who would accept the coming of a new bedspread into<br /> the universe,<br /> in exchange for her life.</p> \n  <p>Recently, I was going through the junk of the cellar<br /> and I<br /> found the bedspread. It was torn and unraveled<br /> and stuffed<br /> into an old pillowcase.</p> \n  <p>My sister recalls washing it once, and adding too<br /> much bleach<br /> to the machine. When she took it from the dryer, it<br /> fell apart in her hands.</p>\n </blockquote> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Things-Joseph-Pintauro-Corita/dp/B002EK7J6W/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro4.jpg?resize=680%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71934\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro4.jpg?w=1130&amp;ssl=1 1130w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro4.jpg?resize=240%2C159&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro4.jpg?resize=320%2C212&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro4.jpg?resize=768%2C508&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro4.jpg?resize=600%2C397&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Things-Joseph-Pintauro-Corita/dp/B002EK7J6W/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro5.jpg?resize=680%2C453&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71933\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro5.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro5.jpg?resize=240%2C160&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro5.jpg?resize=320%2C213&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro5.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro5.jpg?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Things-Joseph-Pintauro-Corita/dp/B002EK7J6W/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro6.jpg?resize=680%2C442&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"442\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71932\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro6.jpg?w=1156&amp;ssl=1 1156w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro6.jpg?resize=240%2C156&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro6.jpg?resize=320%2C208&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro6.jpg?resize=768%2C500&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tobelieveinthings_pintauro6.jpg?resize=600%2C390&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p> \n <p>Radiating from these verses that celebrate the vibrant aliveness of the Earth — the minerals that form “the hills and the mountains” and are also “the substance the hills and mountains stand upon”; the “red hanging begonias” that “parachute onto twinkling grass”; the ice of February — is a reminder that these living miracles exist with us, not for us.

/></a></p> \n <p>All of Pintauro’s poetry is essentially love poetry. Harmonizing the cosmic and quotidian scales of his verse-meditations is a subtle and symphonic love poem, evocative of that exquisite passage from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/16/albert-camus-diary-wendy-macnaughton/\">the diaries of Albert Camus</a>: “If those whom we begin to love could know us as we were before meeting them … they could perceive what they have made of us.” Pintauro writes:</p> \n <blockquote>\n  <p>long live our avoidance<br /> of the quadrillion probabilities<br /> of our non-existence</p> \n  <p>i am not who i was<br /> i am not going to be who i was going to be<br /> you changed all that</p> \n  <p>you are not who you were<br /> you are not going to be who you were going to be<br /> i changed all that</p> \n  <p>what is, is… and cannot at the same time, not be.<br /> what was, was… and cannot,<br /> not have been. so you see my love</p> \n  <p>we are us<br /> we are us now and we shall never have been<br /> not us.</p> \n  <p>who are we going to be?<br /> we are going to be who we never would have been<br /> without each other.</p>\n </blockquote> \n <p><a

/></a></p> \n <p>Rising above the human love poem is a grand orchestral love poem to life, improbable and temporal and transcendent life — life in which, as the great naturalist John Muir observed a century before Pintauro, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/05/10/john-muir-nature-writings/\">“when we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.”</a> These verses close the miraculous <em>To Believe in Things</em>:</p> \n <blockquote>\n  <p>LONG LIVE EVERYTHING</p> \n  <p>… but remember,<br /> everything is not every<br /> possible thing<br /> everything is only all<br /> there is here and now</p> \n  <p>somewhen,<br /> there will be more than there is.</p> \n  <p>you are not everything<br /> but everything<br /> could not be<br /> everything without<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p>\n </blockquote> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Believe-Things-Joseph-Pintauro-Corita/dp/B002EK7J6W/?tag=braipick-20\"

&#8220;Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree,&#8221; Hermann Hesse wrote a century ago in his <a

It is also an incomplete sentiment, for the dichotomy is not between good and evil but within the totality of being &#8212; something James Baldwin captured two decades and myriad miniature wars later in his staggering observation that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/08/14/james-baldwin-nothing-personal-evil/\">&#8220;it has always been much easier (because it has always seemed much safer) to give a name to the evil without than to locate the terror within.&#8221;</a></p>\n<p>A century before Baldwin, <strong>Friedrich Nietzsche</strong> (October 15, 1844&#8211;August 25, 1900) explored the complexity and nuance of this disquieting fundament of human nature in his 1886 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Good-Evil-Friedrich-Nietzsche/dp/1797691422/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Beyond Good and Evil</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft\" target=\"_blank\"><em>free ebook</em></a> | <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/beyond-good-and-evil-on-the-genealogy-of-morality/oclc/843858352&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Good-Evil-Friedrich-Nietzsche/dp/1797691422/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/nietzsche1.jpg?w=680&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Friedrich Nietzsche</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Composed of 296 numbered arguments, organized into nine thematic parts, and concluding with an epode, or aftersong, titled &#8220;From High Mountains,&#8221; this unyawning awakening of a book builds on the ideas Nietzsche had explored three years earlier from a more poetic angle in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, now examined with a pointed critical sensibility. It is at bottom a gauntlet to dogma, challenging the epochs-old notion of morality as the mere opposition of good and evil. The good person, Nietzsche argues as he hurls classical philosophy into discomposure and lays the groundwork for contemporary moral philosophy, behavioral economics, and social psychology, is not the opposite of the evil person; good and evil, rather, are different expressions of the same nature, which bubble to the surface by complex and nuanced currents of potentiality and choice. </p>\n<p>In the seventy-second argument, Nietzsche &#8212; translated here by Helen Zimmern in the early twentieth century when his works were first published in English, and writing in an era when <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/17/ursula-k-le-guin-gender/\">every woman was &#8220;man,&#8221;</a> &#8212; extols the power of perseverance over the power of vehemence:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that makes great men.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Two sentiments later, he supplements this with another necessity of greatness:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two things besides: gratitude and purity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Nietzsche places the active opposition to evil at the heart of the good, he admonishes that the preservation of this crucial purity, this hallmark of greatness, is an immense and delicate responsibility requiring constant vigilance over one&#8217;s own heart:</p>\n<blockquote><p>He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_68985\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/art-by-arthur-rackham-for-a-1933-edition-of-edgar-allan-poes-tales-of-mystery-and-imagination2361213_print?sku=s6-11742979p4a1v46?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clarke_poe4.jpg?resize=680%2C899&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"899\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68985\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clarke_poe4.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clarke_poe4.jpg?resize=240%2C317&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clarke_poe4.jpg?resize=320%2C423&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clarke_poe4.jpg?resize=768%2C1016&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/clarke_poe4.jpg?resize=600%2C794&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art by Harry Clarke for a rare 1919 edition of Edgar Allan Poe&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/13/harry-clarke-edgar-allan-poe-tales-of-mystery-and-imagination/\"><em>Tales of Mystery and Imagination</em></a>.
