Surgeons must pay particular attention to every move. Orthopedic surgeons can easily miss revealing details on an x-ray. Perhaps no job in health care requires more multitasking than nursing. Mindfulness is especially important in this field.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352721820301972?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\">new study</a> from the University of South Florida's School of Aging Studies, led by assistant professor Soomi Lee and published in the journal Sleep Health, uncovers a critical best practice for nurses: sleep. In this study of 61 full-time nurses in U.S. hospitals, an extra 29 minutes of sleep every night helped these frontline workers be more mindful while on the job. </p><p><a href=\"https://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/how-does-meditation-work\" target=\"_self\">Mindfulness</a> requires complete attention to detail on the moment in front of you. Derived from Buddhist philosophy, mindfulness became vogue in psychotherapy circles in the seventies, predominantly due to the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn. While the word tends to invoke images of seated meditation practice, mindfulness can be done at all times by anyone, making this focus on nurses especially intriguing. </p><p>Nurses are expert multitaskers—the antithesis of mindfulness, though given their job duties, juggling multiple obligations comes with the territory. It's easy to overlook a blood test or temperature check when the hospital floor is slammed. Mindfulness plays an important role in helping them stay on track without becoming overwhelmed by tasks. </p><p>Thanks to long and often grueling shifts—some nurses can be on the floor for 24 hours—sleep problems are common. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic; the emotional toll is causing  mental health problems for all frontline workers, which can result in a lack of sleep. A vicious cycle ensues. </p><p>For the study, Lee and her team tracked the nurses via self-reported questionnaires on their phones, examining eight sleep variables across five dimensions: satisfaction, alertness, timing, efficiency, and duration. They also reported their levels of attention and awareness while at work. The nurses answered mindfulness and sleepiness questions three times a day for two weeks. </p><h3>Should you \"hack\" your sleep pattern? | Vanessa Hill | Big Think</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"af84e812903700afbdc0c73e6b7c619e\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Y-qLKZWyDs?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>It shouldn't be surprising that more sleep leads to greater capacity to focus. Specifically, the nurses that reported greater sleep sufficiency, higher sleep quality, and less insomnia fared best the next day at work. The goal, however, was to track more than awareness. As Lee <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-10/uosf-shd101320.php\" target=\"_blank\">notes</a>,</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Mindful attention is beyond just being awake. It indicates attentional control and self-regulation that facilitates sensitivity and adaptive adjustment to environmental and internal cues, which are essential when providing mindful care to patients and effectively dealing with stressful situations.\"</p><p>In a sort of feedback loop, the nurses that reported higher mindfulness scores were 66 percent less likely to experience symptoms of insomnia. About <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/almost-one-third-americans-sleep-fewer-six-hours-night-180971116/\" target=\"_blank\">one-third of American adults</a> sleep less than six hours per night. <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/insomnia-brain-health\" target=\"_self\">Problems</a> ranging from cognitive decline and weight gain to automobile accidents and immune system issues result from too little sleep. </p><p>If car crashes are more likely when drivers aren't sleeping enough, just think of the number of workplace accidents—an especially harrowing prospect if your job requires sticking needles into patients and monitoring their vitals. With an <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/21st-century-spirituality/sleepless-nation-why-eight-plus-hours-is-necessary-for-optimal-health\" target=\"_self\">estimated 70 million Americans</a> suffering from some form of sleep disorder, this is an under-discussed public health crisis. </p><p>The feedback loop from Lee's study shows the necessity of cultivating both more awareness and sleeping better.

While the obvious answer of \"unplug it if it tries to kill you\" has many supporters (and it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8N72t7aScY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">worked on </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8N72t7aScY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8N72t7aScY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HAL </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8N72t7aScY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9000</a>), it isn't too difficult to imagine that a sufficiently advanced machine would be able to prevent you from doing that. Alternatively, a very powerful AI might be able to make decisions too rapidly for humans to review for ethical correctness or to correct for the damage they cause. <br/> </p><p>The issue of keeping a potentially super-human AI from going rogue and hurting people is called the \"control problem,\" and there are many potential solutions to it. One of the more frequently discussed is \"<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ai/#Sing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">alignment</a>\" and involves syncing AI to human values, goals, and ethical standards. The idea is that an artificial intelligence designed with the proper moral system wouldn't act in a way that is detrimental to human beings in the first place. <br/> <br/> However, with this solution, the devil is in the details. What kind of ethics should we teach the machine, what kind of ethics <em>can</em> we make a machine follow, and who gets to answer those questions?  </p><p><br/> Iason Gabriel considers these questions in his new essay, \"<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-020-09539-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Artificial Intelligence, Values, and Alignment.</a>\" He addresses those problems while pointing out that answering them definitively is more complicated than it seems.  </p><h3> What\neffect does how we build the machine have on what ethics the machine\ncan follow?\n\n\n\n</h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IHE63fxpHCg\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> <strong><br/> </strong>Humans are really good at explaining ethical problems and discussing potential solutions. Some of us are very good at teaching entire systems of ethics to other people. However, we tend to do this using language rather than code. We also teach people with learning capabilities similar to us rather than to a machine with different abilities. Shifting from people to machines may introduce some limitations. <br/> <br/> Many different methods of machine learning could be applied to ethical theory. The trouble is, they may prove to be very capable of absorbing one moral stance and utterly incapable of handling another.  </p><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a way to teach a machine to do something by having it maximize a reward signal. Through trial and error, the machine is eventually able to learn how to get as much reward as possible efficiently. With its built-in tendency to maximize what is defined as good, this system clearly lends itself to utilitarianism, with its goal of maximizing the total happiness, and other consequentialist ethical systems. How to use it to effectively teach a different ethical system remains unknown. <br/> <br/> Alternatively, apprenticeship or imitation learning allows a programmer to give a computer a long list of data or an exemplar to observe and allow the machine to infer values and preferences from it. Thinkers concerned with the alignment problem often argue that this could teach a machine our preferences and values through action rather than idealized language. It would just require us to show the machine a moral exemplar and tell it to copy what they do. The idea has more than a few similarities to <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/virtue-ethics-the-moral-system-you-have-never-heard-of-but-have-probably-used\" target=\"_self\">virtue ethics</a>.  </p><p>The problem of who is a moral exemplar for other people remains unsolved, and who, if anybody, we should have computers try to emulate is equally up for debate. <br/> <br/> At the same time, there are some moral theories that we don't know how to teach to machines. Deontological theories, known for creating universal rules to stick to all the time, typically rely on a moral agent to apply reason to the situation they find themselves in along particular lines. No machine in existence is currently able to do that. Even the more limited idea of rights, and the concept that they should not be violated no matter what any optimization tendency says, might prove challenging to code into a machine, given how specific and clearly defined you'd have to make these rights.</p><p>After discussing these problems, Gabriel notes that:<br/> <br/> \"In the light of these considerations, it seems possible that the methods we use to build artificial agents may influence the kind of values or principles we are able encode.\"<br/> <br/> This is a very real problem. After all, if you have a super AI, wouldn't you want to teach it ethics with the learning technique best suited for how you built it? What do you do if that technique can't teach it anything besides utilitarianism very well but you've decided virtue ethics is the right way to go?  </p><h3></h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/91TRVubKcEM\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p>If philosophers can't agree on how people should act, how are we going to figure out how a hyper-intelligent computer should function?</p><p> The important thing might not be to program a machine with the one true ethical theory, but rather to make sure that it is aligned with values and behaviors that everybody can agree to. Gabriel puts forth several ideas on how to decide what values AI should follow.  </p><p> A set of values could be found through consensus, he argues. There is a fair amount of overlap in human rights theory among a cross-section of African, Western, Islamic, and Chinese philosophy. A scheme of values, with notions like \"all humans have the right to not be harmed, no matter how much economic gain might result from harming them,\" could be devised and endorsed by large numbers of people from all cultures.  </p><p> Alternatively, philosophers might use the \"Veil of Ignorance,\" a thought experiment where people are asked to find principles of justice that they would support if they didn't know what their self-interests and societal status would be in a world that followed those principles, to find values for an AI to follow. The values they select would, presumably, be ones that would protect everyone from any mischief the AI could cause and would assure its benefits would reach everyone. <br/> <br/> Lastly, we could vote on the values. Instead of figuring out what people would endorse under certain circumstances or based on the philosophies they already subscribe to, people could just vote on a set of values they want any super AI to be bound to. <br/> <br/> All of these ideas are also burdened by the present lack of a super AI. There isn't a consensus opinion on AI ethics yet, and the current debate hasn't been as cosmopolitan as it would need to be. The thinkers behind the Veil of Ignorance would need to know the features of the AI they are planning for when coming up with a scheme of values, as they would be unlikely to choose a value set that an AI wasn't designed to process effectively. A democratic system faces tremendous difficulties in assuring a just and legitimate \"election\" for values that everybody can agree on was done correctly.  </p><p>Despite these limitations, we will need an answer to this question sooner rather than later; coming up with what values we should tie an AI to is something you want to do <em>before</em> you have a supercomputer that could cause tremendous harm if it doesn't have some variation of a moral compass to guide it. <br/> <br/> While artificial intelligence powerful enough to operate outside of human control is still a long way off, the problem of how to keep them in line when they do arrive is still an important one. Aligning such machines with human values and interests through ethics is one possible way of doing so, but the problem of what those values should be, how to teach them to a machine, and who gets to decide the answers to those problems remains unsolved.  </p></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/PVBK04iXvAA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 19:01:49 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDUzMTcwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwMzk4ODc0M30.-jlr12rMxnNhWkiZODWma59kDyu6LJb2VTzw9Mwy3v4/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C126%2C0%2C186&height=700","linkMd5":"45c7f4a2f64c679eed500a3b3b8eed6b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-04-41-537_3782293dc31b79e5.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":104388,"destBytes":104388,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDUzMTcwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwMzk4ODc0M30.-jlr12rMxnNhWkiZODWma59kDyu6LJb2VTzw9Mwy3v4/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C126%2C0%2C186&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-04-41-537_3782293dc31b79e5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/PVBK04iXvAA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn48@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-05-14-196_51e2fbd26391241f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159474034},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:34","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:34","title":"Finding joy in 2020?

In late 2016, less than a year after I was hired to be on a team researching joy at Yale University, three of my family members unexpectedly died within four weeks: my cousin's husband Dustin at 30 by suicide, my sister's son Mason at 22 of sudden cardiac arrest, and my dad, David, at 70 after years of opioid use.</p><p>While researching joy, I was speaking at funerals. At times, even reading about joy felt so absurd that I almost vowed to be anything but joyful.</p><p>In 2020, many people can relate to this.</p><p>I want to be clear: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2019.1690669\" target=\"_blank\">Joy is not the same as happiness</a>. Happiness tends to be the pleasurable <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2019.1685571\" target=\"_blank\">feeling we get from having the sense that life is going well</a>.</p><p>Joy, on the other hand, has a mysterious capacity to be felt alongside sorrow and even – sometimes, most especially – in the midst of suffering. This is because joy is what we feel deep in our bones when we realize and feel connected to others – and to what is genuinely good, beautiful and meaningful – which is possible even in pain. Whereas happiness is generally the effect of evaluating our circumstances and being satisfied with our lives, joy does not depend on good circumstances. </p><h3></h3><br/><h2>An illumination</h2><p>A couple of days after my cousin's husband died, a small group of family members and I were shopping for funeral items when the group decided to go to the place where Dustin had died by suicide. It was getting dark and the sun had almost set. As we were taking in the landscape we suddenly noticed a star above the trees. Standing next to one another in a line, we looked across the sky and one of us asked whether any other stars could be seen. There were none. We realized that there was just this one exceedingly bright shining star in the sky.</p><p>Gazing at the star, we felt as if Dustin had met us there, that he'd allowed that single star to be seen in the sky so that we would know he was all right. It was not the kind of relief we wanted for him. But for a few minutes we allowed the tragedy of what had occurred in this very space just two days before to hang in the background, and we instead focused on the star. We were filled with a kind of transformative, quiet joy. And we all gave ourselves over to this moment.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/as/english/facultystaff/potkay_a.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scholar Adam Potkay</a> noted in his 2007 book \"<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/res/article-abstract/59/242/815/1586259?redirectedFrom=fulltext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Story of Joy</a>,\" \"joy is an illumination,\" the ability to see beyond to something more.</p><p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://education.asu.edu/inside-the-academy-of-education/honorees/nel-noddings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nel Noddings</a>, Stanford professor and author of the 2013 book \"<a href=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520275706/caring\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Caring</a>,\" describes joy as a feeling that \"accompanies a realization of our relatedness.\" What Noddings meant by relatedness was the special feeling we get from caring about other people or ideas.</p><p>Joy is also the feeling that can arise from sensing kinship with others, experiencing harmony between what we are doing and our values, or seeing the significance in an action, a place, a conversation or even an inanimate object.</p><p>When I teach about joy, I use an example from my family to explain this. When my sister looks at a Mason jar now – whether in someone's hand filled with tea or bursting with flowers on a friend's coffee table – it reminds her of her son Mason. It is not just an object she is seeing, but a relationship imbued with beauty, goodness and meaning. It gives her a feeling that can be described only as joy.</p><p>We cannot put joy on our to-do lists; it does not work that way. But there are ways we can prepare ourselves for joy. There are \"gateways\" to joy that help us to become more open to it.</p><p>Gratitude involves bringing to mind the good that is in the world, which makes rejoicing possible. The feeling that follows contemplating nature or art that we find inspiring is often joy, as these are experiences that help people feel connected to something beyond themselves, whether to the natural world or to others' feelings or experiences. Since \"hope,\" as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s04zdvrBz-c\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theologian Jürgen Moltmann</a> has said, is \"the anticipation of joy,\" writing out our hopes helps us to expect joy.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Three types of joy</h2><p>In my book, \"<a href=\"https://www.eerdmans.com/Products/7794/the-gravity-of-joy.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Gravity of Joy</a>,\" I identify multiple kinds of joy that can be expressed even in today's troubled times.</p><p>Retrospective joy comes in vividly recalling a previous experience of unspeakable joy. For example, we can imagine in our minds an occasion when we helped someone else, or someone unexpectedly helped us, a time we felt deeply loved … the moment we saw our child for the first time. We can close our eyes and meditate on the memory, even walk through the details with someone else or in a journal and, often, experience that joy again, sometimes even more acutely.</p><p>There is a kind of joy, too, that is redemptive, restorative – resurrection joy. It is the feeling that follows things that are broken getting repaired, things that we thought were dead coming back to life. This kind of joy can be found in apologizing to someone we have hurt, or the feeling that follows recommitting ourselves to sobriety, a marriage or a dream we feel called to.</p><p>Futuristic joy comes from rejoicing that we will again glimpse meaning, beauty or goodness, and seemingly against all odds feel that they are connected to our very life. This type of joy can be found, for example, through singing in a religious service, gathering at a protest demanding change or imagining a hope we have being realized.</p><p>In the midst of a year in which it is not difficult to stumble onto suffering, the good news is that we can also stumble onto joy. There is no imprisoned mind, heartbreaking time or deafening silence that joy cannot break through.</p><p>Joy can always find you.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ats.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">George H.

The best policy remains: avoid contact with others, avoid unnecessary travel. In short: we're all stuck at home a whole lot more than we'd like to. </p>\n<p><span></span>After the better part of a year spent under various forms of lockdowns and other restrictions, many are suffering from an increasingly itchy version of <em>wanderlust</em> – the urge to travel – and it's becoming harder and harder not to scratch. </p>\n<p>Here's an interesting alternative: instead of traveling through space, why not stay put in the first three dimensions and travel through the fourth one instead? It's a trick performed to great acclaim by H.G. Wells in \"<a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35\" target=\"_blank\">The Time Machine</a>.\" <br /></p>\n<p>The protagonist in Wells' 1895 novella travels to the terrifying future populated by Eloi and Morlocks and even further forward to the final days of Earth, without having to leave the laboratory attached to his house.</p>\n<h3>​750 million years into the past</h3>\n<br><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8e079cb759c93a8f114d37670e2ca922\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"39f51\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDUyNTI2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNDI3ODIxOX0.uFiLQ1OVzfnxyYXG2HBVQM69-9vr5JHpGZkU8frgQ2A/img.jpg?width=980\" /><p><em>New York City through the ages.

You don't even need a lab; just go to the interactive map built by paleontologist Ian Webster. Here's how it works.<br /></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Type in the name of your hometown.</li>\n  <li>Its coordinates are 'geolocked' onto the globe.</li>\n  <li>As you scroll through the past ages of the Earth, the continents shift shape and change place.</li>\n  <li>Watch the surroundings of your location modify accordingly. Now you're high up in the mountains. And now you're getting your feet wet in the middle of a nameless ocean. </li>\n </ul>There are several ways to navigate the deep past presented by the Ancient Earth Globe.\n <ul>\n  <li>From the drop-down menu on top, you can pick one of 25 specific times, from zero to 750 million years ago.</li>\n  <li>Or pull one of 19 significant events from the menu on the right-hand side: the time of the first dinosaurs or the first flowers, the time of the supercontinents of Pangaea or Pannotia, the Jurassic or Cretaceous era.</li>\n  <li>Or you can time-travel casual style, by using the left and right arrows on your keyboard to flip through prehistory. </li>\n </ul><h3>The map of the world isn't 'fixed'</h3><br><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"17df49844a4d2fb9481c6d147946e084\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"1eb09\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDUyNTI3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNjAwNjQzM30.-e-z8c0tTN5BjqMYZAMTRQ1qRYMPRKWgPDGaDvCkrmk/img.jpg?width=980\" /><p><em>Time travel in Buenos Aires.

The map of the world that we experience as 'fixed' is anything but. The tectonic forces that shift, split and collide entire continents are constantly at work. Except that our lives are too short to really experience the changes they bring about.</p><p>But go back far enough into the past, and what's familiar becomes strange. Dry land transforms into ocean floor. Seaside towns move to the middle of strange continents. Cold climes turn tropical, and vice versa. Imagining such exotic pasts may not be the same as actually going there. But it sure beats watching the news in this Groundhog Day of a year. </p><p><em><br /></em></p><p><span></span><em>Images from the Ancient Earth Globe reproduced with kind permission by Ian Webster</em></p><p><em></em><strong>Strange Maps #1052</strong></p><p><strong></strong><em>Got a strange map?
