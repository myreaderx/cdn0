Don’t get hung-up on the mashup of genres too much, as <em>Core Defense</em> is very much a tower defense game at its, ahem, core. But it livens up this well-trodden game type with some roguelike elements and just a dash of deckbuilding, and it has proven a winning formula with players over on PC. Here is the launch trailer for the PC version of <em>Core Defense</em> so you can get an idea of what it’s like in action.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/47SFM1lvpq4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>Anyhoo, just a couple of weeks ago a major update was released for <em>Core Defense</em> on PC and alongside that update ehmprah had been working on mobile versions of the game. Those mobile versions are now nearly finished and in fact are currently in open beta.

If all goes according to plan the mobile versions of <em>Core Defense</em> will release in full on April 21st.

Shaun <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2016/07/28/a-new-layton-and-inazuma-eleven-highlight-level-5s-upcoming-mobile-releases/\">wrote about Level-5’s TGS offerings</a> that included it. If you’ve neverh eard of <em>Inazuma Eleven</em>, it is a football themed cross media franchise from Level-5 that saw quite a bit of success in Japan and Europe on Nintendo platforms. The 2016-announced <em>Inazuma Eleven</em> was revealed to be <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2016/07/28/a-new-layton-and-inazuma-eleven-highlight-level-5s-upcoming-mobile-releases/\">Inazuma Eleven Ares</a></em> for console and mobile platforms in Japan and it was delayed and renamed to <em>Inazuma Eleven: Great Road of Heroes</em>. <em>Inazuma Eleven: Great Road of Heroes</em> was <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/09/22/inazuma-eleven-great-road-of-heroes-delayed-level-5-yokai-watch-jam-academy-ios-android-ps4-nintendo-switch/\">delayed to 2021</a> following its previous delay to 2020. As you can see, it has been quite a ride for <em>Inazuma Eleven</em> fans waiting for the newest entry. Today, it has been pushed to 2023 but a new developer video was released showing off some footage of the game on Switch. Watch the new footage from <em>Inazuma Eleven: Great Road of Heroes</em> below:</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8Y1TvCglfM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>The video above reveals that the final game will not be comparable to this footage though and that the game is aimed to be a culmination of the series so far. Level-5 founder Akihiro Hino apologized for the development time but wants to reward fans with a perfect game (<a href=\"https://www.gematsu.com/2021/04/inazuma-eleven-great-road-of-heroes-delayed-to-2023-in-japan-development-update-video\">via Gematsu</a>). As of now, <em>Inazuma Eleven: Great Road of Heroes</em> is set for a 2023 release in Japan on iOS, Android, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. It was previous confirmed for the West, but as of now, the 2023 release window is just for Japan. Check out the official website <a href=\"https://www.inazuma.jp/great-road/\">here</a>.

There are no April Fool’s jokes in this article, friends. This is your safe zone with only the usual chicanery about. Compared to last week, this Thursday is positively quiet. We’ve still got a whole bunch of new games to check out, with summaries of each. Nothing huge today, but there are a few smaller games worth looking at. We’ve also got the usual lists of incoming and outgoing sales to look at, such as they are. Let’s go!</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Dungeon and Puzzles ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279004\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dungeonandpuzzles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dungeonandpuzzles.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dungeonandpuzzles-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dungeonandpuzzles-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dungeonandpuzzles-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>What a nice little puzzle game this is. You have to clear 150 hand-crafted levels by defeating all of the enemies and reaching the exit. You’re given different types of equipment to solve each problem with, including swords, bows, shields, and more. Sometimes you can directly defeat the enemy, while other times you might need to push or pull them onto a trap. The aim is to beat the level in as few moves as possible. I suppose at its core it’s a <em>Sokoban</em>-style game, but it goes to show just how good one of those can be when it has some fresh ideas applied to it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Stick Fight: The Game ($7.50)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279005\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stickfightthegame.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stickfightthegame.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stickfightthegame-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stickfightthegame-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stickfightthegame-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>What is it about stickmen that work so well in so many formats? This game sees a bunch of stick-characters battling it out in physics-based combat in a variety of arenas. And when I say a variety, I mean a serious variety: there are 100 levels with plenty of gimmicks to liven things up. There are also tons of weapons to use against your foes. Up to four players can join in on the multiplayer fun via local or online modes. Great silly action, really. The price makes it an easy pick-up provided you’re down with a game that is largely multiplayer-focused in its fun.</p> \n<h3><strong>What Comes After ($6.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279006\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/whatcomesafter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/whatcomesafter.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/whatcomesafter-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/whatcomesafter-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/whatcomesafter-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>This is a narrative adventure of sorts from the creators of <em>Coffee Talk</em> and <em>Rage in Peace</em>. Vivi goes on a journey to the place the living go after they die, and her means of getting there is a special train filled with souls of the departed. Talk to them to learn their regrets, their joys, their lives, and their deaths. This is a short, heartwarming story with fairly straightforward gameplay and some very sharp writing. It’s very emotional and heavy, so make sure you’re into that kind of thing before signing up. Quite interesting and it might just be something you get a lot from.</p> \n<h3><strong>Arcade Archives Haunted Castle ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279007\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/arcadearchiveshauntedcastle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1368\" height=\"770\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/arcadearchiveshauntedcastle.jpg 1368w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/arcadearchiveshauntedcastle-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/arcadearchiveshauntedcastle-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/arcadearchiveshauntedcastle-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>The <em>Castlevania</em> series has had its ups and downs, but very rarely did the Konami-made installments reach the lows that they did with this 1988 arcade entry. Granted, you may already know that if you played this game in the <em>Konami Arcade Anniversary</em> set that was released a while back. It has some good music, but otherwise this is a clunky, unfair, and shockingly hard-to-enjoy game by almost any measure. It was one thing to have it as part of a set with some other, better games. Buying it stand-alone? Well, you do what you want. Hamster did its usual good work on the port, but there’s only so much you can do to polish up<em> Haunted Castle</em>.</p> \n<h3><strong>Abbie’s Farm for Kids and Toddlers ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279008\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/abbiesfarmforkidsandtoddlers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/abbiesfarmforkidsandtoddlers.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/abbiesfarmforkidsandtoddlers-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/abbiesfarmforkidsandtoddlers-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/abbiesfarmforkidsandtoddlers-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>This is another one of those apps largely meant for very young kids. There are all kinds of animals on the farm and you need to feed them the right foods. They’ll also want some water to wash it all down. Nothing happens if the animals aren’t fed, of course. No risk of Tamagotchi-style trauma here. You can also collect materials to bake cakes. There are several locations to visit. It seems like some fairly low-stress enjoyment for the little ones. I’m not the audience for it, so that’s where I’ll leave it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Acalesia ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279009\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/acalesia.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/acalesia.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/acalesia-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/acalesia-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/acalesia-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>I’ll say this: if you’ve got a fiver, the Switch has got a hundred side-scrolling action games for you to choose from. Here’s another one. You play as a little pixel guy with a little pixel shotgun who needs to rescue a pixel princess. He’s also collecting pixel treasures and battling pixel monsters. I haven’t had a chance to try this one yet, but it’s not hard to imagine how it goes. If you feel the need to throw another log onto your indie side-scroller fire, this is certainly an option.</p> \n<h3><strong>Train Station Simulator ($21.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279010\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/trainstationsimulator.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/trainstationsimulator.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/trainstationsimulator-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/trainstationsimulator-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/trainstationsimulator-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>I really like the idea of this game, and the way those visuals look stirs something up in me. But it’s not the kind of sim experience I was hoping for, unfortunately. The UI is fiddly, the building options are restrictive, and it’s just a very cumbersome game to play in almost every sense of the word. There are multiple modes and the underlying systems are certainly deep enough to chew on if you can fit them in your mouth, so I’m not saying there isn’t any merit to it. It’s just that it’s not my particular flavor, and I don’t think it really plays as well as you would hope on the Switch’s controls. If you have a lot of patience, you might get something out of this. You’re probably better off playing it on your computer and pocketing some extra money, however.</p> \n<h3><strong>A Long Way Down ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279011\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/alongwaydown.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/alongwaydown.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/alongwaydown-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/alongwaydown-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/alongwaydown-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>This is a deck-building roguelite RPG, along the lines of things like <em>Slay the Spire</em>. Its reviews on other platforms are… mixed, to say the least. Most of the negative reviews mention just how buggy the game is, and I’m not sure if that’s been resolved for the Switch version or not. Assuming it has, the next hurdle apparently involves the game’s balancing. It’s a little too easy in most instances, with little reason to properly engage in the mechanics save for a couple of boss difficulty spikes. Get around that stuff, and I suppose what you’re left with is a somewhat standard take on a formula that has already been done very well by some other games on the system. At the very least, I like the look of the game. Some nice art here. I’d have to spend more time with it to say anything else.</p> \n<h3><strong>Moorhuhn Kart 2 ($29.79)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279012\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/moorhuhnkart2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/moorhuhnkart2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/moorhuhnkart2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/moorhuhnkart2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/moorhuhnkart2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>This game costs five dollars on Steam. Even at that price, a lot of players are mixed on it. I’m going to hazard a guess that increasing the price an <em>astonishing</em> six-fold is not going to change anyone’s mind. Anyway, you get seven different racers, eight tracks, and ten different power-up items to play with. There are all the standard modes, including local and online multiplayer. Between the complete lack of challenge, the weak visuals, and some questionable technical performance, I’m not sure why anyone would opt for this over any of the several other, better kart racers on the Switch. At the very least, wait until it goes on sale for three dollars or whatever.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></p> \n<p>Some interesting titles in the inbox today. The pair of <em>Atelier Ryza</em> games are very rarely on sale, and they’re both quite good if you’re into JRPGs. <em>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</em> hasn’t been on sale too often before. I’m not sure I’d recommend picking it up, but if you’re going to buy the game it’s better to get it on sale, right? There are some other good games in there, so look carefully and see what jumps out at you. There isn’t much in the outbox that gets me doing jumping jacks on the rooftops, but you might as well check it too.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-266175\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/treacherinbeatdowncity.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/treacherinbeatdowncity.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/treacherinbeatdowncity-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/treacherinbeatdowncity-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/treacherinbeatdowncity-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><em><strong>Treachery in Beatdown City</strong></em> ($9.99 from $19.99 until 4/5)<br /> <em><strong>Red Rope: Don’t Fall Behind</strong> </em>($2.59 from $12.99 until 4/5)<br /> <em><strong>Abbie’s Farm for Kids &amp; Toddlers</strong> </em>($8.99 from $9.99 until 4/5)<br /> <em><strong>Potion Party</strong> </em>($8.49 from $9.99 until 4/8)<br /> <em><strong>Under Leaves</strong></em> ($9.09 from $12.99 until 4/8)<br /> <em><strong>Brawl Chess</strong></em> ($4.99 from $9.99 until 4/9)<br /> <em><strong>Among Us</strong></em> ($4.00 from $5.00 until 4/11)<br /> <em><strong>Domiverse</strong> </em>($2.99 from $14.99 until 4/12)<br /> <em><strong>Cat Quest II</strong> </em>($8.99 from $14.99 until 4/12)<br /> <em><strong>Hardcore Mecha</strong></em> ($18.74 from $24.99 until 4/12)<br /> <em><strong>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</strong> </em>($17.99 from $29.99 until 4/14)<br /> <em><strong>Invisible, Inc.</strong></em> ($13.99 from $19.99 until 4/14)<br /> <em><strong>Don’t Starve</strong></em> ($4.99 from $19.99 until 4/14)<br /> <em><strong>Mark of the Ninja: Remastered</strong></em> ($4.99 from $19.99 until 4/14)<br /> <em><strong>Doom &amp; Destiny</strong></em> ($7.19 from $11.99 until 4/15)<br /> <em><strong>Miner Warfare</strong></em> ($4.79 from $7.99 until 4/15)</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-260569\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/atelierryza.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/atelierryza.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/atelierryza-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/atelierryza-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/atelierryza-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /><br /> <em><strong>Atelier Ryza: ED&amp;tSH</strong></em> ($29.99 from $59.99 until 4/15)<br /> <em><strong>Atelier Ryza 2: LL&amp;tSF</strong></em> ($47.99 from $59.99 until 4/15)<br /> <em><strong>KORG Gadget</strong></em> ($33.60 from $48.00 until 4/19)<br /> <em><strong>Tokyo Dark: Remembrance</strong> </em>($9.99 from $19.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Agatha Knife</strong></em> ($5.99 from $11.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>MechaNika</strong> </em>($2.99 from $5.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Necosphere Deluxe</strong> </em>($3.99 from $7.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>BATTLLOON</strong> </em>($3.49 from $6.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Fight</strong> </em>($1.99 from $9.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Night Vision</strong></em> ($1.99 from $9.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Dogfight</strong> </em>($1.99 from $9.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Survival</strong> </em>($1.99 from $9.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Guitar</strong> </em>($1.99 from $9.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Monkey Business</strong></em> ($1.99 from $9.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Teddy Gangs</strong></em> ($1.99 from $9.99 until 4/20)</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-242301\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chiki-chiki-boxy-racers-switch-impressions-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chiki-chiki-boxy-racers-switch-impressions-2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chiki-chiki-boxy-racers-switch-impressions-2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chiki-chiki-boxy-racers-switch-impressions-2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chiki-chiki-boxy-racers-switch-impressions-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /><br /> <em><strong>Chiki-Chiki Boxy Racers</strong></em> ($4.99 from $9.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>The Midnight Sanctuary</strong> </em>($4.99 from $9.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Tiny Metal</strong></em> ($7.49 from $14.99 until 4/20)<br /> <em><strong>Go!

I thought it was a late joke given today is April 2nd but I checked and this is all real. Apple not only shadow dropped both those games but also added so many classics to the service. This has resulted in some games having two versions on the store and I’m not sure how save data works between them if there’s even any overlap. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CFFAC935-AD9F-4F3A-8DA2-5D98DE789370.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1792\" height=\"828\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-279070\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CFFAC935-AD9F-4F3A-8DA2-5D98DE789370.png 1792w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CFFAC935-AD9F-4F3A-8DA2-5D98DE789370-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CFFAC935-AD9F-4F3A-8DA2-5D98DE789370-768x355.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CFFAC935-AD9F-4F3A-8DA2-5D98DE789370-1024x473.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Timeless Classics has launched with <em>Good Sudoku</em>, <em>Chess – Play &amp; Learn</em> and more while App Store greats includes <em>Fruit Ninja Classic</em>, <em>Mini Metro</em>, <em>Threes!</em> and more.

For Apple Arcade Originals, <em>NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition</em>, <em>The Oregon Trail</em>, and more have joined the service with more to come. <em>The Oregon Trail</em> is Gameloft giving players a new twist on the classic. <em>Cut the Rope Remastered</em> is a 3D remaster of the App Store classic. I’m very curious to see if Apple eventually starts using Apple Arcade to bring ports of older console games and whether this is what will be used to bring in <em>Divinity Original Sin 2</em> since we haven’t heard anything of that release since the <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/06/26/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-ipad-port-mod-support-wwdc-2020/\">reveal at WWDC</a>.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/itKd6ujyzvs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>The full list of games added today is below:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Backgammon+</li> \n <li>BADLAND+</li> \n <li>Blek+</li> \n <li>Chameleon Run+</li> \n <li>Checkers Royale+</li> \n <li>Chess – Play &amp; Learn+</li> \n <li>Clap Hanz Golf</li> \n <li>Cut the Rope Remastered</li> \n <li>Don’t Starge: Pocket Edition+</li> \n <li>Fantasian</li> \n <li>Fruit Ninja Classic+</li> \n <li>Good Sudoku+</li> \n <li>Mahjong Titan+</li> \n <li>Mini Metro+</li> \n <li>Monument Valley+</li> \n <li>NBA 2K21 Arcade Edition</li> \n <li>Really Bad Chess+</li> \n <li>Reigns+</li> \n <li>Simon’s Cat – Story Time</li> \n <li>Solitaire by MobilityWare+</li> \n <li>SongPop Party</li> \n <li>SpellTower+</li> \n <li>Star Trek: Legends</li> \n <li>Sudoku Simple+</li> \n <li>Taiko no Tatsujin: Pop Tap Beat</li> \n <li>The Oregon Trail</li> \n <li>The Room Two+</li> \n <li>Threes!+</li> \n <li>Tiny Crossword+</li> \n <li>Wonderbox: The Adventure Maker</li> \n <li>World of Demons</li> \n</ul> \n<p>For games coming soon to the service, <em>Legends of Kingdom Rush</em>, <em>Frenzic: Overtime</em>, and the excellent <em>Leo’s Fortune</em>.

So when after years of speculation it was announced that <em>League of Legends</em> would be coming to mobile in an official capacity under the subtitle of <em>Wild Rift</em>, I looked at it as my second chance to give it another try. While still technically in beta, <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em> expanded to the Americas this week, and I gave it that second try, and… I totally bounced off it again.</p> \n<p>So what the heck are we doing here in the Game of the Week, then? Well, as someone who can admit that <em>League of Legends</em> just isn’t for me, I’ve also been covering mobile games for over a decade now and have in fact tried out every single <em>LoL</em> knockoff that has come out, and I can confidently say that <em>Wild Rift</em> is head and shoulders above all of them and is the kind of effort that deserves to be highlighted… even if it’s not my cup of tea personally. (Not yet at least, I’m going to keep on trying though, at Eli’s request!)</p> \n<p>Speaking of Eli, you may recall him as the Editor in Chief of TouchArcade for a decade until leaving to start GameClub in early 2019, but he has made a triumphant return as a guest writer specifically for <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>. Eli has been playing <em>LoL</em> on PC since the very beginning, and is the perfect person to give an informed opinion about <em>Wild Rift</em>, so be sure to <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2021/03/28/league-of-legends-wild-rift-first-impressions/\">give his lengthy write-up a read</a> if you haven’t done so already for all the nitty gritty details.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNjWjwae-us\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>So, despite not “clicking\" for me personally, I can’t help but be impressed with <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em> in every possible way. Its visuals and performance are top-notch, the controls are fantastic, and the onboarding process is excellent. Even as a total <em>LoL</em> noob the tutorial gets you right up to speed, and from very early on you are very frequently being showered with cool new unlocks and items. This is one of the very best examples of a free to play game you never feel the need to spend money in, but actually <strong>want</strong> to spend money in because you enjoy it. That should be no surprise since <em>LoL</em> on PC has been a shining example of free to play done right for more than a decade now. </p> \n<p>If you’re an existing fan, I can pretty much guarantee you’ll love having the <em>LoL</em> experience built from the ground up for your mobile device and in your pocket ready to be played at a moment’s notice. It’s not a replacement for the PC version, it’s a compliment to it. If you’re a complete beginner to <em>LoL</em> or MOBAs in general, <em>Wild Rift</em> does a wonderful job of explaining the ins and outs of the genre and is a great place to start if you’re looking to get into this type of game. Whether free or paid, if every mobile game had the level of polish and thoughtfulness that <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em> has we’d be living in a veritable gaming utopia. </p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 23:13:22 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c9c76a78a16924eb44b5429883d903a1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jared Nelson","publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425404275},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:04","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:50:04","title":"‘Shrouded Citadel’, the 1:1 Scale AR Escape Room Dungeon, is Launching Soon on Android and iOS","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=278910","description":"<p><em>Shrouded Citadel</em>, Pifer Studios’ immersive Augmented Reality dungeon adventure, will be available soon on Google Play and the App Store and invites gamers to “play different”.

You’ll encounter a wide variety of puzzles along the way and solve brainteasers to collect idols you need to progress through the floors. But as the Citadel reveals more of its secrets, you’ll find yourself discovering entities that may or may not be out to get you.

In today’s article, we’ve got several new releases to look at. Nothing huge, but some decent games that may catch your interest if you’re inclined to like the genres in question. We’ve also got a massive list of new sales to check out, with lots of familiar faces and some lesser-seen ones to go with them. There’s plenty to dig into, so let’s commence with the digging!</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>SturmFront – The Mutant War: Ubel Edition ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279050\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sturmfrontthemutantwar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sturmfrontthemutantwar.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sturmfrontthemutantwar-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sturmfrontthemutantwar-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sturmfrontthemutantwar-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>A top-down shooter in the vein of things like <em>Ikari Warriors</em> or <em>Shock Troopers</em>, but a little bit gorier. In fact, the level of carnage kind of reminds me of <em>Smash TV</em> or <em>Total Carnage</em>. Well, however you want to carve the turkey, this is a really cool action game with a classic feel to it. The only thing that’s really missing is a two-player mode. You’ll have to take on this mission solo, I’m afraid. There are some hidden things to sniff out, but for the most part this is just some straightforward bang-bang shenanigans, as you like it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Street Racing: Tokyo Rush ($11.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279051\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/streetracingtokyorush.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/streetracingtokyorush.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/streetracingtokyorush-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/streetracingtokyorush-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/streetracingtokyorush-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Here’s another BoomBit driving game, this one centered around racing on the streets of Tokyo rather than engaging in any sort of simulator stuff. There are circuit races, sprint car races, time trials, and more. If you don’t feel like racing, you can roam around the game’s streets freely. There are twenty-four different cars to drive, and some traffic on the streets to make things interesting. As with most of BoomBit’s games, you can try this one out for free on your mobile device to see how well you like it before committing to the Switch version. The name is almost the same, I think they just flipped the words around.</p> \n<h3><strong>Good Night, Knight ($11.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279052\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/goodnightknight.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/goodnightknight.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/goodnightknight-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/goodnightknight-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/goodnightknight-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><em>Good Night, Knight</em> is a top-down hack-and-slash action-RPG whose chief gimmick involves a heavy emphasis on field of view and stealth. It features support for local two-player co-op, which is always a nice extra. The dungeons you’ll explore are procedurally generated, but there’s no permadeath at play here by default. There is plenty of loot to find and use, and extra challenge modifiers for those who are willing to risk a little to get some nicer rewards. If you want to add even more bite to the experience, there is an Ironman mode where a single death ends the game. This one is quite cool, if you’re into this sort of affair. Nothing to do a triple salchow over, but it’s fun.</p> \n<h3><strong>Pixel Game Maker Series Dragon Peak ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279053\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pixelgamemakerseriesdragonpeak.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pixelgamemakerseriesdragonpeak.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pixelgamemakerseriesdragonpeak-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pixelgamemakerseriesdragonpeak-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pixelgamemakerseriesdragonpeak-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>I’ll say this much: the<em> Pixel Game Maker</em> tool seems quite versatile. We’ve seen a lot of different kinds of games in this series, and this one is a beat-em-up. Regrettably, it’s not a very <em>good</em> beat-em-up. Choose from four different characters (to start with, anyway) and battle your way through a semi-open world made up of five stages, with the ultimate goal being to fight and defeat the legendary Ancient Dragon. I’ve experienced worse beat-em-ups, but its controls are just kind of stiff in a way that makes it unpleasant to play. There’s support here for up to four players locally, and I suppose if you have to do it that would be the way to get the most enjoyment from it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Gordian Rooms: A Curious Heritage ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279054\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gordianroomsacuriousheritage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gordianroomsacuriousheritage.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gordianroomsacuriousheritage-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gordianroomsacuriousheritage-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gordianroomsacuriousheritage-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>This is an escape room adventure game along the lines of things like <em>The Room</em> or <em>The House of Da Vinci</em>, and it’s not too shabby at all. You receive a letter from your weird uncle after he passes, challenging you to defeat his ultimate puzzle if you want to obtain an inheritance. It’s not quite as intricate or tough to solve as the aforementioned games, and not all of the puzzles land as you might hope they would. Still, there’s enough good in here to sustain the game through its three or four hours. I wouldn’t recommend this over<em> The Room</em> or anything, but if you’re on the lookout for something with a similar feel, you’ll probably be satisfied with this.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Well, that’s a lot. I’ll call attention to a few things as usual, then leave you to look through the rest. <em>Scribblenauts Showdown</em> is a whopping 90% off, making it a mere four bucks. Probably worth it at that price. Dotemu’s games like <em>Windjammers, Ys Origin</em>, and <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> don’t go on sale that often and are worth considering. Kairosoft’s <em>Mega Mall Story</em> and <em>Pocket Academy</em> are half-off, the best prices we’ve seen for the Switch versions yet. There isn’t too much in the outbox, but have a look through it as well. <em>Wild Guns Reloaded</em>, at the very least, is a rare sale you should take up.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on

For a while now, the coming soon section of the App Store for Apple Arcade listed <em>Wonderbox: The Adventure Maker</em> by Aquiris (<em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/20/horizon-chase-5th-anniversary-celebration/\">Horizon Chase</a></em>). The action adventure maker where you play creations made by others. The game slowly introduces you to the mechanics of the platform. The developers aim to have something new for you each time you launch the game. I’ve been very impressed with the visuals in the trailers and screenshots so far.

However, it was just one part of the envisioned game, and almost like clockwork a year after that initial release a huge version 2.0 update was released adding tons of new content and features. Now here we are another year removed from that previous big update, and Berger now considers the game finally complete with a massive version 3.0 update that has just arrived for the iOS and Android versions alongside the debut of this new full version releasing on Steam. In this new “final\" trailer you can see <em>Pixelot</em> in action for yourself.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TyCzFW1HIcY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>Ever since its original release a couple of years ago <em>Pixelot</em> has been getting praise from players <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/pixelot-by-kyle-berger.395163/\">in our forums</a> for its solid RPG and puzzle mechanics and oodles of charm. Between its initial release version and the two major yearly updates that have been released, <em>Pixelot</em> is now a pretty darn massive game considering how simplistic it might look on the outside. You can absolutely tell that heart and soul has been poured into its creation, and it’s so lovely to hear stories about indie developers like Berger making a dream game in their spare time like this. So if you enjoy old-school style RPGs and have missed this one over the past two years, definitely consider giving <em>Pixelot</em> a try on any of the platforms where it’s available. It’s just a scant three bucks on either <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelot/id1254557946\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=game.pixelotkyle\">Android</a> and the new <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1512860/Pixelot/\">Steam version</a> is currently on launch sale for 30% off too.</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu,
