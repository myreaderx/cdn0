Sometimes after we put the book we’re currently reading aside, I’ll also give them a bonus, impromptu storytelling session as I tuck them in. I just tell them a story that I conjure up on the spot. While Gus (age 10) has kind of aged out of it, Scout (age 7) still really enjoys hearing Dad’s imaginative yarns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn’t use any guides to come up with my stories, and instead just drew upon my years of consuming narratives in books, comics, TV, and movies to figure out what to say and how to (lightly) structure things. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the recommendation of an AoM reader, however, I recently picked up a short book called </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/057855027X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=057855027X&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Tell Stories to Children</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, co-written by two </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waldorf and forest school educators</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Looking to hone my paternal storytelling skills, I gave it a read. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I was already using many proven tactics on crafting stories for kids on the fly, and I garnered a few new tips too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re a dad (or </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-be-an-awesome-uncle/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cool uncle</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or even grandpa) looking to connect with your kiddos via storytelling, below I share the nuts and bolts of crafting stories for children that I’ve personally field-tested and found work well.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Master the Storytelling Loop to Tell Great Stories</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Tell Stories to Children</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, authors Silke Rose West and Joseph Sarosy say the best stories for children are structured in the form of a loop. The story starts off in reality, in the world your kid lives in; then it moves into a world of imagination where reality and fantasy mix together to create a new world, and a conflict must be resolved; then it ends up back in reality. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve been unwittingly following this pattern since I first started telling stories to my kids.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A series of stories I’ve been telling my daughter Scout for the past few years is called “Magic Mirror Land.” I basically ripped off the story of Alice in </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1949460894/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1949460894&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the Looking Glass</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064404994/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0064404994&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and made Scout the hero of the story.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She walks through the big mirror that’s in the hallway outside her bedroom door (reality). She enters a world where everything is kooky (fantasy). She’s a chicken, her brother is an elf, her parents are a dog and a cat, the sky is pink, and the sun is a lemon. In Magic Mirror Land, Scout fights all sorts of monsters to save her Magic Mirror Family. But she always makes it back to her bed before sunrise (reality). Real world→imaginative world→real world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve got similar stories like this. During Christmas time, I tell a story that the kids have a tunnel in the back of their closet that takes them to the North Pole. Before freezing to death, they get picked up by an elf and placed in a cozy bed in Santa’s house. They have a great time with Mr. and Mrs. Claus sipping hot chocolate, eating cookies, and playing with toys. At the end of the story, they get brought back to their home via sleigh. Real world→imaginative world→real world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The set-up doesn’t even have to be that whimsical. If you saw a squirrel in your backyard earlier, you can make up a story about what its day is like and the problems it has to solve — avoiding fights with birds, not getting run over by a car, collecting enough nuts for winter, etc. Then the story ends with the squirrel coming back to sleep in the tree in your yard. Real world→imaginative world→real world.</span></p>\n<h3>Use a Portal to Connect Reality to the World of Imagination</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make the transition from the real world to the world of imagination, use portals. A few favorites that I’ve used:</span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mirrors</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tunnels</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caves</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whirlpools</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closets</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forests</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wishing wells</span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of those portals are more fantastical, but by my lights the most compelling kinds are objects/structures in your kids’ current environment. Think of the types of nooks, rooms, holes, and shafts that piqued your curiosity when you were a kid, and made you wonder what they held and where they led. West and Sarosy give an example of a story where a metal drainage pipe on the side of the road turns into a passageway to a world of adventure.</span></p>\n<h3>Stir Up Some Conflict</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’re in imagination land, create a conflict that has to be resolved. An evil dragon needs to be slayed; a set of characters need to be rescued; a city needs to be saved from a slime flood. The conflict can even be just getting back to reality. I’ve used that device a few times in my stories. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the characters struggle. I usually tell stories where the protagonist is on the verge of defeat, but figures out at the last minute how to vanquish the bad guy or solve the problem. It’s a trope I picked up from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545162076/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0545162076&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Harry Potter</a>, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but it works. If it made J.K. Rowling a billionaire, it can make me an awesome storytelling dad. </span></p>\n<h3>Add Fun Details</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leading up to the conflict and the resolution, describe the world of imagination in a richly detailed and compellingly whimsical way. Remember, this is a make-believe world so anything can happen. The sky can be a different color, the ocean can be red jello, gravity doesn’t work, animals talk, cars can sprout wings and fly. Run wild. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the part that my kids like the best. They crack up over all the weird stuff I come up with and keep asking for more. When they bring up the story in conversation, they usually want to talk about all the fun details of the imaginary world Dad spun for them.</span></p>\n<h3>Resolve the Conflict</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main character has to resolve the conflict in the story. In Magic Mirror Land, that usually involves Scout using skills or attributes that she has in the real world; I’ve had her employing cartwheels to beat bad guys and beams of love to unfreeze her Magic Mirror Family (I think I might have subconsciously been riffing off the Care Bears on that one). </span></p>\n<h3>Return to Reality</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the conflict has been resolved, get back to reality. It could be via the original magic portal or through some other means. For example, in my North Pole stories, the kids get to the North Pole via a tunnel in their closet but come back home via sleigh.</span></p>\n<h3>Bring the Imaginative World Into the Real World</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can mix up the storytelling loop by bringing the world of fantasy into the realm of reality. That can create some hijinks. Think </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006RXQ3T6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B006RXQ3T6&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a>. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would happen if a cartoon character ran around in the real world? Sometimes in our Magic Mirror Stories, the characters in Magic Mirror Land come to our world, and Scout has to figure out how to disguise a talking dog and cat. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So that’s how I make up stories on the fly for my kids. Start in the world your kids know, transition to a fantasy world, come back to the real world. The more you do it, the better you’ll get at it. Don’t be afraid to goof it up. Your kids don’t care. The thing they’ll remember the most is that their dad took the time to tell them a story before they drifted off to Dreamland. </span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-tell-awesome-stories-to-your-kids/\">How to Tell Awesome Stories to Your Kids</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/z2Ef18tM-H0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:09:54 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5612e2eaee21b1c1af96d60318db8f05","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett and Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/Tell-Awesome-Stories-Header-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn95@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-24-670_7492e8f280882e2e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/z2Ef18tM-H0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-24-329_9bcbcd6dbfb0d1cd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854182928},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:02","title":"Sunday Firesides: Blessed Are the Restless","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=129745","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-129748 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/restless.jpg\" alt=\"man looking out over mountain valley filled with fog. \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/restless.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/restless-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/restless-320x197.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/restless-640x394.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a young C.S. Lewis would gaze out the windows of his nursery, the landscape of green hills in the distance would fill him with pangs of yearning. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nature would continue to stir these inconsolable longings throughout his life</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as would encounters with literature, music, art, and friendship. In these “Tantalizing glimpses, premises never quite fulfilled,” he heard the echoes of a yet-to-be-realized Paradise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We do not want merely to see beauty,” he wrote of the ache these hints inspired. “We want something else which can hardly be put into words — to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Lewis’ longings were bittersweet — marked with a sense of both illumination and incompletion — yet he described them as the very essence of joy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friedrich Nietzsche located human restlessness in the gap between your current self and your “true self,” which lay “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an infinite height above you — at least, above what you commonly take to be yourself.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For him, realizing how far one was from being a risk-relishing, energy-catabolizing, struggle-loving “Ubermensch” — a Superman — was surely disquieting, yet far preferable to placating this feeling by living as a “Last Man,” sated on pedestrian pleasures and herd-generated values.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our time, we see restlessness not as a boon, much less a joy, but rather as a condition to be medicated, therapized, or palliated by booking another vacation. But philosophers as different as Nietzsche and Lewis realized that restlessness is not a problem to be solved, but a pointer to be followed. For both it was a spur to seek for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> — for the beauty, strength, and potential which transcend the ordinary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restlessness saves us from the soul-shriveling belief that infinite longings can ever be satisfied by finite fare. Rather than being an irritating curse, it’s a vitalizing blessing. </span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-blessed-are-the-restless/\">Sunday Firesides: Blessed Are the Restless</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/SmdGYcF23b0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 01:39:04 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"fe5ca9b8d5aeeb76fb19cf79d62b9d3c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett &#38; Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/restless.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn8@2020_1/2020/10/28/03-03-24-424_ba0a1430711cfb14.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/SmdGYcF23b0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn99@2020_5/2020/10/28/03-03-28-566_dd7b2b95725fc1d8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854182928},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:02","title":"Podcast #654: How to Astronaut","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=129720","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe title=\"#654: How to Astronaut\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/654-how-to-astronaut/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<div>If you grew up in the ‘80s like me, there’s a good chance you really wanted to go to space camp and you really wanted to be an astronaut.

Terry and I begin our conversation with the plan he set in childhood to become an astronaut via going to the Air Force Academy and becoming a pilot. We talk about how long it took him to make it to space once he joined NASA, the training he underwent for years which required being a skill-acquiring polymath, and how aspects of that training, which included flying jets and wilderness survival courses, didn’t always directly correlate to his job as an astronaut, but were still essential in being adept at it. We also discuss the physical training Terry did both before his missions and after leaving the earth, and whether he suffered any long-term health issues from being in space. From there we get into what a typical day is like when you’re floating through sixteen sunsets, including what space food looks like these days and whether they’re really eating “astronaut ice cream” up there, what it’s like to sleep while weightless, and of course, that most burning of questions, “How do you go the bathroom in space?” We then discuss the importance of emotional and mental skills when you’re living for months at a time in a space station, and what it was like to leave that station to take a spacewalk and see the earth from above. We end our conversation with how Terry physically and psychologically adjusted to returning to earth, whether he yearns to go back up again, and what he thinks the future of space exploration holds.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Consider this show the stint at space camp your parents never signed off on.</div>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>What got Terry started dreaming about being an astronaut </li>\n<li>The importance of learning how to learn </li>\n<li>How long it took Terry to get to space </li>\n<li>What the training is like, particularly flying the T-38 </li>\n<li>Getting physically fit for space travel </li>\n<li>The physical problems with long-term space travel </li>\n<li>What does a day in the life of an astronaut look like?</li>\n<li>The straight dope on space food </li>\n<li>Sleeping, peeing, and every other weird daily hygiene routine</li>\n<li>The psychological toll of space travel </li>\n<li>The dangerous reality of space walks </li>\n<li>What it’s like coming back to earth </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312427565/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0312427565&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Right Stuff</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/learn-new-skills-quickly/\">Grow, Adapt, and Reinvent Yourself With Ultralearning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-385-make-stick/\">Learning How to Learn</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_T-38_Talon\">Northrop T-38</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/analogs/nsrl/why-space-radiation-matters/\">Space Radiation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.omegawatches.com/en-us/watches/speedmaster/skywalker-x-33/skywalker-x-33/product\">Omega Skywalker X-33</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BDBDT21/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B07BDBDT21&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Astronaut Ice Cream</a></li>\n<li>Skydiving From Space: <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/skydiving-from-space-part-i-joseph-w-kittingers-long-lonely-leap/\">Part I</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/skydiving-from-space-part-ii-nick-piantanidas-magnificent-failure/\">Part II</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/15-constellations-every-man-should-know/\">15 Constellations Every Man Should Know</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129725\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0548.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"340\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0548.jpg 340w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0548-320x471.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Terry</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://terryvirts.com/\">Terry’s website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/astro_terry/\">Terry on Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AstroTerry\">Terry on Twitter</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

If you’re like me, you kinda treat it like the junk drawer of your entire house. Stuff slowly makes its way there, and then stays there. To get to something you want, you have to claw your way through a pile of other stuff. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-organize-your-garage/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had made an effort at organizing my garage five years ago</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which had certainly helped tame the chaos. But over time, things started to devolve. Not only were my general household tools and things getting harder to find and access, but the area of the garage dedicated to our home gym began to feel more cluttered and disordered. I had acquired more pieces of equipment and failed to incorporate them and set up the area in a way that felt clean and inviting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The central issue wasn’t having too much stuff; I’m not a hoarder. Though I did need to get rid of some things, most of the stuff I kept in the garage was stuff I used and wanted to keep. What I really needed was a better way to organize it.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Biggest Key to Organizing Your Garage: Get Your Stuff Off the Floor</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I follow Coop over at </span><a href=\"https://garagegymreviews.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Garage Gym Reviews</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and one thing he hits on over and over again when it comes to organizing your garage gym is: “Get your crap off the floor.” </span></p>\n<p>This is an admonition that applies as readily to garage gyms as to any kind of garage and every area of a garage. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to get things off the floor, is to put them on your walls. Walls are underutilized areas for storage. When you hang things up on the wall, you free up floor space in your garage and make the area feel less cluttered. It also makes getting to stuff easier. Instead of reaching over things to get what you need, you walk up to the wall where the item has been hung and take it off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recently used Coop’s advice to rework not just my garage gym but my garage as a whole, and it’s been a game-changer. The place looks great, I’ve opened up floor space, and things are easier to access. Getting your stuff off the floor really is the biggest key in organizing your garage.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">How to Get Stuff Off the Floor and Up on the Walls</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below I’ll show you before and after pics of some areas of the garage I organized using the get-your-stuff-off-the-floor principle and offer tips on how you can do likewise.</span></p>\n<h3>Racks</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Racks provided me the most significant ROI in freeing up floor space. There are racks for all sorts of things.</span></p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-129860 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/wallrackbeforeafter.4jpg.jpg\" alt=\"before and after of racks in a garage.\" width=\"500\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/wallrackbeforeafter.4jpg.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/wallrackbeforeafter.4jpg-320x426.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a rack on which to hang things like shovels, rakes, brooms, and hoes is something I did during my previous reorganizing effort several years back. This time around I extended the idea to other clutter-creating items, like our bikes.</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_129852\" style=\"width: 610px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-129852\" class=\"wp-image-129852 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/2C923642-270E-46F7-941A-0140FA1C7444.jpg\" alt=\"before and after of bike storage in a garage. \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/2C923642-270E-46F7-941A-0140FA1C7444.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/2C923642-270E-46F7-941A-0140FA1C7444-320x320.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-129852\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In addition to getting stuff off the floor, getting rid of some things we weren’t using helped too. For example, we had that old desk and end table sitting in our garage for years, thinking we’d use them someday. But we eventually realized we likely never would and got rid of them. Regularly prune your possessions. </p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I bought this <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Tukd3c\">bike rack</a> on Amazon. I don’t know why I didn’t purchase it earlier. With my bikes hanging from the wall, I’ve freed up a lot of floor space, but more importantly, the bikes are just easier to get to now. Before, they were pretty much stacked on top of each other, so if I wanted my bike at the end of the stack, I’d have to move the other bikes to get to it. Such a pain in the butt. Now I go to the bike I want and take it off the wall. Easy peasy. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_129865\" style=\"width: 610px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-129865\" class=\"wp-image-129865 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/0AE7718E-8B74-4598-A96F-E8F0D0472E22.jpg\" alt=\"before and after of dumbell and barbell storage in a garage gym. \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/0AE7718E-8B74-4598-A96F-E8F0D0472E22.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/0AE7718E-8B74-4598-A96F-E8F0D0472E22-320x320.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-129865\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">While getting something onto the wall is the ideal way to get something off the floor, it’s hard to hang up dumbbells and kettlebells. But I did still give them a lift and reduce their footprint by getting this <a href=\"https://www.titan.fitness/organize/freestanding-storage/mass-storage-system/45-inch-2-tier-mass-storage-system/400321.html\">dumbbell/kettlebell rack from Titan Sports</a>. </p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_129853\" style=\"width: 610px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-129853\" class=\"wp-image-129853 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/BDBBB99D-078B-421E-A4EC-B190DE0B0D40.jpg\" alt=\"before and after of organized garage gym area. \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/BDBBB99D-078B-421E-A4EC-B190DE0B0D40.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/BDBBB99D-078B-421E-A4EC-B190DE0B0D40-320x320.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-129853\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A wider look at the before and after.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third rack I installed was for my barbells. I’ve got a bunch of barbells now, and they were taking up a lot of space. I stored a few of them in a <a href=\"https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-9-bar-holder-2-0?utm_source=bing&#38;utm_medium=cpc&#38;utm_campaign=Rogue%20FItness%20-%20Shopping%20Campaign&#38;utm_term=1101011992458&#38;utm_content=All%20Products\">Rogue 9 Bar Holder</a>, but this vertical holder had some drawbacks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, I couldn’t store all my barbells in it, particularly my specialty barbells like my <a href=\"https://store.kabukistrength.net/products/duffalo-performance-squat-bar\">Duffalo bar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.roguefitness.com/sb-1-rogue-safety-squat-bar\">safety squat bar</a>, and deadlift bar. They’re just too long and my ceilings too short for me to store vertically. So those bars were lying on the floor, taking up floor space. Lame. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, while the vertical bar holder doesn’t take up too much room, it still squatted on precious floor space in my garage gym. The tall structure created a physical and optical obstacle that made it hard to navigate the area and created a cluttered feeling. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So I bought the <a href=\"https://www.roguefitness.com/the-rogue-gun-rack\">V2 Gun Rack from Rogue</a>. This storage rack holds up to six barbells — on your wall. I’ve got pretty much all my barbells off the floor now, even the big specialty barbells. I’ve freed up a bunch of floor space, the garage feels tidier, and it just looks super rad having a bunch of barbells hanging on my wall. </span></p>\n<h3>Wall-Mounted Shelves</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-129862 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/wallshelf.jpg\" alt=\"shelves mounted on the wall of a garage for storage. \" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/wallshelf.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/wallshelf-320x214.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These shelves were another thing I put in during my previous round of organizing. They’re easy and cheap to install. Just get some brackets and 1×12 boards. Bam. They allowed me to get lots of little doodads off the floor.</span></p>\n<h3>Hooks</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_129851\" style=\"width: 460px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-129851\" class=\"wp-image-129851\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0575-2.jpg\" alt=\"hooks mounted on a pillar to hang jump ropes, belt, resistance bands, and more.\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0575-2.jpg 500w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/IMG_0575-2-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-129851\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I have hooks on three sides of this pillar, on which hang very hook-friendly gym equipment: jump ropes, weightlifting belts, resistance bands, and TRX straps. I still need to get <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3kyXeQz\">a wall-mounted storage hook</a> around which to wrap our battle rope.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hooks are cheap and should be used without abandon.

There are no surefire handbooks that infallibly lead you to your true vocation in three easy steps; there are no blog posts that can explain the entire meaning of life. Rather it’s a lifelong process of searching and refining; the answers you find now will change over time, as study and life experience broaden your perspective.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, while easy answers to finding meaning and purpose can’t be served up on a silver platter, guideposts exist which can point your search in the right direction. You’ll find five such thought-stimulating guideposts below — episodes of the AoM podcast with guests who offer particularly good guidance on finding your calling and living with a greater sense of significance. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/podcast/\">Check out our podcast archives for even more episodes on the subject, and to listen to shows on a wide variety of other topics</a>; sometimes, it’s not when we’re pondering meaning and purpose directly, but rather thinking about something seemingly unrelated, that we get an insight that connects life’s big dots.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/find-your-true-calling/\">A Guide for the Journey to Your True Calling</a></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/616-a-guide-for-the-journey-to-your-true-calling/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>What are you meant to do with your life? Guidance on this question can come from many sources; psychotherapist and yoga teacher Stephen Cope says that one of the best is the <em>Bhagavad Gita. </em>In this episode he unpacks how this ancient scripture can point you towards your true calling. This includes exploring the three areas of your life that can clue you in to your life’s purpose, and why that purpose may be small and quiet rather than big and splashy. </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-635-the-existentialists-survival-guide/\">The Existentialist’s Survival Guide</a></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/635-the-existentialists-survival-guide/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Befitting its name, the existentialist branch of philosophy wrestles with the question of our very existence. What does it mean to be a free and individual human being? What makes this messy life worth it? In this interview, Professor Gordon Marino helps unpack those questions, bringing insight not only as a scholar but also as a football and boxing coach. After listening you’ll be better equipped to survive the setbacks, emotions, and general angst that comes with personhood. </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-397-the-3-pillars-of-a-meaningful-life/\">Finding Fulfillment in a World Obsessed With Happiness</a></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/397-finding-fulfillment-in-a-world-obsessed-with-h/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>What if searching for happiness actually results in unhappiness, and to get happiness we need to be looking for something else? This interview with Emily Esfahani Smith gets into the difference between happiness and meaning, the three pillars of a meaningful life (and how we can experience them), and whether meaning requires a spiritual or faith tradition. You’ll come away from this interview looking differently at not only your life as a whole, but also at the makeup of how you spend your days. </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/david-brooks-second-mountain/\">The Quest for a Moral Life</a></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/518-the-quest-for-a-moral-life/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Do you sometimes feel that from an outside perspective you seem to be doing okay, but inwardly you feel kind of empty? This is because, as David Brooks argues, you’re stuck on life’s “first mountain.” The climb up this first mountain is focused on <em>you</em>: getting a college degree, starting a career, falling in love, buying a home, and making your mark on the world. Those are good things, and necessary even, but eventually start to feel unfulfilling on their own. That’s when we discover there’s a second mountain to ascend — a path of selflessness, relationships, and being more generative. In this episode, you’ll get a bead on pursuing this moral quest. </p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-find-your-calling-in-life/\">How to Find Your Calling in Life</a></h3>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/556-how-to-find-your-calling-in-life/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>You might think that your calling is the same thing as your career or vocation. My guest in this episode, Gregg Levoy, says that’s not necessarily the case. Callings — emotional, psychological, and spiritual nudges — can be big or small, and might involve a job change, or something as simple as reaching out to a friend. Gregg walks us through how to better attune yourself to their signals, how to discern if something you think is a calling actually is or not, and how to respond if the answer is affirmative.</p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/best-podcast-episodes-on-finding-meaning-and-purpose/\">The 5 Best AoM Podcast Episodes on Finding Meaning and Purpose</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/ahQatrSFDME\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 15:13:25 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6cbc18fde95e61f0b4d41a1cd18e1f87","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"AoM Team","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/purpose_podcasts.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn39@2020_2/2020/10/28/03-03-24-295_645b6b6d0928ed91.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/ahQatrSFDME":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn23@2020_5/2020/10/28/03-03-24-484_2276300d4a4490db.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603854182928},{"createdTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:02","updatedTime":"2020-10-28 11:03:02","title":"Podcast #655: Simple, Excuse-Busting Advice for Getting in Shape","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=129783","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe title=\"#655: Simple, Excuse-Busting Advice for Getting in Shape\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/655-simple-excuse-busting-advice-for-getting-in-sh/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>When it comes to getting in shape, there are always a bunch of excuses to use as to why you can’t get yourself in gear: you don’t know what program to start, you don’t have time, you don’t have any equipment, etc., etc. </p>\n<p>My guest today cuts through those excuses and the unnecessary complications people often bring to health and fitness to show us how you can lose weight and get strong in ways that are wonderfully simple, but powerfully effective. His name is <a href=\"http://danjohn.net/\">Dan John</a>, he’s a strength and throwing sports coach, a writer of many books and articles on health and fitness, and a college lecturer. We begin our conversation with Dan’s two foundational approaches to simplifying your life called “shark habits” and “pirate maps,” which will help you organize and streamline all your decisions, in turn helping you focus on and stay consistent with your diet and workouts. We talk about the way being part of an intentional community can keep you on track with your fitness goals as well. From there we get into Dan’s quadrants for eating and exercise — Reasonable Workouts/Tough Diet; Reasonable Workouts/Reasonable Diet; Tough Workouts/Reasonable Diet; Tough Workouts/Tough Diet — and when you should be in one quadrant or another. We then talk about a very simple way to get started lifting called the “One-Two-Three” method, Dan’s highly effective 10,000 Swing Kettlebell challenge, and how you can still work out even if all you have is a single dumbbell. We also talk about one of the most effective bodyweight exercises, the pull-up, and the overlooked key to working your way into them if you can’t do even a single rep right now. We then talk about why Dan thinks you should exercise outside more often and the difference between health and fitness. We end our conversation with Dan’s prescription for losing weight.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Dan’s best advice to get into a regular exercise habit </li>\n<li>How shark habits free up your mind </li>\n<li>How pirate maps help you achieve your goal </li>\n<li>The power of intentional community </li>\n<li>Dan’s Reasonable/Tough, Diet/Workout quadrant </li>\n<li>Vegetables for breakfast?! </li>\n<li>Why you shouldn’t necessarily feel destroyed by your workouts </li>\n<li>The infamous 10,000 kettlebell swing challenge</li>\n<li>What size kettlebell should you use?</li>\n<li>Getting a workout with a single dumbbell </li>\n<li>Why Dan advocates for exercising outside</li>\n<li>How do you lose weight and keep it off?</li>\n<li>Keeping your gut biome healthy  </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-exercise-well-rounded-man/\">My first interview with Dan on being a well-rounded man</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/make-exercise-a-sustainable-habit/\">Counterintuitive Advice on Making Exercise a Sustainable Habit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/10-best-tactics-making-exercise-unbreakable-habit/\">The 10 Best Ways to Make Exercise an Unbreakable Habit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-589-how-exercise-helps-us-find-happiness-hope-connection-and-courage/\">How Exercise Helps Us Find Happiness, Hope, Connection, and Courage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://onemomentcompany.com/\">One Moment Meditation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.brain.fm/\">brain.fm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/declutter-office-digital-work-life/\">Declutter Your Digital Life</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/home-gym/\">Everything You Need to Know About Creating a Home Gym</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.danjohnuniversity.com/\">Dan’s Workout Generator</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-324-fitness-fellowship-faith-cure-sad-clown-syndrome/\">Fitness, Fellowship, and Faith</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-keep-it-off/\">How to Lose Weight and Keep It Off Forever</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-intermittent-fasting/\">The Pros and Cons of Intermittent Fasting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/the-10000-swing-kettlebell-workout-revisited\">The 10,000 Swing Kettlebell Challenge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/pull-ups-fitness-routine/\">Do More Than One Stinking Pull Up</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-129784\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/10/attempts.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"317\" height=\"475\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Dan</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CoachDanJohn1?fref=ts\">Dan on Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://danjohn.net/\">Dan’s website</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!

This article was originally published in September 2009.</em></p>\n<p>In 1926, strong man and physical culture enthusiast Earle Liederman wrote a book called <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3m77mQL\">Endurance</a>. </em>In it, Liederman makes the case for developing all-around strength and fitness as a way of not only preserving one’s health in the everyday sense of extending longevity, but protecting it under extraordinary and acutely threatening circumstances. </p>\n<p>According to Liederman:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Every man should be able to save his own life</strong>. He should be able to swim far enough, run fast and long enough to save his life in case of emergency and necessity. He also should be able to chin himself a reasonable number of times, as well as to dip a number of times, and he should be able to jump a reasonable height and distance.</p>\n<p>If he is of the fat, porpoise type, naturally he cannot do all, if any, of these things; he has nobody to blame but himself, and his way of living that has brought his body into its condition of obesity.</p>\n<p>Suppose—and it has happened many times—there should be a fire at sea or on lake or river; should one be half a mile or more from the shore, he would be mighty thankful to realize, were he compelled to jump for his life from the fire, that he could swim that distance and reach the shore in safety.</p>\n<p>Suppose one were in a burning building and he had to lower himself hand under hand down a rope or down an improvised rope of bedclothing tied together to reach the ground in safety; he again would be thankful a thousand times that he possessed the strength and endurance in his arms and coordinate muscles that would enable him to save himself. Such things never may happen, and let us hope they do not, but what has happened always is possible to occur again—and, in fact, always is happening to someone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Liederman did “not believe in everyone striving to be a long distance swimmer, a long distance runner, or any kind of endurance athlete,” he argued that every man should be able to achieve the following 5 fitness benchmarks:</p>\n<h3>Swim at least half a mile or more</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2009/09/swimming.png\"><img style=\" display:
