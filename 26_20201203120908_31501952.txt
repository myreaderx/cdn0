From that vantage point, it’s capable of capturing and analyzing data across the construction site.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;You can only improve what you can measure, and at Versatile we are just scratching the surface of what we can do to create value for our users and use data to turn job sites into controlled manufacturing with fast feedback loops,” co-founder and CEO Meirav Oren said in a release tied to the news.</p>\n<p>The company says it’s able to use that information to provide a picture of construction progress, with additional information on site materials, while targeting any potential redundancy in the space.</p>\n<p>With around $10 trillion currently spent on construction each year, the industry is prime for some big-ticket investments.

What if it was more Pixar-like?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sketchy.com/\">Sketchy</a>, a visual learning platform, takes complex material that a med student might need to memorize for an exam, and puts the information in an illustrated scene. For example, it uses a countryside kingdom to explain the coronavirus, or a salmon dinner to explain Salmonella. The goal is for a student to be able to mentally go back to the scene while taking an exam, walk through it and retrieve all of the information.</p>\n<p>While Sketchy’s strategy might seem odd, it’s actually well-known. The &#8220;memory palace&#8221; technique matches objects to concepts for easier memorization. So far, Sketchy has more than 30,000 paid subscribers and is on track to hit $7 million in revenue this year.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>To charge this growth and break into new content verticals, Sketchy is taking venture capital on for the first time in its seven-year history. Last month, the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200924005067/en/Leading-Online-Education-Startup-SketchyMedical-Secures-30-Million-Investment-From-TCG\">team announced</a> that it has raised a $30 million Series A led by <a href=\"https://tcg.co/\">The Chernin Group</a> (TCG). Today, some of those shares were sold in a secondary transaction <a href=\"https://www.reachcapital.com/\">Reach Capital,</a> which now accounts for $3 million of the financing.  It’s a big combined investment for a company that has been bootstrapping since birth &#8212; and the deal could help us see where online education is heading.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"NIkRbOwkV4\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold/\">Edtech investors are panning for gold</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Edtech investors are panning for gold&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold/embed/#?secret=NIkRbOwkV4\" data-secret=\"NIkRbOwkV4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The capital comes as Sketchy itself looks to grow past a content service for med students, and into an education platform tackling information in critical fields, from legal to nursing. With the new money, Sketchy plans to build an in-house animation studio and hire more artists and doctors, some of whom are currently consultants.</p>\n<h2><strong>The story</strong></h2>\n<p>A big part of Sketchy’s magic, and effectiveness, comes from the fact that all of its founding team have experience in medicine.</p>\n<p>The company began in 2013 when then-med students Saud Siddiqui and Andrew Berg were in desperate need of a better study solution for microbiology. To liven up their studying, Berg and Siddiqui began weaving characters into stories to try to memorize concepts &#8212; and after a few good test scores, they started creating stories for their classmates.</p>\n<p>“Neither Saud or I were artists, so they were pretty bad,” Berg said. As demand continued, the duo put their scraggly sketches on YouTube. Eventually, Siddiqui and Berg roped in classmate Bryan Lemieux, a good artist, to tell the stories with them. Eventually Bryan brought on his twin brother, Aaron, and the founding team was born.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to today: Siddiqui and Berg have finished their residencies in emergency medicine, while the Lemieux brothers chose to leave medicine. All have moved full-time to the company after trying to balance both jobs. Still, the knowledge from working in the field continues to be useful.</p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s name has evolved: born as SketchyMedical, it has since rebranded to just Sketchy. While the team chose the name to nod toward its focus on art, the name also has negative connotations. Expect a rebrand in the future.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the company claims that it is used by a third of med students in the United States. The majority of its revenues come from 12-month subscriptions for students looking to prep for med school exams like Step 1, and Step 2.</p>\n<p>While B2C is a promising business model for many reasons (it’s always easier to convince a human to pay instead of a entire, red-tape-bound institution), the company has also posted promising B2B growth. So far, 20% of its revenue comes from direct contracts it has with medical schools. The founders said that they will pursue both growth methods for now, but based on the price of med school (and student debt crisis), it would be great to see them grow through school contracts so students don&#8217;t have to face the brunt of costs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Beyond the coronavirus </strong></h2>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/reach-capital\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"reach-capital\">Reach Capital’s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Jennifer Carolan, an investor in Sketchy, said that Sketchy’s product market fit with med students is a “strong signal that their content is worth it.” Even with competitors such as Picorize and Medcomic, she’s confident that Sketchy’s product is defensible and can expand into new verticals. Part of the reason the firm approached Sketchy to invest in them is because of low customer acquisition costs, <a href=\"https://reachcapital.medium.com/sketchy-5b57affb5ad4\">Carolan notes in a blog post. </a></p>\n<p>That said, unlike most edtech companies, which have enjoyed surging new user demand thanks to remote learning, Sketchy didn’t have a huge COVID-19 boom.</p>\n<p>“We weren&#8217;t one of those people that hadn&#8217;t found product market fit and then exploded after COVID,” said Berg. “We’ve always been there and been growing.”</p>\n<p>So the real trigger for today’s fundraise wasn’t COVID-19 momentum, but instead, a push to capitalize its sustained growth into more digital curriculum verticals.</p>\n<p>Long-term, think of Sketchy as joining a chorus of startups, including Top Hat Jr and Newsela, that want to replace textbook publishers. In a remote world, live, moving content is more rapidly losing value, and upstarts are trying to replace them with more effective and engaging content.</p>\n<p>“One of the challenges is just to make sure we don&#8217;t go too fast,” Siddiqui said. “We want to keep that degree of quality we’ve maintained for so many years, and do it at scale.”</p>\n<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The original version of this story stated that Sketchy had raised $32 million. This is incorrect. The company raised $30 million along with a secondary transaction from Reach Capital. </em></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cj6RkYOzGa\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call/\">Equity Dive: Edtech’s 2020 wakeup call</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Equity Dive: Edtech’s 2020 wakeup call&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call/embed/#?secret=cj6RkYOzGa\" data-secret=\"cj6RkYOzGa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/GfCzZijhnlo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 22:50:09 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"2519f95f9bb9439de2f321eca4aaed66","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_3/2020/12/03/12-09-05-213_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn83@2020_6/2020/12/03/12-09-04-096_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn72@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-04-233_9ad7e5c0aa55abea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=GfCzZijhnlo:ACEgwLEOY_4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn32@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-05-534_e4fa2640558e562e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-06-712_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/GfCzZijhnlo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn47@2020_4/2020/12/03/12-09-05-355_4a0ec40f944d1ebd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606997311750},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","title":"Google shutting down Poly 3D content platform","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2082031","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is almost running out of AR/VR projects to kill off.</p>\n<p>The company announced today in an email to <a href=\"https://poly.google.com/\">Poly</a> users that they will be shutting down the 3D-object creation and library platform &#8220;forever&#8221; next year.

To celebrate the Season 2 premiere of Hulu Original &#8220;Pen15,&#8221; the company had offered the Watch Party experience to its ad-supported customers for 10 days, starting on September 18.</p>\n<p>In November, Hulu began testing the Watch Party feature <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams/\">with election news live streams</a> &#8212; the first time it had offered co-viewing with its live content.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WfQz17EYb6\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams/\">Hulu tests its social viewing feature, Watch Party, with election news live streams</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Hulu tests its social viewing feature, Watch Party, with election news live streams&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/hulu-tests-its-social-viewing-feature-watch-party-with-election-news-live-streams/embed/#?secret=WfQz17EYb6\" data-secret=\"WfQz17EYb6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Today, Hulu says Watch Party is no longer in a &#8220;test&#8221; phase, and is now officially available to both sets of on-demand customers, including those on its commercial-free and ad-supported plans alike.</p>\n<p>At launch, Watch Party works across thousands of on-demand titles from Hulu&#8217;s library. This includes not only Hulu&#8217;s own original content but also other licensed and broadcast programs like &#8220;The Golden Girls,&#8221; &#8220;This Is Us,&#8221; &#8220;Family Guy&#8221; and &#8220;The Bachelorette&#8221; &#8212; all of which Hulu said had been popular titles for Watch Party during the testing period.</p>\n<p>To use Watch Party, you&#8217;ll look for the new Watch Party icon that appears on a title&#8217;s detail page on Hulu.com. This will provide a link that you can then share with up to seven other Hulu subscribers, age 18 or older. The experience doesn&#8217;t require a browser plugin, but works directly on the Hulu website itself.</p>\n<p>As the program plays, users can chat and react with emoji in the group chat window, or even pause the viewing experience if they need to take a quick break. This won&#8217;t pause the stream for other viewers, as with some other co-watching experiences &#8212; instead, the user can rejoin the group and stay behind others or they can use a &#8220;Click to Catch Up&#8221; button in the chat window to get back in sync.</p>\n<p>Co-watching has been a popular pandemic activity as people looked for ways to stay connected with friends and family when they couldn&#8217;t spend time in person. In addition to Hulu, Amazon Prime Video <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime/\">launched</a> co-viewing and <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitch-watch-parties-amazon-prime-video-titles-1234576194/\">Twitch launched </a>its own Watch Parties. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/scener-now-lets-you-co-watch-hbo-or-netflix-in-a-virtual-theater-with-up-to-20-people/\">HBO teamed up with Scener</a>, Plex <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/plex-launches-a-co-watching-experience-for-its-on-demand-library-and-users-personal-media/\">launched</a> Watch Together and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/how-instagram-co-watching-works/\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together/\">Facebook</a> rolled out co-viewing too.

But the company also operates an <a href=\"https://bolt.eu/en/scooters/\">electric scooter service</a> in 45 cities across Europe. Designed by the company’s in-house hardware team, the new model focuses on safety.</p>\n<p>As you can see on the photo, it’s a big scooter that weighs 19kg — that’s more than an average bike. It has a battery with a 40km range and it is primarily made of aluminum.</p>\n<p>The company says it should last up to 60 months thanks to a modular design. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/mtakso\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mtakso\">Bolt <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> can replace parts without having to replace the scooter altogether.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Behind the scenes, you’ll find built-in sensors to detect accidents and unsafe riding. If you fall or if you brake sharply, Bolt can be alerted. The scooter also recognizes unsafe riding patterns. Combined with audio and visual warnings, it should educate riders about what you’re supposed to do and not do.</p>\n<p>On the integrated dashboard, you can receive alerts telling you that you’re riding in a pedestrian area, or in a low-speed area. You can also see if you’re allowed to park in this area. Bolt plans to turn on front light blinking when you enter a pedestrian or low-speed area.</p>\n<p>Like most modern e-scooter models, Bolt can swap the battery without having to move the entire scooter. It is much more efficient to recharge detachable batteries than scooters themselves.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, Bolt unveiled plans to double-down on scooters. It plans to operate a scooter service in more than 100 cities in 2021. There could be as many as 130,000 electric scooters and electric bikes in European cities.

Today, <a href=\"https://karakuri.com/\">Karakuri</a>, a food robotics startup, unveils its first automated canteen to make meals: the &#8220;DK-One” robot. It’s also revealing a $8.4 million (£6.3million) investment, led by <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/firstminute-capital\">firstminute capital</a>, which includes funding from Hoxton Ventures, Taylor Brothers, Ocado Group and the UK’s government-backed Future Fund. It has now closed a total of £13.5m in funding.</p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/karakuri\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"karakuri\">Karakuri’s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> robotic system has been initially designed to make breakfast bowls. But the technology will end up being employed in a large array of scenarios, including restaurants, canteens, buffets, hotels and supermarkets. Posibly even tending vertical farms. It’s particular strength is in being able to create extremely tailor-made combinations of food, putting &#8216;personalized nutrition’ within practical reach. Remember those movies where the food is tailored by a robot? That.</p>\n<p>The post-Covid world is also highly likely to embrace this technology due to the robot&#8217;s inherent cleanliness and efficiency, compared to human-made food. That said, Karakuri is not positioned to replace humans but to augment them, taking on the boring and repetitive tasks which typically see kitchen staff have far more itinerant careers due to the sheer pressure of low-level jobs where a robot would be far more suitable.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The DK-One robot is Karakuri’s first pre-production machine which uses the latest in robotics, sensing and control technologies. It’s capable of creating high quality hot and cold meals, which maximize nutritional benefits, restaurant performance and minimize food waste.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Vesx0iFc5U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>\n<p>Post-COVID restrictions, further on-customer-site trials of the DK-One are expected to take place in the first half of 2021.</p>\n<p>The DK-One robot zips around a circular enclosure at a rate of knots, each time measuring accurate portion sizes as determined by an app, where the customer can tailor to their tastes. It means anyone ordering something would be able to track the ingredients, nutrients, calories, and quantity of literally every meal.</p>\n<p>Up to 18 ingredients can be dispensed per installation, with each ingredient temperature controlled. It will dispense of any ingredient type including wet, dry, soft, or hard food onto plates, bowls, or a range of meal containers</p>\n<p>Because it’s so accurate it, therefore, reduces food waste around portions and allows for real-time data on ingredients. The thin margins restaurateurs typically have could be improved by using such a robot in repetitive tasks, and means employees can be tasked with more complex and fruitful and fulfilling work. It’s also easily integrated into existing commercial kitchens.</p>\n<p>Barney Wragg, CEO and co-founder of Karakuri, said in a statement: “This will be the first time we can use a pre-production machine to demonstrate the DK-One’s commercial and nutritional benefits in the real world and thus demonstrate our vision for the future of food.”</p>\n<p>Karakuri was founded by Simon Watt and Wragg, two longtime friends and colleagues who previously worked together at ARM. In April 2018 the Founders Factory venture studio invested in Karakuri and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/brent-hoberman\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"brent-hoberman\">Brent Hoberman <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> joined the board as Chairman and is also listed as a co-founder.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/pbnFMrPOcWI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Dec 2020 06:00:54 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"08434af323c84532bbe67db2a4e69465","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Mike Butcher","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_3/2020/12/03/12-09-05-213_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn83@2020_6/2020/12/03/12-09-04-096_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn80@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-05-183_0d3f888e6901c1d3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=pbnFMrPOcWI:DBauKdx1z1k:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn27@2020_4/2020/12/03/12-09-04-219_edcb646d052bc95c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-06-712_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/pbnFMrPOcWI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn15@2020_6/2020/12/03/12-09-05-296_1a9f47ea965dab72.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606997311739},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","title":"Amazon’s Fire TV Cube adds support for two-way video calls via a connected TV","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2082150","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"amazon\">Amazon <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> in September <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/amazon-redesigns-fire-tv-introduces-new-fire-tv-stick-and-low-cost-fire-tv-stick-lite/\">announced</a> it was bringing video calling support to its Fire TV platform.

We&#8217;re calculating the daily change between the preceding day&#8217;s close and the listed day&#8217;s final price:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>November 25: -5.4% (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/\">deal leaks midday</a>)</li>\n<li>November 27: +0.33%</li>\n<li>November 30: -0.74%</li>\n<li>December 1: -1.8% (deal is announced after-hours)</li>\n<li>December 2: -8.52%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Salesforce saw its share price fall from around $264 before the deal became known to $220.78 at the end of regular trading today.

But I wanted to ask my colleague Ron Miller about the situation, to see if he could add anything to the <em>why isn&#8217;t Wall Street liking this combo more</em> question. Here is his take:</p>\n<p>While Wall Street appears to be taking an initial dislike to the deal &#8212; it is a big gaudy number &#8212; over time I think they should come to understand it better. Slack will give Salesforce the social piece it has been longing for since the days of Enterprise 2.0. They initially tried to build it themselves with Chatter, but that never quite caught on. Ten years later, they finally have their social component.</p>\n<p>Benioff&#8217;s instincts about what his company needs are usually on target, and while he may have overpaid for this bauble, the ability to tie his company&#8217;s products together under Slack&#8217;s communications and work integration umbrella proved too attractive to resist.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget in spite of the fact that Microsoft Teams is making headway, mostly by giving it away for free with Office 365 subscriptions, Slack remains the darling of the developer class. And as long as Salesforce finds a way for it to maintain its independence, the marriage could work out. At the very least, it deserves a chance to prove that it can.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/KVbZB3bhYhk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 23:16:29 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"385cde2705b03d6cc03af4c6d1ea7db4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_3/2020/12/03/12-09-05-213_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn83@2020_6/2020/12/03/12-09-04-096_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn84@2020_4/2020/12/03/12-09-05-234_dd4c3d9da72c12a3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=KVbZB3bhYhk:3LLSliC29_4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn46@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-09-04-278_7c1f8bc6bec33dd6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-06-712_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/KVbZB3bhYhk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn27@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-05-298_6dee875b4797cee7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606997311750},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","title":"ultimate.ai scores $20M for a supportive approach to customer service automation","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2081212","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://www.ultimate.ai\">Ultimate.ai</a>, a virtual customer service agent builder, has closed a $20 million Series A round of funding, led by Omers Ventures with participation from Felicis Ventures and existing investors HV Capital, and <a href=\"http://maki.vc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://maki.vc/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1606895197617000&#38;usg=AFQjCNGmQSIWL-KZxtvA5JCNL0EhZ-yLPw\">Maki.vc</a> &#8212;

Our vision has always been the big picture: Of automation becoming one of the primary means of providing customer service.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having multilingual smarts remains an advantage, with ultimate.ai&#8217;s virtual agents able to handle interactions in over 20 languages at this point.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;Our market &#8212; the customer service automation market &#8212; has a lot of players,&#8221; Kainulainen goes on, name-checking the likes of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/ada-nets-19-million-series-a-to-grow-its-customer-service-chatbot/\">Ada Support</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/28/salesforce-makes-some-einstein-ai-algorithms-available-to-third-party-developers/\">Einstein Bots</a> (Salesforce’s own solution) as key competitors.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;This is because it is new and, until recently, solutions were so early that there were virtually no barriers to entry. But the market has changed a lot in the last four years. There are now only a handful of players globally that are worth paying attention to and we are one of them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 2016-founded startup is hitting the nail on the head for a growing number of customers &#8212; with close to 100 signed up to its platform at this point, including the likes of Deezer, Telia, Footasylum, and Finnair. Per Kainulainen, it works best for &#8220;b2c brands with large (and often repetitive) customer service volumes&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is where automation can provide a huge impact from day one and really free up people to take on more creative and challenging work. We have a broad customer base of close to 100 great brands&#8230; and do particularly well in industries like retail/ecommerce, telecommunications and travel,&#8221; he adds.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s enjoyed a major growth spurt this year, as businesses of all stripes were forced to ramp up their attention to online customer interactions as the coronavirus pandemic became an engine for digital activity.</p>\n<p>Customer retention has also risen in priority for many businesses, as a highly contagious virus and public health safety measures put in place to reduce its spread, flipped markets into recession &#8212; which Kainulainen points to as another growth driver.</p>\n<p>Overall, he says it&#8217;s tripled ARR over the last 12 months (albeit, it was the same growth story last year too). Plus it&#8217;s tripled headcount to deal with the COVID-19 effect.</p>\n<p>Now ultimate.ai is gearing up for fresh growth &#8212; saying it&#8217;s expecting major developments next year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;COVID-19 has&#8230; prompted one of the most accelerated periods of change in the customer service industry,&#8221; says Kainulainen, predicting 2021 will bring &#8220;immense innovation&#8221; in the space &#8212; and that &#8220;booming&#8221; automation technologies will take &#8220;center stage&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Of course it&#8217;s a convenient narrative for a customer service chatbot maker to tell.</p>\n<p>But COVID-19 is clearly accelerating digital transformation of consumer focused businesses &#8212; a movement that, logically, pumps demand for smarter tools to handle online customer support. So those positioned to harness new momentum for customer service automation &#8212; by being able to offer an accessible, scalable and effective product (as ultimate.ai claims it does) &#8212; are sitting pretty in the middle of a pandemic.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;We believe that the best product will win this market,&#8221; adds Kainulainen. &#8220;We have a big vision for what we want <a href=\"http://ultimate.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ultimate.ai/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1606934261525000&#38;usg=AFQjCNHQAmj-YBWsjt_0IRW7U5fUHRE1dA\">ultimate.ai</a> to be. Market maturity for our technology has accelerated massively in 2020, achieving in one year what could have probably taken five. We will capitalize on that by building more, faster.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Series A funding will go on sales and marketing, with a planned market push in North America and a desire to go deeper throughout Europe, as well as being ploughed into further product development.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And while &#8212; clearly &#8212; not every potential b2c customer will be able to &#8216;automagic&#8217; away 80% of their customer support pings, Kainulainen argues ultimate.ai can still offer a compelling sales pitch to businesses with more &#8220;consultative&#8221; customer support needs, where automation will only be able to play a far more limited role.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;There&#8217;s often a strong correlation between how consultative a customer service organization needs to be and how highly trained and experienced their team is. In other words, it is often the case that organizations with ‘lower bound’ automation potential also only need 10% automation to still drive a huge ROI,&#8221; he suggests.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;For example, one of our customers is a large national pharmacy group, where customer service agents are qualified pharmacists who provide prescription medical advice. Here, the goal isn’t to achieve a very high automation rate but rather to automate basic, repetitive processes to free up the pharmacists for more challenging tasks that better use their capabilities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;For this customer, in addition to the automation of simple requests (which alone provides a huge value) our real-time answer recommendations help pharmacists respond faster and easier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Omers Ventures managing partner, Jambu Palaniappan, dubbed the startup&#8217;s growth &#8220;truly spectacular&#8221;, as well as lauding its &#8220;world-class team&#8221; and founders &#8220;with a strong vision and unrivalled knowledge of AI&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are numerous chatbot companies out there but ultimate.ai represents something much bigger because at its core is an automation company with massive potential,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We look forward to working with Sarah, Reetu, Jaakko, and Markus as they expand internationally and advance their deep product capabilities even further.&#8221;</p>\n<p>“The customer service industry is undergoing an automation revolution. In ultimate.ai, we saw a vision that’s bold enough to lead the way,&#8221; added Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, in another supporting statement. &#8220;We believe that, just in the same way that category leaders have defined marketing and sales automation, ultimate.ai will do the same for customer service.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jambu Palaniappan, managing partner at Omers Ventures, will join the ultimate.ai board. Aydin Senkut, founder and managing partner of Felicis Ventures, will join as an investor, alongside former head of Airbnb for Business Mark McCabe, and former EVP global sales of payment giant Adyen, Thijn Lamers.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dhhIxGuTk5\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/salesforce-and-google-want-to-build-a-smarter-customer-service-experience/\">Salesforce and Google want to build a smarter customer service experience</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Salesforce and Google want to build a smarter customer service experience&#8221;

The complaint alleges Google violated parts of the National Labor Relations Act by surveilling employees, and generally interfered with, restrained and coerced employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1\">Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act</a>.</p>\n<p>The NLRB also alleges Google discouraged &#8220;its employees from forming, joining, assisting a union or engaging in other protected, concerted activities,&#8221; the complaint states.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This complaint makes clear that workers have the right to speak to issues of ethical business and the composition of management,&#8221; Laurence Berland, one of the fired Google employees, said in a statement. &#8220;This is a significant finding at a time when we’re seeing the power of a handful of tech billionaires consolidate control over our lives and our society. Workers have the right to speak out about and organize, as the NLRB is affirming, but we also know that we should not, and cannot, cleave off ethical concerns about the role management wants to play in that society.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Ex-Googlers Berland and Kathryn Spiers <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/fired-google-workers-will-file-federal-complaint-alleging-the-company-wrongfully-terminated-them/\">previously filed a federal complaint with the NLRB arguing</a> Google fired them for organizing, which is a protected activity. They had organized around a variety of topics, including Google’s treatment of its temporary, vendor and contractor workers, Google’s alleged retaliation against employees who organized, the company’s work with Customs and Border Protection and more.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in November 2019, Google put Rebecca Rivers and Berland on leave for allegedly violating company policies. At the time, Google said one had searched for and shared confidential documents that were not pertinent to their job, and one had looked at the individual calendars of some staffers. Following a protest in support of the two, Rivers, Berland, Duke and Waldman were fired.</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div>&#8220;Google has always worked to support a culture of internal discussion, and we place immense trust in our employees,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;Of course employees have protected labor rights that we strongly support, but we have always taken information security very seriously. We’re confident in our decision and legal position.

To kick off its new journey, the firm said it has secured $700 million in a new financing round.</p>\n<p>This round, the name of which was not disclosed, was led by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/walmart\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"walmart\">Walmart <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> with participation from some existing investors, PhonePe said.

The startup had been engaging with investors for new capital for several quarters and, in at least one instance, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/google-and-walmarts-phonepe-establish-dominance-in-indias-mobile-payments-market-as-whatsapp-pay-struggles-to-launch/\">struggled to raise funds at a $3 billion valuation earlier this year</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier. It had hoped to raise about $1 billion at a valuation as high as $10 billion last year, however, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The partial spin-off, which had been in the works for more than a year, means that Flipkart&#8217;s stake in PhonePe will reduce from 100% to 87%. &#8220;This partial spin-off gives PhonePe access to dedicated long-term capital to pursue our vision of providing financial inclusion to a billion Indians,&#8221; said Sameer Nigam, founder and chief executive of PhonePe, in a statement.</p>\n<p>Flipkart will remain PhonePe’s majority shareholder, and the &#8220;two businesses will retain their close collaboration,&#8221; PhonePe said.</p>\n<p>PhonePe, which means &#8220;on the phone&#8221; in Hindi, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/walmarts-phonepe-zips-past-google-pay-in-india-as-upi-tops-2-billion-monthly-transactions/\">currently leads the mobile payments market in India</a>, by some metrics. In October, it surpassed Google Pay to become the top UPI payments app. UPI is a four-year-old payments infrastructure built by India’s largest banks. It is the most popular way people transact money digitally in India. PhonePe reported 835 million UPI transactions in October, ahead of Google Pay, which processed about 820 million transactions that month.</p>\n<p>“As Flipkart Commerce continues to grow strongly serving the needs of Indian customers, we are excited at the future prospects of the group. This move will help PhonePe maximize its potential as it moves to the next phase of its development, and it will also maximize value creation for Flipkart and our shareholders,” said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, CEO of Flipkart Group, in a statement.</p>\n<p>In a recent report to clients, analysts at Bernstein identified PhonePe as one of the startups in India that could file for an IPO in within three years. PhonePe&#8217;s &#8220;reliance on parent Flipkart has shrunk, from 50% of monthly transactions to less than 1% today. PhonePe was first to launch on UPI and has extended into new use cases including travel booking, bill payments, financial services etc. The company has also launched Switch which allows users to switch between PhonePe and other apps like food, grocery delivery etc. (Super App),&#8221; they wrote.</p>\n<p>PhonePe, which has amassed over 100 million monthly active users, could look to expand outside of India, the analysts wrote in the report, which was obtained by TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>PhonePe and Google Pay today also compete with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/paytm\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"paytm\">Paytm, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> which is backed by SoftBank and Alibaba. Paytm, which was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/\">privately valued at $16 billion last year when it raised $1 billion</a>, has shifted its attention to cater to merchants in recent quarters as UPI currently offers no way for companies to make any money on its platform.</p>\n<p>At an event in Bangalore late last year, Sajith Sivanandan, managing director and business head of Google Pay and Next Billion User Initiatives, said current local rules in India have forced Google Pay to operate without a clear business model in the country.</p>\n<p>If that wasn&#8217;t a challenge enough, WhatsApp, which is the most popular smartphone app in India with over 400 million users in the world&#8217;s second largest market, began <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/\">rolling out its payments service in the country last month</a>.

Because of that, he felt that they lacked the expertise to build the application correctly, and it never really caught on, with so many similar products in the market at the time.</p>\n<p>But Benioff never lost interest in the concept of incorporating social into the Salesforce platform.

I think that COVID-19 has shown us how critical it is to get employees the data they need to do their job, but also the community they need to thrive at their job. The marriage of Salesforce and Slack promises to do just that,&#8221; Seka told me.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Be8IVr1LHF\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud/\">With Hyperforce, Salesforce lets you move your data to any public cloud</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;With Hyperforce, Salesforce lets you move your data to any public cloud&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud/embed/#?secret=Be8IVr1LHF\" data-secret=\"Be8IVr1LHF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Brent Leary, principal analyst at CRM Essentials, was knocked out by the price tag, but says it shows that Salesforce is not afraid to go after what it wants, even if it has to pay a hefty price to get it. &#8220;This goes to show Salesforce has absolutely no fear in them when it comes to this deal. They are willing to throw down the big bucks on this acquisition because they see a huge payoff by adding this piece into their platform,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>As for Slack, he sees it as a way for them to take the fast track to the enterprise big leagues. &#8220;And for Slack they go from competing with AMOSS (Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Salesforce) to joining one of them, and the company that really made the most sense for them to team up with,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Laurie McCabe, an analyst and founder at SMB Group, agrees with Leary&#8217;s take, saying Salesforce doesn&#8217;t hesitate when it thinks the value is there. &#8220;In this case, Slack gives them a strong collaboration offering that will help them compete more effectively against Microsoft’s growing cloud portfolio, which of course includes CRM and Teams,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<h2>Show me the money</h2>\n<p>Battery&#8217;s Agrawal believes this deal is all about generating revenue, and it was willing to pay a premium to move the needle in billion-dollar chunks.

That translates into more than $18 billion in lost market cap &#8212; probably not the reaction they were hoping for.

Until now, the company has mostly been able to stay in its own swim lane in terms of products. [&#8230;] To get to a trillion dollars in market cap, Salesforce needs to try to grow in two massive markets,&#8221; Agrawal said. Those would be either knowledge worker/desktop (see <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/\">the 2016 Quip acquisition</a>) or cloud (see <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/with-hyperforce-salesforce-lets-you-move-your-data-to-any-public-cloud/\">the Hyperforce announcement</a>). Agrawal says chances are the company&#8217;s best bet is the former, and it was willing to pay top dollar to get it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The deal will help Salesforce maintain a 20%+ growth rate over the next few years,&#8221; he said. Ultimately, he sees it moving the revenue needle, which should eventually drive market cap higher and help achieve those goals.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Salesforce president and CEO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"bret-taylor\">Bret Taylor <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> said while they intend to integrate Slack deeply into the Salesforce product family, they recognize the power and utility of Slack as a standalone product and they don&#8217;t intend to do anything that would mess with that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, we want to make sure that Slack remains as a kind of technology-agnostic platform. We know that Slack is used by millions and millions of people every day to connect every tool under the sun. The most remarkable thing is just how many customers have also just integrated their own custom internal tools as well into this is really kind of the central nervous system for the teams that use it, and we would never want to change that,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to judge a deal this large until we have some hindsight and see how well the two companies have meshed, how well they can incorporate Slack into the Salesforce ecosystem, while allowing that independence Taylor alluded to. If they can find a way to walk that line and Slack becomes that wrapper, that operating system, that glue that holds the Salesforce ecosystem together, it will be a good deal, but if Slack stops innovating and withers under the weight of its corporate overlords, then it might not be money well spent.</p>\n<p>Time will tell which is the case.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iK7LtPqecI\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/\">Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=iK7LtPqecI\" data-secret=\"iK7LtPqecI\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/OW7ThIfmmiU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 23:08:22 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"d5439becb41658d9e535a702034238bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ron Miller","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_3/2020/12/03/12-09-05-213_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn83@2020_6/2020/12/03/12-09-04-096_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn3@2020_1/2020/12/03/12-09-04-845_d52efa37ac1e7828.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=OW7ThIfmmiU:83Eet1G6l5k:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-04-226_2182632a871b7dd5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-06-712_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/OW7ThIfmmiU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn73@2020_3/2020/12/03/12-09-04-101_b875c326d7bfa7ca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606997311743},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","title":"Alibaba and Ethiopian Airlines to launch cold chain exporting China’s COVID vaccines","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2082377","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">China has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/business/china-vaccine-diplomacy.html\">pledged</a> that it would be sharing its COVID-19 vaccines with other countries, especially those with which it <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02807-2\">has close ties</a>.

This means that healthcare providers can work closely with patients even remotely, which is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"q52wGcJb9I\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/as-alzheimers-costs-soar-startups-like-neurotrack-raise-cash-to-diagnose-and-treat-the-disease/\">As Alzheimer&#8217;s costs soar, startups like Neurotrack raise cash to diagnose and treat the disease</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;As Alzheimer&#8217;s costs soar, startups like Neurotrack raise cash to diagnose and treat the disease&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/as-alzheimers-costs-soar-startups-like-neurotrack-raise-cash-to-diagnose-and-treat-the-disease/embed/#?secret=q52wGcJb9I\" data-secret=\"q52wGcJb9I\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/tf_Jx3wclsk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Dec 2020 01:00:53 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"bb0e10b14635e0383c2d38a07d9dbeb4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Catherine Shu","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-08-32-199_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_3/2020/12/03/12-09-05-213_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn83@2020_6/2020/12/03/12-09-04-096_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn56@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-04-207_96e8092380c89f40.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=tf_Jx3wclsk:KQMRB7O5VuM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn44@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-05-375_361e5075b70ae38c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn39@2020_2/2020/12/03/12-09-06-712_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/tf_Jx3wclsk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn100@2020_5/2020/12/03/12-09-04-248_c18613e54d938cd8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606997311750},{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 20:08:31","title":"AutoX becomes China’s first to remove safety drivers from robotaxis","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2082324","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Residents of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/shenzhen-eb7c\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shenzhen-eb7c\">Shenzhen <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> will see truly driverless cars on the road starting Thursday. AutoX, a four-year-old startup backed by Alibaba, MediaTek and Shanghai Motors, is deploying a fleet of 25 unmanned vehicles in downtown Shenzhen, marking the first time any autonomous driving car in China tests without safety drivers or remote operators on public roads.</p>\n<p>The cars, meant as robotaxis, are not yet open to the public, an <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/autox-ac12\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"autox-ac12\">AutoX <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>The milestone came just five months after AutoX <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/autonomous-vehicle-startup-autox-lands-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/\">landed a permit from California</a> to start driverless tests, following in the footsteps of Waymo and Nuro.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>It also indicates that China wants to bring its smart driving industry on par with the U.S. Cities from Shenzhen to Shanghai are competing to attract autonomous driving upstarts by clearing regulatory hurdles, touting subsidies and putting up 5G infrastructure.</p>\n<p>As a result, each city ends up with its own poster child in the space: AutoX and Deeproute.ai in Shenzhen, Pony.ai and WeRide in Guangzhou, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/momenta-ai\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"momenta-ai\">Momenta <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> in Suzhou, Baidu&#8217;s Apollo fleet in Beijing, to name a few. The autonomous driving companies, in turn, work closely with traditional carmakers to make their vehicles smarter and more suitable for future transportation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have obtained support from the local government. Shenzhen is making a lot of rapid progress on legislation for self-driving cars,&#8221; said the AutoX representative.</p>\n<p>The decision to remove drivers from the front <em>and</em> operators from a remote center appears a bold move in one of China&#8217;s most populated cities. AutoX equips its vehicles with its proprietary vehicle control unit called XCU, which it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/autox-and-fiat-chrysler-are-teaming-up-on-a-robotaxi-for-china/\">claims</a> has faster processing speed and more computational capability to handle the complex road scenarios in China’s cities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[The XCU] provides multiple layers of redundancy to handle this kind of situation,&#8221; said AutoX when asked how its vehicles will respond should the machines ever go rogue.</p>\n<p>The company also stressed the experience it learned from &#8220;millions of miles&#8221; driven in China&#8217;s densest city centers through its 100 robotaxis in the past few years. Its rivals are also aggressively accumulating mileage to train their self-driving algorithms while banking sizable investments to fund R&#38;D and pilot tests. AutoX itself, for instance, has raised <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/autox-ac12\">more than $160 million</a> to date.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote
