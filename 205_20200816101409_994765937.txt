The collective photothermal, water, electrochemical, and self‐restoring redox requirements are optimized by adjusting layer‐by‐layer assembly of polyacrylamide, PDMS, and CuO/Cu foil into a sandwich structure.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Capturing solar energy for thermal conversion in a highly efficient manner for steam‐electricity cogeneration is particularly opportune in the context of optimal solar energy utilization for concurrent water‐energy harvesting. Herein, an integrative photothermal evaporator/thermogalvanic cell with the desired optical, heat, water, and electrochemical management for synergistic steam‐electricity production is reported. Versatile layer by‐layer assembly is employed to integrate a hydrogel/metal‐oxide/polymer into a multilayer film with individually addressable thickness, composition, and structure. As such, the ultimate integrative multilayer film cell demonstrates a unified high surface area and conductive electrodes, broadband absorption, rapid water suction‐ion exchange, and thermal insulation properties. Thus, the designed cell immensely suppresses heat losses, achieving a high solar thermal conversion efficiency of 91.4% and maximum power outputs of ≈1.6 mW m<sup>−2</sup>. Additionally, the self‐floating, deformable, modular integral device presents appealing attributes such as salt‐rejection for viable seawater desalination, high mechanical stability, and resilience to demanding operating conditions, and configurable on‐demand/point‐of‐use tandem structure to maximize clean water and power generation value per area. This integrated strategy may provide prospective opportunities to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and freshwater inputs and solutions for renewable and decentralized clean water and electricity.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a5bf7cc4-ed09-4dd1-b880-2698164c3378/adfm202002867-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"27c74e14c12282390319c5a1c6b32d66","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn48@2020_6/2020/08/16/10-13-56-094_2c5ca1846e6d1040.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":238,"author":"\nFan Lu Meng, \nMinmin Gao, \nTianpeng Ding, \nGamze Yilmaz, \nWei Li Ong, \nGhim Wei Ho\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a5bf7cc4-ed09-4dd1-b880-2698164c3378/adfm202002867-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-13-57-819_2c5ca1846e6d1040.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"LipoBots: Using Liposomal Vesicles as Protective Shell of Urease‐Based Nanomotors","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202002767?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/291d3632-f8cc-4cf9-8f9a-91a4414c90ed/adfm202002767-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"LipoBots: Using Liposomal Vesicles as Protective Shell of Urease‐Based Nanomotors\"/>\n<p>Enzyme‐powered nanomotors are designed by attaching or encapsulating urease onto or into liposomes, which act as a nanomotor chassis and protective shell for urease. The propulsion of nanomotors encapsulating urease is triggered by a percolating agent present in the bile salts. Moreover, enzyme encapsulation on the inner liposomal compartment allows preservation of functionality when the nanomotors are exposed to harsh conditions.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Developing self‐powered nanomotors made of biocompatible and functional components is of paramount importance in future biomedical applications. Herein, the functional features of LipoBots (LBs) composed of a liposomal carrier containing urease enzymes for propulsion, including their protective properties against acidic conditions and their on‐demand triggered activation, are reported. Given the functional nature of liposomes, enzymes can be either encapsulated or coated on the surface of the vesicles. The influence of the location of urease on motion dynamics is first studied, finding that the surface‐urease LBs undergo self‐propulsion whereas the encapsulated‐urease LBs do not. However, adding a percolating agent present in the bile salts to the encapsulated‐urease LBs triggers active motion. Moreover, it is found that when both types of nanomotors are exposed to a medium of similar pH found in the stomach, the surface‐urease LBs lose activity and motion capabilities, while the encapsulated‐urease LBs retain activity and mobility. The results for the protection enzyme activity through encapsulation within liposomes and in situ triggering of the motion of LBs upon exposure to bile salts may open new avenues for the use of liposome‐based nanomotors in drug delivery, for example, in the gastrointestinal tract, where bile salts are naturally present in the intestine.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 17:29:30 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/291d3632-f8cc-4cf9-8f9a-91a4414c90ed/adfm202002767-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"1aed47637584da06dc5e4099dc751e4b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-57-069_7e65c51a6af45b49.webp","author":"\nAna C.

Specifically, the photosensitizer zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) is conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) via pH‐labile maleic acid amide linker and then immobilized onto the hyaluronic acid (HA) chain using a redox‐cleavable disulfide linker. The PEG segment can enhance blood circulation of the molecular carrier after intravenous administration and be shed after reaching the acidic tumor microenvironment, allowing the remaining fragment to self‐assemble into large clusters in situ to avoid backward diffusion and improve tumor retention. This process is driven by hydrophobic interactions and does not require additional external actuation. The aggregates are then internalized by the tumor cells via HA‐facilitated endocytosis, and the high glutathione level in tumor cells eventually leads to the intracellular release of ZnPc to facilitate its interaction with the subcellular lipid structures. This tumor‐triggered morphology‐based delivery platform is constructed with clinically tested components and could potentially be applied to other hydrophobic therapeutics.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 18:16:31 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/535d86af-4c73-4446-8d68-9daf65401842/adfm202000229-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"09202b568e98289a72da3cca89f2d326","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn68@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-53-961_0eddef0e880dc64e.webp","author":"\nXuan Wang, \nMenghuan Li, \nYanhua Hou, \nYanan Li, \nXuemei Yao, \nChencheng Xue, \nYang Fei, \nYang Xiang, \nKaiyong Cai, \nYanli Zhao, \nZhong Luo\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/535d86af-4c73-4446-8d68-9daf65401842/adfm202000229-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-56-344_0eddef0e880dc64e.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Laser Assisted Solution Synthesis of High Performance Graphene Supported Electrocatalysts","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202001756?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/43949619-75c6-4bbd-8056-15e7a0d36c88/adfm202001756-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Laser Assisted Solution Synthesis of High Performance Graphene Supported Electrocatalysts\"/>\n<p>Graphene supported electrocatalysts, including RuO<sub>2</sub> and Pt, are synthesized via laser (248 nm) irradiation of semiconducting electrochemical graphene oxide (EGO) and metal salts precursor solutions.

Herein, based on light‐induced electrochemistry, a laser‐assisted, continuous, solution route for the simultaneous reduction and modification of graphene oxide with catalytic nanoparticles is reported. Electrochemical graphene oxide (EGO) is used as starting material and electron–hole pair source due to its low degree of oxidation, which imparts structural integrity and an ability to withstand photodegradation. Simply illuminating a solution stream containing EGO and metal salt (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> or RuCl<sub>3</sub>) with a 248 nm wavelength laser produces reduced EGO (rEGO, oxygen content 4.0 at%) flakes, decorated with Pt (≈2.0 nm) or RuO<sub>2</sub> (≈2.8 nm) nanoparticles. The RuO<sub>2</sub>–rEGO flakes exhibit superior catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, requiring a small overpotential of 225 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>. The Pt–rEGO flakes (10.2 wt% of Pt) show enhanced mass activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and similar performance for oxygen reduction reaction compared to a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst.

This review provides an overview of recent developments in white LECs, specifically three major aspects thereof, namely, host–guest white LECs, nondoped white LECs, and device engineering of white LECs.

Inspired by the unique poly‐ionic nature of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), a novel Au/APP/ITO memristor with favorable flexibility and stability is prepared. Synaptic behaviors can be stimulated by voltage pulses that are 20 ns in width, 0.1 V in amplitude, and repeatable under 10<sup>4</sup> pulse cycles, thereby outperforming several other benchmark memristors. Further, the device, prepared on conductive silicone, can sustain its synaptic performance even under 360° bending. Furthermore, the device can sustain its synaptic behaviors even after exposure to fire for 60 s and 5.6 kGy of ionic irradiation.

The work thus offers a viable solution for flexible magnetic materials that can be utilized in a range of applications.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:15:28 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/41d34b19-f0f9-4a2e-810d-72538b742184/adfm202003495-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"9933e527de06fe87e024aeb2e3d0c4f7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn8@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-13-56-351_7a6b20c498d10008.webp","author":"\nFeng An, \nKe Qu, \nGaokuo Zhong, \nYongqi Dong, \nWenjie Ming, \nMengfei Zi, \nZhijie Liu, \nYadong Wang, \nBiyun Qi, \nZhen Ding, \nJun Xu, \nZhenlin Luo, \nXingsen Gao, \nShuhong Xie, \nPeng Gao, \nJiangyu Li\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/41d34b19-f0f9-4a2e-810d-72538b742184/adfm202003495-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-13-56-940_7a6b20c498d10008.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Targeting Oligosaccharides and Glycoconjugates Using Superselective Binding Scaffolds","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202002298?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/81c53694-affd-430e-b640-2d6b052ac6b0/adfm202002298-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Targeting Oligosaccharides and Glycoconjugates Using Superselective Binding Scaffolds\"/>\n<p>A unique modular, synthetic strategy allows for the creation of artificial binding sites with precise spatial positioning of multiple carbohydrate receptors, enabling the remarkable ability to distinguish a target oligosaccharide over closely related carbohydrate structures.

Both concepts incorporate solution‐based fabrication techniques, which makes them attractive for low cost applications based on, for example, roll‐to‐roll fabrication or inkjet printing. However, both concepts have unique benefits that justify their appeal. LECs comprise ionic species in the active layer, which leads to the omission of additional organic charge injection and transport layers and reactive cathode materials, thus LECs impress with their simple device architecture. QD‐LEDs impress with purity and opulence of available colors: colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are semiconducting nanocrystals that show high yield light emission, which can be easily tuned over the whole visible spectrum by material composition and size. Emerging technologies that unite the potential of both concepts (LEC and QD‐LED) are covered, either by extending a typical LEC architecture with additional QDs, or by replacing the entire organic LEC emitter with QDs or perovskite nanocrystals, still keeping the easy LEC setup featured by the incorporation of mobile ions.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:37:59 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/10647328-7b83-44ec-8d3b-0101c51a5b35/adfm201907349-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"ea708fa4aa35d74e9e19ea6f305826fb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn19@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-57-208_66ad20fbf57768f3.webp","author":"\nEkaterina Nannen, \nJulia Frohleiks, \nSandra Gellner\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/10647328-7b83-44ec-8d3b-0101c51a5b35/adfm201907349-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn56@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-13-58-353_66ad20fbf57768f3.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Direct Conversion of Fe2O3 to 3D Nanofibrillar PEDOT Microsupercapacitors","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202003394?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/03d79b31-ae4a-4366-beac-af1b3a261dd0/adfm202003394-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Direct Conversion of Fe2O3 to 3D Nanofibrillar PEDOT Microsupercapacitors\"/>\n<p>This paper presents a superior and cost‐effective strategy for developing 3D microsupercapacitors that directly convert Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanofibers in one step.

The effect of each component on the photoelectrochemical behavior is studied by linear sweep photovoltammetry, incident photon‐to‐charge carrier conversion efficiency measurements, and long‐term photoelectrolysis. 2.6 times higher photocurrents are obtained for the best‐performing FeNiOOH/Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/graphene system compared to its pristine Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> counterpart. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal an increased hole‐lifetime in the case of the Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/graphene samples. Long‐term photoelectrolysis measurements in combination with Raman spectroscopy, however, prove that the underlying nanocarbon framework is corroded by the photogenerated holes. This issue is tackled by the electrodeposition of a thin FeNiOOH overlayer, which rapidly accepts the photogenerated holes from Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, thus eliminating the pathway leading to the corrosion of graphene.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:15:28 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9729783c-0367-42e9-90c1-a53a5b3340a1/adfm202002124-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"238be7d6c7705aa3763baa1b1d83fef9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-52-984_a0c5dac99da1a09f.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":373,"author":"\nAttila Kormányos, \nEgon Kecsenovity, \nAlireza Honarfar, \nTönu Pullerits, \nCsaba Janáky\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9729783c-0367-42e9-90c1-a53a5b3340a1/adfm202002124-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-59-954_a0c5dac99da1a09f.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Inverse Solidification Induced by Active Janus Particles","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202003851?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/464488aa-92dc-47d3-b8eb-883fcfe4b973/adfm202003851-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Inverse Solidification Induced by Active Janus Particles\"/>\n<p>Inverse solidification driven by active colloids provides novel insight into the collective effects in mixed colloidal systems. It offers versatile possibilities to address the processes of solidification in various systems out of equilibrium, including the formation of bio‐molecular condensates or biomineralization, transitions from amorphous to polycrystalline state in condensed matter, or synthesis of materials under extreme conditions.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Crystals melt when thermal excitations or the concentration of defects in the lattice is sufficiently high. Upon melting, the crystalline long‐range order vanishes, turning the solid to a fluid. In contrast to this classical scenario of solid melting, here a counter‐intuitive behavior of the occurrence of crystalline long‐range order in an initially disordered matrix is demonstrated. This unusual solidification is demonstrated in a system of passive colloidal particles accommodating chemically active defects—photocatalytic Janus particles. The observed crystallization occurs when the amount of active‐defect‐induced fluctuations (which is the measure of the effective temperature) reaches critical value. The driving mechanism behind this unusual behavior is purely internal and resembles a blast‐induced solidification. Here, the role of “internal micro‐blasts” is played by the photochemical activity of defects residing in the colloidal matrix. The defect‐induced solidification occurs under non‐equilibrium conditions: the resulting solid exists as long as a constant supply of energy in the form of ion flow is provided by the catalytic photochemical reaction at the surface of active Janus particle defects. The findings could be useful for the understanding of the phase transitions of matter under extreme conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/464488aa-92dc-47d3-b8eb-883fcfe4b973/adfm202003851-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"6b15293781fdb361eb0e208045b14ea0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-57-996_989d3329f035c6fd.webp","author":"\nTao Huang, \nVyacheslav R.

Recently, several quadruple perovskite halides, such as Cs<sub>4</sub>CdSb<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub> and Cs<sub>4</sub>CdBi<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub>, have been theoretically predicted to be excellent p‐type TCs that surpass all the conventional p‐type TCs and hence attracted a lot of attention. In this work, experiments and hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations are combined to evaluate the p‐type dopability in these quadruple perovskite halides. The experimental results reveal that these materials are optically transparent but electrically insulating, which contradicts the previous prediction. The hybrid DFT calculations show that the difficulty in forming p‐type doping in these compounds is because of the easy formation of the compensating n‐type intrinsic defects in the p‐type region, which is resulted from too deep valence band maximum levels. It is further demonstrated that the bandgap underestimation associated with the semilocal DFT and the unintentional chemical boundary overestimation should be the origins of the p‐type conductivity predicted previously. The results highlight the importance of reasonable bandgap description and chemical boundary determination in predicting defect thermodynamics.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:15:28 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8a89b24a-0f9f-46e2-b418-5a29f2d1d5b7/adfm201909906-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"9c90c03b7cf3b45b586e9775b1e1d562","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-13-54-954_4ead4c7503a1775a.webp","author":"\nSanlue Hu, \nBing Xia, \nYang‐Peng Lin, \nTakayoshi Katase, \nJun Fujioka, \nToshio Kamiya, \nHideo Hosono, \nKe‐Zhao Du, \nZewen Xiao\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8a89b24a-0f9f-46e2-b418-5a29f2d1d5b7/adfm201909906-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn23@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-49-388_4ead4c7503a1775a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Molecularly Imprinted Polymers and Electrospinning: Manufacturing Convergence for Next‐Level Applications","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202001955?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5adaaee6-5aab-465c-804d-22b6653de664/adfm202001955-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Molecularly Imprinted Polymers and Electrospinning: Manufacturing Convergence for Next‐Level Applications\"/>\n<p>This progress report highlights the latest developments in the innovatively developed combination of molecular imprinting with electrospinning, for the production of a new class of functional micro‐ and nanomaterials.

At a high oxidation degree, the electrode applying a conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) binder displays the worst electrochemical properties, while the electrode using a sodium alginate binder delivers the best electrochemical performance (a highly reversible capacity of 1064 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> with a 90.1% capacity retention at 800 mA g<sup>−1</sup> after 200 cycles and an outstanding rate capability of 401 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> at 8000 mA g<sup>−1</sup>) for its negligible oxidation. Additionally, the emergence/decomposition of surface intermediates, including (PO<sub>2</sub>)<sup>3−</sup> and (PO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>3−</sup> species, are observed in the discharging/charging processes via the ex situ P K‐edge X‐ray absorption spectroscopies. This novel discovery of the unique role of binders in phosphorus anodes, not only provides an opportunity to ameliorate their electrochemical properties, but also enables their practical applications in high‐energy sodium‐ion batteries.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3c4df6c9-ae9c-4ed5-8851-ffc0686f20e1/adfm202000060-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"1163dcb92c54b7a60a17d8b8ee674473","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn95@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-13-50-378_2ba4a64c5af7a34e.webp","author":"\nWei Xiao, \nQian Sun, \nMohammad Norouzi Banis, \nBiqiong Wang, \nWeihan Li, \nMinsi Li, \nAndrew Lushington, \nRuying Li, \nXifei Li, \nTsun‐Kong Sham, \nXueliang Sun\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3c4df6c9-ae9c-4ed5-8851-ffc0686f20e1/adfm202000060-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-58-710_2ba4a64c5af7a34e.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Rational Interface Design and Morphology Control for Blade‐Coating Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with a Record Fill Factor of 81%","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202001240?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/861c4e4d-4e6c-4ba6-b451-1c2577c7b320/adfm202001240-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Rational Interface Design and Morphology Control for Blade‐Coating Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with a Record Fill Factor of 81%\"/>\n<p>Highly efficient flexible perovskite solar cells prepared by blade coating are reported. A dual hole transport layer comprised of “PEDOT:PSS/PTAA” is delicately designed, which forms a cascade energy level alignment, enabling markedly enhanced charge extraction.

However, the overwhelming majority of flexible perovskite solar cells are produced using spin coating, which represents a major hurdle for upscaling. Here, a scalable approach is reported to fabricate efficient and robust flexible perovskite solar cells on a polymer substrate. Thiourea is introduced into perovskite precursor solution to modulate the crystal growth, resulting in dense and uniform perovskite thin films on rough surfaces. As a decisive step, a cascade energy alignment is realized for the hole extraction layer by rationally designing a bilayer interface comprised of PEDOT:PSS/PTAA with a distinct offset in the highest occupied molecular orbital levels, enabling markedly enhanced charge extraction and spectral response. An efficiency as high as 19.41% and a record fill factor up to 81% are achieved for flexible perovskite devices processed by a scalable printing method. Equally important, the bilayer interface reinforces the bendability of the indium tin oxide substrate, leading to enhanced mechanical robustness of the flexible devices. These results underpin the importance of morphology control and interface design in constructing high‐performance flexible perovskite solar cells.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/861c4e4d-4e6c-4ba6-b451-1c2577c7b320/adfm202001240-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"1cebee0b0afe4bfddb8a6a0c7d098506","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-50-736_83612020a5007f9c.webp","author":"\nZhen Wang, \nLinxiang Zeng, \nCuiling Zhang, \nYuanlin Lu, \nShudi Qiu, \nChuan Wang, \nChong Liu, \nLijun Pan, \nShaohang Wu, \nJinlong Hu, \nGuangxing Liang, \nPing Fan, \nHans‐Joachim Egelhaaf, \nChristoph J.

With the discovery of the excellent electrical stability of MXene under an alternating current (AC), herein, PLEDs that employ MXene electrodes and exhibit high performance under AC operation (AC MXene PLEDs) are presented.

For thick sandwich polymer LECs, a continuous change of the emission color provides a direct visual indication of a moving EZ. Results from an optical and electrical analysis indicate that the intrinsic zone is narrow at early times, but starts to widen during operation, notably well before the electrical device optimum is reached.

Common lithographic approaches suffer from limited resolution in defining ultrasmall nanogaps and restrictive available substrates for flexible and stretchable devices. In this work, a process portfolio to overcome the above limitations is proposed, enabling the fabrication of multiscale metallic nanogaps with reduced gap size on specific substrates for functional devices. The portfolio combines the recently developed sketch and peel lithography strategy, nanotransfer printing, and post‐mechanical assembly. Among the portfolio, the sketch and peel lithography strategy provides the unique capability to rapidly and reliably define multiscale adhesion‐free metallic nanostructures and nanogaps, which significantly facilitates the subsequent transfer printing process. Nanoplasmonic and nanoelectronic devices with ultrasmall nanogaps that are inaccessible with existing patterning approaches are fabricated to demonstrate the applicability of this fabrication strategy. The portfolio could also have potential for a variety of other applications in flexible and stretchable optics, electronics, and optoelectronics.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9ccf627a-c044-44f7-9474-229a874893b0/adfm202002549-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"c9c37008411787841f5edf89744e9b76","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-51-159_62e4cede1de9a562.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":345,"author":"\nYiqin Chen, \nZhiwen Shu, \nZhanyong Feng, \nLing’an Kong, \nYuan Liu, \nHuigao Duan\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9ccf627a-c044-44f7-9474-229a874893b0/adfm202002549-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn100@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-54-897_62e4cede1de9a562.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Multicompartment Polymer Vesicles with Artificial Organelles for Signal‐Triggered Cascade Reactions Including Cytoskeleton Formation","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202002949?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/87637a06-c236-4f92-878d-507950d2f170/adfm202002949-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Multicompartment Polymer Vesicles with Artificial Organelles for Signal‐Triggered Cascade Reactions Including Cytoskeleton Formation\"/>\n<p>Signal transduction via responsive artificial organelles allows the biomimetic polymer‐based multicompartment system to harbor different functionalities (cargo release, enzymatic activity, ion channel recruitment, cytoskeleton mimic) and represents an ideal candidate for cell logics and smart synthetic materials.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Organelles, i.e., internal subcompartments of cells, are fundamental to spatially separate cellular processes, while controlled intercompartment communication is essential for signal transduction. Furthermore, dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton provides the mechanical basis for cell shape transformations and mobility. In a quest to develop cell‐like smart synthetic materials, exhibiting functional flexibility, a self‐assembled vesicular multicompartment system, comprised of a polymeric membrane (giant unilamellar vesicle, GUV) enveloping polymeric artificial organelles (vesicles, nanoparticles), is herein presented. Such multicompartment assemblies respond to an external stimulus that is transduced through a precise sequence. Stimuli‐triggered communication between two types of internal artificial organelles induces and localizes an enzymatic reaction and allows ion‐channel mediated release from storage vacuoles. Moreover, cytoskeleton formation in the GUVs' lumen can be triggered by addition of ionophores and ions. An additional level of control is achieved by signal‐triggered ionophore translocation from organelles to the outer membrane, triggering cytoskeleton formation. This system is further used to study the diffusion of various cytoskeletal drugs across the synthetic outer membrane, demonstrating potential applicability, e.g., anticancer drug screening. Such multicompartment assemblies represent a robust system harboring many different functionalities and are a considerable leap in the application of cell logics to reactive and smart synthetic materials.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/87637a06-c236-4f92-878d-507950d2f170/adfm202002949-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"bccd12d60dfcc7d3fd1f2c43b0a7f4f7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn7@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-57-159_8fddb66624537f50.webp","author":"\nAndrea Belluati, \nSagana Thamboo, \nAdrian Najer, \nViviana Maffeis, \nClaudio Planta, \nIoana Craciun, \nCornelia G.

In this study, an injectable, biocompatible, self‐healable, and conductive material poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/guar slime (PPGS) is developed for healing wounds with various kinds of movements.

Herein two near‐infrared (NIR) chemiluminescent reporters (NCRs) with high renal clearance for real‐time imaging of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the kidneys are synthesized. NCRs comprise a β‐cyclodextrin unit and a modified dicyanomethylene‐4<i>H</i>‐pyran containing Schaap's dioxetane as the renal‐clearance enabler and the chemiluminescent moiety, respectively. NCR1 and NCR2 specifically activate their NIR chemiluminescence towards superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>•−</sup>) and peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>−</sup>), respectively. By virtue of their nanomolar sensitivity and high renal clearance, NCRs not only detect subtle upregulation of endogenous RONS in cells but also enable noninvasive monitoring of RONS in the kidneys under nephrotoxic exposure. The earlier activation of NCR1 relative to NCR2 implies the sequential upregulation of O<sub>2</sub>\n<sup>•−</sup> and ONOO<sup>−</sup> during drug‐induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Moreover, detection of the fluorescence of excreted NCRs permits urinalysis of AKI, detecting the upregulation of RONS at least 24 h earlier than histological analysis.

The formation and tuning of nanowrinkles are studied in graphene‐based membranes to understand their role in regulating mass transport in 2D membranes.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Laminar membranes stacked by 2D materials are an emerging selective unit in separating processes across disciplines for their controllable mass transport properties. In general, parallel nanochannels formed between neighboring layers, owing to their adjustable size and surface chemistry, are considered the dominant transport regulator. Besides these flat interlayer channels, wrinkled morphology has also existed in 2D membranes, but the structure and potential transporting role of such curved channel remain largely unexplored. This study demonstrates that nanowrinkles are intrinsically formed in graphene‐based membranes, featuring an arc‐like shape with around 2.5 nm high center and two narrow wedge corners. By a facile “solvent‐treatment” during assembly, the membranes are tuned to possess different wrinkle density. In transport tests involving water and ions, the appearance of more wrinkles yields higher water permeation yet has limited effect on ion passage. These findings suggest that nanowrinkles by themselves serve as fast transporting ways while their connection with narrow interlayer channels can form a selective network. Results here are expected to deepen the understanding of mass transport mechanisms in current laminar membranes (e.g., graphene‐based) and provide strategies for designing future 2D membranes via wrinkle engineering.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f41ccf7d-bc7c-4b1d-9151-e8aef7e736b9/adfm202003159-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"ef32b03f31cdf31001e78ab5e6910708","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn36@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-13-50-922_6d82368fc1463ad0.webp","author":"\nYuan Kang, \nRuosang Qiu, \nMeipeng Jian, \nPeiyao Wang, \nYun Xia, \nBenyamin Motevalli, \nWang Zhao, \nZhiming Tian, \nJefferson Zhe Liu, \nHuanting Wang, \nHuiyuan Liu, \nXiwang Zhang\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f41ccf7d-bc7c-4b1d-9151-e8aef7e736b9/adfm202003159-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn84@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-13-49-476_6d82368fc1463ad0.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Trilayer Nanomesh Films with Tunable Wettability as Highly Transparent, Flexible, and Recyclable Electrodes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202002556?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b3dc6b16-ca86-405d-98c3-3fb3b7b448a1/adfm202002556-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Trilayer Nanomesh Films with Tunable Wettability as Highly Transparent, Flexible, and Recyclable Electrodes\"/>\n<p>Trilayer dielectric/metal/dielectric nanomesh transparent conductive films are developed via nanosphere lithography and are demonstrated to be an effective solution to the low transmittance problem for nanohole arrays.

Here, it is shown that BiFeO<sub>3</sub> thin films can be grown on flexible plastic by solution processing involving three different but complementary strategies to induce the crystallization of the perovskite phase at a lower temperature limit of 325 °C. This “three‐in‐one” approach is based on the synthesis of tailored metal precursors i) with a molecular structure resembling the crystalline structure of the oxide phase, which additionally allows both ii) photochemical and iii) internal combustion reactions taking place in the thin films. The flexible BiFeO<sub>3</sub> thin films obtained from a specifically designed molecular complex with <i>N</i>‐methyldiethanolamine yield a large remnant polarization of 17.5 µC cm<sup>−2</sup>, also showing photovoltaic and photocatalytic effects. This result paves the way for the direct integration of an interesting class of oxides with photoferroelectric properties in flexible devices with multiple applications in information and communication technology, and energy.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/eaece1fc-81c5-42d5-875a-8eecf0ec94c1/adfm202001897-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"fb44e59d97b1c2845cbaf6df34c570a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-13-56-894_43abd7b4953297fa.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":360,"author":"\nIñigo Bretos, \nRicardo Jiménez, \nJesús Ricote, \nRafael Sirera, \nM.

Electrode fabrication methods and assembly processes are reviewed and compared and future research needs in this area are discussed.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>MXenes are 2D materials with relatively high surface areas, high electrical conductivities, functional transition metal surfaces, tunable surface chemistries, and solution processability. Due to these properties, 2D MXenes have attracted widespread attention as electrode materials for energy storage devices, including electrochemical capacitors, with high power and energy densities. However, many studies have shown that the electrochemical performance of MXene electrodes is considerably affected by their structure and morphology. These properties are, for the most part, controlled by the method used for the assembly of 2D MXene flakes and the electrode fabrication methods. A successful electrode assembly and fabrication method should address several challenges, such as the restacking of 2D flakes, to achieve electrode structures and morphologies that deliver high ionic transport properties, electrical conductivity, and mechanical stability. This review aims to provide insight into the current state‐of‐the‐art assembly and fabrication methods used to design and fabricate high performance electrodes based on MXenes. The major challenges to be addressed and possible future directions in the fabrication of MXene electrodes for practical energy storage applications are highlighted.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6c6f4ed2-93ef-40cf-8786-a811c281a0c9/adfm202005305-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"bc41126d08525e0802c1dc9e71e1d1b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn24@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-56-639_d4a29b5cc4d7450b.webp","author":"\nJafar Orangi, \nMajid Beidaghi\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6c6f4ed2-93ef-40cf-8786-a811c281a0c9/adfm202005305-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn60@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-13-50-659_d4a29b5cc4d7450b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"The Role of Ni and Co in Suppressing O‐Loss in Li‐Rich Layered Cathodes","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202003660?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/077fc5c8-f217-4806-b299-1561afb2e88a/adfm202003660-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"The Role of Ni and Co in Suppressing O‐Loss in Li‐Rich Layered Cathodes\"/>\n<p>O‐loss from Li<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> can be almost completely suppressed with Ni substitution due to the presence of a near stoichiometric Ni‐rich rocksalt shell acting as a self‐protecting surface layer against O‐loss.

However, oxidation of O<sup>2−</sup> on charging often results in loss of oxygen from the lattice. In the case of Li<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> all the capacity arises from oxygen loss, whereas doping with Ni and/or Co leads to the archetypal O‐redox cathodes Li[Li<sub>0.2</sub>Ni<sub>0.2</sub>Mn<sub>0.6</sub>]O<sub>2</sub> and Li[Li<sub>0.2</sub>Ni<sub>0.13</sub>Co<sub>0.13</sub>Mn<sub>0.54</sub>]O<sub>2</sub>, which exhibit much reduced oxygen loss. Understanding the factors that determine the degree of reversible O‐redox versus irreversible O‐loss is important if Li‐rich cathodes are to be exploited in next generation lithium‐ion batteries. Here it is shown that the almost complete eradication of O‐loss with Ni substitution is due to the presence of a less Li‐rich, more Ni‐rich (nearer stoichiometric) rocksalt shell at the surface of the particles compared with the bulk, which acts as a self‐protecting layer against O‐loss. In the case of Ni and Co co‐substitution, a thinner rocksalt shell forms, and the O‐loss is more abundant. In contrast, Co doping does not result in a surface shell yet it still suppresses O‐loss, although less so than Ni and Ni/Co doping, indicating that doping without shell formation is effective and that two mechanisms exist for O‐loss suppression.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 08:30:20 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/077fc5c8-f217-4806-b299-1561afb2e88a/adfm202003660-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"0df1ada5bdb95b0a45d1b24234d03fc6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn44@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-55-247_1f023aa6dcb90635.webp","author":"\nEdouard Boivin, \nNiccolo Guerrini, \nRobert A.

Furthermore, this undesired self‐heating for a free‐standing thin‐film LEC can be suppressed by the employment of a device architecture featuring high thermal conductance and a small emission‐area fill factor, since the corresponding improved heat conduction to the nonemissive regions facilitates more efficient heat transfer to the ambient surroundings.

Real applications, however, meet challenges, with the central concern being the robustness to resist mechanical abrasions and impacts. Here, a revolutionary strategy is proposed to create a microskeleton‐nanofiller (MSNF) film with exceptionally mechanical superstable superhydrophobicity. The strategy is conceptually different from the traditional superhydrophobic 3D microskeleton, because a 3D microskeleton is used to completely fill in the infused superhydrophobic medium. The resulting MSNF film can reserve superhydrophobicity under not only continuous abrasion before the complete wearing off the film, but also Taber abrasion, knife‐scratch, and cyclic tape peels. In addition, the MSNF film enables damage resistance to heavy impact at least up to a kinetic energy of ≈40.2 J. Furthermore, the MSNF film is also superamphiphobic to prevent oil contamination and can reserve the superhydrophobicity under large bending or torsion. Together with robustness and scalability, the MSNF film will be useful in automobiles, ships, aircraft, and houses in harsh environments and the strategy can extend to various inexpensive structured materials (such as porous iron).</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:48:07 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/71c6372b-12ad-4665-9c9f-ab8ca0a3abbc/adfm201910665-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"3fd0c32258d7c5441644eb1a3c88fb08","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-54-239_e70dc550146fc7eb.webp","author":"\nYongquan Qing, \nSonglin Shi, \nCunjing Lv, \nQuanshui Zheng\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/71c6372b-12ad-4665-9c9f-ab8ca0a3abbc/adfm201910665-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn40@2020_6/2020/08/16/10-13-51-963_e70dc550146fc7eb.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Blocking of Conducting Channels Widens Window for Ferroelectric Resistive Switching in Interface‐Engineered Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Tunnel Devices","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202002638?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b2d3be0-ba26-433a-a221-c5dc75f57661/adfm202002638-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Blocking of Conducting Channels Widens Window for Ferroelectric Resistive Switching in Interface‐Engineered Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Tunnel Devices\"/>\n<p>The electroresistance on interface‐engineered hafnium‐oxide based ferroelectric tunnel junctions is analyzed.

In (111) HZO epitaxial films on (001) SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, for instance, twinned orthorhombic (o‐HZO) ferroelectric crystallites coexist with grain boundaries between o‐HZO and a residual paraelectric monoclinic (m‐HZO) phase. These grain boundaries contribute to the resistive switching response in addition to the genuine ferroelectric polarization switching and have detrimental effects on device performance. Here, it is shown that, by using suitable nanometric capping layer deposited on HZO film, a radical improvement of the operation window of the tunnel device can be achieved. Crystalline SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and amorphous AlO<i>\n   <sub>x</sub>\n</i> are explored as capping layers. It is observed that these layers conformally coat the HZO surface and allow to increase the yield and homogeneity of ferroelectric junctions while strengthening endurance. Data show that the capping layers block ionic‐like transport channels across grain boundaries. It is suggested that they act as oxygen suppliers to the oxygen‐getters grain boundaries in HZO. In this scenario it could be envisaged that these and other oxides could also be explored and tested for fully compatible CMOS technologies.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b2d3be0-ba26-433a-a221-c5dc75f57661/adfm202002638-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"dbf775062f8e9841d3766df6b92fae70","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-49-674_92631cf72f557b3b.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":340,"author":"\nMilena Cervo Sulzbach, \nSaúl Estandía, \nJaume Gàzquez, \nFlorencio Sánchez, \nIgnasi Fina, \nJosep Fontcuberta\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b2d3be0-ba26-433a-a221-c5dc75f57661/adfm202002638-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-13-51-349_92631cf72f557b3b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"A “Trojan Horse” Camouflage Strategy for High‐Performance Cellulose Paper and Separators","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202002169?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/29d15afe-307a-4328-a423-e5d9a711f5e3/adfm202002169-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"A “Trojan Horse” Camouflage Strategy for High‐Performance Cellulose Paper and Separators\"/>\n<p>A camouflage strategy is invented to integrate cellulose fibrils and lignosulfonate through charge attraction mediated by cross‐linkable polycation.

Facile restoration of LCC analogues in paper is challenging because of the charge repulsion between negatively charged lignin and pulp fibrils. A camouflage strategy is discovered to prepare positively charged lignosulfonate–polyamide‐epichlorohydrin complex (LPC) nanoparticles, which are effectively incorporated in pulp through the “LPC–pulp” attraction instead of “lignosulfonate–pulp” repulsion. Water‐resistant LPC paper sheets are prepared in ≈20 min without pressurization. They exhibit high tensile strength (41 MPa), surviving boiling water treatment for 14 days, on par with the strength of pristine paper and certain plastics in a dry state. The camouflage strategy applies to various pulps and processing technologies, as exemplified by a paper separator showing exceptional electrolyte wettability and rate capability in lithium‐ion batteries. This work establishes advanced cellulose valorization with combined strength, water stability, and tailored microstructures replacing petroleum polymers in engineering and energy implications.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/29d15afe-307a-4328-a423-e5d9a711f5e3/adfm202002169-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"b6fb21a5dfcd187f60e8696cab9fb352","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn39@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-13-57-386_e2bbf53386c92bd9.webp","author":"\nFang Zhang, \nXiwei Lan, \nHuawen Peng, \nXianluo Hu, \nQiang Zhao\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/29d15afe-307a-4328-a423-e5d9a711f5e3/adfm202002169-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/16/10-13-55-829_e2bbf53386c92bd9.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Bioresorbable Wireless Sensors as Temporary Implants for In Vivo Measurements of Pressure","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202003754?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f73ff00b-6ec6-4092-b690-3b061590367c/adfm202003754-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Bioresorbable Wireless Sensors as Temporary Implants for In Vivo Measurements of Pressure\"/>\n<p>Bioresorbable electronic technologies serve as the basis for implantable sensors that monitor symptoms of temporary medical conditions and then disappear naturally within the body, without the need for extraction surgeries.

This study describes the preparation of highly aligned poly(ε‐caprolactone) (PCL) fiber conduits coated with a concentration gradient of nerve growth factor (NGF) (A/G‐PCL) using a newly designed electrospinning receiving device. The A/G‐PCL conduits are confirmed in vitro to enhance and attract the neurite longitudinal growth of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons toward their high‐concentration gradient side. In vivo, the A/G‐PCL conduits are observed to direct a longitudinal stronger attraction of axons and migration of Schwann cells in 15 mm rat sciatic nerve defects. At 12 weeks, rats transplanted with A/G‐PCL conduits show satisfactory morphological and functional improvements in g‐ratio, total number, and area of myelinated nerve fibers as well as the sciatic function index, compound muscle action potentials, and muscle wet weight ratio as compared to aligned PCL fibers conduits with uniform NGF (A/U‐PCL). The performance of A/G‐PCL is similar to that of autografts. Moreover, mRNA‐seq and RT‐PCR results reveal that Rap1, MAPK, and cell adhesion molecules signaling pathways are closely associated with axon chemotactic response and attraction. Altogether, by combining structural guidance with axon chemotaxis, the NGF‐gradient/aligned PCL fiber conduits represent a promising approach for peripheral nerve defect repair.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 13:59:52 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ba6c63d0-f0bd-47a8-b373-d9fc68e711c4/adfm202002610-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"5fdfe718bc7f1ae114998cbe75eb0c5d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn31@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-13-54-286_b9cb7df5b2dabafa.webp","author":"\nLei Zhu, \nShuaijun Jia, \nTuanjiang Liu, \nLiang Yan, \nDageng Huang, \nZhiyuan Wang, \nShi Chen, \nZhengping Zhang, \nWen Zeng, \nYing Zhang, \nHao Yang, \nDingjun Hao\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ba6c63d0-f0bd-47a8-b373-d9fc68e711c4/adfm202002610-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn47@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-13-52-138_b9cb7df5b2dabafa.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Nonthermal Dynamics of Dielectric Functions in a Resonantly Bonded Photoexcited Material","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202002821?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/84dcddfa-d391-4923-acd1-bcdfbc29828c/adfm202002821-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Nonthermal Dynamics of Dielectric Functions in a Resonantly Bonded Photoexcited Material\"/>\n<p>It has been recently known that femtosecond‐laser‐induced ultrafast amorphization of “phase change materials” such as GeSbTe or AgInSbTe occurs in several picoseconds, and it remains unknown whether such an ultrafast phase change is thermal or nonthermal.

This work shows a methodology to identify a thermalization‐time domain of a photoexcited semiconductor, where it can be detected by monitoring the time‐resolved photoabsorption broadband spectrum and comparing that to thermally induced spectrum changes, by which the electron–lattice thermalization time is evaluated to be 12 ps for PbTe. Further analyzing the dynamic dielectric functions substantiates that thermalization time is related to the recovery time of the resonant bonding. Such a crucial determination of thermalization time would eliminate an uncertainty of “thermal or nonthermal” in ultrafast phase change of the resonantly bonded materials.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:15:28 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/84dcddfa-d391-4923-acd1-bcdfbc29828c/adfm202002821-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"b7491597c100ead25d89911a4832a697","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-13-52-454_f1a2164efc9ede12.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":269,"author":"\nHiroshi Tanimura, \nShinji Watanabe, \nTetsu Ichitsubo\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/84dcddfa-d391-4923-acd1-bcdfbc29828c/adfm202002821-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-13-57-349_f1a2164efc9ede12.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Synthesizing Organo/Hydrogel Hybrids with Diverse Programmable Patterns and Ultrafast Self‐Actuating Ability via a Site‐Specific “In Situ” Transformation Strategy","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202002163?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ecb6ed99-f821-4f27-abd9-4a15498dd987/adfm202002163-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Synthesizing Organo/Hydrogel Hybrids with Diverse Programmable Patterns and Ultrafast Self‐Actuating Ability via a Site‐Specific “In Situ” Transformation Strategy\"/>\n<p>Relying on the high efficiency of the aminolysis of poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate), an “in situ” transformation strategy is developed to synthesize organo/hydrogel hybrids with diverse and mable patterns.

Most of these systems employ hydrophobic small molecules during either stem cell differentiation, drug screening, or organoid development. However, due to PDMS's structure and hydrophobicity, lipophilic molecules are strongly absorbed creating unpredictable concentrations of mitogens, drugs, differentiation factors, and analytes, which is a major limitation in its use for biological applications. In this study, several catechol‐functionalized calix[4]arene based macrocyclic polyphenols (MPPs) are synthesized and coated on PDMS through a dip‐coating or flow through process. One molecule, MPP5<sub>cone</sub>, synthesized from catechol and resorcinol in its cone isomer form, increases the hydrophilicity of PDMS and drastically reduces the absorption of a number of hydrophobic drug surrogates, while preserving high oxygen permeability, good cell viability and function. However, simple rules of molecular absorption based on Log P are not observed, suggesting screening barrier coatings for PDMS with single probes is not sufficient. The coating procedure is easily translated to microfluidic devices by infusion through channels with a pump, and therefore should find use in applications where molecular absorption into PDMS is a significant problem.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/71f5e420-3276-489a-9ce3-ac195b26a5d0/adfm202001274-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"30cf4a26bde07552ac2c41ee7182b31a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-57-949_16100648c58aafee.webp","author":"\nWillie Mae Reese, \nPatrick Burch, \nAngie B.

Herein, a molecule design strategy to improve the PLQY in 0D metal halides is proposed. Two new lead‐free organic–inorganic metal halide hybrids with broadband orange emissions have been prepared with a PLQY increase of 57% from (C<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>16</sub>)SbCl<sub>5</sub> (<b>I</b>) to (C<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>16</sub>)SbCl<sub>5</sub>⋅H<sub>2</sub>O (<b>II</b>) by introducing H<sub>2</sub>O molecules.

LECs have a simple structure and can be fabricated using low‐cost methods and materials and are seen as the next big thing in organic devices after organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs). In particular, expectations are high, in that LECs could be used to create a new generation of low‐cost lighting systems, making use of their surface‐emitting property. Getting such systems to the market will require the development of highly efficient white light‐emitting LECs. A variety of methods for obtaining white emission based on the light‐mixing principle have been explored. Among these, the use of exciplexes formed between donor‐type and acceptor‐type molecules is one of the more promising. Exciplex emission is broad in spectrum and can be used to produce LECs with a high color rendering index. In this progress report, the recent developments in research into LECs designed to utilize exciplex emission and present technologies used to obtain white emission are discussed. The potential for using thermally activated delayed fluorescence to improve efficiency is described.

The produced arrays of semiconductor features exhibit dimensions in the sub‐10 nm scale and their dimensions are independent of the lithographical patterning resolution.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Atomic‐precision patterning at large scale is a central requirement for nanotechnology and future electronics that is hindered by the limitations of lithographical techniques. Historically, imperfections of the fabrication tools have been compensated by multi‐patterning using sequential lithography processes. The realization of nanometer‐scale features from much larger patterns through offset stacking of atomically thin masks is demonstrated. A unique mutual stabilization effect between two graphene layers produces atomically abrupt transitions that selectively expose single‐layer covered regions. Bilayer regions, on the other hand, protect the underlying substrate from removal for several hours permitting transfer of atomic thickness variations into lateral features in various semiconductors. Nanoscopic offsets between two 2D materials layers could be introduced through bottom‐up and top‐down approaches, opening up new routes for high‐resolution patterning. A self‐aligned templating approach yields nanometer‐wide bilayer graphene nanoribbons with macroscopic length that produces high‐aspect‐ratio silicon nanowalls. Moreover, offset‐transfer of lithographically patterned graphene layers enables multipatterning of large arrays of semiconductor features whose resolution is not limited by the employed lithography and could reach &lt;10 nm feature size.

Since then, LECs have evolved through the discovery of new suitable emitters, understanding the working mechanism of devices, and the development of various fabrication methods. LECs are best known for their simple architecture and easy, low‐cost fabrication techniques. The key feature of their fabrication is the use of air stable electrodes and a single active layer consisting of mobile ions that enable efficient charge injection and transport processes within LEC devices. More importantly, LEC devices can be operated at low voltages with high efficiencies, contributing to their widespread interest.

It is therefore not surprising that the search for the perfect antifouling coating has been going on for decades. With the discovery of metal‐based antifouling paints in the 1970s, fouling was thought to be a problem of the past, yet its untargeted toxicity led to serious ecological concern, and its use became prohibited.

Nanomedicines have served as a paradigm for preferential tumor accumulation but still confront issues such as poor circulation and insufficient tumor accumulation. By virtue of coating nanoparticles with cell membranes from diverse cell sources, active proteins on cell membranes can impart a variety of desired functionalities or supplementary therapeutic effects to nanoparticles, providing ways for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

The critical issues of charge separation as exemplified in NIR‐NFA OSCs based on the paradigm blend of PTB7–Th donor (D) and IEICO–4F acceptor (A) are revealed here. These studies corroborate efficient charge transfer between D and A, accompanied by geminate recombination of photo‐excited charge carriers.

By incorporation of a third‐component of benchmark ITIC or PC<sub>71</sub>BM with various molar ratios, these two issues are well‐resolved accordingly, yet in distinctly influencing mechanisms. ITIC molecules modulate film morphology to create more continuous paths for charge transportation, whereas PC<sub>71</sub>BM diminishes CTS and enhances electron transfer at the D/A interfaces.

Among them, LECs based on phosphorescent iridium(III) complexes have attracted significant research interest in the past 15 years, because of their high efficiency and tunable emission color across the entire visible spectrum. To fabricate white LECs for lighting, high‐performance blue LECs are the first prerequisite. Huge efforts have been devoted to improving the performances of blue LECs based on iridium(III) complexes either by developing new blue‐emitting complexes or by engineering the devices. Nevertheless, blue LECs have still shown much lower performances (brightness, efficiency, stability, etc.) compared to the red, orange‐red, yellow, and green counterpart devices. In particular, a single blue LEC with satisfactory blue‐color purity, high efficiency, and high stability is still missing. Here, the advances in blue‐emitting iridium(III) complexes for LECs and the device engineering on LECs using the complexes are reported.

While keeping constant stress relaxation and systematically decoupling overall stiffness from linear elongation, an energy dissipation term (J mol<sup>−1</sup>) is introduced, that is the molar energy required to deviate from linear stress–strain regime and enter into plastic region. Strikingly, an inverse relationship is unveiled between substrate dissipation energy and cell response, with high adhesion/high spreading and low adhesion/no spreading detected for substrates at low and high dissipation energy, respectively.

In contrast, recent advances in device technologies and material synthesis have opened a route for LECs using nonpolymeric materials. This progress report focuses on current developments in the device concepts, mechanisms, and characteristics of LECs that allow the utilization of nonpolymeric materials. First, the three primary device types, namely, electrochemically doped, ionic‐material, and electrostatically doped LECs, are categorized, and their distinct features are described. Second, electrochemically doped LECs based on small molecules and branched molecules are introduced. Then, an overview of the rapidly growing field of ionic‐material LECs, especially ionic transition metal complexes, ionic small molecules and perovskites, and their characteristics are provided. Following these results, recent achievements in solid‐state materials, such as inorganic single crystals, quantum dots, and 2D materials, as electrostatically doped LECs are highlighted. Finally, an overview and evaluation of these LECs reveal the key directions and remaining issues that must be overcome to further functionalize LECs, which provide a versatile approach for new lighting applications comprising emergent materials.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:37:59 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5e5968a3-0601-46f1-9344-8de81504f287/adfm201908641-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"0f87eb3c027b900a45726e19ad39470c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn40@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-53-583_7b934d1739c0a059.webp","author":"\nKeiichiro Matsuki, \nJiang Pu, \nTaishi Takenobu\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5e5968a3-0601-46f1-9344-8de81504f287/adfm201908641-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn24@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-53-396_7b934d1739c0a059.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Controllable Stiffness Origami “Skeletons” for Lightweight and Multifunctional Artificial Muscles","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202000349?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e2febb8d-41ef-4751-8169-d3b7a800cd32/adfm202000349-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Controllable Stiffness Origami “Skeletons” for Lightweight and Multifunctional Artificial Muscles\"/>\n<p>Inspired by the human limb and by combining the adjustable stiffness of muscles and origami folding of joints, controllable stiffness origami “skeletons” are embedded into a common monofunctional vacuumed‐powered cube‐shaped (CUBE) artificial muscle, thereby enabling the monofunctional CUBE artificial muscle to achieve lightweight and multifunctionality as well as controllable force/motion output without sacrificing its volume and shape.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Flexible, material‐based, artificial muscles enable compliant and safe technologies for human–machine interaction devices and adaptive soft robots, yet there remain long‐term challenges in the development of artificial muscles capable of mimicking flexible, controllable, and multifunctional human activity.

For example, random GBs in Si solar cells are found to have a detrimental effect on the cell performance being characterized by an increased recombination activity relative to grains. Yet, their role in Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) solar cells still remains controversial. The recent electron‐beam‐induced current (EBIC) study shows that 58% of the GBs in CIGS exhibit enhanced electrical properties considered to be benign (for the device performance). Yet, they coexist with 16% detrimental GBs (reduced electrical properties) and 27% neutral ones (no change in electrical property when compared with the bulk). In the present study, these different GBs are investigated by combining EBIC with electron backscattered diffraction and atom probe tomography techniques on identical GBs. For the first time, a successful correlation is shown (for any device) that interconnects the GB characteristics to its composition. Sufficient statistics demonstrate that the collective fluctuations of all elements at GBs determine its trait. In general, benign (detrimental) GBs are characterized by Cu depletion (enrichment) that favored the formation of donor (acceptor) defects.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:15:28 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a91b0f00-c5f2-4ff6-b6dd-294b417911e8/adfm202001046-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"d8a7db8b86678d6644c1334b8a32c310","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-13-52-529_de33888611f62b46.webp","author":"\nMohit Raghuwanshi, \nRoland Wuerz, \nOana Cojocaru‐Mirédin\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a91b0f00-c5f2-4ff6-b6dd-294b417911e8/adfm202001046-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-49-716_de33888611f62b46.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Origin of the Exclusive Ternary Electroluminescent Behavior of BN‐Doped Nanographenes in Efficient Single‐Component White Light‐Emitting Electrochemical Cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.201906830?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d8254f16-10ff-422a-950d-603bd1afcbcd/adfm201906830-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Origin of the Exclusive Ternary Electroluminescent Behavior of BN‐Doped Nanographenes in Efficient Single‐Component White Light‐Emitting Electrochemical Cells\"/>\n<p>The origin of the white ternary electroluminescent behavior of BN‐doped nanographenes with a B<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub> doping pattern (hexa‐perihexabenzoborazinocoronene) is rationalized.

However, to date, there are rather limited trials to regulate the mechanical factors toward tumor treatment or imaging. Here, a synergistic antitumor therapy of cryoablation and gallium microparticles (GMs) mediated bomb‐explosion‐like mechanical destruction is proposed for the first time. Moreover, the GMs are demonstrated to enhance the T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) effect and mediate the dual‐mode imaging of computerized tomography (CT) and MRI. The GMs are found to exert a mechanical force to surrounding chitosan ice crystals during freezing, which is attributed to the volume expansion during the phase transition process. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of piercing gallium materials via a sword‐like shape into the solid ice crystals is observed with a penetration length of 150 µm within 1 ms, which further shows the remarkable mechanical destruction to frozen ice crystals. Furthermore, a series of in vitro and in vivo results prove the negligible biotoxicity and good biocompatible of GMs. The in vivo synergistic therapy exhibits effective destructive results with reduced recurrence rate and prolonged survival.

The film is generated by adding a conductive carbon nanotubes polydopamine (PDA) filler into an elastic polyurethane (PU) inverse opal scaffold. Owing to the brilliant flexibility and inverse opal structure of the PU layer, the film shows stable stretchability and brilliant structural color.

Here a self‐powered fire alarm system based on a novel multilayered cylindrical triboelectric nanogenerator (MC‐TENG) that can produce electrical power for the detection sensors by harvesting the kinetic energy of moving tree branches in a forest is presented. The major parameters for harvesting the kinetic energy using the proposed MC‐TENG are investigated, including the number of triboelectric layers, the frequency, the amplitude of external excitation, and the orientation between motion direction and device configuration. The fabricated MC‐TENG results in a peak power of 2.9 mW and a maximum average power of 1.2 mW at a low frequency of 1.25 Hz. The integrated self‐powered forest fire alarm system, consisting of fire sensors, a carbon‐based micro‐supercapacitor, and the MC‐TENG, is demonstrated to be able to report fire risk or hazard efficiently, accurately, and robustly.

Graphene oxide (GO) and gelatin‐methacrylate (GelMA) are polymerized and chemically reduced to form reduced (GO/GelMA) (r(GO/GelMA)). The prepared materials present good electrical conductivity, flexibility, mechanical stability, and permeability, which are suitable for use as NGCs. In vitro studies show 2.1‐ and 1.4‐fold promotion of neuritogenesis of PC12 neuronal cells on r(GO/GelMA) compared to GelMA and unreduced GO/GelMA, respectively. Animal studies using a rat sciatic nerve injury model with a 10 mm gap between the proximal and distal regions of the defect reveal that r(GO/GelMA) NGCs significantly enhance peripheral nerve regeneration, indicated by improved muscle weight increase, electro‐conduction velocity, and sciatic nerve function index. Specifically, r(GO/GelMA) NGCs are utilized to potentiate regrowth with myelination in rat sciatic nerves followed by histological, immunohistological, and morphometrical analyses.

At first sight, this “band structure engineering” seems impossible in organic semiconductors, which usually exhibit localized electronic states instead of Bloch bands. However, the strong Coulomb interaction in organic semiconductors allows for a continuous shift of the ionization energy (IE) over a wide range by mixing molecules with halogenated derivatives that exhibit different quadrupole moments. Here, this effect of energy level engineering on blends of pentacene and two fluorinated derivatives, in which the position but not the number of fluorine atoms differ, is studied. Structural investigations confirm that pentacene forms intermixed phases in blends with the fluorinated species. The investigation of electronic properties and simulations reveals a much larger shift of the ionization energy (1.5 eV) than in previous studies, allowing to test this model in a range not investigated so far, and emphasizing the role of the position of the halogen atoms.

Nonetheless, even equilibrium aspects are far from being fully understood. Equilibrium space charge effects at the MAPI/TiO<sub>2</sub> and MAPI/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> interfaces are discussed, which are of paramount significance for solar cells. Different from the photovoltaic literature in which such built‐in potentials are considered as being generated solely by electronic charge carriers, a generalized picture that considers the equilibrium distribution of both ionic and electronic carriers is applied. Experimental evidence is given that shows it is the ions that are responsible for the equilibrium space charge potential, the reason being a pronounced ion adsorption at the contacts. The electronic redistribution is a sheer consequence of the so‐established electric field. Experiments with mesoporous oxide as well as experiments with MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> (MAPBr) indicate photovoltaic relevance and material generality in terms of the choice of the lead‐based perovskite.

The synthesized patterned graphene on the <i>c</i>‐plane of NPSS is verified to be monolayer and high quality. The patterned graphene enables the selective and well‐aligned nucleation of aluminium nitride (AlN) to promote rapid epitaxial lateral overgrowth of single‐crystal AlN films with low dislocation density. Consequently, the fabricated UV‐LED demonstrates high luminescence intensity and stability. The method is suitable for obtaining various patterned graphene by substrate design, which will allow for greater progress in the cutting‐edge applications of graphene.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:15:28 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b55f680b-77d2-428d-b934-5d67506af18a/adfm202001483-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"01430fd51a771b1ca41e56fcb68c363c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn92@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-52-653_83da4b41c9dc51bf.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":297,"author":"\nZhaolong Chen, \nHongliang Chang, \nTing Cheng, \nTongbo Wei, \nRuoyu Wang, \nShenyuan Yang, \nZhipeng Dou, \nBingyao Liu, \nShishu Zhang, \nYadian Xie, \nZhiqiang Liu, \nYanfeng Zhang, \nJinmin Li, \nFeng Ding, \nPeng Gao, \nZhongfan Liu\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b55f680b-77d2-428d-b934-5d67506af18a/adfm202001483-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn96@2020_6/2020/08/16/10-13-53-314_83da4b41c9dc51bf.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Triboelectric Nanogenerators: Multilayered Cylindrical Triboelectric Nanogenerator to Harvest Kinetic Energy of Tree Branches for Monitoring Environment Condition and Forest Fire (Adv.

Here, In‐Ga‐Zn‐O memtransistors using a naturally oxidized Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and an ion gel as a common gate stacking dielectric is proposed. Positive charge trapping in the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer can be induced by modulating the gate voltage, which causes the back sweep subthreshold swing (SS) of the device to break the physical limit (≥60 mV per decade at room temperature), and the minimum SS is as low as 26.4 mV per decade. In addition, photogenerated charges in the device are captured at the In‐Ga‐Zn‐O channel/ion gel interface due to the superposition of the additional electric field generated by positive charges trapped in the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer and the external gate electric field. Thus, persistent photoconductivity is observed in the In‐Ga‐Zn‐O memtransistors.

A clear understanding of the switching mechanisms in this type of memristors, however, is still in its early stages.

The superior properties of simple device architecture, low‐voltage operation, and compatibility with inert metal electrode render LECs suitable for cost‐effective light‐emitting sources.

The enhanced π back donation induced by the Lewis base as the electron donor is first confirmed by first‐principle calculations, which greatly activates the NN bond and promotes its dissociation. Moreover, as suggested by molecular dynamics simulations, such abundant Lewis base would contribute to more surface heterogeneity and thus enhanced van der Waals interactions between nitrogen and the catalyst. Localized high concentration of N<sub>2</sub> molecules can be realized at the catalyst surface, enabling efficient N<sub>2</sub> delivery with a high flux and benefiting the following reaction process. As expected, the proof‐of‐concept metal‐free catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 62.9% and ammonia yield rate of 41.1 µg h<sup>−1</sup> mg<sup>−1</sup> at −0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. With this Lewis base‐assisted strategy, the superior efficiency would greatly reduce the energy loss of the system and cut down the fundamental cost, thus contributing to future practical applications.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 10:28:21 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d2649a6e-0b65-4313-b573-6fad3b4daa0c/adfm202001244-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"a42fe7bc9b9d35291f3c19654562b41c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn47@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-50-515_060f969d4da78b3f.webp","author":"\nMengfan Wang, \nSisi Liu, \nHaoqing Ji, \nJie Liu, \nChenglin Yan, \nTao Qian\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d2649a6e-0b65-4313-b573-6fad3b4daa0c/adfm202001244-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-13-54-846_060f969d4da78b3f.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Fabrication of MAPbBr3 Single Crystal p‐n Photodiode and n‐p‐n Phototriode for Sensitive Light Detection Application","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202001033?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1a91c105-fded-4250-9409-628867feb16b/adfm202001033-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Fabrication of MAPbBr3 Single Crystal p‐n Photodiode and n‐p‐n Phototriode for Sensitive Light Detection Application\"/>\n<p>A MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystal p‐n perovskite homojunction photodiode and n‐p‐n phototriode are successfully fabricated through controlled incorporation of Bi<sup>3+</sup> ions in solution.

The resulting membranes yield an attractive postcombustion carbon capture performance (CO<sub>2</sub> permeance up to 2470 GPU; CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity up to 33), improving upon the selectivity of the graphene and nanoporous polymer by at least two‐fold.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>High‐flux nanoporous single‐layer graphene membranes are highly promising for energy‐efficient gas separation. Herein, in the context of carbon capture, a remarkable enhancement in the CO<sub>2</sub> selectivity is demonstrated by uniquely masking nanoporous single‐layer graphene with polymer with intrinsic microporosity (PIM‐1). In the process, a major bottleneck of the state‐of‐the‐art pore‐incorporation techniques in graphene has been overcome, where in addition to the molecular sieving nanopores, larger nonselective nanopores are also incorporated, which so far, has restricted the realization of CO<sub>2</sub>‐sieving from graphene membranes. Overall, much higher CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity (33) is achieved from the composite film than that from the standalone nanoporous graphene (NG) (10) and the PIM‐1 membranes (15), crossing the selectivity target (20) for postcombustion carbon capture. The selectivity enhancement is explained by an analytical gas transport model for NG, which shows that the transport of the stronger‐adsorbing CO<sub>2</sub> is dominated by the adsorbed phase transport pathway whereas the transport of N<sub>2</sub> benefits significantly from the direct gas‐phase transport pathway. Further, slow positron annihilation Doppler broadening spectroscopy reveals that the interactions with graphene reduce the free volume of interfacial PIM‐1 chains which is expected to contribute to the selectivity. Overall, this approach brings graphene membrane a step closer to industrial deployment.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 08:31:41 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/a9690b47-6cde-43de-8dc2-ca501e353571/adfm202003979-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"7c6c26c48f0ce0cf97e8abd33d05fca2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn3@2020_4/2020/08/16/10-13-56-437_a6a570ea247a602c.webp","author":"\nGuangwei He, \nShiqi Huang, \nLuis Francisco Villalobos, \nMohammad Tohidi Vahdat, \nMichael D.

Polybubbles can also enable on‐demand delivery of cargo upon light activation to further regulate cargo release.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Vaccine coverage is severely limited in developing countries due to inefficient protection of vaccine functionality as well as lack of patient compliance to receive the additional booster doses. Thus, there is an urgent need to design a thermostable vaccine delivery platform that also enables release of the bolus after predetermined time. Here, the formation of injectable and light‐activatable polybubbles for vaccine delivery is reported. In vitro studies show that polybubbles enable delayed burst release, irrespective of cargo types, namely small molecule and antigen. The extracorporeal activation of polybubbles is achieved by incorporating near‐infrared (NIR)‐sensitive gold nanorods (AuNRs). Interestingly, light‐activatable polybubbles can be used for on‐demand burst release of cargo. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies demonstrate successful activation of AuNR‐loaded polybubbles. Overall, the light‐activatable polybubble technology can be used for on‐demand delivery of various therapeutics including small molecule drugs, immunologically relevant protein, peptide antigens, and nucleic acids.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:15:28 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/22472b6b-90f5-4bb8-96e9-c5ead89fa940/adfm202003579-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"0439c518f2748d064f012bc210099aed","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-13-51-403_8bf071335b3a5975.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":312,"author":"\nShreedevi Arun Kumar, \nJacob Good, \nDavid Hendrix, \nEunsoo Yoo, \nDongin Kim, \nKaivalya A.

It is a facile preparation/operation for trauma emergency. This LBA achieves more rapid tissue integration (&lt;10 s) and stronger adhesive strength (up to 97.65 kPa) than most of the recently developed hydrogel‐based tissue adhesives.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Massive bleeding and wound infection after tissue trauma are the major dangerous factors of casualties in disasters; hence, first‐aid supplies that can greatly achieve wound closure and effectively control the hemorrhage and infection are urgently needed. Although existing tissue adhesives can adhere to the tissue surfaces and achieve rapid wound closure, most of them have limited hemostatic and antibacterial capacities, making them unsuitable as the first‐aid tissue adhesives. In this study, inspired by the inherent hemostatic and antibacterial capacities of chitosan and the excellent tissue integration capacity originating from a Schiff base reaction, liquid bandage (LBA), an in situ imine crosslinking‐based photoresponsive chitosan hydrogel (NB‐CMC/CMC hydrogel), is developed for emergency wound management. Upon UV irradiation, <i>o</i>‐nitrobenzene in modified carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) converts to <i>o</i>‐nitrosobenzaldehyde that subsequently crosslinks with amino groups on tissue surface, which endows the LBA with superior tissue adhesive performance. LBA's hemostatic and antibacterial properties can be tuned by the mass ratio of NB‐CMC/CMC. Moreover, it exhibits satisfactory biocompatibility, biodegradability, and the capability to enhance wound healing process. This study sheds new light on the development of a multifunctional hydrogel‐based first‐aid tissue adhesive that can achieve robust tissue adhesion, effectively control bleeding, prevent bacterial infection, and promote wound healing.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:52:03 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e0b1ea1b-efcc-4369-9478-af5beb02d7bc/adfm202001820-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"5eb9ed92a372dc358f8864fee2712a60","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-52-859_14da794e52639671.webp","author":"\nYufei Ma, \nJingxuan Yao, \nQian Liu, \nTing Han, \nJiping Zhao, \nXiaohua Ma, \nYingmu Tong, \nGuorui Jin, \nKai Qu, \nBaoqiang Li, \nFeng Xu\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e0b1ea1b-efcc-4369-9478-af5beb02d7bc/adfm202001820-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-13-55-117_14da794e52639671.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Nonpolymeric LECs: Recent Progress on Light‐Emitting Electrochemical Cells with Nonpolymeric Materials (Adv.

A layer of parylene is deposited on graphene/copper (Cu) foils grown by chemical vapor deposition and are laminated onto ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA)/poly(ethylene terephthalate). Then, the samples are delaminated from the Cu using an electrochemical transfer process, resulting in flexible and conductive substrates with sheet resistances of below 300 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup>, which is significantly better (fourfold) than the sample transferred by R2R without parylene (1200 Ω sq<sup>−1</sup>). The characterization results indicate that parylene C and D dope graphene due to the presence of chlorine atoms in their structure, resulting in higher carrier density and thus lower sheet resistance. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the binding energy between parylene and graphene is stronger than that of EVA and graphene, which may lead to less tear in graphene during the R2R transfer. Finally, organic solar cells are fabricated on the ultrathin and flexible parylene/graphene substrates and an ultra‐lightweight device is achieved with a power conversion efficiency of 5.86%.

Although 3D printing fabricates inanimate objects, the emerging technology of 4D printing allows for animated structures that change their shape, function, or properties over time when exposed to specific external stimuli after fabrication. Among the materials used in 4D printing, hydrogels have attracted growing interest due to the availability of various smart hydrogels. The reversible shape‐morphing in 4D printed hydrogel structures is driven by a stress mismatch arising from the different swelling degrees in the parts of the structure upon application of a stimulus. This review provides the state‐of‐the‐art of 4D printing of hydrogels from the materials perspective. First, the main 3D printing technologies employed are briefly depicted, and, for each one, the required physico‐chemical properties of the precursor material. Then, the hydrogels that have been printed are described, including stimuli‐responsive hydrogels, non‐responsive hydrogels that are sensitive to solvent absorption/desorption, and multimaterial structures that are totally hydrogel‐based. Finally, the current and future applications of this technology are presented, and the requisites and avenues of improvement in terms of material properties are discussed.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:15:28 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/63ea1eb4-8e06-4dda-9ca6-33d68628171b/adfm201910606-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"511011fc32dbc3eb46c52e6940a36b18","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn52@2020_1/2020/08/16/10-13-58-512_772858d018058f11.webp","destWidth":394,"destHeight":394,"author":"\nMathilde Champeau, \nDaniel Alves Heinze, \nThiago Nunes Viana, \nEdcarlos Rodrigues de Souza, \nAnne Cristine Chinellato, \nSilvia Titotto\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/63ea1eb4-8e06-4dda-9ca6-33d68628171b/adfm201910606-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-51-278_772858d018058f11.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Polymer Light‐Emitting Electrochemical Cells with Bipolar Electrode‐Dynamic Doping and Wireless Electroluminescence","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.201907003?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ca4c20e9-5841-48df-8e0a-832716764ddc/adfm201907003-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Polymer Light‐Emitting Electrochemical Cells with Bipolar Electrode‐Dynamic Doping and Wireless Electroluminescence\"/>\n<p>Light‐emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) containing bipolar electrodes (BPEs) are reviewed.

The PLECs of interest have a planar configuration and contain bipolar electrodes (BPEs). A BPE is an electrically floating conductor immersed in an electrochemical cell that contains redox species. When the electrochemical cell is polarized with an externally applied voltage bias, coupled redox reactions are induced wirelessly at the extremities of the BPEs due to the development of a sufficient interfacial potential difference. BPEs can have a dramatic effect on the doping pattern and the emission profiles of PLECs. In a bulk homojunction PLEC containing a large number of dispersed micro‐BPEs, the turn‐on response and light output are greatly enhanced when multiple light‐emitting p–n junctions form throughout the active layer. PLECs offer a solid‐state platform on which the bipolar electrochemistry phenomena can be investigated, and the understanding of the complex PLEC processes can be improved. This progress report highlights several new BPE types as well as their potential applications for device performance enhancement and for the visualized screening of functional materials.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:37:59 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ca4c20e9-5841-48df-8e0a-832716764ddc/adfm201907003-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"a771a22d3ce130298d5c633bf4641c77","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-49-370_c40c281e8b0a4987.webp","author":"\nShiyu Hu, \nJun Gao\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ca4c20e9-5841-48df-8e0a-832716764ddc/adfm201907003-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn12@2020_2/2020/08/16/10-13-52-633_c40c281e8b0a4987.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Molecular Engineering to Boost AIE‐Active Free Radical Photogenerators and Enable High‐Performance Photodynamic Therapy under Hypoxia","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202002057?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/db03fa6a-cf8a-4b08-bf4b-53f877805e43/adfm202002057-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Molecular Engineering to Boost AIE‐Active Free Radical Photogenerators and Enable High‐Performance Photodynamic Therapy under Hypoxia\"/>\n<p>A feasible molecular engineering method is proposed for achieving the transformation of AIE‐active type I free radical ROS generators from type II <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> species to overcome ACQ effect and enable high‐performance photodynamic theory under hypoxia.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The severe hypoxia in solid tumors and the vicious aggregation‐caused fluorescence quenching (ACQ) of conventional photosensitizers (PSs) have limited the application of fluorescence imaging‐guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), although this therapy has obvious advantages in terms of its precise spatial–temporal control and noninvasive character.

The crystals can be mechanically deformed or can reversibly change color as a function of their temperature, hence their sensitive mechanochromic and thermochromic response make them attractive candidates for a wide range of visual sensing applications.

An introduction to the field, key materials, mechanisms, and recommendations to move the research forward is presented.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The in situ formation of a light‐emitting p–n or p–i–n junction in light‐emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) necessitates mixed ionic–electronic conductors in the active layer. This unique characteristic requires electronic, luminescent, and ionic ingredients that work synergistically in the LECs. The material requirements that lead to promising electroluminescent properties are discussed and the important components reported so far are surveyed. Particular attention is paid to the working mechanisms behind junction formation and stabilization to create efficient and stable electroluminescence in conjugated‐polymer‐based LECs. Keeping these fundamentals in mind explains how LEC devices have evolved from classic conjugated polymer blends into highly stable crosslinked, hybrid composite, and stretchable device architectures. To conclude, a future development strategy is proposed based on a dual approach: develop new materials specifically for LEC devices and explore novel ways to efficiently process and stabilize the p–i–n junction, which will drive improvements in both LEC external quantum efficiency and operating lifetime toward truly low‐cost solid‐state lighting applications.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:37:59 +0000","feedId":205,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2c511301-1737-4791-9ec6-500bb7fceb04/adfm201909102-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"102ef7fe6b75ae8f054fa1ae9576248f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_3/2020/08/16/10-13-54-726_88b2075a161039ad.webp","author":"\nKareem Youssef, \nYing Li, \nSamantha O'Keeffe, \nLu Li, \nQibing Pei\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2c511301-1737-4791-9ec6-500bb7fceb04/adfm201909102-gra-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_5/2020/08/16/10-13-55-421_88b2075a161039ad.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 18:13:48","title":"Self‐Adaptive All‐In‐One Delivery Chip for Rapid Skin Nerves Regeneration by Endogenous Mesenchymal Stem Cells","link":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.202001751?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/79899399-0c88-47e2-927d-2c77e6d5532d/adfm202001751-gra-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Self‐Adaptive All‐In‐One Delivery Chip for Rapid Skin Nerves Regeneration by Endogenous Mesenchymal Stem Cells\"/>\n<p>An all‐in‐one delivery chip that combines protein release, gene delivery, and electrical conduction in a single microfluidic chip is developed by 3D coaxial printing.
