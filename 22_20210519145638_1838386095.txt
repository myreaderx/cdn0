It adds to recent research from <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/retail-trading-stock-market-declined-in-march-despite-stimulus-checks-2021-5-1030410379\">JPMorgan</a> and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/retail-trading-activity-investors-stock-market-april-goldman-2021-4-1030295308\">Goldman Sachs</a> that has shown a considerable drop in activity among amateur investors.</p><p>&#34;The 2020 stay-at-home orders and business closures have meant many have an abundance of time and money, which bred a huge flurry of retail activity,&#34; Josh Mahony, senior market analyst at trading platform IG, said.</p><p>Yet Mahony said the recent fall in retail trading should come as no surprise. &#34;With <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-guidelines-mask-guidance-list-of-states-relaxing-keeping-mandates-2021-5\">restrictions gradually removed</a> and businesses reopening, the question for the months ahead is just how different the new &#39;normal&#39; looks,&#34; he said.</p><p>Piper Sandler&#39;s research, released to clients earlier in May, found that online investing in futures, cash equity and equity option volumes all decreased month on month in April.</p><p>&#34;Trading activity contracted considerably,&#34; the investment bank&#39;s managing director Richard Repetto and analyst Kyle Robinson wrote.</p><p>Piper Sandler found that April&#39;s equity trading volumes fell to 9.9 billion shares per day in April.

As Darren Tierney said to the Committee, the letter of appointment did contain provisions about Mr Greensill&#39;s conflicts of interest and duties on him regarding conduct, propriety and confidentiality.</p><p>&#34;However, my initial assessment of these letters suggests to me that some form of contract was in place whilst he was working for the Cabinet Office.&#34;</p><p>Tierney had previously told the committee that civil servants had not found a contract. He said: &#34;What we have found so far are an appointment letter and then subsequent reappointment letters, which set out some conditions on his appointment-things like the Official Secrets Act, confidentiality, using the Business Appointment Rules when he leaves-but so far we have been unable to identify the contract.&#34;</p><p>A business card for Greensill, obtained by the Labour Party, described Greensill as a &#34;Senior Advisor&#34; in the Prime Minister&#39;s office, including a Downing Street email address and direct landline. Tierney told the committee that Greensill had a pass for the Cabinet Office and Number 10. </p><p>In the committee meeting of April 26, PACAC member David Jones MP asked Tierney if it was possible that Greensill may have acquired &#34;information that would have been of assistance to him in deciding the basis upon which he would offer commercial services to the Government&#34; while working in Downing Street.

A Walmart spokesperson said that the company&#39;s sales of bridal jewelry spiked 80% year to date in April. Meanwhile, the retailer&#39;s seasonal artificial floral business jumped 250% from the beginning of the month. Wedding arts and crafts and wedding décor rose 150% across April.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced many couples to re-think their special days. Some brides and grooms have <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/pandemic-wedding-changes-photo-ideas-2021-1\">opted</a> for small, intimate ceremonies, live-streamed vows, or drive-in nuptials.

Just look for the Prime logo as you shop. Shopping on Amazon without a subscription will end up costing more and is less convenient than without a Prime membership.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&slotNum=4&imprToken=9cba751a-bd93-72b7-651&ie=UTF8&node=8729023011&linkCode=ll2&tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkId=6682463bb80f1ec1cffe5bfbabc939f9&language=en_USe5bfbabc939f9&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Free same-day shipping</a>:</strong> For select items, Amazon also offers free one-day or even same-day shipping. With Prime Free one-day delivery, there&#39;s no minimum purchase for eligible items to be ordered by the afternoon and get your items by 9 p.m. the next day. For same-day shipping orders, shoppers can order eligible items before noon and get them by 9 p.m. the same day.

Most items that are eligible for Prime&#39;s free two-day shipping and are shipped by Amazon can be ordered with Amazon Day.</p><p>You&#39;re not locked into Amazon Day for all your future orders.

he announced in part in an email interview with Insider.</p><p>In February, Harden&#39;s 13 Endeavors made an investment in Therabody along with a group of more than 100 names in sports, business, and entertainment. Other investors included Jay-Z, Aaron Rodgers&#39; growth equity fund Rx3 Growth Partners, Kevin Hart&#39;s Hartbeat Ventures, and Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman&#39;s Thirty Five Ventures.</p><p>In an email exchange with Insider, Harden discussed his investment and new role in the company, and detailed his history of using Therabody&#39;s percussive massage therapy devices in performance recovery, including in his preparation for the 2021 NBA playoffs. </p><p><strong>How did you view Therabody as an investment going into it, in February?</strong></p><p>I had used Therabody products before I became an investor, so I had knowledge of the brand going in, which spurred my investment. I was first introduced to Theragun when I was in Houston. I am lucky enough to have been taught the importance of taking care of my body by world-class trainers and I have had access to incredible technologies, like Theragun, since their inception.</p><p>But I don&#39;t think these products or technologies should be just for the professional athlete, and Therabody is aligned in that. I loved that Theragun rebranded into Therabody last year and expanded the products and services they offer- they are really setting out to break down barriers in the wellness space. Therabody is a brand I truly believe in- like all of my investments. There is so much more to come for them, and I&#39;m excited to be a part of that growth.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a4fce7f27b4c001944541e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"James Harden\" height=\"2624\" width=\"3936\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kenneth Wynn</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>What do you see yourself bringing to this ambassador partnership? What made this the move for you at this time?</strong></p><p>I don&#39;t do anything without putting my all into it. I invested in Therabody because I believe in what they are setting out to do. I&#39;m becoming an ambassador and taking the partnership to the next level because I want more people to understand what their products can do for them. I think specifically within the last year, people are more aware than ever about how they are treating their bodies and what it needs to feel its best- mentally and physically. Everyone deserves self-care, and by partnering with Therabody, I hope I&#39;ll show the world how accessible it is to proactively take care of the mind and body.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a4ff75f27b4c0019445424?format=jpeg\" alt=\"James Harden\" height=\"2624\" width=\"3936\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kenneth Wynn</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>How does the Therabody therapeutic element factor into your preparation for the playoffs here, if it does? What does it involve for you?</strong></p><p>Throughout the years, I&#39;ve learned to be proactive in taking care of my body to feel my best and perform my best during such a long season. Using my Theragun is one of the most important steps in my pregame and postgame routines. Both routines look similar for most games: stretching, listening to music, hydrating, staying focused, and using Theragun. I&#39;ve also started using Therabody&#39;s RecoveryAir pneumatic compression boots, which are amazing at night or on a rest day while playing video games or watching a movie.</p><div

href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrencies-china-crypto-crackdown-price-outlook-2021-5-1030445035\">meltdown in cryptocurrencies</a> sent ether tumbling as much as 44% on Wednesday, with the cryptocurrency falling to its lowest levels since March.</p><p>The cryptocurrency, which is a popular medium of exchange for NFTs, is now down roughly 60% from its recent record-high of $4,380. That&#39;s in stark contrast from its parabolic run in late April and early May, in which it more than doubled in a few short weeks.</p><p>Ether&#39;s not the only cryptocurrency that is down big in recent days. Bitcoin has fallen more than 30% since Monday, with much of the weakness stemming from <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/elon-musk-bitcoin-environment-tesla-crypto-bulls-trolling-2021-5-1030435658\">Elon Musk&#39;s weekend tweets</a> and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-rally-china-bans-banks-crypto-business-btc-2021-5-1030442848\">China reiterating a warning against the speculative asset class.</a></p><p>But bullish investors could see some reprieve as ether tests <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-ether-price-support-levels-downside-technical-analysis-btc-eth-2021-5-1030442270\">a key technical support level,</a> according to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies. </p><p>&#34;The magnitude of [ether&#39;s] pullback shows the risk inherent to parabolic rallies, during which support levels are left well behind,&#34; Stockton explained in a Tuesday note. Ether&#39;s support level now stands around $2,038, according to Stockton.</p><p>Ether briefly dipped below that level early Wednesday morning, falling to a low of $1,919. It has since bounced higher above the key support level, and is trading at $2,375 as of publication.</p><p>&#34;We expect the pullback [in ether] to deepen in the near term, after which a consolidation phase may keep hold for a month or two within the context of the long-term uptrend,&#34; Stockton said.</p><p>As traders look to buy the dip in cryptocurrencies, keeping an eye on ether&#39;s key technical support level outlined by Stockton could prove to be a helpful guide.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a

href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/ethereum-inventor-says-he-won-t-get-shiba-inu-tax-write-off\">Bloomberg first reported</a>. The rules in his country, he said, are &#34;significantly cleaner than in the US or Canada.&#34; </p><p>The 27-year-old on May 13 donated what was, on that day, equivalent to $1 billion. Buterin intended for it to provide India with healthcare and basic-needs items.</p><p>India, currently a global hotspot for the virus, is seeing global record numbers of cases and deaths with an overwhelmed healthcare system unable to cope with shortages in medication, food, and oxygen tanks.</p><p>When news broke of Buterin&#39;s donation, Shiba Inu dropped by around 34% as investors panicked. The meme token the week prior was skyrocketing to almost 1,000%.</p><p>Shiba Inu, founded less than a year ago, took inspiration from dogecoin, a more established meme currency. It even  branded itself as a &#34;<a href=\"https://www.shibatoken.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dogecoin killer</a>.&#34; Because it&#39;s new, it&#39;s still also very volatile. At one point, the donation of Buterin fell to around $800 million and rose to about $2 billion. </p><p>Shiba Inu was last at $0.000009253 as of 9 a.m. ET Wednesday, according to <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CoinMarketCap</a>. It is the 33th largest cryptocurrency with a market valuation of over $3.2 billion. At this point. Buterin&#39;s donation is equivalent to $414 million.</p><p>Then, on May 17, Buterin announced that <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/vitalik-buterin-shiba-inu-coin-burn-dogecoin-ethereum-2021-5-1030436920\">he burned 90% of his Shiba Inu holdings</a> - almost half the coin&#39;s circulation. It was his only choice, he said, given that the creators of the meme token sent him trillions of coins without his consent.</p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t *want* to be a locus of power of that kind.

She shares how to make the</a><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-svp-outlines-steps-required-return-to-office-safely-2021-1\"> transition.</a></em></p><h2>1. Does the vaccine work in adolescents?</h2><p>Yes, recently released <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal\">data from Pfizer-BioNTech</a> shows that the COVID-19 vaccine seems to work really well in this age group. The COVID-19 vaccine was found to be <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal\">100% efficacious</a> in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in an ongoing clinical trial of children in the US aged 12 to 15. Adolescents made <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html\">high levels of antibody</a> in response to the vaccine, and their immune response was just as strong as what has been seen in older teens and young adults 16-25 years of age.</p><h2>2. How do I know whether the vaccine is safe for my child?</h2><p>So far, the COVID-19 vaccine appears to be safe and well tolerated in adolescents. All of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the US have undergone rigorous study, but we don&#39;t want to assume that children are little adults. This is why it&#39;s so important to study these vaccines just as carefully in children before health authorities could recommend use. Ongoing studies will continue to follow vaccinated children closely and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html\">robust safety monitoring</a> will help rapidly identify rare or unexpected concerns if they emerge.</p><h2>3. I thought children were low-risk - do they still need to get the vaccine?</h2><p>Currently, children represent nearly <a href=\"https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/\">25% of all new reported weekly COVID-19 cases</a> in the US. While serious illness from COVID-19 is rare in children, it does occur - thousands of children have been hospitalized and <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics\">at least 351 children</a> have died from COVID-19 in the US. Some children who get seriously ill from COVID-19 may have underlying health conditions, but not all do. Vaccination will help protect children from developing serious illness.</p><p>Additionally, since adolescents can transmit COVID-19 to others, vaccinating children may prove to be an important part of safely getting back to normal activities of life, including attending school in person, participating in team sports, and spending time with friends. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7011a1\">A large survey of school-aged children</a> showed that children in full or partial virtual school reported lower levels of physical activity, less in-person time socializing with friends, and worse mental or emotional health compared with those receiving full in-person schooling. Children are experiencing unprecedented increases in indirect adverse health and educational consequences related to the pandemic, and we need to find ways to help them get quickly and safely back to normal life. Vaccination is one of them.</p><h2>4. What side effects might I expect for my child?</h2><p>Nonsevere side effects may be experienced following vaccination. The <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download\">most commonly reported side effects</a> have been pain and swelling at the injection site. Other common side effects include tiredness and headache. Similar to young adults, some adolescents have experienced fever, chills, muscle aches, and joint pain, which may be more common after the second dose. These effects are short-lived, however, and most resolve within one to two days.</p><p>Some adolescents <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/fainting.html\">may faint</a> when receiving an injection. If this is a concern for your child, let your vaccine administration site know ahead of time - your child can be given the vaccine while they&#39;re seated or lying down to avoid injuries from falling.</p><h2>5. Have there been any severe reactions among children?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal\">No serious adverse events</a> related to vaccination were reported in the Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial. Serious allergic reactions have rarely been reported in older people. Anyone with a known severe or immediate allergy to the vaccine or any component of the vaccine should not get the vaccine. If your child has a history of any severe allergic reactions or any type of immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable therapy, let the vaccine site administrator know so that your child can be monitored for at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html?s_cid=10485:who%20should%20not%20take%20the%20covid%20vaccine:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21\">least 30 minutes after getting the vaccine</a>.</p><p>Parents should talk to a trusted health care provider or allergist if they have specific questions about the possibility of an allergic reaction in their child.</p><h2>6. When will a COVID-19 vaccine be authorized for children younger than 12 years?</h2><p>COVID-19 vaccine makers have begun or are planning to begin testing COVID-19 vaccines in younger children. As more information becomes available, the authorized age recommendations may change. Children ages two-11 years old could potentially be eligible as early as the end of this year.</p><h2>7. If I&#39;ve been vaccinated but my child hasn&#39;t, could I still give the virus to them?</h2><p>The COVID-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html\">do not contain live COVID-19 virus</a>, so they cannot cause COVID-19. Rather, getting vaccinated will help protect both you and your children from COVID-19. Studies have shown that vaccinated pregnant and lactating mothers can pass protective immunity on to their young infants <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2021.03.023\">across the placenta and in breast milk</a> - one more benefit of vaccination.</p><p>Though researchers are still learning how well the vaccine can help prevent spread, vaccination is still an important way to limit infecting people who are not yet eligible for the vaccine, like younger children.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

</p><p>Elliptic reported that affiliates of DarkSide split the funds from ransom payments with developers who worked on the actual malware. &#34;The DarkSide developer has received bitcoins worth $15.5 million (17%), with the remaining $74.7 million (83%) going to the various affiliates,&#34; Elliptic reported, with the share for developers starting out at 25% and decreasing to 5% if the ransom amounts to over $5 million. </p><p>Ransomware attacks are on the rise in the US, with Temple University data cited by the Washington Post showing a record high of almost 400 attacks in 2020. <a

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last week that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-says-fully-vaccinated-people-can-drop-masks-most-places-2021-5\">fully vaccinated people could ditch their masks</a>, many Americans - and some public-health experts - wondered whether the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-guidelines-no-masks-vaccinated-people-expert-opinion-2021-5\">recommendations were too broad</a>.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re missing a critical step, and that step is fully vaccinated people around other fully vaccinated people in large or small groups,&#34; Leana Wen, the former health commissioner of Baltimore, told Insider. &#34;That should be safe, but now we&#39;re going from &#39;you can only dine indoors with a few people&#39; to &#39;everybody can take off their masks because we&#39;re not checking their vaccination status.&#39;&#34;</p><p>The CDC&#39;s recent guidance says that fully vaccinated Americans can take off their masks indoors and outdoors at gatherings of any size - even with unvaccinated people present. The exceptions to that rule include healthcare settings, homeless shelters, public transportation, and airports. Private companies such as stores and airlines are also be free to enforce mask rules as they see fit.</p><p>But for people who want a more tailored way to gauge their personal risk, experts highlight two circumstances in which masks are still a good idea for vaccinated people. The first is if new daily cases start to rise at all in your local community. The second is a low level of vaccination in your area - one significantly below the current national average of 37%.</p><p>But even in the absence of these red flags, experts noted, the CDC is not mandating that anyone to go maskless. </p><p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t mean that you have to take your mask off,&#34; Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told Insider. &#34;It means that you <em>can</em> take your mask off.&#34;</p><p>She added: &#34;If you are still feeling vulnerable, if you&#39;re somebody who has a compromised immune system, if you are in an area when you&#39;re still higher transmission, then the conservative thing to do would be to continue to wear a mask in situations where you&#39;re going to be around people where you don&#39;t know what their vaccination status is.&#34;</p><h2>Any increase in cases could be a reason to mask up</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606309ef67187800184ad3c5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"coronavirus testing\" height=\"1105\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A nurse administers a COVID-19 test at a site in Suffolk County, New York, on December 18, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/nurse-practitioner-deborah-beauplan-administers-a-covid-19-news-photo/1296362947?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">John Paraskevas/Newsday via Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The more real-life data researchers get about the US&#39;s authorized vaccines, the more the shots seem to work <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccines-exceeding-expectations-real-world-data-2021-5\">well against variants</a> and reduce transmission. So Rimoin said the new CDC guidelines simply underscore &#34;how confident we are in these vaccines and the ability of these vaccines to really protect people.&#34;</p><p>President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-will-send-vaccine-supply-overseas-after-who-criticism-2021-5\">announced on Monday</a> that US coronavirus cases are declining in all 50 states for the first time since the pandemic started. It&#39;s another indicator that vaccines are stopping the virus from spreading. </p><p>But it also means that any increase in cases in your local area should be concerning at this point, according to Lisa Lee, an epidemiologist at Virginia Tech.</p><p>&#34;If we get an uptick, we&#39;re going to have to consider what is happening because we have a lot of people vaccinated and we should not be seeing more infections,&#34; Lee told Insider. &#34;We should continue to see less.&#34;</p><p>If cases start rising in your community, she said, that&#39;s a good reason to consider putting a mask on - especially when indoors around other people.</p><p>&#34;In a place like rural Colorado that happens to be a hotspot, people have to think carefully,&#34; Lee said. &#34;Even vaccinated folks need to really be careful and think about whether that&#39;s a risk they&#39;re willing to take.&#34;</p><h2>Is your area&#39;s vaccination rate below the national average?</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6025b58ab3c2a800183cc7c1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Disneyland vaccines\" height=\"1992\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Disneyland COVID-19 vaccination site in Anaheim, California.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mario Tama/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Around 37% of the total US population is fully vaccinated so far. Vaccinated people living in communities that are significantly below that threshold might consider keeping their masks on for now, Lee said.</p><p>&#34;When we say the United States has nearly 50% of people fully vaccinated now, that&#39;s great, but that doesn&#39;t mean anything for a particular place,&#34; Lee said, referring to the roughly 47% of US adults who are fully vaccinated. &#34;We really do need to think carefully about our own situation and our own community.&#34;</p><p>It&#39;s safer to remove your mask, for instance, in McKinley County, New Mexico, or Essex County, New York, where more than half the population is fully vaccinated, than in Warren County, Virginia, or Hancock County, Georgia, where just 3% of residents are fully vaccinated.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/602570f3b3c2a800183cc5c5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"woman face mask\" height=\"2688\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A woman adjusts her face mask.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Those who want to exercise maximum caution could wait to remove their masks until at least 75% of their community is vaccinated, Lee added. That&#39;s likely the threshold at which an area has reached herd immunity - the point beyond which the virus can&#39;t easily pass from person to person.</p><p>Reaching herd immunity would also make it far less likely that the US would suddenly see a new, more contagious or deadly variant emerge. (The virus can&#39;t mutate if it isn&#39;t spreading.)</p><p>&#34;We want to get out of this cycle of chasing the variants with vaccines,&#34; Lee said. &#34;A way we&#39;re going to get out ahead of it is by ensuring that we get 75% to 85% of the population vaccinated. So we&#39;ve got to work on that. We cannot give up.&#34;</p><p>Until then, though, the threat of new variants means there&#39;s always a chance the CDC might need to reinstate mask guidelines.</p><p>&#34;We have to watch for variants that might evade the efficacy of the vaccine,&#34; Lee said. &#34;If we see those, we&#39;re going to have to be flexible enough to agree that, OK, maybe it is time for a few weeks or months of masks again.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-decide-when-safe-to-remove-mask-cdc-2021-5'>Business Insider</a></div><div

Tuesday.</a></p><p>The mix-match study, <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04860739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">called CombiVacS</a>, is the first in the world to provide data on the immune response when the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech is given after a dose of AstraZeneca&#39;s vaccine.</p><p>Antibody levels were about 40 times higher for those who got Pfizer&#39;s vaccine two weeks after AstraZeneca&#39;s, compared with participants who got a single AstraZeneca dose, the researchers from Carlos III Health Institute <a href=\"https://www.isciii.es/Noticias/Noticias/Paginas/Noticias/Presentaci%c3%b3n-resultados-preliminares-CombivacS.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said in a presentation of preliminary results. </a></p><p>The group found that neutralizing antibodies that fight off the virus were boosted more than seven times higher after the dose of Pfizer&#39;s shot. This is higher than described elsewhere with two doses of the same vaccine, they said. </p><p>There were 673 healthy people aged 18 to 60 in the trial, which spanned five different hospitals -  441 people got a dose of AstraZeneca&#39;s vaccine followed by a dose of Pfizer&#39;s, while the control group, which didn&#39;t receive a second dose, consisted of 232 people. There was roughly a 50-50 split between the number of women and men in the study. </p><p>The study didn&#39;t directly compare the combination of vaccines with two doses of AstraZeneca&#39;s shot. It&#39;s not clear if the antibody response would be boosted to the same levels when doses were spaced out by more than two weeks.</p><p>The study hasn&#39;t been published as a research paper or scrutinized by other experts in a peer-review. </p><h2><strong>Side effects as expected</strong></h2><p>The Spanish researchers said that side effects after the combination of vaccines lasted about two to three days, and were as expected with two doses of the same shot - but they didn&#39;t directly compare them in the study.</p><p>The most common side effects were injection site discomfort, headache, tiredness, chills, mild nausea, mild cough and fever, they said. The study is not big enough to detect rare adverse events.</p><p>Another <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-vaccine-side-effects-worse-when-mixing-vaccines-study-says-2021-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mix-match study from Oxford University</a> found that combining Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines produced worse flu-like side effects than two doses of the same vaccine. The Oxford study researchers are now investigating whether spacing the doses to 12 weeks reduces the side effects.</p><p>Jesus Antonio Frias, clinical director at Carlos III, said that the study&#39;s results supported the possibility of vaccinating patients who have received the first dose from AstraZeneca. But the decision is not up to the study&#39;s investigators, he said.</p><p>Spain stopped using AstraZeneca&#39;s vaccine in Spaniards under 60 years-old in April, due to the risk of unusual blood clots. There are about 1.5 million young Spaniards, including health workers, who received one dose of AstraZeneca&#39;s vaccine, but have not gotten a second, <a

authentic.</li>\n<li>An lost sense of self can cause feelings of inadequacy and distraction in your work and personal life.</li>\n<li>Doing at least one thing for yourself daily that makes you feel loved and fulfilled can help restore balance.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>The concept of &#34;the true Self&#34; has been present in <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/psychology\">psychology</a>, <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/philosophy\">philosophy</a>, religion, and mysticism for a long <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/time\">time</a>. The current research studies also show a connection between the true Self and the experience of meaning in life, the opposite of despair. </p><h2>Authenticity leads you to your true self</h2><p>Previously, I have talked about the role of ego in <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/367568\">feeling fulfilled in life</a>. We explored that there is more than one entity to yourself: the ego and the true Self or the Source or the Spirit/Soul. It doesn&#39;t matter what you call it, but everyone has this pure essence to their being. However, you probably often only identify yourself with the ego, the part of you that is conditioned through fear. The ego keeps you safe, secure, and out of danger. And that is very important for evolutionary purposes. You need to protect yourself.</p><p>When you go up Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs, you are above and beyond danger. You have reached physical safety so you don&#39;t need the ego as you climb towards the self-actualization state. In fact, you have to drop your ego as you go up the pyramid. You have to be more and more vulnerable by dropping your guards one at a time.</p><p>As you drop these guards, you become more and more authentic and true to yourself first, then to others. This journey through authenticity is what helps you to know your true Self, which I call becoming &#34;God.&#34; Or just when you realize &#34;I am That&#34; as the Vedic expression goes. </p><h2>Your true Self is always connected with the life source that creates everything</h2><p>It is hard to describe and grasp this abstract phenomenon of your true self if you haven&#39;t practiced some sort of <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/mindfulness\">mindfulness</a> witnessing or meditation. In simple language, your true Self is your Spirit or God&#39;s essence within you but it is much more than that. Your true Self is the awareness of the Presence within you that is always and has forever connected with the <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/universe\">Universe</a>. In other words, you are God but feel separated because of the development of the ego.</p><p>As soon as you believe in the truth of the ego, you start to identify yourself with your gender, roles you play, your physical body, your five senses, your abilities, etc. You forget that you are still connected with the life force, the Universe, that creates everything. That&#39;s why it is so much easier for kids to be more creative and imaginative than adults because kids still are and feel connected with the Universe.</p><p>Feeling separated from this life force is what makes you feel inadequate and incomplete because you no longer know or believe in your own greatness. And feeling not loved keeps on adding to the void within you even if you had very loving caregivers. These feelings intensify if you didn&#39;t have loving caregivers or unfortunately experienced trauma(s) or abuse. </p><p>Following is the exercise I highly recommend to practice at least for three weeks to feel the difference: </p><h2>Show up for you</h2><p>Pick one small thing that makes you feel loved. It could be taking a walk, washing your face before bed, taking a long bath, exercise, fully enjoying a cup of coffee, reading a book, etc. Whatever it is, you have to feel loved when you are done with it. If you don&#39;t, try something else next time till you find something that makes you feel loved and fulfilled. You don&#39;t have to take away a ton of time for this exercise. Just put aside about 10 minutes every day to give yourself your unattended attention. </p><p>Do not undermine the power of this simple exercise. When you show up for yourself consistently, you are telling your fragile and afraid ego that you are worthy of this attention, that you matter, and that you are lovable. And this, my friend, is a game-changer. This is exactly what I teach to my clients each step of the way. It&#39;s through baby steps you build the relationship with yourself that helps you connect with your true Self, which is always present. All it requires to present Itself to you is your attention. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

About a decade later, the office pivoted its focus and launched smart-cities program <a href=\"https://www.sanantonio.gov/smartsa\">SmartSA</a>.</p><p>Through community partnerships, SmartSA is \"about building a future together,\" Dillard said. \"It's making sure that we're working together rather than apart, as we start to innovate and build these smart-city technologies.\"</p><p>San Antonio designated three areas as \"<a href=\"https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/27/Files/SmartSA-Overview.pdf\">innovation zones</a>,\" including downtown, a mixed-use community development in the former Brooks Air Force Base, and the medical center area.

The research also helps identify what resources are needed to execute the projects.</p><p>Some of the R&#38;D League's projects include creating an ideas portal for the city and adding sensors to solid-waste vehicles and artificial intelligence on traffic cameras.

The city expanded its existing fiber network into neighborhoods and mounted monopole antennas and small cell towers on schools and libraries to send out a signal. Students were given devices allowing them to log into their school district's network from home.</p><p>Dillard said they're still \"chipping away\" at closing the digital divide in the city, but, \"we do intend to get there.\" The plan is to roll out the program citywide.</p>\n\tA smart-streetlights pilot hopes to identify energy, sustainability, and quality-of-life issues\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a27ccef27b4c0019444d26?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Brooks 4\" height=\"1351\" width=\"1802\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A smart streetlight.\n<p class=\"copyright\">CPS Energy</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>San Antonio recently launched a six-month <a href=\"https://newsroom.cpsenergy.com/cps-energy-and-the-city-of-san-antonio-forge-smart-city-agreement-with-att-and-itron/\">Smart Streetlight Technology</a> pilot in partnership with local electric-utility company CPS Energy, AT&#38;T, and Itron.

So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats.&#34;</p><p>Biden responded: &#34;It&#39;s a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I do not praise racists. That is not true.&#34; He also cited his time working as a public defender for the cause of civil rights before becoming a senator. </p><p>After the debate ended, Biden leaned to his right and said, &#34;Well, that was some f---ing bullshit&#34;

Over the past month, bitcoin futures markets experienced their steepest and more sustained liquidation since the bitcoin ascent started last October,&#34; JPMorgan said. </p><p>Momentum traders including crypto funds that have unwound assets recently are partially responsible for this, according to the research note. A key momentum indicator has therefore turned negative from a short term perspective, which could lead to more traders selling off their assets. </p><p>In the longer term however, the momentum indicator is still positive. &#34;It is perhaps too early to characterize bitcoin as oversold,&#34; JPMorgan said, adding that bitcoin futures and related products had also been affected by the drop in value of the digital asset.</p><p>&#34;What is striking is that the recent outflows from bitcoin funds have been accompanied by inflows into gold ETFs in a reversal of the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of this year,&#34; the research note said, adding that a similar pattern can be observed with futures contracts on the two assets. </p><p>Large parts of the crypto community have hailed bitcoin as the new gold, especially young investors who see it as a more worthwhile investment compared to bullion, which has earned bitcoin the nickname &#34;millennial gold&#34;. </p><p>The ongoing shift is mostly driven by institutional investors, JPMorgan said. From an institutional perspective, flows into bitcoin began to slow down during the first three months of this year and turned negative at the beginning of the second quarter. In comparison, retail flows have stayed relatively stable throughout. </p><p>The reasons behind the shift are however unclear, although JPMorgan said bitcoin&#39;s volatility, especially the speed at which it tends to fall, was at odds with gold&#39;s greater price stability. </p><p>&#34;Or they perhaps view the current bitcoin price as too high relative to gold and thus do the opposite of what they did in the previous two quarters, i.e. they sell bitcoin and buy gold,&#34; the bank said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-bitcoin-gold-investing-crypto-cryptocurrency-2021-5'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Fhug82vXtpY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 13:53:18 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/602436c667d1e300113c5538?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"55d1c3ab5262b822bc057a2c54b3d962","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn92@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-00-792_1550e5d396cdcb35.webp","destWidth":2875,"destHeight":2156,"sourceBytes":855336,"destBytes":855336,"author":"skiderlin@businessinsider.com (Sophie Kiderlin)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6021330ecca90200129b6f10?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn12@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-01-937_860f22f063a825b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-05-974_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-07-060_99c381ddf3dcd6f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn40@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-02-398_e8dbad3dce144dd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn71@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-33-719_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Fhug82vXtpY:lWw9kMw2OC4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn55@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-02-164_9c8da026f9f30a35.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Fhug82vXtpY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn64@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-06-543_623dbaec4b410f3c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436145871},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:45","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:45","title":"I recruit nannies, personal chefs, and even palace managers for the ultra-wealthy.

As a result, there&#39;s never been more demand for highly qualified household staff. As the cofounder and director of Pembury Partners Household Consultancy (Pembury), I&#39;m the person some of the world&#39;s wealthiest have on speed dial when they&#39;re looking to hire executive staff for their private residence - or residences.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t looking to start my own business. For the last few years, I&#39;ve been at a senior level within the private household recruiting sector. When the pandemic first hit, my team and I were put on furlough, and that became the catalyst I needed. I gave Evie Dakin, a colleague and good friend of mine, a call and told her we should go it alone. It was hard to take that first step, but we haven&#39;t looked back since.</p><p>Pembury officially became operational in June 2020. Our offices are in London&#39;s Mayfair neighborhood, although I&#39;ve been working at home for the better part of the year. For the first six months it was just Evie and I doing everything from business development to accounts and marketing. At the end of last year we made our first hires, a project manager and expert in childcare recruitment. </p><h2><strong>Currently, we&#39;re working with about 100 UHWNI clients, many of whom are celebrities and athletes.</strong></h2><p>Dealing with the 1% everyday is super intense, especially because all of my clients want to have hired someone yesterday. But that&#39;s nothing different to recruiting for the luxury hotel space, where I&#39;ve also worked before. The UHNWIs (ultra-high-net-worth individuals) of the world want their home to be run like a six-star hotel, too.</p><p>At any one time, we could be looking to fill any range of roles in a number of locations. For example, we&#39;re currently recruiting for a property and assets manager in Azerbaijan, a chief of staff in London, and a palace manager in Qatar. </p><p>For many people, the past 12 months have been tough for business but for us it&#39;s been nothing short of a boon. We&#39;ve really pushed through COVID and are growing all the time. </p><h2><strong>We staff for all types of specialty positions, such as performance chefs for professional footballers. </strong></h2><p>By performance chefs, I mean people that cook the right meals for sportsmen and women, chefs that have formal education in nutritional science and who know what are the key ingredients for optimal athletic performance. It&#39;s definitely a growing trend that we&#39;re also seeing cross over into the UHNWI space - healthy living is the phrase on everyone&#39;s lips right now.</p><p>It&#39;s quite a niche market, but once one professional athlete hires a chef, they all want a chef. It&#39;s something we&#39;ve never done before but it&#39;s been hugely successful so far.</p><p>We don&#39;t employ staff on behalf of our clients, we&#39;re just an introducer and charge our clients a percentage of the candidate&#39;s first year salary as a fee. Right now, that&#39;s 25%.</p><p>In terms of salary range, nannies can expect to earn between $55,000 to $140,000 depending on experience, chefs between $70,000 and $350,000, and chief of staffs from $100,000 to $425,000.</p><p>Although some candidates register with us in response to vacancies listed on our website or on social media platforms like Linkedin, we mostly head hunt. While travel restrictions and local quarantines have been obstacles to navigate, Evie and I have the right knowledge and know the right tools to be able to track down the right pool of candidates anywhere in the world.</p><h2><strong>Most people we hire must have prior experience in private households, or on superyachts or in luxury chalets.</strong></h2><p>A stable CV is essential, as is five years of excellent references and a clean criminal record. The vetting process is extensive and to the highest standards. Once we put a candidate forward, they then connect with the principal client or their representative for a face-to-face or video interview.</p><p>After filling a vacancy, we don&#39;t follow up with performance reviews, but I did place a chef in a training camp for a World Champion Boxer who retained his title with one of his best performances, so I like to think that had something to do with it. Feedback is always welcome, although unusual. </p><p>This week I had a chef on trial with a British billionaire and the female principal client texted me after the meal to say she loved them. That was nice. Because we reference check every candidate we put forward, and they trial with the client, it&#39;s rare that anyone is ever unhappy once a placement has been made.</p><h2><strong>We may get a call at 5 p.m. on a Friday afternoon asking for someone by Monday morning. </strong></h2><p>Evie and I don&#39;t work fixed hours, as is usual in the UHNWI space. If I&#39;m working for clients on the west coast of the US, I&#39;ll adjust my hours to be on their time for as long as required.</p><p>There is one rule I abide by as much as possible, however, and that is to not work on a Saturday. I&#39;m Jewish and practicing so I keep from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday as my protected family time. For the other six days, there&#39;s no holds barred, and I&#39;ll pick up my phone 24/7.</p><p>It may sound draining but my job does allow me to work from anywhere in the world and be with my family. In August we will visit Israel for the month. I&#39;ll work early before my children wake up, and then we can spend the morning together, probably at the beach. I&#39;ll work for a couple of hours when it&#39;s really hot in the afternoon and then we can go out at night. At home back in London, I usually break up the day with time on my Peloton.</p><h2><strong>I deal with household names daily, so the expectations are high (and some egos are extremely big).</strong></h2><p>It&#39;s fascinating working with UHNWI and celebrity names, but in the end it becomes normal and it&#39;s not really something I talk too much about with my social circle. Of course, NDA&#39;s prohibit me from sharing too much detail, but, in any case, many of my friends wouldn&#39;t understand the world I live in and the inner lifestyle of UHNWIs.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a3c25ff27b4c0019445055?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Darren Lewis\" height=\"934\" width=\"1242\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A course by the private chef for Lewis&#39; at-home anniversary dinner.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Darren Lewis</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>My wife and I recently celebrated our 10-year wedding anniversary during Britain&#39;s COVID-19 lockdown.

As of May 2021, ICE confirmed that more than 14,000 people had tested positive for COVID-19 at 133 different facilities, and the Vera Institute of Justice&#39;s research demonstrates that the actual number of infections in ICE detention is far higher.</p><p>The majority of immigrants facing deportation, including <a href=\"https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/support-universal-representation-safe-network-101.pdf\">70%</a> of those in detention, lack an attorney, leaving them to navigate a complex and unjust system without legal defense.</p><p>Fortunately, Quiroz lives in one of a growing number of places where state and local governments have set up public defender-style systems to ensure that no one faces deportation without a lawyer simply because they cannot afford one. As a result, an experienced removal defense immigration attorney from the Oakland-based nonprofit Immigrant Legal Defense (ILD) provided Quiroz with legal representation. ILD also partnered with the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice on a public campaign resulting in daily phone calls to ICE and immigration authorities from Quiroz&#39;s family, community members, and immigrant rights supporters demanding Quiroz be released from detention. More than one month later, ICE released Quiroz home to his family. Since then, the immigration judge terminated Quiroz&#39;s deportation proceedings and he is no longer at risk of being deported.</p><h2><strong>Immigrants need guaranteed legal defense</strong></h2><p>We need action at all levels of government. The Biden administration can build a <a href=\"https://www.vera.org/publications/a-federal-defender-service-for-immigrants\">federally-funded, universal legal defense service</a> that provides representation to all immigrants. But state and local leadership is key and must continue to step up to protect immigrants in our communities by supporting public defender-style deportation defense systems that provide high quality legal defense to immigrants like Quiroz who cannot otherwise afford it.</p><p>Amid the pandemic, lawyers and legal service providers in deportation defense programs across the country remain on the front lines fighting every day for their clients, and it is making a difference. Immigrants who are <a href=\"https://www.vera.org/blog/immigrants-facing-deportation-do-not-have-the-right-to-a-publicly-funded-attorney-heres-how-to-change-that\">represented</a> are three and a half times more likely to be released from detention on bond and up to 10 times more likely to establish a right to remain in the United States. </p><p>Deportation defense programs are also a common-sense policy solution widely supported by the public, across political lines. <a href=\"https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/taking-the-pulse-national-polling-v2.pdf\">Polling</a> by the Vera Institute of Justice has shown that two in three people in the United States, or 67%, support government-funded attorneys for immigrants facing deportation. Although legal defense alone cannot undo the decades of systemic issues facing immigrants, it is a necessary check on the unjust system of criminalization and mass detention of immigrants that particularly targets over-policed immigrants of color.</p><p>As communities seek to invest in programs with a community-driven vision of public safety and justice, more than 40 cities, counties, and states have continued, expanded, and created new deportation defense programs. <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Harris-County-OKs-2-5M-to-help-poor-immigrants-15717330.php\">Harris County, Texas</a>, <a href=\"https://denverite.com/2021/03/24/denvers-immigrant-legal-defense-fund-got-a-big-boost-this-week/\">Denver</a>, <a href=\"https://justicecorps.org/news/prince-georges-county-pledges-half-a-million-dollars-towards-access-to-counsel-for-detained-immigrants/\">Prince George&#39;s County, Maryland</a>, and the state of <a href=\"https://www.afsc.org/resource/nj-coalition-immigrant-representation-applauds-increased-funding-to-detention-and\">New Jersey</a> have dedicated increased funding for deportation defense programs, while the states of <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/stories/illinois-lawmakers-want-to-explore-providing-legal-help-to-immigrants-facing-deportation/56d5aeba-d1ca-40d5-ae78-3358efbba0dd\">Illinois</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coloradopolitics.com/opinion/immigrants-as-well-have-a-right-to-an-attorney/article_5555de6e-9b43-11eb-9e42-5b90235572c2.html\">Colorado</a> consider similar efforts. A promising new program was recently approved in <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/california-border-county-votes-fund-legal-aid-migrants-facing-deportation-1589023\">San Diego County, California</a> that makes legal defense at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, where Quiroz was detained, a reality for more people who desperately need it.</p><p>Local and state policies that ensure due process and repair the most broken aspects of our immigration system have charted a path forward for federal action. And this critical work must continue across all levels of government. Local and state leaders, community organizations, and legal service providers can hasten progress towards a more just system by joining the movement to secure, protect, and champion counsel for people facing deportation. All of us deserve a right to due process when our life, liberty, or community ties are at stake.</p><p><em>Annie Chen is the director of the Vera Institute of Justice&#39;s SAFE Initiative, which

He&#39;s a unique character,&#34; Houston said. &#34;There&#39;s a lot of things I miss about Carl. But having said that, there were leadership issues that I believe included lying, included what I would call narcissistic behavior.&#34;</p><p>After news of Lentz/ firing broke, an Insider investigation found the church had been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/after-bieber-pastor-carl-lentz-fired-hillsong-accused-of-discrimination-2020-12?r=hillsong-teaser\">accused of exploitation and discrimination in other instances</a>. </p><p>Houston told Guthrie that there were things about Lentz that he &#34;should&#39;ve known earlier.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I think there&#39;s a lot of things I should&#39;ve known earlier, and hopefully, moving forward, we&#39;ll make sure we have far better systems in place and better accountability,&#34;

That never happened.</p><p>Republican senators, led by West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-republican-infrastructure-plan-breakdown-biden-2021-4\">introduced</a> the $568 billion proposal last month - significantly smaller than Biden&#39;s $4 trillion plan. It included funding mainly dedicated to physical infrastructure, like roads and bridges, and proposed funding the plan through potential &#34;user-fees,&#34; like a gas or road tax, instead of the corporate tax hikes the president pitched.</p><p>The meeting came and went between this group and Biden, Transportation Sec. Pete Buttigieg, and Commerce Sec. Gina Raimondo and a new plan wasn&#39;t introduced, with Capito telling reporters after the meeting that there was &#34;progress, but we still got a ways to go.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I think they&#39;re [Buttigieg and Raimondo] digesting what we proposed, and I think the plan is for them to react to that,&#34; Capito added.</p><p>Capito&#39;s office referred Insider to a readout of the meeting which said Capito felt &#34;encouraged,&#34; and the White House would follow up with the group later this week.</p><p>While a new plan wasn&#39;t brought to the table, Capito told reporters there was &#34;back and forth&#34; during the meeting on what it would take to carry out some of the measures in Biden&#39;s plan, and that while they did talk about methods to fund a plan, they didn&#39;t go too in depth on the matter because they first need to decide on what they&#39;re going to fund in the first place.</p><h2>Democrats want Biden to bypass the GOP</h2><p>Biden has repeatedly said he would like to reach a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure, and that he is willing to compromise on the scope and size of his plan. But Democratic lawmakers are concerned that the focus on bipartisanship is taking too much time away from passing urgent legislation.</p><p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/house-democrats-biden-infrastructure-legislation-bipartisan-agreeement-pramila-jayapal-2021-5\">59 House Democrats</a> sent a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urging them to bypass negotiations with Republicans and go even bigger on infrastructure investments, suggesting a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/29/biden-infrastructure-taxes-spending-plan/\">$7 trillion</a> proposal that Biden campaigned on.</p><p>&#34;While bipartisan support is welcome, the pursuit of Republican votes cannot come at the expense of limiting the scope of popular investments,&#34; the Democrats wrote.</p><p>Biden and Republicans have expressed interest in striking some sort of bipartisan agreement by Memorial Day, but as Democrats are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/john-podesta-infrastructure-plan-biden-gop-progressives-bipartisan-2021-5\">increasingly</a> urging the president to leave the GOP behind and pass legislation, the only other route is budget reconciliation, which even some Democrats are weary of.</p><p>Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, for example, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/19/biden-liberals-republicans-infrastructure-489418\">told</a> Politico that will using reconciliation to bypass Republicans would be &#34;quicker and easier,&#34; he said Democrats &#34;don&#39;t seem to have the votes for it,&#34; likely referring to moderate Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia&#39;s desire to have a bipartisan bill.</p><p>While Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the GOP&#39;s infrastructure plan could cost <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiExYvt-dXwAhUCKVkFHZSGBGsQFjAAegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fmitch-mcconnell-backtracks-on-infrastructure-red-line-price-tag-bipartisan-2021-5&usg=AOvVaw1vAxORou7985L52-ZEs_je1-5&#38;usg=AOvVaw1vAxORou7985L52-ZEs_je\">up

H. Wyman Howard III, the top SEAL officer and a former commander of SEAL Team 6, testified in Congress and highlighted Naval Special Warfare Command&#39;s strategic shift from counterterrorism operations to great-power competition against near-peer competitors, such as Russia and China.</p><h2>A sea change</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e9f41635bd7a50d41544d60?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Navy SEAL graduation\" height=\"964\" width=\"1400\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>SEAL Qualification Training Class 336 at their graduation ceremony, April 15, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Navy/MCS 1st Class Anthony W. Walker</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Following his testimony, Howard told the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/politics-osama-bin-laden-china-russia-government-and-politics-8f277ce1a284b227afcdcffabfb51ffc\" target=\"_top\">Associated Press</a> that Naval Special Warfare Command is looking to slash 30% of its SEAL platoons but increase the number of operators in each of the remaining platoons.</p><p>Now each SEAL Team will have six instead of eight platoons. It isn&#39;t clear, however, if the added troops will be SEAL operators or direct-support troops.</p><p>There are less than 3,000 active-duty SEALs right now, and a typical SEAL platoon is composed of 16 operators.</p><p>But each platoon is usually augmented by direct support personnel, such as cryptologists or Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technicians, and by other commandos, such as Air Force Pararescuemen or Combat Controllers, thus inflating the actual number of troops on target.</p><p>In his testimony, Howard revealed that there will be new courses and standards for SEAL officers and senior enlisted operators as a result of several scandals that have rocked the community.</p><p>Insider understands that all junior SEAL officers will be required to go through an ethics course. In addition to this mandatory course, Naval Special Warfare <a href=\"https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/20210428_NSWC%20Posture%20Statement_SASC-ETC-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_top\">has introduced</a> a mid-level assessment process for officers eligible for higher command.</p><p>&#34;These changes are generally good as they enhance the tactical element and give us more punch downrange. And they make sense as we&#39;re gearing for a fight against actual, competent militaries and not just a bunch of ragtag fanatics,&#34; a SEAL operator told Insider.</p><p>&#34;Against the Chinese, we won&#39;t be worrying so much about small-arms fire as about their electronic- and cyber-warfare capabilities. CT [counterterrorism] ops are still dangerous, but they don&#39;t have the same risk as an op against a Chinese harbor,&#34; the SEAL operator added.</p><h2>Different but similar</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/605bc3f90d155e0019ef69b0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Navy SEAL Afghanistan\" height=\"1331\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Navy SEAL takes a defensive position in northern Zabul province, Afghanistan, April 10, 2010.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Navy/Chief MCS Jeremy L. Wood</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Throughout the Global War on Terror, US forces have enjoyed undisputed air superiority, allowing conventional and special-operations units to operate much more freely than they would in a contested environment.</p><p>However, in a potential conflict with China or Russia, US forces might not enjoy the same advantages.</p><p>For example, understanding the conventional might of the US military, China has pursued the anti-access/anti-denial (A2/AD) concept in an attempt to negate the US Navy&#39;s capabilities in the Pacific in general but especially around Taiwan, a country that China sees as a breakaway province and wants to reabsorb.</p><p>To that end, Beijing has been building and fortifying man-made islands in the South China Sea, where many countries dispute China&#39;s expansive claims. These islands essentially act as pickets, preventing US aircraft carriers from getting within range and diminishing their usefulness.</p><p>In addition, earlier this year, US Indo-Pacific Command sounded the alarm about the shifting balance of power in its area of operations. China, the Pentagon warned, <a href=\"https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/the-chinese-military-will-outmatch-the-us-in-the-pacific-by-2025/\" target=\"_top\">will militarily outmatch</a> US forces in the Pacific by 2025.</p><p>Although this assessment didn&#39;t consider US and allied reinforcements from other areas of operations, it shows the threat level.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a46594f27b4c001944538a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Navy SEAL Special Boat Team\" height=\"1499\" width=\"1999\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>US Navy SEALs train with Special Boat Team 12 to board gas and oil platforms from a moving vessel, July 28, 2011.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Navy/PO3 Adam Henderson</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In such an environment, Naval Special Warfare has all the potential to shine. Indeed, in case of a conflict with China, they are the logical go-to choice for any special-operations missions.</p><p>&#34;Honestly, and although lots of people in the community might not like to admit it, great power competition and a conflict with a nation-state like China or Russia or even North Korea and Iran suits the [SEAL] Teams&#39; DNA better,&#34; a former SEAL officer told Insider.</p><p>Moscow has been pursuing a similar A2/AD strategy in annexed Crimea, with the Russian military making the peninsula a fortress. Operations in the Black Sea region around Crimea, like the islands and littorals of the Pacific, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/navy-seals-swcc-training-for-land-water-combat-near-russia-2021-5\" target=\"_top\">would play to the SEAL Teams&#39; strengths</a>.</p><p>&#34;CT [Counterterrorism] is cool and a great recruitment tool-who doesn&#39;t love kicking in doors and shooting bad guys in the face?-but the Teams are more than that, a lot more, actually,&#34; the former SEAL officer said.</p><p>&#34;Our forefathers, the UDT [underwater demolition team] frogmen, were established during World War II to do underwater demolitions and hydrographic recon. From the beaches of Normandy during D-Day to Iwo Jima and Okinawa, frogmen paved the way for the Marines and the Army,&#34; the former officer added. &#34;In a future conflict with a big power, we would end up doing essentially similar missions. For sure, they will be more technologically advanced, but the gist remains the same. People [in the community] need to understand that and embrace it.&#34;</p><h2>Old skills, new missions</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59e4c0b506fca06abc6c8225?format=jpeg\" alt=\"us navy seal submarine delivery vehicle SDV\" height=\"812\" width=\"1259\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two members launch a SEAL Delivery Vehicle from Los Angeles-class attack sub USS Philadelphia.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Navy photo by Chief Photographer&#39;s Mate Andrew McKaskle</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>To be sure, there is a degree of overlap between skill-sets used in counterterrorism operations and those that will be required against a near-peer threat.</p><p>For example, preparing the intelligence for and executing direct-action missions, such as raids or ambushes, will be the same despite the targets being different.</p><p>China, moreover, has the largest navy in the world, with about <a href=\"https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/us-navy-would-face-a-massive-770-ship-force-in-a-pacific-fight-with-china/\" target=\"_top\">750 vessels</a> of varying tonnage and capabilities. Naval Special Warfare&#39;s SEAL Delivery Vehicle - mini-subs that can transport SEALs close to a target without alerting the enemy - is ideal for operations to restrict those vessels&#39; movement, such as by blocking ports, or even to sink them.</p><p>But Naval Special Warfare&#39;s smallest community, the Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen (SWCCs), who specialize in direct action, reconnaissance, and ship-boarding operations, adds a lot to the equation.</p><p>&#34;Frankly, I think the SWCC community in many ways is designed for a near-peer environment conflict,&#34; a former SWCC operator told Insider. &#34;The Special Boat Teams are one of the only elite maritime special operations units in the world. Our mainstay is over-the-beach direct-action operations, coastal reconnaissance, and VBSS. These three items would be a huge element in any major great-power competition.&#34;</p><p>&#34;With the technologically advanced boats and weapons at the Boat Team&#39;s disposal, they can effectively wage war against a modern-day enemy. SWCC&#39;s concentrate on speed, stealth, and firepower. These attributes make them extremely dangerous and specialized,&#34; the former SWCC operator added.</p><p><em>Stavros Atlamazoglou is a defense journalist specializing in special operations, a Hellenic Army veteran (national service with the 575th Marine Battalion and Army HQ), and a Johns Hopkins University graduate.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-navy-seals-are-refocusing-to-fight-china-and-russia-2021-5'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_PKNPQZpZU0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 12:47:04 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60a46594f27b4c001944538a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"9bc4913b61e7982c1f862dd1c749d51c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn32@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-55-58-506_a0638dc0743ef0c3.webp","destWidth":1999,"destHeight":1499,"sourceBytes":238852,"destBytes":238852,"author":"insider@insider.com (Stavros Atlamazoglou)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60087ed06d4c620018e410cb?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn95@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-02-237_7ec93d3c2c71393c.webp","https://i.insider.com/5e9f41635bd7a50d41544d60?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-01-536_1a9fbd3928f74adf.webp","https://i.insider.com/605bc3f90d155e0019ef69b0?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn96@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-715_c65ed97aab2a8b34.webp","https://i.insider.com/60a46594f27b4c001944538a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn32@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-55-58-506_a0638dc0743ef0c3.webp","https://i.insider.com/59e4c0b506fca06abc6c8225?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-01-355_70407b2f6a8b58f5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-05-974_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn99@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-02-676_39a056e2c0142bfe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn79@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-04-837_cda2524513311649.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn71@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-33-719_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_PKNPQZpZU0:iRXVys-UIRY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn40@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-02-898_ce51578f315eb0e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_PKNPQZpZU0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn80@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-32-711_bb625144c3e6904f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436145868},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:45","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:45","title":"The 30 most popular deals our readers purchased last year on Amazon Prime Day - and what to expect this year","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-day-most-popular-products","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>If you buy through our links, we may earn money from affiliate partners. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7e0762282c500018c792ae?format=jpeg\" alt=\"30 Most Popular Prime Day Buys 2x1\" height=\"834\" width=\"1668\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon;

class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>A year into the pandemic, working from home is preferred by many employees.</li>\n<li>But working remotely can still be very monotonous. </li>\n<li>Try making simple tweaks to your routine, like setting reminders to take breaks. </li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>I&#39;ve gone through a complete remote-work evolution since I started working from home last March. </p><p>It can be tough finding ways to be efficient, without also increasing the risk of burnout. From turning my fireplace mantel into a standing desk, to doing yoga while proofreading for work, I&#39;ve tried almost everything to keep myself productive.</p><p>And these challenges might be here to stay. Over a year after the CDC announced the pandemic, effectively shutting down the US, a <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/03/survey-reveals-what-worked-about-online-work/\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard survey</a> revealed that 81% of the workforce either doesn&#39;t want to return to the office or would prefer a hybrid schedule moving forward. At least 27% hopes to continue working remotely full-time.</p><p>Remote work has many benefits - no waking up early, no morning commute, and no reason to get dressed in business attire. But it can also be a <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/323228/remote-workers-facing-high-burnout-turn-around.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\">challenge;</a> remote workers during the pandemic often struggle with the monotony of logging on from home every day. </p><p>If you&#39;re struggling with engagement at work right now, here are some ways to freshen up your work-from-home lifestyle to help you be more productive. </p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\t1. Change your notification sounds\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1c796f27b4c0019444c0f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Changing Slack notifications\" height=\"388\" width=\"720\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Changing the notification sound on Slack.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Here's a riddle for you. What do you hear a million times a day, but never really notice anymore? Your notifications.&#160;</p><p>Instead of a spoken \"Hey, can you help me with this?,\" you got an audible \"ping\" with every new alert, instilling an almost Pavlovian response to check your inbox or direct messages. After awhile, though, that knee-jerk reaction may have dulled with time as the sound started to pass right below your threshold of awareness.&#160;</p><p>To liven up your communications again, try changing your notification sound every 2-3 months. This could be the notifications on your phone, <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications#sound-and-appearance\" rel=\"noopener\">on Slack</a>, for email, etc. Whatever you need to do to press the reset button in your mind.</p>\n\t2. Switch out your computer wallpaper\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1c996f27b4c0019444c15?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Changing wallpaper on Macbook\" height=\"449\" width=\"599\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Switching out computer wallpapers.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>You're likely going to be staring at your screen all day long.</p><p>Switching out your wallpaper can be a welcome change. It could be a naturescape, a family photo, a picture of your dog.</p><p>You'll be pleasantly surprised at how something so simple can make you feel exponentially more engaged throughout the work day. When you find yourself noticing the picture less and less, it's time to change it up again.</p>\n\t3. Download applications and extensions to avoid non-work-related internet usage\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1cc0ff27b4c0019444c1b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Downloading applications onto computer\" height=\"517\" width=\"689\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Download applications and extensions when possible to avoid unnecessary internet searches.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>We've all done it &#8212; opening a tab to look something up for work and somehow finding yourself on YouTube watching Binging With Babish's latest video. To avoid these little excursions, try downloading applications and extensions when possible.&#160;</p><p>For instance, if you work primarily on social media, download the Twitter application on your laptop to reduce the likelihood that you'll get lost down the Google rabbit hole. When you're doing the same tasks every day, it can be far too easy to meander, especially when you know no one's watching.</p>\n\t4. Play around with different style settings\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1cda3f27b4c0019444c1c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Changing themes on Google Chrome\" height=\"281\" width=\"640\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Try switching up themes and style settings on your computer.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Whether you have a Mac or a PC, you'll likely have the option to customize your computer's style settings. Even if you're just switching from Light mode to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-on-dark-mode-on-windows\" rel=\"noopener\">Dark mode</a>, that small change will grab your attention every time you open your computer.</p><p>You may also be able to choose between an array of accent colors or customize settings all the way down to the font. On <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-google-chrome\">Google Chrome</a>, for example, you can <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-change-google-theme\" rel=\"noopener\">choose between a variety of themes</a>, or even create one.&#160;</p><p>Use your imagination with these style settings. It's a fun and easy way to explore and curate your professional niche at home.</p>\n\t5. Utilize organization tools\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1c28bf27b4c0019444c0b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tab groups on Chrome\" height=\"432\" width=\"576\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The group tab function in Google Chrome.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-group-tabs-in-google-chrome\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Chrome</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2020/12/05/microsoft-edge-gets-chromiums-tab-groups-feature/\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Edge</a> offer a tab group function, allowing you to combine tabs to keep related pages together in one place. The beauty of this feature is that it lets you condense what could otherwise be an overwhelming slew of seemingly random browser tabs into more digestible chunks.</p><p>This function even gives you the options of naming individual tab groups, color-coding each group, and expanding or collapsing groups to free up space in your tabs bar. In addition, Google Chrome offers an <a href=\"https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/12/good-news-you-can-now-enjoy-google.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Auto Tab Groups Creation feature</a>, which will automatically group similar tabs together.&#160;</p><p>Just as you may save specific sites or pages in your bookmarks bar, these features add an additional layer to keeping your browser visually neat and compartmentalized. If you're someone who thrives on finding new ways to organize, the tab group function may be right up your alley.</p>\n\t6. Set reminders to take breaks\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1ceadf27b4c0019444c1d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Time Out break reminder\" height=\"280\" width=\"640\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Time Out application&#39;s inspirational quotes break function.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>When you first started working from home, you may have been diligent about getting up and moving around. Maybe you took walks, or just got a quick stretch in. But as time has gone by, perhaps your activity levels have taken a nosedive.</p><p>It can be far too easy to let eight hours slide by without any substantial movement or activity, especially when you're in the comfort of your own home. Rather than rely on instinct to pull yourself away from work, try downloading an application that will actively remind you to step back, get up, and move.</p><p>For example, the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/time-out-break-reminders/id402592703?mt=12\" rel=\"noopener\">Time Out</a> application lets you customize how often you want to be reminded to take a break, and for how long you want that break to last. Once you've set up the timing of your breaks, you can choose how you want to be notified it's time to take your breather.</p><p>There are other ways of reminding yourself it's time to take a break, like investing in a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fidus-Leakproof-Motivational-Sports-Green-Gradient/dp/B08BNPC1B7/ref=sr_1_11?crid=3FPEZLP3RJQB5&#38;dchild=1&#38;keywords=water+bottle+with+time+marker&#38;qid=1621254293&#38;sprefix=water+bottle+with+time%2Caps%2C183&#38;sr=8-11\" rel=\"noopener\">time-marked water bottle.</a> The tick marks on the bottle will help you keep track of how much water you're drinking, but can also serve the dual function of indicating when you should get up and move.&#160;</p><p>Spend some time researching options to find the one that fits best.</p>\n\t7. Develop your own hybrid work schedule\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1c0131b5cea0019c453fe?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Working at a coffee shop\" height=\"1874\" width=\"2498\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The author working at a local cafe.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Rather than working from home all day, every day, try working from a new location. That could be a local coffee shop, a coworking space, or maybe even your office. For example, make a plan to spend alternating days at home and at a cafe.</p><p>But schedule your <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-zoom-guide\">Zoom</a> calls for the days you're at home. The stranger sitting at the table next to you almost certainly doesn't want to hear you explain to your coworkers the details of your company's Q1 finance report.</p><p>Adopting a hybrid schedule is especially accommodating for those who miss some of the social nuances of an office workspace. This way, you'll get your work done while also getting to see some new faces.</p>\n\t8. Come up with a snack plan\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a25dc7f27b4c0019444cb3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Making a smoothie\" height=\"1809\" width=\"2412\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The author prepares a premade frozen smoothie mix.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Just like you shouldn't go grocery shopping on an empty stomach, you also shouldn't start working from home without a snack plan. It can be far too easy when you're sitting at home to munch on some less savory or fulfilling foods. Start preparing in advance by keeping protein bars within reach, or making smoothie mixes and storing them in the freezer for easy blendability.&#160;</p><p>I've become addicted in recent months to the <a href=\"https://happymoneysaver.com/smoothie-freezer-packs/\" rel=\"noopener\">Quick and Easy Smoothie Freezer Packs</a> from Happy Money Saver. I make a bunch every weekend, pull one out when I need a quick pick-me-up, and I'm right back to work. It's a great way to get a speedy and nutritional boost, and you can customize them however you like.</p>\n\t9. Subscribe to a monthly service\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1bdddf27b4c0019444c02?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Receiving a delivery at home\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The author receiving a package at home.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Subscribing to a service that serves your professional needs can help add some excitement to your daily routine.&#160;</p><p>If you're a big coffee drinker, try a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trade-coffee-review\" rel=\"noopener\">subscription to Trade Coffee</a>, which compares your personal tastes to its over 400 varieties of coffee to deliver an assortment of brews to your door. Or, if you're someone who thrives on taking detailed written notes throughout the workday, maybe give <a href=\"https://clothandpaper.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Cloth &#38; Paper</a> a gander. Every month, you'll receive a box full of unique goodies, from notebooks, to planners, to pens.</p><p>Having something on the calendar to look forward to each month will instill a sense of structure that can be easily lacking when working remotely.</p>\n\t10. Invest in you\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1be311b5cea0019c453fd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Making a cappuccino\" height=\"1875\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The author makes a cappuccino at home.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kate Macchi/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Beyond just subscribing to a monthly delivery service, set aside some time to invest in yourself. At this point, you've more than likely nailed down a work-from-home routine, but there are always ways to zhuzh things up.</p><p>If you're still buying your latte every morning at your local Starbucks, invest in an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-espresso-machine\" rel=\"noopener\">espresso machine</a> so you can try your hand at making your own at home.</p><p>If you just want to dabble with your inner barista skills without forking out a ton of money, there are plenty of affordable options. I bought this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Espresso-Machine-Cappuccino-Frother-Carafe/dp/B08X1NGSLK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ILWMFOSBKIP5&#38;dchild=1&#38;keywords=sowtech+espresso+machine&#38;qid=1621217286&#38;sprefix=sowtech+es%2Caps%2C179&#38;sr=8-1\" rel=\"noopener\">SOWTECH machine</a> for around $60 on Amazon and it's been a great way to dip my toes without committing to a big, shiny contraption.&#160;</p><p>And if you work out before, after, or even during the workday, perhaps consider purchasing a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-fitness-tracker\" rel=\"noopener\">fitness watch</a> so you can track your progress day-to-day. I've done all my workouts at home over the past year and my fitness watch serves as a visual reminder that I'm still moving and being active by counting my steps, individual workouts, etc.</p><p>It's little things like these that make it feel less like you're trying to force your work and home life together, but rather that the two are now one and the same.</p>\n</div><div

Friedlander told Insider during a recent interview ahead of the release of &#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; on June 4.</p><p>Both shows are part of Netflix&#39;s grander content ambitions as it looks to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/list-of-netflix-upcoming-franchises-events-spectacles-tv-movies-2021-3\">build bankable franchises or &#34;spectacle&#34; programming</a> that can compete with established Hollywood IP from the likes of Disney and WarnerMedia. Netflix said <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/netflix-2021-content-spend-17-billion-1234955953/\">it would spend $17 billion on content</a> this year, up from $11.8 billion last year when the pandemic slowed production.</p><p>&#34;The thing that many studios are able to do is create great franchises,&#34; Netflix&#39;s co-CEO Reed Hastings told The Hollywood Reporter in September, when asked <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-wants-to-build-franchises-like-star-wars-harry-potter-2020-9\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"ea9eff0e8aa8649d4298668716bb88f7\">what Netflix could learn from Hollywood</a>. &#34;We&#39;re making great progress on that with &#39;Stranger Things&#39; and other properties, but compared to &#39;Harry Potter&#39; and &#39;Star Wars,&#39; we&#39;ve got a long way to go.&#34;</p><p>Friedlander is helping Netflix get there.</p><h2>How Netflix defines a spectacle or event series</h2><p>Friedlander joined the company in 2011 as its first employee dedicated to original series; a decade later, after playing an essential role in Netflix hits like &#34;House of Cards&#34; and &#34;The Haunting of Hill House,&#34; he&#39;s overseeing a new spectacle and event TV division introduced last year to help Netflix achieve its lofty goals (Kelly Luegenbiehl leads a new franchise TV team).</p><p>Friedlander described the content under his team as being in two buckets: visual-effects driven, IP driven fantasy, sci-fi, and action programming (spectacle TV) and prestige limited series like &#34;The Queen&#39;s Gambit&#34; and &#34;When They See Us&#34; (event TV).</p><p>Friedlander said that his team is responsible for scouting IP with potential to turn into shows, but they also hear pitches from creators. The team is composed of directors, managers, and associates across the original series division, and supported by other teams like business affairs, which negotiates contracts.</p><p>&#34;There is no checklist,&#34; Friedlander said of the content he looks for. &#34;It&#39;s not just me, but a number of talented, passionate superfans inside Netflix that are constantly mining IP or hearing pitches from storytellers that are so riveting they seem undeniable.&#34;</p><p>While Friedlander&#39;s shows don&#39;t technically start out as &#34;franchises,&#34; he said that the two teams - spectacle/events and franchises - will often work together. Netflix thinks about franchise shows as those that have spinoff potential, like the hit fantasy series &#34;The Witcher.&#34; Netflix is already developing a prequel series, called &#34;The Witcher: Blood Origin,&#34; and an anime movie.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;m hoping that the spectacle shows we&#39;re creating could one day become franchises,&#34; Friedlander said. &#34;The franchise team focuses on building those out.&#34;</p><p>What&#39;s most important to him in a story is whether a show is relatable, even if it&#39;s about a family of superheroes or a deer-human hybrid. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s about the ability to emphasize with a character you didn&#39;t think that you would,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;m always looking to be put in other people&#39;s shoes and look through other people&#39;s eyes.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/609edaaaf27b4c00194449de?format=jpeg\" alt=\"jupiter&#39;s legacy\" height=\"1378\" width=\"2012\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;Jupiter&#39;s Legacy.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Netflix</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Netflix is leaning into genre like never before</h2><p>Netflix had 90 TV shows in early development or production based on books, comics, manga, or video games as of March, according to the research firm Ampere Analysis. Book adaptations lead with 60, and the remaining 30 were comic, manga, and game adaptations.</p><p>Some of those adaptations are projects that Friedlander and the events/spectacle team are overseeing. Here are a few:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-adapting-the-three-body-problem-game-of-thrones-duo-2020-9\">&#34;The Three-Body Problem,&#34;</a> based on the sci-fi novel by the Chinese author Liu Cixin. </li><li>A live-action &#34;Avatar: The Last Airbender&#34; series.</li><li>Tim Burton&#39;s &#34;Wednesday,&#34; based on the Addams Family&#39;s Wednesday Addams.</li><li>&#34;Cowboy Bebop,&#34; based on the anime series of the same name.</li><li>&#34;Vikings: Valhalla,&#34; a spin-off of History Channel&#39;s &#34;Vikings.&#34;</li><li>&#34;Assassin&#39;s Creed,&#34; based on the Ubisoft video-game franchise.</li></ul><p>Millarworld, the comic-book company founded by Mark Millar, is also under Friedlander&#39;s purview. Netflix bought it in 2017 in its first acquisition to develop content based on Millar&#39;s comics. The first was &#34;Jupiter&#39;s Legacy,&#34; which spent a week at the top of Netflix&#39;s daily lists of its most popular shows in the US earlier this month.</p><p>&#34;We knew we had something special when a team of superheroes is arguing at the dining table and then going off to fight a villain,&#34; Friedlander said. </p><p>&#34;Jupiter&#39;s Legacy&#34; is only the beginning for Millarworld at Netflix.</p><p>Millar has a board in his office with the next five years mapped out, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/netflixs-mark-millar-on-jupiters-legacy-and-millarworld-plans-2021-5\">he told Insider earlier this month</a>. The plans include &#34;American Jesus,&#34; about a teenager who discovers he&#39;s the resurrected Jesus Christ, and &#34;The Magic Order,&#34; which was postponed due to the pandemic but that Millar called a &#34;top priority&#34; along with &#34;Jupiter&#39;s Legacy.&#34; </p><p>&#34;We were drawn to the breadth of Mark&#39;s creations and stories,&#34; Friedlander said. &#34;With his existing IP as well as the stories yet to be told, we knew it was a really great opportunity to have him as a partner.&#34;</p><p>Next up for Friedlander&#39;s team is &#34;Sweeth Tooth,&#34; based on the post-apocalyptic DC comic by Jeff Lemire, which he described as a &#34;fairy tale&#34; with elements of drama, adventure, and sci-fi.</p><p>&#34;It has a real sense of adventure about it, but it also has a sense of hope and wonder,&#34; Friedlander said. &#34;Gus&#39; journey is both an emotional one as well as an adventurous one. As people experience the show it&#39;ll be like peeling back layers of an onion - there&#39;s something new with each episode.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-netflixs-spectacle-tv-push-which-includes-jupiters-legacy-2021-5'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nzxlPHtC9X0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 13:26:46 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60a3f9aff27b4c0019445192?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"6a7a186538ef507be9edb4fd1aef9060","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-00-523_183c9445e63d705e.webp","destWidth":934,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":53730,"destBytes":53730,"author":"tclark@insider.com (Travis Clark)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60a3d3631b5cea0019c4576c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn16@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-04-102_c769ad3da775234f.webp","https://i.insider.com/609edaaaf27b4c00194449de?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn41@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-05-790_b2ff9f86284cb1e3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-05-974_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn48@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-01-707_8a428df3376af184.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn75@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-02-207_4a1647a928ba944e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn71@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-33-719_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=nzxlPHtC9X0:qGTAYmKQQGY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn20@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-01-385_6706965fe3701faa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/nzxlPHtC9X0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-06-417_9b0655cc329ceb09.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436145880},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:45","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:45","title":"Arizona recount auditors have found the files of voting data Trump claimed were destroyed as part of a plot to deprive him of victory","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-recount-auditors-find-files-trump-claimed-destroyed-2021-5","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a4f63ff27b4c001944540f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"trump vote count arizona\" height=\"750\" width=\"1500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A composite image of former President Donald Trump and a photo of the Arizona ballot recount.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Arizona election auditors said Tuesday they&#39;d found files that were initially thought to be missing.</li>\n<li>Trump had seized on claims of missing voter data to push his election fraud &#34;Big Lie.&#34;

(small)</bi-shortcode><p>The iPad Pro has always been Apple&#39;s most powerful tablet, but the company is taking that approach to the next level with its latest model. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">new iPad Pro</a>, which launches in the second half of May and starts at $800 for the 11-inch model, runs on Apple&#39;s M1 chip, the same powerful processor found inside the latest MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.</p><p>Compared to last year&#39;s version, the 11-inch iPad Pro I&#39;ve been testing also comes with optional 5G connectivity, a better webcam with Apple&#39;s new Center Stage feature, Thunderbolt support, and choices for more storage capacity. </p><p>All told, the addition of the M1 chip along with these improvements makes the iPad faster, longer-lasting, and more useful as a work device than before. Yet it still has limitations that prevent it from truly replacing your laptop, so it&#39;s better-suited for creatives rather than those with more traditional workflows. </p><p>Still, for creative professionals, the M1 chip is likely to open up a whole new set of possibilities. But as is the case with Apple&#39;s older iPad Pros, you&#39;ll have to pay a pretty penny to get the most out of it.</p><h2>Apple iPad Pro 11-inch (2021) Specifications</h2><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 251px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Apple iPad Pro</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Specifications</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 20px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 20px;\">Display</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 20px;\">11 inches, 2,388 x 1,668 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Processor</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Apple M1 with 8-core central processing unit, 8-core graphics processing unit</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Main Camera</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">12-megapixel wide, 10-megapixel ultra-wide</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Front Camera</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">12-megapixels with Center Stage</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Connectivity</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Wi-Fi 6, optional 5G, Bluetooth 5.0</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Ports</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">USB 4/Thunderbolt, Apple Smart Connector</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Battery Life</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Estimated up to 10 hours</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Storage</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">RAM</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">8GB or 16GB</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Authentication</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Face ID</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Colors</td><td style=\"width: 50%; height: 21px;\">Silver or Space Gray</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Display and design</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a3f7fb1b5cea0019c45852?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple’s 2021 iPad Pro has the new M1 chip\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Apple&#39;s 2021 iPad Pro with M1 (11-inch) has a similar design as its predecessor\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">11-inch iPad Pro</a> comes with a vibrant screen that packs 264 pixels per inch, just like the iPad Air, 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and previous-generation iPad Pro. Apple&#39;s new mini-LED display, which should enable better contrast, is only available on the latest larger-sized iPad Pro. </p><p>The biggest differences between the screens on the 11-inch iPad Pro and iPad Air is that the Pro&#39;s display is slightly larger, brighter, and includes Apple&#39;s ProMotion technology. This boosts the refresh rate up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling and faster responsiveness. </p><p>But it isn&#39;t noticeable enough to play a big role in your buying decision. Scrolling seems a bit faster, but using the second-generation Apple Pencil to sketch and color on the iPad Air generally feels as smooth as it does on the new iPad Pro. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">new iPad Pro</a> also has the same slim design as its predecessor. That&#39;s to say it has a sleek metal build with flat edges, making it extremely compact and portable. But unlike the colorful iPad Air, the iPad Pro only comes in silver and space gray.</p><h2>Performance</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a3f8471b5cea0019c45853?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple’s 2021 iPad Pro has the new M1 chip and works with Apple Pencil\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Apple&#39;s 2021 iPad Pro with M1 (11-inch) with the newest Apple Pencil\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a>&#39;s M1 chip is impressively fast when it comes to processing video and photo edits. That&#39;s important for a device like this, which Apple has been pitching towards photographers, video editors, artists, designers, architects, and really anyone who works with 3D renderings.</p><p>In one test, the M1-equipped iPad Pro exported a 10-minute 4K video to 1080p using Adobe Premiere Rush in nearly half the amount of time it took for the iPad Air to accomplish the same task. It also beat last year&#39;s 12.9-inch iPad Pro by about 20 seconds. Exporting the same video on a Dell XPS 13 running on an 11th-generation Intel Core i7 chip took nearly 20 minutes.</p><p>The new iPad Pro was also a hair faster at exporting a 4.7MB photo using Adobe Lightroom, as shown in the results below.</p><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 85px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 43px;\"><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 43px;\"> </td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 43px;\"><strong>Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, 2021)</strong></td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 43px;\"><strong>Apple iPad Air (2020)</strong></td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 43px;\"><strong>Apple iPad Pro (12.9-inch 2020)</strong></td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 43px;\"><strong>Dell XPS 13</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\"><strong>Video Export</strong></td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\">3 minutes, 25 seconds</td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\">3 minutes, 45 seconds</td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\">5 minutes, 55 seconds</td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\">19 minutes, 58 seconds</td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\"><strong>Photo Export</strong></td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\">1.4 seconds</td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\">2 seconds</td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\">1.8 seconds</td><td style=\"width: 20%; height: 21px;\">3.2 seconds</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The jump in speed compared to Apple&#39;s older iPads is certainly notable. But it&#39;s really the way app developers put the M1 chip&#39;s power to use in their apps that will make the iPad Pro stand out. For example, the music composition app StaffPad is updating its app with a feature only available on M1 devices that automatically detects notes as you&#39;re playing an instrument.</p><p>It&#39;s features like this that showcase Apple&#39;s intentions for the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a> as a computing device. Although I&#39;ve always appreciated the iPad Pro for its speed, battery life, and compact design, I&#39;ve never really understood Apple&#39;s vision for it as a new type of computer. That seems poised to change now that the M1 chip has made its way to the iPad Pro, as apps like StaffPad are proving.</p><h2>Productivity</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a3f9791b5cea0019c45857?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple’s 2021 iPad Pro has the company’s M1 chip\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Apple&#39;s 2021 iPad Pro with M1 (11-inch) with the Magic Keyboard\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>But don&#39;t get the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">iPad Pro</a> if you&#39;re really looking for a traditional laptop experience. Computers that run on a desktop operating system like macOS or Windows are still much easier to navigate for juggling multiple workflows. </p><p>I&#39;m able to get most of my work done (including writing this review) on the iPad Pro by displaying Google Docs and Slack in Split View and keeping my email handy in Slide Over. </p><p>However, the minute I need to dig into another app or open a different Google Doc, I find myself missing my laptop. And if you really want to use the iPad to get work done, you&#39;ll have to purchase accessories since Apple doesn&#39;t include a keyboard or Apple Pencil in the box. That means the iPad Pro can get expensive pretty quickly, considering the newest <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMU8F2AM%2FA%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Apple Pencil</a> costs $129 and the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJQL3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-129%25E2%2580%2591inch-5th-generation-us-english-white\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Magic Keyboard</a> starts at $299.</p><p>That being said, Apple has addressed one of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a>&#39;s biggest shortcomings compared to a traditional computer. Both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch models now support Thunderbolt, making it possible to connect the iPad to more peripherals, like high-resolution displays, USB-C hubs, and directly to dedicated cameras.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a3f9d51b5cea0019c45858?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple’s 2021 iPad Pro has the new M1 chip\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Apple&#39;s 2021 iPad Pro with M1 (11-inch) has a new camera feature called Center Stage\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Cameras have traditionally been overlooked in tablets, but that&#39;s not the case with the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a>. Like its predecessor, Apple&#39;s latest pro-tablet has a LiDAR sensor for measuring depth, a 12-megapixel wide camera, and a 10-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera, which could be useful for those who want to quickly shoot and edit photos and videos on the same device.</p><p>But it&#39;s the front-facing camera that&#39;s gotten a big improvement this time around. Not only does the new iPad Pro have a 12-megapixel front camera instead of a 7-megapixel camera, but it also has a new feature called Center Stage. </p><p>As the name implies, Center Stage keeps you in frame as you move during video calls, and it works in Apple&#39;s FaceTime app as well as other video conference apps. </p><p>Center Stage just works on the new <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a>, so you don&#39;t have to toggle any settings to enable it. During FaceTime calls, the camera automatically zooms in slowly to frame my face more evenly and follows me as I slide over to the left and right. It even pans out when someone else enters the scene to get them in the shot.</p><p>Some other devices like Amazon&#39;s newest Echo Show 10 and Logitech&#39;s QuickCam webcam use motors to track subjects and keep them in frame, but having it built right into the iPad makes it feel more useful and ubiquitous. </p><p>This is an example of a feature that really makes the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a> stand out in Apple&#39;s tablet lineup. It also shows how Apple can leverage the M1&#39;s power to add capabilities that weren&#39;t possible before. I only wish it came sooner, as I could imagine it being really useful for the group video calls I made to friends and family over the holidays in 2020. Hopefully this feature comes to M1 Macs at some point, too.</p><p>Otherwise, the 12-megapixel front camera on the new iPad Pro has also gotten a boost in overall quality. Take a look at the photos below, and you&#39;ll notice the iPad Pro&#39;s image looks slightly brighter and more colorful than the photo taken on the iPad Air, which has a 7-megapixel front camera.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a3fa0d1b5cea0019c4585a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A selfie taken on the new 2021 iPad Pro\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A selfie taken on the new 2021 iPad Pro.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a3fa44f27b4c001944519b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"A selfie taken on the 2020 iPad Air\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A selfie taken on the 2020 iPad Air\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Battery life</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a3fb321b5cea0019c45861?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple’s 2021 iPad Pro has the new M1 chip\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Apple&#39;s 2021 iPad Pro with M1 (11-inch) has a vibrant screen\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Apple estimates that the new <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">iPad Pro</a> should have the same battery life as the previous-generation iPad Pro and newest <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-air\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Air</a>. Battery life is generally similar between all three tablets based on my testing, but the new 11-inch iPad Pro lasted the longest. When I played a 1080p video on YouTube with the screen set at its maximum brightness, the new 11-inch iPad Pro lasted for almost six hours. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-air\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Air</a>, meanwhile, died after a little more than five hours, while the older 12.9-inch iPad Pro died at the five hour mark. Remember, however, that battery life will vary depending on how you use your iPad. It&#39;s also possible that the 11-inch iPad Pro lasted longer because it&#39;s brand new, whereas the iPad Air and iPad Pro have been used previously for other tests and reviews.</p><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 64px;\" border=\"1\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 43px;\"><td style=\"width: 25%; height: 43px;\"> </td><td style=\"width: 25%; height: 43px;\"><strong>Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, 2021)</strong></td><td style=\"width: 25%; height: 43px;\"><strong>Apple iPad Air (2020)</strong></td><td style=\"width: 25%; height: 43px;\"><strong>Apple iPad Pro (12.9-inch 2020)</strong></td></tr><tr style=\"height: 21px;\"><td style=\"width: 25%; height: 21px;\"><strong>Battery Life</strong></td><td style=\"width: 25%; height: 21px;\">5 hours, 54 minutes</td><td style=\"width: 25%; height: 21px;\">5 hours, 17 minutes</td><td style=\"width: 25%; height: 21px;\">5 hours</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Should you buy it?</h2><p>Yes, but only if you&#39;re looking for a tablet for editing multimedia projects and making video calls. The iPad Air can handle most of the same tasks for a cheaper price, but creatives who really want a super portable work device are likely to benefit most from the iPad Pro&#39;s M1 processor, Thunderbolt support, and advanced cameras.</p><h2>What are your alternatives?</h2><p>If you&#39;re looking to spend around $1,000 for a work device and have a more traditional workflow that involves doing a lot of research in a web browser, managing spreadsheets, and writing papers, the MacBook Air is a better choice. It still offers the long battery life and fast performance that comes with the M1 chip, but runs on Apple&#39;s desktop software that&#39;s better for multitasking.</p><p>Those who want a really nice iPad for light productivity, playing games, and watching movies should opt for the iPad Air, which has a similar design, plenty of power since it runs on the same chip as the iPhone 12, and is also compatible with the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMU8F2AM%2FA%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Apple Pencil</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJQL3LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-129%25E2%2580%2591inch-5th-generation-us-english-white\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Magic Keyboard</a>.</p><p>If you really want a tablet for traditional workflows and aren&#39;t partial to Apple, there&#39;s always Microsoft&#39;s Surface Pro 7. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8N17J0M5ZZQS%2F08ZHhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fsurface-pro-7%2F8N17J0M5ZZQS%2F08ZH\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Surface Pro 7</a> has a similarly compact and ultra-portable design, but runs on Windows instead of a mobile-first operating system. </p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>The new <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">iPad Pro</a> is fast, long-lasting, and has an impressive camera that keeps you in frame.

During a fundraiser in New York City, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-democrats-joe-bidens-record-before-debates-2019-6\">he spoke about his career as a senator</a> and referenced legislating alongside pro-segregationist lawmakers.</p><p>&#34;Well guess what? At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn&#39;t agree on much of anything. We got things done,&#34; Biden had said.</p><p>Harris had been readying an attack on Biden over his comments, and her team had compiled opposition research to hit him hard on racial issues, according to Dovere. Once the topic was brought up on stage, Harris&#39; aides advised her to go for the jugular. </p><p>&#34;I do not believe you are a racist, and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground,&#34; she told Biden on stage. &#34;But I also believe, and it&#39;s personal - it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.&#34;</p><p>&#34;And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,&#34; Harris continued. &#34;And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.&#34;</p><p>Biden sought to defend himself and said Harris&#39; comments were a mischaracterization. When the debate cut to commercial, Dovere reported that Biden offered his candid reaction of the scene to Buttigieg, whom he then hardly knew.

typical day. </li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>It all began with a Google search in 2017. </p><p>Trisha Goyal was in Connecticut looking for a place to play tennis, and quickly realized her task wasn&#39;t so simple. </p><p>Most of her options were either too expensive or not flexible enough to fit with her schedule. In 2019, she co-created <a href=\"https://breakthelove.com\">Break the Love</a>, a digital platform that allows people to book tennis lessons, enter tournaments, and meet other players. </p><p>Tennis has a stigma attached to it: It&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-features/exclusive-judy-murray-urges-tennis-to-shed-its-elitist-tag-and-open-its-doors-to-the-masses/\">exclusive</a> and <a href=\"https://tennispredict.com/why-is-tennis-so-expensive/\">expensive</a>, said Goyal, who&#39;s now 28, lives in New York City, and has been playing the sport since she was eight years old. That&#39;s why she wanted to build inclusivity into the company&#39;s ethos.</p><p>Break the Love started by partnering with nonprofits around New York City but has now entered into revenue partnerships with the United States Tennis Association and Wilson Sporting Goods. Spread across 10 cities in places such as New York and California, Break the Love hosts its own classes, is creating its own tennis tournaments, and has 5,000 active users. </p><p>The company saw record growth amid the pandemic as people sought to go outside during times of isolation and there are 20,000 on the waitlist for the locations in which Break the Love has yet to launch. Declining to share exact revenue, Goyal says the company won the Adidas&#39; Reimagine Sports Grant through the iFundWomen&#39;s grant program and was accepted into the Adidas-backed incubator program <a href=\"https://www.leadsports.com/\">leAD</a>. </p><p>To Insider, Goyal breaks down what a typical day looks like, from taking partnership calls all morning, to tennis classes late in the evening. </p><h2>She wakes up at 7:30 a.m. </h2><p>After making a cup of coffee and walking her dog for 20 minutes, Goyal opens Instagram to post the scheduled morning marketing for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/breakthelove/?hl=en\">Break the Love,</a> highlighting upcoming classes and other events. </p><p>Around 8 a.m. Goyal takes a shower, grabs another cup of coffee, and begins going through her emails. &#34;I usually scan through all of my emails and list down which emails are the highest priority that I need to respond to in the morning versus the afternoon,&#34; she said.</p><h2>Her first-morning meeting is around 9 a.m. </h2><p>Goyal stops checking emails around 9 a.m. and begins meetings. There are only about four full-time employees at the company, and her first meeting is usually with her engineering team, as Break the Love is both an app and website. They spend an hour testing new features.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1b118f27b4c0019444bed?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Break the love Trisha Goyal\" height=\"3992\" width=\"2994\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Goyal and her team have been making flyers for Break the Love to market the company.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Break the Love</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Break the Love already offers classes for beginners and advanced players, and charges users a fee to attend classes and tournaments. Classes start as low as $39. The platform also trains athletes who, afterward, can serve as instructors for the classes.</p><p>Goyal says Break the Love builds all the tools it needs in-house, and it&#39;s something to which they must pay close attention. There is a big difference, for example, between launching a new tennis product in New York versus Florida, Goyal says, and the team must know how to have a product be effective in both markets. </p><p>In New York, for example, the problem is typically where to find courts and where people can learn about tennis without spending too much money (private lessons can cost an average of $125 an hour, she said.) In places like Florida, however, it mainly comes down to finding people to play with, and places to learn the sport that are comfortable and inclusive for everybody. </p><p>On this day, the company released a map view so people can pinpoint the exact location of tennis courts before deciding to join a class or enter into a tournament. &#34;After we feel good about what we are about to push out, we spend the second half of our hour doing discovery around new features,&#34; Goyal added. The team then spent thirty minutes mapping out features that could better predict weather patterns. </p><h2>After morning meetings, she connects with investors </h2><p>Goyal spends about thirty minutes reviewing scheduled programs for the week, then goes back to her inbox and starts answering emails from investors. </p><p>She gets another cup of coffee, and around 11:30 a.m., she takes a quick break to get fresh air and lunch. While eating, she starts working on a creative partnership deck as well as more proposals. &#34;For us, partnerships are a big part of how we grow our number of courts we have access to,&#34; she said, citing, for example, how the company works with various Parks and Recreation Departments throughout the nation. </p><p>Aside from partnering with both public and private tennis courts, Break the Love provides tennis rentals for beginners.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1b109f27b4c0019444bea?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Break the love Trisha Goyal\" height=\"519\" width=\"790\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Break the Love / Gabby Perez</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Around  2 p.m. she has more calls</h2><p>Goyal grabs another cup of coffee then hops on another call. On this day, she spoke to Wilson Sporting Goods to plan a new series launching this summer called &#34;Access Courts,&#34; which seeks to help get more people into tennis. </p><p>Since she&#39;s often on back-to-back phone calls, Goyal likes to schedule &#34;walking calls&#34; outdoors. Afterward, she squeezes in calls with some customers to receive feedback on programs. Gen Zers and millennials are outspoken in what they like and don&#39;t like these days, she said, predicting more will start demanding inclusive and convenient tennis access. The goal is for her company to be at the forefront of that push, the same way <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cami-tellez-cofounder-wants-to-build-a-billion-dollar-brand-2020-10\">Parade</a> makes inclusive underwear or FENTY Beauty makes inclusive skin foundations. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1b2adf27b4c0019444bf5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Break the love Trisha Goyal\" height=\"755\" width=\"1007\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Goyal on her way to a practice.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Break the Love</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>&#34;What you see on pro-circuit tennis doesn&#39;t trickle down fully to the club system which is where tennis predominantly lives and is predominantly run by the same kind of people that can make the sport feel intimidating,&#34; she said. &#34;Just like golf.&#34; </p><p>After the calls, she looks at ways to modify existing program formats based on the customer feedback. </p><h2>Around 6 p.m. she tries out her classes </h2><p>She spends time sending personalized welcome emails, then changes into her tennis clothes to join one of Break the Love&#39;s tennis classes.  &#34;This is one of my favorite parts of my day because really our product is the on-court experience so it is always really rewarding to experience it myself,&#34; she said. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60a1b119f27b4c0019444bee?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Break the love Trisha Goyal\" height=\"2676\" width=\"4014\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Break the Love / Jenna Fernandez</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>At around 8:30 p.m., she finally makes it back home </h2><p>Goyal showers and makes dinner. She tries not to check her emails but, instead finds herself designing new marketing material. Before bed, she walks her dog again. Around 10:30 p.m., she falls asleep, so she can wake up tomorrow and do it all over again.  </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

be paid in cryptocurrencies have turned an uncomfortable spotlight on digital tokens and their use in crime.</p><p>One analyst said the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline was facilitated by cryptocurrencies, which &#34;will not go unnoticed by the US government and other countries.&#34;</p><p>Hackers severely <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/colonial-largest-us-fuel-pipeline-operator-shuts-down-operations-after-cyberattack-2021-5\">disrupted the US energy network</a> earlier in May when they attacked the crucial Colonial Pipeline&#39;s computing systems. To get the system back up and running, Colonial paid a ransom of nearly $5 million in cryptocurrency, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom\">Bloomberg reported</a>, citing people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Days later, hackers targeted Ireland&#39;s health service and also demanded a ransom <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/bitcoin-ransom-will-not-be-paid-following-cyber-attack-on-hse-computer-systems-1.4564957\">be paid in bitcoin</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/btc-usd\">Bitcoin</a> has crashed in recent days after Elon Musk said Tesla would no longer accept the token as payment, due to its &#34;insane&#34; and environmentally damaging energy use. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrencies-china-crypto-crackdown-price-outlook-2021-5-1030445035\">Cryptocurrencies slid again</a> on Tuesday after Chinese regulators cracked down on the use of digital assets for payments.</p><p>But Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda, said the so-called ransomware attacks had been an underappreciated factor.</p><p>&#34;With Elon Musk grabbing all the headlines on his bitcoin/dogecoin pivot, the real issue is the $5 million ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;Attacks on critical US infrastructure facilitated by cryptocurrencies will not go unnoticed by the US government and other countries. I would argue that the regulatory threat to cryptocurrencies has increased exponentially.&#34;</p><p>Critics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have long argued that they facilitate crime thanks to their anonymous and decentralized nature, which means they are very hard to trace and link to individuals.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrency-should-be-curtailed-terrorism-concerns-yellen-2021-1\">said in January</a> that she was concerned about cryptocurrencies for this reason. &#34;I think many are used - at least in a transaction sense - mainly for illicit financing,&#34; she told lawmakers during her confirmation hearing.</p><p>Gary Gensler, the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission markets regulator, has made similar criticisms in the past.</p><p>&#34;Beyond use on the darknet, there are those around the globe who seek to use these new technologies to thwart government oversight of money laundering, tax evasion, terrorism financing, or evading sanctions regimes,&#34; he <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/meeting/house/108562/witnesses/HHRG-115-AG00-Wstate-GenslerG-20180718.pdf\">told Congress</a> in 2018.</p><p>Although cryptocurrency companies that deal with customers in the US are covered by various financial regulations, the digital asset markets is largely a grey area outside the traditional world of finance. Regulators have consistently warned that investors should only buy in if they&#39;re <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-dogecoin-risks-lose-money-bank-of-england-andrew-bailey-1030396958\">willing to lose all their money</a>.</p><p>In the US, regulators are keeping a close eye on cryptocurrencies but have not yet committed to any major rule changes during the latest digital asset boom.</p><p>Fox Business reported in April that Gensler is <a href=\"https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6249208738001#sp=show-clips\">waiting for the Treasury</a> to review the currency cryptocurrency rules before the SEC lays out its approach. Fox said Gensler is likely to step up enforcement action.</p><p>Regulators are likely to increase their focus on crypto as ransomware attacks become more prevalent, said Rahul Bhushan, co-founder of Rize ETF, which runs a cybersecurity fund.</p><p>Yet Bhushan said a stronger &#34;regulatory framework around cryptocurrencies… will help legitimize that market.&#34;</p><p>Michael Shaulov, chief executive of crypto firm Fireblocks, said: &#34;The true solution is a capability for law enforcement agencies around the world to distribute real-time information about illicit activities allowing wallet and custody providers to block these funds in transit.&#34;</p><p>Colonial Pipeline has been contacted for comment.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/ransomware-cryber-attack-bitcoin-btc-cryptocurrency-regulation-sec-2021-5'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_ayqwaT0ewI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 11:20:10 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60a4ed6ff27b4c0019445405?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"01cfd1ddf9682e81ba77f21a80e4ad12","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn78@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-00-675_d139d2ad664035fc.webp","destWidth":3999,"destHeight":3000,"sourceBytes":184664,"destBytes":184664,"author":"hrobertson@businessinsider.com (Harry Robertson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60a4ed73e25d05001880c655?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn96@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-04-287_dfb993b692965d45.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-05-974_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn56@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-01-464_b3d7e23d801b3810.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn71@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-05-951_d25a8e8b5dabcf68.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn71@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-33-719_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_ayqwaT0ewI:kQwEzect--8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn23@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-31-480_332f65d1b3d4f672.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_ayqwaT0ewI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn100@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-05-422_b60552647ced3543.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436145891},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:45","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:45","title":"Odds of a melt-up in the stock market are rising as institutional investors raise $297 billion in cash, Fundstrat's Tom Lee says","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-melt-up-potential-institutions-raise-billions-cash-2021-5","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f45216742f43f001ddfed58?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Lee\" height=\"2691\" width=\"5383\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Cindy Ord/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li><strong>The odds of a stock market melt-up are rising as institutional investors raise $297 billion in cash, Fundstrat&#39;s Tom Lee said in a Monday note.</strong></li><li><strong>&#34;Institutional investors have been steady sellers of risk assets even as equities managed to post gains,&#34;

in the stock market are rising as institutional investors raise near record levels of cash, <a href=\"https://fsinsight.com/\">Fundstrat&#39;s</a> Tom Lee said in a note on Tuesday.</p><p>Since the start of 2021, money market balances of institutional investors have surged by $297 billion to more than $3 trillion, nearly matching the peak levels seen during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in May of 2020. </p><p>The near-record cash raise by professional investors comes even as the stock market managed to move higher so far this year, with the S&#38;P 500 up 11%, and as data continues to show improving momentum for the US economy.</p><p>&#34;Institutional investors have been steady sellers of risk assets even as equities managed to post gains,&#34; Lee said.</p><p>While professional investors have been raising cash, the money market balances of retail investors has fallen by $76 billion in 2021 to about $1.5 trillion, according to the note. Assuming that $76 billion in retail money flowed into the stock market, it has been more than offset by the cash raise of institutions.</p><p>To Lee, the current dynamic is a sign of capitulation among institutional investors, which could potentially lead to a &#34;melt-up&#34; in the stock market as they look to deploy the cash raised back into the stock market.</p><p>The cash raised by institutions coincides with survey data from the National Association of Active Investment Managers that showed positioning in the S&#38;P 500 is the most cautious since April 2020.</p><p>&#34;Anytime investors are this cautious, it is a strong &#39;contrarian&#39; buy signal. Thus, we see high odds of a market melt-up,&#34; Lee said.</p><p>Lee recommended investors take advantage of this dislocation by buying cyclical stocks poised to benefit from a full reopening of the US economy, including stocks in the energy, materials, and financials sectors, according to the note. Lee is cautious on technology stocks and said investors should use any strength to reduce exposure to the sector. </p><figure>\n\t<img
