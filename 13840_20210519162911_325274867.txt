I'll show the first version of a video on Patreon and often the feedback I get results in a video going through further revisions to improve it.  e.g. Fix audio issues, clarify points, add extra footage or cut extraneous things out. The video that goes live on youtube is the final version.","publishedDate":"Sat, 15 May 2021 09:36:30 +0000","feedId":13840,"bgimg":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/b2PkLPOuNN8/hqdefault.jpg","linkMd5":"90fcedfc6d455bf9389dc03a27fa864e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn74@2020_2/2021/05/19/16-29-10-801_6a1266fc8cdcab54.webp","destWidth":480,"destHeight":360,"sourceBytes":30351,"destBytes":21830,"author":"Techmoan","publishedOrCreatedDate":1621441720580}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-20 00:28:40","updatedTime":"2021-05-20 00:28:40","feedId":13840,"fetchDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 16:28:40 +0000","fetchMs":23,"handleMs":10,"totalMs":30804,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":15,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"79b59b7ab14b8d981e3d8a220e20848a","hostName":"us-51*","requestId":"f082671b064a4a67809c9a0883fa3d6e_13840","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx12":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:38:57","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:59:00","id":13840,"name":"Techmoan","url":"https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC5I2hjZYiW9gZPVkvzM8_Cw","subscriber":224,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.youtube.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn24@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-58-59-808_338d4b3529898bf7.ico","description":"","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1621441720546,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":24,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":10,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":30768,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/b2PkLPOuNN8/hqdefault.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":480,"destHeight":360,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn74@2020_2/2021/05/19/16-29-10-801_6a1266fc8cdcab54.webp","sourceBytes":30351,"destBytes":21830,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":13840,"totalSpendMs":544,"convertSpendMs":8,"createdTime":"2021-05-20 00:29:10","host":"europe64*","referer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2PkLPOuNN8","linkMd5ListStr":"90fcedfc6d455bf9389dc03a27fa864e","githubUser":"myreaderx12","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"29.6 KB","destSize":"21.3 KB","compressRate":"71.9%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx12":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
