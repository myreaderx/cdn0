It’s not for lack of hype, of course. Years of prelude punctuated by Samsung’s own breathless expectations provided plenty of build-up, but in the end, the device felt like a partially baked disappointment.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A number of early units broke for a variety of reasons. Samsung recalled the foldable, went back to the drawing board and released it on a delayed timeline. I ran into issues with my second sample pretty quickly. At the end of the day, the device just demanded a level of gingerliness most users can’t really afford with a day-to-day mobile device.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xrPStPEVPN\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/my-galaxy-fold-display-is-damaged-after-a-day/\">My Galaxy Fold display is damaged after a day</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;My Galaxy Fold display is damaged after a day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/my-galaxy-fold-display-is-damaged-after-a-day/embed/#?secret=xrPStPEVPN\" data-secret=\"xrPStPEVPN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Galaxy Fold Z 2, which was the centerpiece of today’s Unpacked annex event, is largely devoted to addressing the biggest complaints about the original. Given the issues with the original, that’s about as admirable a goal as any. We were all aware that the Galaxy Fold was going to be a learning process for Samsung — and certainly there’s a certain degree of throwing caution to the wind — but relative to the company’s other device, it just didn’t feel finished.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038031\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038031\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2038031\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-3.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038031\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We certainly didn’t feel comfortable advising people to purchase the device for $2,000. The Fold Z 2 is priced the same (which is to say still prohibitively expensive for most), but it could be the product the first gen should have been. I’m going to wait until we’ve had sufficient review time to say anything definitive about the device, but in Samsung’s defense, the company does seem to have addressed most of the major issues with the original — thanks in no small part to some advances introduced with Flip last year.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ca1zBuQRMX\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/living-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip/\">Living with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Living with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/living-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip/embed/#?secret=ca1zBuQRMX\" data-secret=\"ca1zBuQRMX\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The biggest update here is the addition of what the company calls “Ultra Thin Glass” to the primary foldable 7.6-inch display. That was one of the largest pain points of the original — as cool as the technology is, it’s not worth a lot if the touchscreen can’t withstand touches. The technology here is more or less the same as what Samsung introduced with the Flip.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038072\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038072\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2038072\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"767\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=2048,1534 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038072\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The same goes for the new “sweeper” technology, which builds in a brush to wick away particles that might otherwise fall into the phone. This was another issue with the original — crap was getting behind the screen, causing damage when pressure was applied to the front by the user. This is the third-generation of the feature, according to Samsung, sporting a thinner brush than the original. Per the company:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">To achieve this, Samsung developed new innovative sweeper technology to achieve the same level of protection in a smaller space. The Galaxy Z Fold2 Hideaway Hinge features revolutionary slim cutting technology, modified fiber composition and adjusted fiber density.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s a fancy way of saying they made thinner bristles. The hinge has also been improved to allow the device to stand at a variety of angles. That’s going to be an important point as the company looks to compete directly with the likes of Microsoft’s Surface Duo and any other dual-screen devices coming down the road. That’s augmented by Flex Mode (another Flip addition), which reconfigures the screen to make the best use of the partially open display.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038026\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038026\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2038026\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-7.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038026\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other big update here is the addition of a much larger front-facing screen. At 6.2 inches, the front of the device is actually a serviceable display for use while the device is closed. Last time around, the front-facing screen had a weirdly long aspect ratio and wasn’t really great for anything but notifications. The company seemingly took something away from Huawei’s first dip into the foldable category.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new Fold has 5G support, of course — that’s now standard across the company’s flagships, along with some mid-tier devices. That’s coupled with a beefy 4,500 mAh of battery life (split in two, each behind a display), 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. There’s only one memory/storage option for the device for the States, which will run $2,000.</p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2038073,2038072,2038071,2038070,2038069,2038066,2038065,2038064,2038063,2038052,2038051,2038050,2038034,2038036,2038041,2038042,2038039,2038037,2038053,2038054,2038055,2038057\"]</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That entitles the buyer to the Galaxy Z Premier service, which includes on-demand support for the phone and a one-time replacement after accidental screen damage. There’s also a bunch of other perks thrown in, like Founders Card membership and access to golfing, or dinner at a Michelin-star restaurant. I would have preferred a pair of Galaxy Buds, to be honest, but Samsung’s really pushing the luxury angle here.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is up for pre-order September 2, and starts shipping on the 18th.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 14:00:04 +0000","feedId":11805,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-3.gif","linkMd5":"2277aa900de416058136e0e989315fda","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-27-23-177_0ebe2d2420b1eefd.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":73357696,"destBytes":1797122,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-3.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-27-23-177_0ebe2d2420b1eefd.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Product-image-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn94@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-27-26-567_ca920ffb051a00d0.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF-7.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn21@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-28-45-717_54803c50f8f9b238.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn71@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-27-24-914_e7fecbd1573fd4ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=IcOdGMtUBHI:WZS9ufmCNT4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn6@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-27-24-941_bc1f64732078fe24.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn54@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-27-24-894_8bd070eb6d7b3a6e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599294421386},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:27:01","title":"OrCam Technologies co-founder Amnon Shashua to speak at Sight Tech Global","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2039140","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">If the measure of progress in technology is that devices should become ever smaller and more capable, then <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/orcam-technologies\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"orcam-technologies\">OrCam Technologies <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is on a roll.

Intel acquired Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017, the single-largest acquisition of an Israeli company ever. This year, Shashua received the <a href=\"https://www.dandavidprize.org/laureates/2020/future-artificial-intelligence/prof-amnon-shashua\">Dan David Prize (Future Category)</a> for his work in artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Shashua started OrCam at the prompting of his aunt, who was losing her sight and hoped that her technologist nephew could apply his prodigious talents as a scientist and AI expert to help. With that goal in mind, he started OrCam in 2010 with co-founder <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/mr-ziv-aviram\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"mr-ziv-aviram\">Ziv Aviram <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>.

At $3900 per device in the U.S., the OrCam MyEye is far from affordable for most people, but the firm says the device price will come down as production increases.</p>\n<p>At the start of a new era for assistive technology, OrCam’s approach with the lightweight, offline-operating OrCam MyEye is nothing if not thought provoking (the device was recognized as a <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2019/5733047/orcam-myeye-2/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2019/5733047/orcam-myeye-2/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1599117470022000&#38;usg=AFQjCNHi749dV-HgyJFKrZkdtKATJbFUEg\">TIME Best Invention of 2019</a>). Will miniaturization of sophisticated sensors and electronics lead to unobtrusive sensor arrays as the foundation of assistive tech? Will the AI-based natural-language processing lead to an all-purpose, customizable personal assistants that work with abilities as needed?</p>\n<p>“In OrCam’s roadmap,” says Shashua, “the ultimate AT must have the right balance between computer vision and natural language processing. For example, the “smart reading” feature recently launched harnesses NLP (natural language processing) in order to guide the device to which text information to extract and communicate to the user. NLP allows the user to specify precisely what he/she needs to know. For example, the “orientation” feature recently launched allows the user to prompt the device to describe the objects in the scene and to provide audible guidance to those objects. We see the “orientation” feature growing with respect to vocabulary, with respect to search (e.g., “notify me when you see a Toilet sign”), and with respect to obstacle avoidance (where is the free-space in the scene). The technological challenge in bringing these desires into reality critically depends on the progress of compute and algorithms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By &#8216;compute,'&#8221; says Shashua,  &#8220;I mean the ever-growing trend to miniaturize processing power enables more sophisticated algorithms to reside on smaller and battery-powered footprint. By “algorithms” I mean the ever-increasing sophistication of deep-tech to mimic human intelligence. Combining the two creates a powerful impact on the future of assistive tech for people who are blind and visually impaired.”</p>\n<p>Shashua received a B.Sc in mathematics and computer science from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Tel-Aviv University\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel-Aviv_University\">Tel-Aviv University</a> in 1985 and his M.Sc in computer science in 1989 from the <a title=\"Weizmann Institute of Science\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weizmann_Institute_of_Science\">Weizmann Institute of Science. </a><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"></sup>He received a Ph.D in brain and cognitive sciences in 1993 from the <a title=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT), while working at the <a title=\"Artificial intelligence\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\">Artificial Intelligence</a> Laboratory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sighttechglobal.com/\">Sight Tech Global</a> is a virtual event on December 2-3 and attendance is free. <a href=\"https://sighttechglobal.com/conference-registration/\">Pre-registration is open now. </a></p>\n<p>Sight Tech Global <a href=\"https://sighttechglobal.com/sponsorship-opportunities/\">welcomes sponsors</a>.

She told me she soon saw an opportunity in the growth of live video shopping, particularly in China, with potential clients starting to ask whether Bambuser had any products for this. It didn&#8217;t at the time, but it quickly shifted focus and launched its first live video shopping products last fall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn’t plan for the pandemic to hit the world,&#8221; Ghahremani said. &#8220;We started this because we believe that this is going to be the future of retail.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the same time, she suggested that the pandemic — and the resulting shutdowns and struggles of brick-and-mortar retail — have accelerated the transition, giving Bambuser&#8217;s business a big boost. The company&#8217;s offering has been used by brands including H&#38;M, Motivi, Moda Operandi, Frame, LUISAVIAROMA and Showfields, and it says that in Q2, net sales were up 669% year-over-year.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038503\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038503\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2038503\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Bambuser CEO Maryan Ghahremani\" width=\"680\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/maryam_0639.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bambuser CEO Maryam Ghahremani (Image Credits: Bambuser)</p></div></p>\n<p>While e-commerce and social media platforms are expanding their support in this area, Ghahremani said brands are turning to Bambuser because they want to offer a live shopping experience while still owning the brand experience, the customer data and the transaction itself.</p>\n<p>She also emphasized that Bambuser is focused on being a business-to-business product, rather than a consumer shopping platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are trying to create not another Instagram or Facebook or marketplace, because we believe other [companies] are already doing that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not even interested in going into that battle.

And as Palatskova noted, you can also collaborate on a story in real-time with other writers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of writer productivity, I would say there is almost no difference between creating interactive fiction on our engine and just writing fiction,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2038207\" style=\"width: 393px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2038207\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical size-large wp-image-2038207\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?w=383\" alt=\"Dorian Gunmen Scene\" width=\"383\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Gunmen-Scene.jpg?resize=28,50 28w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2038207\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dorian</p></div></p>\n<p>From what I could see, the resulting games look similar to what you&#8217;d find on platforms like<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/pocket-gems-launches-episode/\"> Pocket Gems&#8217; Episode</a>, where there aren&#8217;t a lot of technical bells and whistles, so the story, dialogue and character choices move to the forefront.</p>\n<p>When I brought up the open-source game creation software <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twine_(software)\">Twine</a>, Palatskova said Twine is &#8220;just a tool.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to be more like Roblox, both the tools and the distribution,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>In other words, writers use Dorian to create interactive stories, but they also publish those stories using the Dorian app. (The writer still owns the resulting intellectual property.) Palatskova noted that Dorian also provides detailed analytics on how readers are responding, which is helpful not just for creating stories, but also for monetizing via premium story choices.</p>\n<p>In fact, Dorian says that in early tests involving around 50,000 players, writers were able to improve monetization by 70% after only one or two iterations.

This actually represents the third generation of the tech. The first didn’t exist outside of the lab and the second was shown off to the public but never made it into production.</p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/o0vS_Ri9Hec?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are no doubt all sorts of practical reasons for that. Among them seems to be the issue of pixel density. For reasons that ought to be pretty obvious, there’s a big question of how to maintain a consistent pixel density in the area of the screen that sits on top of the front-facing camera. Xiaomi claims to have solved the problem, however.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The self-developed pixel arrangement used in Xiaomi’s 3rd Generation Under-Display Camera Technology allows the screen to pass light through the gap area of ​​sub-pixels, allowing each single pixel to retain a complete RGB subpixel layout without sacrificing pixel density,” it <a href=\"https://blog.mi.com/en/2020/08/28/xiaomi-unveils-3rd-generation-under-display-camera-technology\">writes in a blog post</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2037542\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WX20200828-131552.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"795\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WX20200828-131552.png 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WX20200828-131552.png?resize=117,150 117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WX20200828-131552.png?resize=234,300 234w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WX20200828-131552.png?resize=530,680 530w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WX20200828-131552.png?resize=39,50 39w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Xiaomi says it’s been able to effectively double the pixel density of competing technology, letting light through to the camera, without sacrificing the uniformity of the screen. It looks good in the side-by-side videos the company has released, but obviously it’s worth reserving judgement until mass production starts next year.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=rwufOoPkAS8:TgIRgMuBlhg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=rwufOoPkAS8:TgIRgMuBlhg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=rwufOoPkAS8:TgIRgMuBlhg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=rwufOoPkAS8:TgIRgMuBlhg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=rwufOoPkAS8:TgIRgMuBlhg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 15:00:43 +0000","feedId":11805,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WX20200828-131552.png","linkMd5":"4f569f4d31d070db978febab41bcef01","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn70@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-27-01-544_65c47dcfd073fe56.webp","destWidth":620,"destHeight":795,"sourceBytes":599753,"destBytes":42552,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WX20200828-131552.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn70@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-27-01-544_65c47dcfd073fe56.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=rwufOoPkAS8:TgIRgMuBlhg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn70@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-27-24-904_33e6aceac3f7d2ff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=rwufOoPkAS8:TgIRgMuBlhg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-27-25-090_1b6d2ee25af0c9ce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn54@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-27-24-894_8bd070eb6d7b3a6e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599294421386},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:27:01","title":"Samsung is holding another Unpacked event next week for the Galaxy Z Fold 2","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2037112","description":"<p class=\"p1\">One of the nice things about virtual events is you can essentially hold as many as you’d like.

On August 6, President Trump <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/\">signed an executive order</a> that gave TikTok&#8217;s Beijing-based parent company ByteDance 45 days to make a deal to divest the U.S. operations of its popular video-sharing app. The deadline was later <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369753/bytedance-tiktok-trump-china-app-privacy-90-days\">extended</a> until mid-November.</p>\n<p>The order arrived at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, which are battling across a number of fronts outside of tech. Relations have deteriorated over issues like China&#8217;s move to assert more authority over Hong Kong with its new national security law, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/us/politics/sanctions-china-xinjiang-uighurs.html\">the detention</a> of one million or more ethnic Uighur Muslims in China&#8217;s Xinjiang region, trade tariffs, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/china-criticizes-us-sanctions-south-china-sea-buildup-72645788\">Beijing’s military buildup</a> in the disputed South China Sea and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Tech companies were pulled into this conflict between the two superpowers. Ahead of the proposed TikTok ban, the U.S. government also had<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech/u-s-tightening-restrictions-on-huawei-access-to-technology-chips-idUSKCN25D1CC\"> tightened its restrictions</a> on China&#8217;s Huawei Technologies in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>After Trump&#8217;s signing of the executive order, TikTok <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-responds\">immediately</a> fought back, most recently in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-sues-the-u-s-government-over-its-forthcoming-ban/\">the form of a lawsuit against</a> the U.S. government that challenged the legality of the TikTok ban. In the interim, several U.S. tech companies&#8217; names emerged as having had discussions with TikTok about a deal, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/daily-crunch-microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-inches-closer-to-reality/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-tiktok-have-held-preliminary-talks-about-possible-combination-11596925449\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-weighs-acquisition-of-rival-to-video-app-tiktok-11570213344\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/if-oracle-buys-tiktok-ill-go-to-dannys-house-and-eat-his-annoying-stanford-sweatshirt/\">Oracle</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-likely-to-announce-sale-us-operations-in-the-coming-days.html\">Walmart</a>. Oracle on Thursday morning <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/oracle-nears-20-billion-tiktok-deal-with-white-house-support-exclusive/\">was said to be nearing a deal with the White House</a> that would comprise $10 billion of cash, $10 billion in Oracle stock and 50% of annual TikTok profit to flow back to ByteDance.</p>\n<p>The actual risk presented by the TikTok app has remained in dispute. Trump&#8217;s executive order declared the social app, and other apps owned by Chinese companies that have entered the U.S., a threat to &#8220;the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.&#8221; The concern is that the app could collect data on U.S. citizens, including location, browsing and search histories. Critics believe TikTok could serve as a conduit for the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s propaganda and censorship arm, as well.</p>\n<p>The TikTok app itself has become hugely popular in the U.S in recent years. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg even declared TikTok&#8217;s existence one of the reasons why Facebook shouldn&#8217;t be considered a monopoly, in his testimony before<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/tech-antitrust-hearing/\"> the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in July</a>.</p>\n<p>According to data from app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower, TikTok has been download nearly 194 million times in the U.S., which is 8.2% of TikTok&#8217;s total downloads, including its Chinese version, Douyin. The U.S. also accounted for nearly $111 million, or 13%, of TikTok&#8217;s total ~$840 million in revenue.</p>\n<p>Mobile data and analytics firm App Annie said TikTok had 52 million weekly active users in the U.S. during the week of August 9-15, 2020, and this number continues to climb. Its weekly active user count in July (July 15-25) was up 75% from just the beginning of 2020, in fact. It also became the top grossing app on the iOS App Store globally in the second quarter, due to increased consumer usage of mobile apps during the pandemic.

So we&#8217;re proud of that as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The most important part is it&#8217;s really also a signal towards the industry that it&#8217;s possible to do upgrades with your phone and not have to come out with a totally new phone every year,&#8221; he adds.</p>\n<p>Finding clever ways to extend device longevity is a core plank of Fairphone&#8217;s mission. The biggest resource sinkhole associated with smartphone consumption is the annual or biennial upgrade cycle which encourages consumers to swap perfectly functional phones for a shiny new model. Fairphone 3 owners can get its latest kit with a cleaner conscience.</p>\n<p>Fairphone is selling the Fairphone 3+ camera modules separately for current Fairphone 3 users &#8212; at an initial cost of €70 until the end of September (rising to ~€95 from October).</p>\n<p>It is also selling a Fairphone 3+ handset for an RRP of €469, aimed at new to the brand users &#8212; opening up pre-sales from today on its website and via partner retailers, with a release date of September 14 across Europe.</p>\n<p>Specs wise, the 4G Fairphone 3+ has a 5.7in Full-HD display with an 18:9 aspect ratio and is powered by a<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset. Out of the box it runs Android 10. On board there&#8217;s 4GB of RAM and 64GB of ROM, expandable via</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> microSD. The removable battery is 3,000mAh. There&#8217;s also Bluetooth 5.0, NFC and a fingerprint scanner.  </span></p>\n<p>van Abel confirms the business will continue to sell last year&#8217;s flagship &#8212; but at a reduced price of around €400.</p>\n<p>The 3+ modules are only backwards compatible one generation of Fairphone which means anyone still using a Fairphone 2 can&#8217;t get this plug and play upgrade. The blocker there is the core module, per van Abel, who says not being able to swap the SOC out for an upgraded chipset remains the biggest challenge for modular upgrades that are able to span more than one smartphone generation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our vision is definitely there that you can also eventually replace the core module&#8230; where the modem and the processor is,&#8221; he says, hazarding that it might be possible &#8220;within a couple of years&#8221;.</p>\n<p>However the wider issue is the component industry still moves so fast it remains way out of step with Fairphone&#8217;s goal of longevity. The social enterprise pledges to provide up to five years of support for each device it sells, meaning it needs relevant spare parts to still be available in order that it can offer replacements or else stockpile them itself &#8212; a capital intensive process. And one that&#8217;s at sharp odds with the blistering upgrade trajectory of processor manufacturers.</p>\n<p>From a sustainability and resource perspective, the best option is also for a smartphone user to keep using the same chipset for as long as possible. The maturity of the smartphone market and commoditization of the tech &#8212; leading to the more iterative device refreshes we generally see now &#8212; also tacitly supports that.</p>\n<p>van Abel can point to consumers holding onto a handset for an average of about double the time they did when Fairphone got started. It&#8217;s a drift that&#8217;s providing uplift to environmentally sensitive brand focused on innovating to produce smartphones with a longer lifespan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve done a lifecycle assessment on the Fairphone 3 and what comes out of that we&#8217;ve also tested what parts of the phone have what kind of footprint and you also see that almost 80% of the CO2 footprint of the phone is within the making and the production of the SOC,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So that means that if you really want to look at it from a sustainability perspective it really makes sense to keep that part of the phone just as long as possible. Because most of the harm on nature is on that part. So even replacing that part &#8212; being able to swap that part &#8212; it&#8217;s great but it&#8217;s kind of a shame that we throw away a lot of stuff and modules and components in the phone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Recycling in the phone business at the moment is plain stupid,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;How it&#8217;s done is you collect the phones and they put them in an oven &#8212; they burn them. And then they get the minerals out&#8230; You can still reuse the minerals but there&#8217;s nothing smart about that. Nothing really has been reused so all the capacitors, the glass of the screen&#8230; So it does make sense at a certain point to being also able to swap the processor like you were able to do with the computers in the old days.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/08/fairphone-3-is-a-normal-smartphone-with-ethical-shine/\">reviewed the Fairphone 3</a> last year we were impressed by how normal the Android device felt &#8212; belying its modular, deconstructable interior and all the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/04/meet-the-tiny-phone-company-thats-making-modularity-sustainable/\">years of effort</a> Fairphone has ploughed into scrutinising and reworking supply chains to be able to stand up its bold claim of a phone that &#8220;dares to be fair&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Now, with the launch of the Fairphone 3+ modules, last year&#8217;s handset is getting a boost to its camera hardware &#8212; with a 48MP main lens and a 16MP front-facing lens offered as replacements to last year&#8217;s 12MP and 8MP units via the new modules (the main and front modules can be purchased separately or as an upgrade bundle).</p>\n<p>On the surface that looks like a huge step up in hardware but it&#8217;s down to the camera module using the Samsung GM1 sensor &#8212; which uses tiny pixels of 0.8-micro to deliver light sensitivity equal to 1.6-micro pixels.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s actually a software technique to eke more out of the hardware, with a trade off in that it entails some compression of picture quality. A Fairphone spokeswoman confirmed the main lens&#8217; &#8220;effective output&#8221; is still 12MP. &#8220;This is common practice in the industry with phones such as the Samsung S5KGM1, Samsung Galaxy A90 5G, Nokia 7.2 and the Sony IMX363,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>As we noted in our review of the Fairphone 3 last September, the 2019 flagship took a fairly standard snap &#8212; with photo quality closer to acceptable, than stand out. The performance gap vs the premium end of the smartphone market was noticeable, even as Fairphone had substantially bested performance vs its earlier handsets.</p>\n<p>The company looks keen to further shrink the photo quality gap. Now it touts &#8220;significantly&#8221; improved photo and video quality via the 3+ upgrade &#8212; which it says supports &#8220;sharper selfies and clearer video calls&#8221;.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also done work to optimize the software, noting support for enhanced object tracking, faster autofocus and image stabilization &#8220;for more reliable shots&#8221;, as well as &#8220;louder, crisper sound&#8221; on the audio front, per its press release.</p>\n<p>A focus on boosting photo and video performance makes sense given how central the camera has become for smartphone users &#8212; feeding into the rise of trendy social video sharing apps like TikTok.</p>\n<p>Successfully convincing consumers to hold onto their existing handset for longer means paying attention to such app trends to make sure hardware and software are keeping up with how people are using their phones.</p>\n<p>For buyers of the Fairphone 3+ handset there&#8217;s another improvement: It boasts 40% recycled plastics &#8212; up from just 9% in last year&#8217;s model. Fairphone says the volume of recycled plastics is now equivalent to a 33cl plastic drinking bottle &#8212; so that&#8217;s one piece of plastic waste prevented from ending up in the sea (for now).</p>\n<p>While some might wonder if there&#8217;s a subtle contradiction in a sustainable smartphone brand launching a new model only a year after unboxing last year&#8217;s flagship, van Abel says expanding the portfolio in important &#8212; as part of the overall mission to grow demand for ethical smartphones.</p>\n<p>That demand is in turn needed to build momentum for the kind of industry-wide shift required for a wholesale upgrade to a circular economy. And the potential of offering <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/can-fairphone-3-scale-ethical-consumer-electronics/\">devices as a services</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to sell as many phones as possible &#8212; because our mission is to show that there is a demand for ethical phones,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;So the more phones we sell the more we can show that the demand is really there. But that also makes a problem in terms of longevity so we have another KPI where we say we want people to use our phone as long as possible &#8212; so we measure how long people actually use our phones and that&#8217;s improving every year as well. So a sales person at Fairphone they get a very hard kind of assignment because they have to sell as many phones as possible but they can&#8217;t approach people that already have them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re challenging ourselves to disconnect the business model from these resources as much as possible but because we take that challenge in the core of our business I think we&#8217;re also ahead of where the industry needs to move towards,&#8221; he adds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nobody can neglect the fact that we&#8217;re running out of resources and it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to get these resources. Look at cobalt, for example. Lithium ion batteries. There&#8217;s a run on cobalt. It&#8217;s gone like 10x, 20x the price it used to be &#8212; because we have this energy transition that we need all kinds of batteries for. So even sustainability needs these resources that you can&#8217;t get purely from recycling. So we know that this has to change. Even for geopolitical reasons I think that what we&#8217;re doing forces us to be ahead of the game.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Demand for Fairphones has been building steadily over the past decade and the social enterprise is now &#8220;almost&#8221; at profitability, per van Abel. &#8220;We&#8217;ve sold over 200k phones &#8212; of which 60k were Fairphone 1s. We&#8217;ve sold over 100k Fairphone 2s. And last year we sold almost 50k Fairphone 3s and this year we&#8217;re aiming for over 100k Fairphone 3+,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never had a portfolio. Now we actually have a portfolio of two phones, Fairphone 3 and 3+, because we&#8217;re going to sell the 3 as well at a lower price with the older modules &#8212; the previous modules &#8212; and the 3+ with the new modules. So that we also have a price point for people that don&#8217;t need the newest camera improvements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fairphone remains very much a European project &#8212; one that&#8217;s perfectly positioned to benefit from a pan-EU push towards sustainability and a circular economy in the coming years. (A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/european-lawmakers-propose-a-right-to-repair-for-mobiles-and-laptops/\">&#8216;right to repair&#8217; Commission proposal</a> for mobiles certainly looks helpful.)</p>\n<p>For now, the biggest market for Fairphones is still Germany, per van Abel. While he says its focus for sales of the new portfolio is to push for more growth in Germany, with France, Holland and the UK its other main markets of continued focus. &#8220;We&#8217;re aiming more also at Scandinavia,&#8221; he adds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The danger of a commoditizing industry is where you get a lot of easy, cheap access to all these technologies and you see it moving towards two sides: The high end and the really low end stuff. But I hope that customers will also value the companies themselves, and the brands and what they stand for. Whereas [iPhone maker] Apple stands for design; they have a premium to it &#8212; you buy something more than just the phone. And I think Fairphone has that as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a compelling story. Especially you see the group of conscious consuming growing within every report I read. You see it growing steadily each year. So people do take more notice of what they actually buy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Funding wise, the social enterprise is comfortably positioned with the debt, equity and growth financing it raised a few years back from impact investors. Though van Abel moots the possibility of taking in more funding to put towards marketing and help it keep scaling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But at the moment we&#8217;re good,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;The impact investors are very patient. It goes with the mission of the company. I think people really are part of Fairphone &#8212; participate in this company because they believe not only in the cash return but also in the impact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also notes that Fairphone is also doing separate financing for some related initiatives in the supply chain which are required to underpin its claim of fair and ethical electronics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A good example of that is the fair cobalt alliance that we&#8217;ve just set up,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re really proud of that. We have set up a great consortium with mining companies, with refineries, with big companies like <a href=\"https://www.signify.com/global/sustainability/sustainable-supply-chain\">Signify</a>, that are part of that supply chain of cobalt. It&#8217;s partly funded, as well, by the Dutch government. So we have more of a broker position &#8212; and that is the nice thing about being a social enterprise. You sometimes can be in between the non-profit and the for-profit sector. You can bridge easily those two worlds.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=TKR9HgwWCjQ:GN7iCarc_w4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=TKR9HgwWCjQ:GN7iCarc_w4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=TKR9HgwWCjQ:GN7iCarc_w4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=TKR9HgwWCjQ:GN7iCarc_w4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?a=TKR9HgwWCjQ:GN7iCarc_w4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 09:00:36 +0000","feedId":11805,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=TKR9HgwWCjQ:GN7iCarc_w4:V_sGLiPBpWU","linkMd5":"5909b4d8152f179307feebfd2f2300b9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn76@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-27-01-476_823fb96a6a84c8b7.webp","destWidth":66,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1009,"destBytes":340,"author":"Natasha Lomas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=TKR9HgwWCjQ:GN7iCarc_w4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn76@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-27-01-476_823fb96a6a84c8b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?i=TKR9HgwWCjQ:GN7iCarc_w4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-27-25-171_997bc6afb5aba67c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Mobilecrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn54@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-27-24-894_8bd070eb6d7b3a6e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599294421388},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:27:01","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:27:01","title":"Samsung’s got a new budget 5G handset and a fitness tracker with a two-week battery","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2039317","description":"<p class=\"p1\">Yesterday’s overflow Galaxy Unpacked event was about one thing and one thing alone: the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/samsungs-new-galaxy-fold-arrives-september-18-for-2000/\">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a>. Honestly, it was a bit anticlimactic after its predecessor found Samsung unveiling five new devices. But the singular focus wasn’t for lack of new stuff to show off. In fact, the company just unleashed <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-marks-a-new-era-of-innovation-with-virtual-experience-life-unstoppable\">a whole slew of new products</a> across a wide range of categories, including a gaming monitor, charging pad, refrigerator and washing machine.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are two in particular I’d like to break out here, however: the new Galaxy Fit 2 band and A42 5G handset. The latter in particular is worth highlighting, given the company’s huge push into 5G this year. Samsung is betting big on pushing early and hard on the next-generation wireless tech.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Early this year, the company announced that it would be standardizing 5G across its flagship products. The company has also made a major push toward embracing the tech on its budget devices, including the A7 and now the A42. 5G hasn’t quite turned out to be the market correction the industry was banking on, due in no small part to a slowdown in sales from the pandemic. Certainly few banked on that. But while <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has yet to announce a 5G iPhone (give it a month or two, mind), Samsung’s already loaded up.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">And importantly, the A42 looks like it may be Samsung’s cheapest 5G offering (though we’re still waiting on exact pricing). Honestly, Samsung wasn’t particularly chatty about the device during an IFA-tied event. Though we do know there’s a quad-camera system and a 6.6-inch display.

The company says users will be able to more easily find videos to watch within the app due to improved discovery features and deeper integrations. In addition to its Content Guide, 20 top-level topics will now offer video-only feeds alongside articles, including travel, politics, local, lifestyle, sports, news and more. The videos will also be more prominent in users&#8217; &#8220;For You&#8221; feeds, which is a mix of editorial and algorithmic curation.</p>\n<p>Users will be able to add video-only feeds to their own magazines, too, if they prefer.</p>\n<p>These videos, for the first time, will play natively within Flipboard. This helps to power Flipboard&#8217;s recommendation engine that directs you to related videos, the company says. This change also means users will be able to use additional video controls, like those that let them skip to the next video, for example.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2037060\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2037060\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2037060\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlipboardTV-1200X750-mobile-explore.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlipboardTV-1200X750-mobile-explore.png 1201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlipboardTV-1200X750-mobile-explore.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlipboardTV-1200X750-mobile-explore.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlipboardTV-1200X750-mobile-explore.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlipboardTV-1200X750-mobile-explore.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FlipboardTV-1200X750-mobile-explore.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2037060\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flipboard</p></div></p>\n<p>The new video effort additionally ties into Flipboard&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/flipboard-expands-into-local-news/\">recent expansions into local news</a> that began at the start of 2020. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/flipboard-storyboards/\">As of this June,</a> Flipboard&#8217;s local news coverage reached 50 cities across the U.S. and Canada. Today that number is 61. Now, Flipboard users will be able to follow their favorite local news outlets&#8217; video content, as well, directly in Flipboard.</p>\n<p>This presents what&#8217;s often a much cleaner experience than visiting the news publishers&#8217; own app or website. Flipboard, meanwhile, offers an undisclosed revenue-share with its news partners, derived from the advertising that runs in their videos.</p>\n<p>These ads play both as pre-rolls and mid-rolls, Flipboard says. This is the first time it&#8217;s run pre-roll ads on its platform &#8212; something that the company believes will help to address demand from publishers for high-quality, brand-safe digital video experiences on mobile.</p>\n<p>At launch, Flipboard is selling the ad inventory for the videos.
