Designed as an attachment/accessory to the watch, these bad boys strap around your head using your goggles (giving them a universal fit), and allow you to dock your Apple Watch right into them. They come with a pair of Bluetooth earphones too, that aside from preventing water from going into your ear, allow you to listen to music, podcasts, ebooks, motivational speeches, or feedback from your coach.</p><p>The Interval Swim Earphones come with an endorsement from avid-user and Olympic legend Michael Phelps too. They&#8217;re 100% waterproof, engineered to sound great underwater (with an increased bass response), and come with physical controls for adjusting the volume as well as for play/pausing your audio tracks. A variety of earhole tips allow you to get the most secure fit, so the earphones stay in place with a watertight fit while you&#8217;re swimming&#8230; and a companion MySwim app for the Apple Watch lets you log your laps and swimming progress too!</p><p>Designer: <a\nhref=\"https://h2oaudio.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">H2O

Take for example Apple&#8217;s latest 27-inch iMac &#8211; designated to be the biggest change Apple ever made in the iMac&#8217;s configuration under the hood. Now while I imagine buying me that sleek design, I&#8217;m wondering if the Kolude&#8217;s Keyboard that doubles as a hub will be the perfect accessory, or shall I look for something new? With Apple all set to launch the new ARM-based machines in the market, let&#8217;s start looking and picking the accessory of our choice to deck out the latest config they plan to hit us with.

The watch’s screen roughly matches the screen size found in classic iPod Nanos, while its body is only a slight bit thicker. The Pod Case, made in silicone, slides right over the Apple Watch body, giving it a funky throwback, while also letting you use the watch as-is.</p><p><img\nsrc=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/571/695/b342e2fd7a5bc5ac20af0c36448fb754_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1585545650&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=5eb31899443a72b5204b0feebba59ec4\" alt=\"SuperCalla\" width=\"1050\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272686\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/apple-accessories-designed-to-fulfill-every-tech-lovers-dream-part-2/08-Supercalla_magnetic-cable_Mac-Accessories.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272687\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/apple-accessories-designed-to-fulfill-every-tech-lovers-dream-part-2/08-Supercalla_magnetic-cable_Mac-Accessories2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Of all the cable-managing solutions I’ve seen in the near 30 years of my existence, <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/05/20/the-best-way-to-prevent-your-cables-from-entangling-magnets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SuperCalla</a>’s solution seems the most compelling.

It looks like most cables, except for that at certain intervals the SuperCalla cable has magnets around it. These magnets effortlessly organize your cables and keep them organized, thanks to the satisfying snap of magnetic attraction. The magnets allow you to easily open the cable out, using as much as necessary, therefore keeping your drawer, bag, and general workplace as neat as possible.

The headphones even pay tribute to the Homepod with the colored waveform-graphic found on the Homepod’s touch-panel and the faux-weave texture around it. I imagine the headphones also pack noise-canceling, as is expected with high-quality audio products, and from the looks of it, these concept headphones even come with a neat wireless charging dock/hanger. The Airpods do work with Android phones, so it’s safe to imagine that these headphones would too, but just like the Airpods, functionality would be extremely limited, and the touch panel wouldn’t be of much use.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272690\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/apple-accessories-designed-to-fulfill-every-tech-lovers-dream-part-2/10-Power1-Airpod-case_Mac-Accessories.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>AXS Technologies from Brooklyn, NY has created a new and innovative product that unifies all of your most important devices into one sleek system essentially making the AirPod’s native charging case obsolete. <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/07/24/power1-a-product-that-apple-should-have-designed-for-your-iphone-and-airpods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Power1</a> takes portability and functionality to a new level giving you a system that’s doubly useful because it doesn’t just charge and protect for your iPhone… it charges and protects your Airpods too and ensures they are always with you and ready for use. Designed as an evolution of traditional battery cases, Power1 not only holds an extra battery but also manages your Airpods like no other system. Armed with proprietary design, Power1 comes with two modes. One, where it charges your Airpods only (up to 30 times on a full battery), and a second mode that charges your Airpods <em>as well as</em> your phone, giving both gadgets full advantage of Power1’s 3000mAh internal battery.</p><p><img\nsrc=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/fs/0b86e197729487.5efa6d53d8148.gif\" alt=\"Link keyboard\" width=\"1050\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272684\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/apple-accessories-designed-to-fulfill-every-tech-lovers-dream-part-2/07-Link_Modular-Keyboard-and-wireless-accessories_Mac-Accessories.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272685\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/apple-accessories-designed-to-fulfill-every-tech-lovers-dream-part-2/07-Link_Modular-Keyboard-and-wireless-accessories_Mac-Accessories2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>The designer Evan Stuart felt the need to create a truly effortless, delightful, and seamless user experience that went beyond beautiful aesthetics. <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/07/29/this-keyboards-magnetic-accessories-create-the-ultimate-modular-desk-setup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Link</a> is a one-stop-shop to keep devices charged, synced, and ‘linked’ together with as minimal cables and inconveniences as possible. The keyboard is a constant at everyone’s desk and therefore the peripheral devices were formed to work around it like modular accessories. The set includes the keyboard along with ’tiles’ which are the peripheral accessories. These tiles include a drawing tablet, wireless charging pads, a touchpad, a number pad, and a dial which is the most interesting of them all. “Pan around. Zoom. Select. Click. Clack. Rotate. The Dial instantly becomes your favorite digital input tool,” says the designer about including the playful accessory. All modules are battery operated and magnetically connect to the side of the keyboard to dock and recharge when low on charge before being reused again. It also comes equipped with NFC, Bluetooth, and wireless charging capabilities to make it the ultimate unifying hub.

The power-socket is a standard format and the OMNIA X Series tries to limit its shape and size to that format, resulting in a plug that’s small because being small is just a sensible direction to design in. This allows the plug to fit into sockets and strips (even over-crowded ones) without really blocking or interfering with other plugs/switches around it. The OMNIA X Series, despite its size, comes in three variants with 30W and 18W power delivery and the ability to quick-charge your Android and Apple devices with ease. It even packs foldable pins, allowing you to easily carry your charging adapter with you everywhere you go in your backpack or even your pocket.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272680\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/apple-accessories-designed-to-fulfill-every-tech-lovers-dream-part-2/05-Satechi-Apple-watch-iPad-Dock_Mac-accessories.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"850\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272681\" src=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/apple-accessories-designed-to-fulfill-every-tech-lovers-dream-part-2/05-Satechi-Apple-watch-iPad-Dock_Mac-accessories2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Like all of Satechi’s products, the <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/06/16/satechis-magnetic-dock-lets-you-charge-your-apple-watch-using-your-ipad-pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USB-C Magnetic Charging Dock</a> comes with Apple-certified MFI charging, and works across all generations of the Apple Watch. The dock plugs right into the side of the iPad Pro or the MacBook Pro, although you could just as easily use it with any power-bank too. The sleek aluminum design does a pretty good job of blending in with Apple’s design language, while inbuilt magnets securely hold onto your watch as it charges, allowing you to dock your iPad on a stand without worrying about the watch slipping or falling off. Neat, eh?

design","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=272725","description":"<p><img\nsrc=\"https://cdn.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/bmws-classic-e24-gets-a-modern-makeover-but-retains-the-iconic-sharknose-design/bmw_6_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"650\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-272728\" /></p><p>When BMW first debuted the E24 way back in 1976, you&#8217;d best believe it instantly became an icon, serving as a departure from BMW&#8217;s previous design language, with an edgy attitude and its legendary sharknose tip &#8211; a protruding, forward-slanting front detail that gave the car its signature appeal along with a sense of speed and a leader-of-the-pack attitude. The sharknose went on to become one of BMW&#8217;s most epochal details&#8230; in fact, there&#8217;s even a dedicated community of BMW sharknose-automobile owners and aficionados (they congregate every year for an annual Sharknose Meeting).</p><p>While the sharknose detail was eventually phased out as BMW&#8217;s design language evolved and matured, it lives on in the annals of history, and Grigory Butin&#8217;s BMW 6 concept hopes to rekindle its glory. The BMW 6 concept is a confluence of the German auto manufacturer&#8217;s current design styling, but with a renewed interpretation of the sharknose. The BMW 6 showcases streamlined bodywork, which Butin feels &#8220;has a very unique and emotional appearance.”</p><p>The car embraces the coupé format, although with proportions that match the original E24, including elongated front and rear ends. Sleek headlights and taillights give it a more menacing glare, and the kidney-grilles on the front are smaller than usual, although they don&#8217;t take away from the car&#8217;s predatory personality. It only makes sense that to complement it, the car comes in a shark-esque gray color too! While the BMW 6 only currently exists as a fan-made concept, it comes future-proofed, with pop-up door handles and camera mirrors. Let&#8217;s hope someone at BMW is reading this and seriously considering bringing the iconic sharknose back!</p><p>Designers: <a\nhref=\"https://grigorybars-design.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noopener

bricks!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=272648","description":"<p><iframe\ntitle=\"Wall house - CTA\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\"

This Wall House designed by CTA Creative Architects shows that creativity by using hole-punctured bricks. It was specifically chosen to facilitate natural ventilation, bring in sunlight, and letting the house itself breathe.</p><p>This &#8220;wholesome&#8221; structure is a multi-generational family home in the city of Bien Hoa, Vietnam and the only thing they wanted was the living spaces to feel bright and airy. &#8220;According to recently published scientific research, indoor air quality is worse than outdoor air quality. Therefore, most of our discussions with the house owner tended to the idea of a house that is able to &#8216;breathe&#8217; 24/7 by itself,&#8221; said the team. Most of the structure&#8217;s exterior is covered in perforated square bricks that allow fresh air and natural light to flood in. It also promotes upcycling in design &#8211; all of the bricks were salvaged from the building sites of properties nearby and were then punctuated to make four small holes in each of them. Material reusability is as important as creativity.</p><p>The team also managed to save burnt and blackened bricks and used them artistically to form dark patches of color which adds more texture and dimension to the exterior aesthetic. The bricks are arranged randomly to form an irregular, bumpy surface finish &#8211; unconventional like the material itself. A wide flight of tiered steps that lead up to the entrance has been printed with a holey pattern to matches the bricks, it almost looks like a permanent shadow cast on them on a sunny day. To further add to the natural breathing feeling, a small &#8220;garden&#8221; was planted around the periphery of the main room which makes the air quality better and also acts a much needed soothing contrast to the brick tones.</p><p>The house has an unobstructed and large living area which features two massive square windows that have been made in Wall House&#8217;s front elevation for maximum natural light. Another window element is the glass roof which illuminates the other corners of the house. All these details not only add to the &#8216;breathing&#8217; quality of the house but also increase the expansiveness of the place. The rest of the material palette for the home was kept very simple – exposed-aggregate concrete cover the floor and dark wood was used for the kitchen cabinets. A black-metal staircase with a wire-frame balustrade leads to the first level of the home and also serves as a great spot to show off your quarantine outfits &#8211; I can&#8217;t be the only one who walks down in a different set of PJs for every meal right?</p><p>Designer: <a\nhref=\"https://ctacta.com.vn/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CTA Creative

reason behind which becomes incredibly evident once you realize what they&#8217;re actually designed for.</p><p>There are two main components to any conversation &#8211; talking to a person, and listening to the person talk to you. It&#8217;s only natural that earphones designed to facilitate conversation would embrace those two parts, right? The Timekettle M2, in that regard, aren&#8217;t your standard TWS earbuds. Sure, they&#8217;re meant for listening to music and podcasts, or giving commands to your phone&#8217;s voice AI, but their prime feature is the ability to foster a multi-lingual two-way conversation by allowing two people to wear one earphone each as the M2&#8217;s on-board translation engine seamlessly fills in the gaps. The earphone case&#8217;s design revolves around that very aspect, with a design that splits right in two, so you can hand one half over to someone you&#8217;re talking to, almost like you&#8217;re breaking bread with them.</p><p>Built with the ability to actively translate up to 40 languages and 93 accents in realtime, the Timekettle M2 earbuds put a translator in the ears of both conversation-holders. The Timekettle M2 boasts of three different conversation modes that help you navigate a variety of situations &#8211; ranging from holding a conversation in a foreign language, asking for advice, or taking lessons in languages you don&#8217;t understand. In Touch Mode, tap the force sensor on the M2 earbud once, and you can have a conversation with someone in any language and your speech instantly plays back in a translated language to the person wearing the other earpiece. In other modes, the M2 earbuds work along with your phone, allowing you to not only record and translate excerpts in foreign languages, but also translate previously recorded audio files whenever you want.</p><p>All the translation happens courtesy the presence of 4 translation engines that actively work to identify and translate languages based solely on vocal input. Timekettle partnered with best-in-class language enterprises such as Google, Microsoft, iFlytek, and others to deliver fast and responsive translations that accurately capture the nuances and idiosyncrasies of regular speech across multiple languages and accent-types. More importantly, the M2 earbuds possess the ability to translate offline &#8211; a feature that&#8217;s accessible by downloading the Offline Speech Translation Pack on M2&#8217;s app.</p><p>When you&#8217;re not using the M2&#8217;s translator feature, it still serves as a pretty good pair of TWS earbuds. Built with Bluetooth 5.0, the M2 offer quick and unwavering connectivity, along with Qualcomm&#8217;s aptX Audio Codec Compression to deliver incredible sound. The M2 comes with all the trimmings of a good pair of TWS earbuds, with the ability to answer and reject calls, cycle through music playback, or summon your phone&#8217;s Voice AI using its touch-sensitive surface. The earphones are compatible with iOS as well as Android devices, and offer 30 hours of playback with the charging-case, and 6 hours of active translation.
