My responsibilities ranged from&nbsp;Flash games to HTML templates to ecommerce coding.</p>\n\n<p>They were all fine jobs, and each paid more than the previous, but&nbsp;none were quite right for me at the time. I was probably a bit of an entitled twenty-something as well.&nbsp;So&nbsp;after saving up a little cash (and having been newly married), I became a full-time freelancer at age 25.</p>\n\n<p>For the next ten years, the freelance life was good to me. I sometimes worked until 2AM on a Sunday. I sometimes slept until noon on a Thursday. I wore unfashionable shorts. I jumped across the country: a tiny Georgia&nbsp;village, a Midwest&nbsp;city loft, a crazy expensive NYC apartment. Over this time, we added three children to the mix.</p>\n\n<p>But as much as I enjoyed freelancing for that decade, I soon found that there were more reasons for me to stop than to continue. Here are those reasons. I won&#39;t pretend that they apply to every freelancer, but they did to me...</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Freedom was fast becoming more of an illusion.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This was the biggest draw to freelancing in the first place - freedom. The idea that I could schedule my work around the times that worked best for me was appealing. I loved working from my own environment that I found productive;&nbsp;while taking on as much or little work as I desired. But as my skills matured and I began taking on more sophisticated clients, I was needed at more hours of the day. Furthermore, as the digital landscape became more complex, more things had to be monitored.&nbsp;As a solo freelancer, it just became overwhelming..</p>\n\n<p><strong>My skillset and connections were stagnating.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Remember when the term &ldquo;web designer&rdquo; meant the &ldquo;person who did anything with a website.&rdquo; I was a web designer when I was coding C# forms, and I was a web designer when I was mapping out sitemaps. In the last decade, the industry has segmented into some very deep verticals, with positions in information architecture, database administration, interaction&nbsp;design, and the like. I began finding that my skills, while diverse, were only a few inches deep, and marketing that skillset was getting tough as a freelancer. Also, I wasn&rsquo;t getting to work with others who were mastering the other facets of digital.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The most interesting projects seemed out of reach.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed many interesting projects as freelancer, and was proud to see my work in various places (my favorite being a Flash-powered Times Square sign I made for the 2008 election). But the current digital landscape demands expertise at too many technologies to name, and most projects that were really interesting to me required a team. It was harder and harder for a freelancer to win a contract meant for a team (except as an external 1099 for that team).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Companies began integrating the aspects that made freelancing interesting.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Freelancing used to be the antithesis of &ldquo;company work.&rdquo; If you didn&rsquo;t freelance, you might end up in a cubicle (think <em>Office Space</em>). But in the last decade, thanks in part to Silicon Valley and various startups, work environments in our space have changed to be more accommodating and thoughtful. My current &ldquo;company&rdquo; position allows me to work at home, take unlimited vacations, and enjoy many of the benefits once allowed only to freelancers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m tremendously fortunate to have freelanced for a decade&nbsp;and support a family while doing so. I look on those days fondly, and am proud of my&nbsp;work and the things I learned during those years. So here&rsquo;s to another ten years making digital things, this time with pants and co-workers.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?a=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?a=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?i=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?a=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?i=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?a=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?a=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?i=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?a=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 05:00:00 +0000","feedId":32192,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"46319fdb15e4b166fc527833a2dba64e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn98@2020_3/2022/03/14/10-14-36-827_aeb948a36e1dbd18.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":997,"destBytes":310,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn98@2020_3/2022/03/14/10-14-36-827_aeb948a36e1dbd18.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?i=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn13@2020_6/2022/03/14/10-14-37-346_a1a26706164f10d5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?i=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn2@2020_2/2022/03/14/10-14-37-667_090533db18a73c0e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn18@2020_6/2022/03/14/10-14-37-143_6f32a39e9f86a0f6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?i=a8rFt2idWqg:ZNimO4gFF_w:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn5@2020_4/2022/03/14/10-14-37-360_0acada9dad79fb93.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/wakeuplater-freelance-blog?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn10@2020_6/2022/03/14/10-14-37-149_89effcafad2a915d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647252876752}],"record":{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 18:14:36","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 18:14:36","feedId":32192,"fetchDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 10:14:36 +0000","fetchMs":23,"handleMs":180246,"totalMs":181642,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":1,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af0629e1ae74a27744b4cbd27b40a78e","hostName":"us-039*","requestId":"ef2aa0e0168642c98a7d96ee9956b438_32192","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":2278,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":6,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":6,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx14":1,"myreaderx6":1,"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx32":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:54:52","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:06:18","id":32192,"name":"Wake Up Later : Design & Digital Musings","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/wakeuplater-freelance-blog","subscriber":100,"website":null,"icon":"http://www.wakeuplater.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"My name is Samuel Ryan.
