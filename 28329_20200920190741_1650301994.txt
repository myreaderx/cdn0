For example, our house in California has been empty for a good, long while. We had the genius idea to have the place remodeled while we were still living in Boston.  “We’ll move back to our dream home!”  The contractor agreed time-and-again, all along the way, that he’d be all finished up in time… Fast forward to today: we are still a couple of weeks out from completion. Now, despite the fact that we love all the work that’s been done, we’re still upset. Every subcontractor that walks in the door is a reminder that he shoulda been done with XYZ project weeks ago; why is he still here, why is any one of ‘em still here, still not done?</p>\n<p>I won’t bore you with the details of the situation or how we’re handling it… it just occurred to me that “I would never run my business this way,” which led me to remember that we quite specifically talk about this “Underpromise, Overdeliver” concept in our training at the agency.  That is not to say that there are never disappointments, or that sometimes we don’t get overeager about an idea that ultimately doesn’t zing like we’d hoped. It just means we try to plan for failure, to adjust for it, and to make up for it when possible.  The goal is “surprise and delight” vs. “overpromise and underdeliver.”</p>\n<p>The gulf between a “wow” and a “sigh” is not easily bridged.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=ZqOE5XvMapQ:1h_PFKUlOyE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=ZqOE5XvMapQ:1h_PFKUlOyE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?a=ZqOE5XvMapQ:1h_PFKUlOyE:W9dqtTZ0I2U\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=W9dqtTZ0I2U\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PrSquared/~4/ZqOE5XvMapQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 09 Jul 2013 17:35:28 +0000","feedId":28329,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c6c96d2f48062eac79d4f7b740ae306f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Todd Defren","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.pr-squared.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/100381000-300x225.jpg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn68@2020_1/2020/09/20/19-05-39-739_3ce7c01f1f70fff6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn60@2020_4/2020/09/20/19-05-39-740_aa3ad4895192e821.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PrSquared?d=W9dqtTZ0I2U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn51@2020_4/2020/09/20/19-05-39-612_9fbef25ee7ba3941.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PrSquared/~4/ZqOE5XvMapQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn62@2020_4/2020/09/20/19-05-39-706_da3e8ecec5953c7b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600628739558}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-09-21 03:05:39","updatedTime":"2020-09-21 03:05:39","feedId":28329,"fetchDate":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 19:05:39 +0000","fetchMs":102,"handleMs":180396,"totalMs":301971,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"818b2f91db1355e1383e1c549cf591f8","hostName":"europe69*","requestId":"92fe4c767b9140259f054c8a73cc9ac1_28329","contentType":"text/xml;
