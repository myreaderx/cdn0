href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-james-comey-letter-clinton-email-investigation-2016-10\">letter to Congress</a> on October 28, 2016 revealing \"the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation\" of Hillary Clinton's private email server.</p><p>Clinton's popular vote forecast was narrowing as the election drew closer, but Comey's letter may have affected the voting margin by up to 4 percentage points in the most important states of the race and close to 2 percentage points nationally, according to a <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/\">report</a> by Nate Silver, founder of <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, a poll analysis website.</p><p>If a similar event were to involve Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, his projected positive voting margins would shrink, but not enough to ruin his chances in key tipping point states, FiveThirtyEight projected.</p><p>The seven states with the highest chance of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-states-which-could-decide-biden-trump-presidential-election-2020\">nudging a candidate</a> over the 270 electoral vote mark are Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, North Carolina, and Minnesota,&#160;<a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/\">FiveThirtyEight forecasting shows</a>. In 2016, President Donald Trump won all of these states except Minnesota, which Clinton claimed by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2016/11/08/500927768/2016-presidential-election-results-for-each-state\">about 2 percentage points</a>.</p><p>An event with the same impact as Comey's letter would reduce Biden's projected lead in Pennsylvania, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pennsylvania-is-the-most-important-state-on-the-map-now-2020-10\">a state the former vice president absolutely needs to flip</a>, from 5.6 to 1.6 percentage points, according to <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/pennsylvania/\">projected voting margins</a> from FiveThirtyEight. His estimated share of the national popular vote would then lead Trump by just 1.8 percentage points.</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><iframe title=\"The possible effects of a \"Comey letter\" incident happening in 2020  n 2020  \" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-KDsRb\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KDsRb/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% ; border: none;\" height=\"481\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();</script></div><p>With 29 electoral votes, Florida has the most electoral votes of any state that swung from blue to red in 2016. If a surprise development rocked Biden's chances before Nov. 3, Trump would become the new projected favorite in Florida with a lead just under 2 percentage points. According to simulations by election forecasting company, <a href=\"https://forecast.decisiondeskhq.com/president\">Decision Desk HQ</a>, Trump wins a second term only 10% of the time without landing Florida.&#160;</p><p>Any similar last minute developments would also diminish Biden's lead in Arizona and North Carolina, FiveThirtyEight projects. Both states went to Trump in 2016 for a combined 25 electoral votes. Neither Biden nor Trump are completely reliant on these states to win, but their electoral votes allow for an easier path to the White House.</p><p>As of Oct. 8, <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html\">over 6 million people</a> have already cast their votes through mail-in and early voting in an election expected to receive the most mailed votes than any other in US history. At this point in 2016, about a month away from the election, <a href=\"http://www.electproject.org/early_2016\">only 75,000 mail-in votes</a> had been cast. According to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/america-likely-wont-know-presidential-race-winner-on-election-night-2020-5\">voting rights experts</a>, voting by mail is expected to make up 50% to 70% of the total vote in November.</p><p>It's impossible to predict if a highly scrutinized incident could occur right before the election and ruin Biden's chances.&#160;But, the closer a Comey-like event occurs to Election Day, the lower the likelihood of it upending the Biden campaign as a much greater proportion of votes will already be placed</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-a-comey-letter-like-surprise-would-impact-bidens-campaign-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Tn3BPnp75IU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 19:09:30 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f7f32d2282c500018c795ad?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"2127209192cf7524afe616af424cbc46","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn7@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-946_c8453dbbbb69a224.webp","destWidth":3317,"destHeight":2487,"sourceBytes":475142,"destBytes":475142,"author":"mhall@businessinsider.com (Madison Hall)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f7de4c8282c500018c791c7?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn67@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-32-710_d13e3f738626a970.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-31-159_bb048c289d500d08.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn25@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-34-475_3ee721086ccf8e76.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn41@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-30-246_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Tn3BPnp75IU:2zEvp1pqRu8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn100@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-33-31-543_2b83e95b195a878f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Tn3BPnp75IU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-33-28-768_d3c66835f041a036.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214360898},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:40","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:40","title":"How to block or unblock someone on the Signal secure-messaging app in just a few taps","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-block-someone-on-signal","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7b6e79282c500018c78ada?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Signal Messaging App\" height=\"1500\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>It&#39;s easy to block and unblock users on Signal.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Picture Alliance/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>You can block someone from contacting you on Signal, and unblock users you've blocked, just like you can on most messaging apps.</li>\n<li>To block a user, open a conversation with them and tap their name at the top of the screen.

Gretchen Whitmer</a>, a frequent target of the president's ire, and hold a mock trial for \"treason\" over her state's COVID-19 lockdown. The men are accused of participating in or being associates of a paramilitary organization, the Wolverine Watchmen, that is associated with the far-right Boogaloo movement, whose members have <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-17/far-right-boogaloo-boys-linked-to-killing-of-california-lawmen-other-violence\">assassinated cops</a> as part of an effort to spur a civil war.</p>\n<p>US Attorney Andrew Birge, a Trump appointee, also charged six individuals as part of a joint state-federal investigation into the plot. According to the federal complaint, the men — at least one of whom tweeted support for President Trump — planned to kidnap Whitmer at her vacation home or official governor's summer residence.</p>\n<p>\"Snatch and grab, man,\" said one of the alleged conspirators, who reportedly engaged in firearms training and tactical drills in what the <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=7223362-Michigan-Kidnapping-Conspiracy\">federal complaint</a> describes as a \"remote area of Michigan.\"</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">\n —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1251169217531056130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 17, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>Nessel was once inclined to dismiss such rhetoric as the overheated musings of cosplay-soldiers. \"But you know, this is much scarier than that,\" she said.</p>\n<p>\"These are individuals who seemingly are very committed to the cause. This went from what seemed to be hostile and angry rhetoric to planning,\" she said. \"Plans to be disruptive to government; to kill law enforcement officials; to potentially blow up the Capitol building; and, of course, to kidnap and put on trial and execute the governor.\"</p>\n<p>\"Once you've moved from just a bunch of guys blowing off steam to training exercises across multiple jurisdictions, and really heavily investing time, energy and effort… now we have to take it very seriously,\" she added.</p>\n<p>Facebook, where the alleged conspirators were caught discussing retribution against Gov. Whitmer, has taken steps in recent months to prohibit paramilitary groups from organizing on its platform. But it is still widely used by far-right activists to organize.</p>\n<p>\"I definitely think it's increasing their numbers,\" Nessel said, \"and it's never good when you have a social media platform used that way.\"</p>\n<p>Still, Facebook is far from the only, or even the most important, factor.</p>\n<p>In April 2020, President Trump, defying the advice of public health experts, egged on opponents of Gov. Whitmer's stay-at-home order, designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\" he tweeted.</p>\n<p>Weeks later, after armed protesters entered Michigan's state capitol building, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-protestors-with-guns-in-michigan-capitol-are-very-good-people-2020-5\">Trump tweeted approvingly</a>. \"These are very good people, but they are angry,\" he said. \"See them, talk to them, make a deal.\"</p>\n<p>According to Nessel, several of the armed men who attended that protest were later involved in the plot to kidnap Whitmer. Indeed, they used that protest to recruit, she said.</p>\n<p>\"These guys think that he's talking to them,\" Nessel said. \"He actually said, you recall, that the governor ought to sit down and negotiate with these armed gunmen. That provides that cover, you know — that legitimacy. That's all they need sometimes to escalate their operations, because they feel like they have the support of the president himself.\"</p>\n<p>That appears to have been the case with two other far-right activists who were <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,4534,7-359--541876--,00.html\">arraigned on Thursday</a>: Jacob Wohl, a 22-year-old social media provocateur before he was banned from Twitter, and 54-year-old Jack Burkman. The two are accused of trying to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/michigan-right-wing-activist-jacob-wohl-accused-of-voter-intimidation-2020-10\">intimidate Michigan voters</a>, allegedly using robocalls to spread false information about mail-in ballots in order to depress turnout.</p>\n<p>Nessel thinks the fact that such people have Michigan in their crosshairs has a lot to do with 2016 and \"the fact that Trump won our state,\" which until then was generally considered a reliable Democratic stronghold; he won by less than 11,000 votes.</p>\n<p>\"In 2016, a large part of the reason why Trump won here is because of these voter-suppression tactics, in large part that stemmed from misinformation being disseminated,\" Nessel said. It would appear some supporter think it's worth another shot, she said. \"It worked last time.\"</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

Seven other men were charged with terrorism-related crimes.</p><p>\"Several members talked about murdering 'tyrants' or 'taking' a sitting governor,\" FBI agent Richard Trask II said in the affidavit. \"The group decided they needed to increase their numbers and encouraged each other to talk to their neighbors and spread their message.\"</p><p>Fox also claimed he needed 200 men to attack the capitol building in Lansing and take hostages, including Gov. Whitmer.</p><p>\"Snatch and grab, man. Grab the f---in' governor. Just grab the b----,\" Fox said during a July 27 meeting. \"Because at that point, we do that, dude — it's over.\"</p><p>Whitmer has been criticized by conservative activists for the state's response to the coronavirus. In April, Whitmer extended a stay-at-home order that imposed restrictions on businesses that were classified as essential. The order was later rescinded as part of the state's reopening plans.</p><p>During a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Whitmer described the men as \"sick and depraved.\"</p><p>\"Hatred, bigotry and violence have no place in the great state of Michigan,\" she said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

That means that every cursed pimple that shows up right before a big interview, night out, first nerve-racking date, or big beach vacation could be dealt with before the damage could really make any difference.</p><p>Like a mini Indiana Jones, I spent most of my pre-teen years engaged in a sprawling search for exactly this. I read the beauty articles, stalked the CVS aisles, and spent my minimum wage earnings on products that promised to be the next big thing. And while some were decently effective, none came within throwing distance of working overnight. Spot correctors like <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/mario-badescu-drying-lotion-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mario Badescu's famous Drying Lotion</a> helped me recover faster, but it was still days at a time. Discovering an <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/differin-acne-gel-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affordable version of Differin</a> in my mid-twenties helped me manage surface-level bumps within two days. And a chance discovery of this <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/aztec-bentonite-clay-mask-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cult-favorite Aztec Clay Mask</a>&#160;with over 13,000 five-star reviews has helped me stop most breakouts before they happen.</p><p>But that still leaves the only kind of pimples I really cared about anyway — the ones that were a bit more severe than a light, surface-level irritation, and which you'd probably see someone's eyes wander to in a conversation.&#160;</p><p><strong>That's what I swear by Mighty Patch for, which I <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/products-we-bought-from-our-coworkers-reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bought immediately</a>&#160;after reading <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/mighty-patch-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this Insider Reviews review</a>. </strong></p><p>To be concise, <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=17095&awinaffid=257137&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.herocosmetics.us%2Fproducts%2Fmighty-patch-originaloriginal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Mighty Patch</a> is simply the best fast acne solution I've ever found. They're Hydrocolloid stickers that suck the gunk out of blemishes overnight (or, as we'll get into later, during the day) if left on top of the blemish for a minimum of six hours. Originally used to treat wounds, hydrocolloid is a super-absorbent material now being put to use in gentle acne treatments — first in South Korea, where Hero Cosmetics' CEO and Co-Founder Ju Rhyu discovered them, and now in the US thanks in part to Rhyu's startup.</p><p>I put a Mighty Patch on at night before bed and wake up to a blemish that seems to have skipped three days of healing; it's not inflamed or raised, and it no longer appears to be active. They're gentle (vegan, alcohol-, paraben-, and sulfate-free), simple, and keep the germs from the outside world and your wandering hands away so blemishes can heal and stay healed. It's my personal \"magic beans\" product.</p><p>And now, Hero Cosmetics has released a Mighty Patch that can be worn during the day: <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=17095&awinaffid=257137&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.herocosmetics.us%2Fproducts%2Fmighty-patch-invisiblenvisible\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">the Invisible+ patches</a>. They're transparent, ultra-thin, matte to avoid reflecting light, and have tapered edges that blend seamlessly into the skin (find comparative photos below)<strong>. </strong>Now, you can treat pimples in as little as six hours, no matter when they appear — no waiting for the cloak of night to get down to business.&#160;</p><h2>How to use Invisible+ Mighty Patches</h2><p>Cleanse the skin, pat it dry, and apply the mighty patch on top of your blemish. Leave it on for a minimum of six hours, either during the day or overnight if you choose. Remove it to throw away once the patch has turned opaque (aka sucked up all the impurities from that spot of your skin).&#160;</p><h2><strong>What the Invisible+ Mighty Patches are like in person</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=17095&awinaffid=257137&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.herocosmetics.us%2Fproducts%2Fmighty-patch-invisiblenvisible\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow noopener sponsored sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f5fbd0f9900001939ee58?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mighty Patch Original vs. the Might Patch Invisible\" height=\"2607\" width=\"3476\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Left: Mighty Patch Original.\nRight: Invisible&#43; Mighty Patch.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mara Leighton/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>The Invisible+ Mighty Patches are the same technology as the originals, but much less conspicuous. They're thinner, more transparent (the originals have a yellowish hue) and matte so they don't catch and reflect light. They have tapered edges to help the patch blend more seamlessly into the skin. If you wear them during the day, you can add a bit of concealer on top to camouflage it effectively and avoid makeup being absorbed into the blemish.</p><p>If the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=17095&awinaffid=257137&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.herocosmetics.us%2Fproducts%2Fmighty-patch-invisiblenvisible\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Invisible+ patch</a> is prominently featured (i.e. smack dab in the middle of your face), though, it's not going to magically look like skin close up. Having said that, though, it's preferable to me between making things worse with just concealer and going sans anything at all. And it'll likely go unnoticed in casual interactions — perfect for doing damage control on a surprise breakout while traveling, beach days, running errands, before a big job interview or date, or pretty much any other time. I've used them last-minute to address a surprise blemish in the morning and afternoon so I could go out with clear skin at night.&#160;</p><p>Plus, the box includes two size options, so you can opt for a smaller patch for less severe blemishes. And, given their cult status, most people won't know what they are, and they're more likely to assume it's got more to do with a bandage than an active acne solution. But, ultimately, it's also good to note that it's not the end of the word even if someone does notice: as Hero Cosmetics' CEO Ju Rhyu, reminded me, \"over 60 million Americans suffer from acne at some point so even though we hate it when we break out, it's a fairly normal thing.\" More often than not, we're all in the same boat.</p><p>My one cautionary note is to check them more frequently while you're out in the daylight if you don't dab concealer on top — once they turn opaque, they're much more noticeable, and you'll probably want to take it off.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=17095&awinaffid=257137&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.herocosmetics.us%2Fproducts%2Fmighty-patch-invisiblenvisible\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5c7865ca26289844e6689f84?format=jpeg\" alt=\"collagehgkhjlkhjllhjl\" height=\"2250\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Left: Invisible&#43; Mighty Patch.

However, if they're working, both the originals and the Invisible+ will eventually turn opaque and be far easier to spot — though, for what it's worth, the thinness of the Invisible+ is still less noticeable overall. For instance, having used both, I wouldn't wear the Mighty Patch Original out in public because of their thickness and color. I would, however, wear the Invisible+ in public if I thought I could get away with it based on the location of my acne.</p><p>Depending on your comfort level and where you need it (side of the face, chin, forehead underneath a baseball cap, etc.) and where you're going (beach, airplane, running errands) the still-there visibility may not matter anyway. Either way you break it down, the fact remains: the efficacy of the Mighty Patch is worth it. The added subtlety of the Invisible+ is worth it if you plan to wear them during the day or out in public.&#160;</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5e948cb329d6d96fac390994\" style=\"position:relative;

Yet interest rates weren't much higher before the pandemic slammed the US economy and forced nationwide lockdowns. The federal funds rate hovered around 1.5% in late 2019 after three rate cuts through the second half of last year.</p><p>The pre-pandemic low-rate environment led investors to take on more risk in search of higher yields. Businesses met the demand with new debt offerings. That behavior is now coming back to bite all of the US, Rosengren said in prepared remarks for an online event with Marquette University.</p><p>\"The slow build-up of risk in the low-interest-rate environment that preceded the current recession likely will make the economic recovery from the pandemic more difficult,\" he said.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-snowflake-barrick-gold-shareholder-brian-gongol-2020-10\" data-analytics-position=\"2\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway shocked investors with its Snowflake and Barrick Gold bets.

The Fed slashed its rate close to zero during the financial crisis and maintained that level until late 2015.</p><p>A build-up in risk can intensify downturns, as levered businesses can more easily default on debt when facing a slowdown in business activity and, in turn, revenue. Greater leverage throughout the economy also kept many firms from participating in emergency lending programs. In all, risk-taking is \"a contributing factor to the bankruptcies we have already seen, unfortunately with more quite likely in the coming months,\" Rosengren said.</p><p>The US lacks the regulatory tools needed to moderate risk build-ups down the road, he added. Failing to research risk-taking behaviors threatens an even worse wave of bankruptcies down the road.</p><p>\"If we expect to remain in a low-interest-rate environment for a protracted period of time, we need to take more precautions against financial stability risks for when the next economic shock hits,\" Rosengren said.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider

But not all embryos survive the gestation process: Some are eaten by their womb-mates.</p><p>\"'Early-hatched' embryos will begin to eat surrounding unhatched eggs,\" Kenshu Shimada, lead author of the study and a professor of paleobiology at DePaul University, told Business Insider. \"The consequence is that only a few pups will survive and develop, but each of those pups can become considerably large in body size at birth.\"</p><h2>Elusive fossil evidence makes the Meg's size 'hard to pin down'</h2><h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f734a650ab50d00184acfa1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"meg tooth shimada\" height=\"584\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Paleobiologist Kenshu Shimada holds a tooth of an extinct shark Otodus megalodon, or the so-called &#34;Meg.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Kenshu Shimada/DePaul University/Jeff Carrion</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></h2><p>Shimada's group first wanted to pin down how big megalodons could get.</p><p>So the researchers looked at how Meg's modern relatives, called lamniforms, live today. These sharks — which include great whites, makos, and sand tigers — have the same diet and body type as Meg did. So Shimada measured the size ratio between those sharks' teeth and body proportions, then applied that comparison to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiwx7jD6ZPsAhWDknIEHbGYCVEQFjAMegQICRAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fmegalodon-teeth-found-in-flooded-cave-mexico-2019-11&usg=AOvVaw3N8FWyKdxlcJ_HU64l8LQD-11&#38;usg=AOvVaw3N8FWyKdxlcJ_HU64l8LQD\">fossilized megalodon teeth</a>.</p><p>That revealed that the maximum length a Meg could get is about 50 feet (15 meters) — more than double the length of a great white, the biggest carnivorous shark alive today.</p><p>\"This does not mean that Megalodon individuals larger than 15 meters did not exist, but their existence has not been substantiated based on scientific specimens in museum collections,\" Shimada said.</p><p>Indeed, a group of UK researchers did similar tooth-body comparisons in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71387-y\">a September study</a>, and found that megalodons could have been 52 feet long. That research also showed that a 52-foot (16-meter) megalodon had a head and tail 13 feet (4 meters) long, and a dorsal fin equal to the height of an average woman.<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f734f7374fe5b0018a8df46?format=jpeg\" alt=\"megalodon fin\" height=\"340\" width=\"576\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Comparison of a reconstruction of an adult megalodon&#39;s dorsal fin to a 5-foot-tall diver.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Oliver Oliver E. Demuth</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"It has been hard to pin down these dimensions because we only have teeth remains,\" Catalina Pimiento, an author of that September study, told Business Insider.</p><p>Scattered vertebrae exist, but scientists have yet to find any other bones, since sharks' soft, cartilaginous skeletons rarely survive fossilization.</p><p>\"It may be we will never find a complete skeleton,\" added Mike Benton, Pimiento's co-author.&#160;</p><h2>Cannibal megalodons</h2><p>Given the paucity of fossils, scientists are forced to make educated guesses about what influenced megalodons' lives and diets using their modern counterparts.</p><p>There are, in theory, two ways a shark can get enough food to become as gigantic as the Meg: either they become filter-feeders and munch on abundant plankton, like whale sharks do, or they gain the ability to control their own body temperatures, which improves their hunting skills.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-01/su-rsw012419.php\">January 2019 study</a> from Pimiento's group suggested that megalodons followed the latter route: They were mesothermic, meaning they could regulate the temperature of their organs. This enabled the sharks to live in colder waters and swim faster — and therefore catch more prey.</p><p>Mesothermy was \"a key driver in the evolution of its gigantic size,\" Pimiento said.</p><p>What drove these sharks to become mesothermic? Shimada thinks the key to answering that question has to do with the way lamniforms&#160;give birth.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f734ed40ab50d00184acfd4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"megalodon\" height=\"1800\" width=\"2700\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Jaws of Carcharocles megalodon, an extinct species of shark that lived from about 23 to 3.6 million years ago.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Florida Museum photo by Kristen Grace</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>A female lamniforms' eggs hatch inside her body, then the pups develop in her womb before being born. The babies that hatch early have the benefit of getting to eat their unhatched brothers and sisters — a process called \"intrauterine cannibalism.\"</p><p>Sometimes, like in sandtiger sharks, hatched pups will eat their litter mates after they're born, too.</p><p>Given that lamniforms are related to megalodons, Shimada said the same rules likely applied to the prehistoric predators.</p><p>In the new study, his group suggested that such cannibalism could've kickstarted megalodons' mesothermy: The task of nurturing a small number of gigantic offspring — well fed on their siblings' blood — in their wombs may have prompted Meg moms to eat more. And in order to eat more, they needed to either switch to a plankton diet, or crank up their internal temperatures to hunt better.</p><h2>'Its hunting style was likely a single-strike tactic'</h2><p>The prehistoric shark's teeth can tell us more about how Megs preferred to hunt.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-03/fmon-hmt030419.php\">One study</a> suggested in March 2019 that the sharks liked to bite hard then step back. Adult megalodons packed a bite force of 11 tons.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f734ed374fe5b0018a8df43?format=jpeg\" alt=\"megalodon\" height=\"1200\" width=\"1800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A megalodon&#39;s blade-ike, serrated teeth were ideal for preying on fleshy marine mammals like whales and dolphins.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Florida Museum photo by Kristen Grace</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"Megalodon's teeth suggest its hunting style was likely a single-strike tactic, designed to immobilize its prey and allow it to bleed out,\" Victor Perez, the lead author of that study, said in a release. He added: \"A shark wouldn't want to grab and hold onto a whale because it's going to thrash about and possibly injure the shark in the process.\"</p><p>Researchers have discovered megalodon bite marks on marine mammal bones, but whether those remarks represent predatory attacks or scavenging activities is still unknown, according to Shimada.</p><h2>Dwindling prey and competition with other sharks may have caused the Meg's extinction</h2><p>The biggest megalodon mystery has little to do with its size, however. Paleobiologists like Shimada and Pimiento still aren't sure how the shark went extinct.</p><p>Megalodons dominated the oceans for 20 million years before disappearing from the fossil record between 3.6 and 2.6 million years ago.

for wide-open outdoor spaces that make it easier to practice social distancing and travel as safely as can be guaranteed right now. Of course, without a vaccine, it's impossible to guarantee safety. Also, consider whether you're leaving or traveling to a hotspot, so as not to contribute to infection spikes. And follow guidelines from the CDC and WHO such as wearing a mask, washing your hands, and social distancing, no matter where you go.</p><p>However, there's something especially idyllic about a lake vacation. Like the best memories from summer camp, lake getaways conjure images of paddling in calm, crystal-clear waters surrounded by forests and wildlife, and plenty of fresh, crisp air. A lake trip can be a relaxing romantic retreat or an outdoorsy family adventure.&#160;</p><p>We rounded up some of the best lakefront stays spanning the US including charming inns with cozy fireplaces and wide porches, as well as mountain resorts with all sorts of activities including biking, hiking, fishing, golf, and more.&#160;</p><p>We carefully selected properties based on the following criteria:</p><ol><li><strong>All hotels are, of course, lakefront.

cellular device in a number of ways.</li>\n<li>Don't ever engage with spammers, even to text a STOP request; instead, you can report them to your phone carrier or use tools on your phone to filter or block them.</li>\n<li>If necessary, you can buy an app that can help block spam texts as well, though it will only be effective while you pay for a subscription to it.&#160;</li>\n<li><strong><a

Reference library for more stories</a>.</strong></li>\n</ul><p>Unwanted text messages, while generally not as annoying as telemarketing calls, can be very irritating.&#160;</p><p>Not only do <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/spam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spam</a> texts clutter your messaging app's inbox and distract you with nonsense notifications, but if you don't have unlimited texting with your cellular plan, you might be paying for junk. And some spam messages contain links to potentially dangerous <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/malware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malware</a>.</p><p>It pays to try to stop – or at least minimize – spam texts when possible.</p><h2><strong>How to stop spam texts</strong></h2><p>Here are five steps you can take to filter or block spammers from reaching your messaging app's inbox.</p><h3><strong>Don't respond to unwanted messages</strong></h3><p>You're probably familiar with the way legitimate sources let you opt out of future text communication by replying \"STOP.\" Many spammers offer you the option to respond with STOP as well, but don't. Spammers use your reply – any reply, including STOP – as a signal that you received your message and are actively engaged in your messages, so that can embolden them to send you more messages. Your information can also be sold to other spammers who are looking for \"verified active\" phone numbers.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7e24d1282c500018c79382?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How_to_stop_spam_texts 2\" height=\"1137\" width=\"1242\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Don&#39;t text &#34;STOP&#34; unless you trust the sender is trustworthy and legitimate.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Report spammers to your cellular provider</strong></h3><p>One way to counter spam texts is by reporting unwanted texters directly to your phone service provider. For most major carriers — including AT&#38;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon — you can copy the offending message and text it to 7726. You should receive a reply, which, depending on the carrier,&#160; might include a request to send the phone number that the spam came from. This probably won't result in instant results for you, but it will contribute to cleaning up the texting ecosystem for everyone.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7e254b282c500018c79385?format=jpeg\" alt=\"spam texts\" height=\"1478\" width=\"1242\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You can report potential spam to your phone carrier.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Filter potential spammers</strong></h3><p>Most phones have a setting to automatically filter potential spam messages so that they don't appear in the same list with important, legitimate texts from known contacts.&#160;</p><ul><li>On an iPhone, start the Settings app and tap \"Messages.\" Scroll down and turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" by swiping the button to the right.&#160;</li><li>On Android, start the Messaging app and tap the three dots at the top right. In the dropdown menu, choose \"Settings,\" and then tap \"Spam Protection.\" Finally, turn on \"Enable spam protection\" by swiping the button to the right.&#160;</li></ul><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7e25adc655f6001969ecb4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How_to_stop_spam_texts 3\" height=\"800\" width=\"1365\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You can filter potential spammers on both iOS and Android.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3><strong>Block specific spammers</strong></h3><p>If you get frequent spam from the same phone number, you can use your messaging app to block that number. Don't count on this helping in every situation, though, because most spammers can appear to use a different number each time they reach out to you, so blocking individual numbers may have little effect.&#160;</p><ul><li>On an iPhone, open the message and tap the user icon at the top of the page, then tap \"info.\" On the next page tap \"info\" again, and then tap \"Block this Caller.\"</li></ul><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7e2613c655f6001969ecb6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How_to_stop_spam_texts 4\" height=\"1919\" width=\"1242\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You can block specific phone numbers, which is handy if you repeatedly get texts from the same sender.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li>On Android, the process may vary depending on the messaging app you're using, but in general, you can tap the three dots at the top of the message and choose \"Block number\" from the dropdown menu.&#160;</li></ul><h3><strong>Use a paid text-blocking app</strong></h3><p>Hopefully, some combination of the previous tips dramatically reduces the number of spam messages you receive. If you need additional assistance, though, you can turn to an app designed to block spam. An app like <a href=\"https://www.robokiller.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RoboKiller</a>, available for both iPhone and Android, can dramatically reduce the spam you receive, both in the form of phone calls and text messages. These apps aren't free, though. RoboKiller has a 7-day free trial, and then costs either $5 per month or $40 per year.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5d8e19fb2e22af18f40d281d\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width:

In a city known for raucous nightlife, many bars and restaurants shut down or operated under heavy restrictions as the city experienced peak infection rates.</p><p>However, New Orleans responded responsibly, and as cases dipped, the historic French Quarter began to slowly and carefully reopen. Restaurants welcome patrons to distanced, courtyard dining and bars now sell to-go drinks.</p><p>With so much recent change, I decided to get a closer read on how local hospitality has adapted in my hometown, and&#160;checked into the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&awinaffid=257137&clickref=&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fmonteleone.en-gb.htmle.en-gb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Hotel Monteleone</a> for one night. This iconic property is one of the city's oldest, most celebrated hotels.</p><p>In fact, I consider it among <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-hotels-new-orleans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New Orleans' best hotels</a> and a rarity, as an independent luxury property that is in its fifth generation of family ownership. It's a beloved spot for locals like myself, as well as visitors, for its famed Carousel Bar that's become something of a New Orleans landmark.&#160;</p><p>It opened in 1886 with 64 rooms and expanded over the decades to its current tally of 570 rooms, making it one of the largest in the city. It comes with a proud literary history: Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, and William Faulkner all stayed here regularly, and Truman Capote (falsely) claimed to have been born here.</p><p>After a short closure, the hotel is now open again, and with attractive prices far cheaper than is the norm. I booked an entry-level <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&awinaffid=257137&clickref=&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fmonteleone.en-gb.htmle.en-gb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Traditional King room</a> for $151 for one night, which was a good $50 below the amount I might usually expect to pay for a midweek booking.</p><p>Most of the amenities, such as the pool, restaurant and spa were open, albeit with restrictions to keep guests safe. This was my first New Orleans hotel stay since the pandemic began, and it turned out to not only be a great value, but reassuring and reviving, and I would gladly return with confidence.

The only completely absent service as far as I could tell, was the removal of in-room dining.</p><p>As I completed my check-in, I also noticed that there was a dedicated desk with a sign saying Health &#38; Medical Assistance, complete with a uniformed medical professional there throughout the day to assist guests with any additional concerns.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d979264d831b2141f07abd1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2 Hotel Reviews Banner The room\" height=\"151\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7cc2e494fce90018f7b763?format=jpeg\" alt=\"hotel monteleone bedroom\" height=\"1119\" width=\"1492\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>My Traditional King Room was compact, but comfortable, with regal design accents.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Paul Oswell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>I booked the hotel's standard, entry-level <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fmonteleone.en-gb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Traditional King room</a>.</p><p>I was allocated one on the 14th floor, the highest floor for regular guest rooms, though there is also a <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fmonteleone.en-gb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Penthouse Suite</a> on the 15th floor. The Monteleone has a good range of rooms, with 55 suites that vary in size and comfort between my room and the Penthouse.

The decor was unswervingly traditional, with crown molding, and floral motifs around the bedding and on the curtains, which were thick and housed in a regal pelmet. It definitely felt like a timeless, historic French Quarter room.</p><p>The King-sized bed was slightly raised and came with high-count cotton linens and an overstuffed mattress that resulted in a comfortable night's sleep. The soundproofing on the windows (and in general) was noticeable, and none of the foot or motor traffic from the street or within the hotel itself was audible.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f59d6d5f23d001959518c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Monteleone room view\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The views from the 14th floor were stunning.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Paul Oswell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Additionally, from the 14th floor, the views over the French Quarter were as good as any in the city.</p><p>I also thought that the room matched up to the COVID-19 cleaning <a href=\"https://hotelmonteleone.com/covid-19-update-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">procedures</a> listed online. This included requiring 48 hours between guest stays, which meant the room immediately felt hygienic and appeared to be freshly sanitized. A sheet of paper on the bed summarized the same information given out at reception, with the opening times and procedures for the bar, restaurant, and other amenities.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7cc450282c500018c78f36?format=jpeg\" alt=\"hotel monteleone bathroom\" height=\"1119\" width=\"1492\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>My bathroom was stocked with Gilchrist and Soames toiletries, plus hand sanitizer.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Paul Oswell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>All unnecessary amenities had been stripped out, so there were no paper pads, pens, or extensive minibar or snacks.</p><p>In fact, the only amenities, which were both welcome, were two bottles of complimentary water in the mini-fridge and a small (1.25ml) bottle of hand sanitizer in the bathroom along with the toiletries, which was plenty given the length of my stay. Housekeeping, should I have stayed longer, would only be completed by request, with staff wearing masks.&#160;</p><p>The aforementioned toiletries were by Gilchrist and Soames, which maintained the high-end ambiance. The mixed marble and granite bathroom came stocked with plentiful thick towels and in-room robes.</p><p>Entry-level rooms come with one sink and a bathtub and shower combination. The water pressure and temperature were both pleasingly easy to control.</p>\n\t\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7cc3c294fce90018f7b769?format=jpeg\" alt=\"hotel monteleone desk\" height=\"1119\" width=\"1492\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A small desk is available for additional seating or as a work space.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Paul Oswell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Other in-room features included a Keurig coffee maker, a flat screen TV, and fast complimentary Wi-Fi (with a paid option for even faster streaming). The armchair and in-room art were fairly unremarkable but perfectly acceptable.&#160;</p><p>Fans of more contemporary, sleek interior design would likely feel more comfortable elsewhere, but as an older property with almost a century and a half of history, the style choices were appropriate.</p><p>Although it's not the most modern room in the city, Monteleone's King room retains luxe standards and was well maintained. I did think there was room for modernization in terms of the technology available and the condition of some of the furniture, however.</p><p>I've also stayed in suites here before and can confirm there isn't too much difference in terms of decor levels and amenities. The suites are really only differentiated in that they offer more space. I would consider booking one of the suites only if I was traveling with a small family. For single travelers and couples, Traditional rooms are more than adequate.</p><p>Of course, a special occasion might deserve an upgrade to one of the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fmonteleone.en-gb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Literary Suites</a> with their parlors, wet bars, and period antiques.

To see a room rate well under $200 is a rarity, and if you're comfortable with travel, now presents an optimal time to take advantage of lower rates and occupancy.</p><p>The occupancy rate during my stay seemed quite low, going off what I was able to see, with not many guests checking in or out and no crowds in the public spaces, and so social distancing wasn't an issue. I used the pool and the restaurant without any qualms at all, and the experience was generally very good.</p><p>Booking during COVID-19 gives guests some extra value for money. If you can find a rate close to my $151 per night, then the Hotel Monteleone is a good choice, and offers an opportunity to stay in a genuinely historic property and one of the few family-run hotels of its kind in the country.</p><h2><a

home <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/popular-airbnb-trending-destinations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to recent Airbnb data</a>.</strong></li><li><strong>Private home rentals are a top lodging choice since <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-airbnbs-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they limit encounters with others and promote social distancing</a>. </strong></li><li><strong>California is one of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/popular-airbnb-trending-destinations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the most popular locations for Airbnb rentals</a>, with</strong><strong> spectacular homes near beaches, deserts, wine country, national parks, and urban centers.</strong></li><li><strong>We combed Airbnb listings to select top-reviewed homes with impeccable amenities in cities such as San Diego, Los Angeles, Palm Springs, San Francisco, and others.</strong></li></ul><p>As people begin to return to domestic travel, safety tops many Americans' priority lists, with travelers choosing close-to-home driving trips bound for private home rentals as opposed to boarding a flight to a crowded resort.</p><p>That's because <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-airbnbs-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doctors consider the private residential environment to be low risk</a> for virus transmission, given the fact that the virus is known to transmit primarily between people via respiratory droplets. And when compared with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-hotels-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hotels</a>, the number of face-to-face encounters at a private home rental is especially low.</p><p>Airbnb also recently released data underscoring these travel trends. They showed <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/popular-airbnb-trending-destinations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nearly half of 2,200 adult survey respondents in the US</a> prefer their first post-pandemic trip to be within 200 miles from home.</p><p>However, before you jump into making any travel plans, it's vital to know and consider that without a vaccine there's no guarantee of safety right now. We always recommend following guidelines from the CDC and WHO and taking safety precautions like hand washing and social distancing.</p><p>Additionally, many parts of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hot-dry-conditions-stoke-devastating-california-wildfires-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">California are experiencing extreme wildfires</a> and even places not directly affected by the fires are experiencing low air quality. You can check the daily wildfire update <a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/daily-wildfire-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p>But, for some added peace of mind, Airbnb recently announced they are requiring all <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-new-cleaning-protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hosts to follow stringent new cleaning policies</a>. This includes wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, and, for hosts and their teams, abiding by a&#160;<a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/airbnbs-5-step-cleaning-process-explained-187\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-ml-dynamic=\"true\" data-ml-dynamic-type=\"sl\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/airbnbs-5-step-cleaning-process-explained-187\" data-ml-id=\"5\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1602190412068ace\" data-skimlinks-tracking=\"xid:fr1602190412068ace\" data-uri=\"414b4056421c8f86cf3a364e723471b4\">five-step enhanced cleaning process</a>. Still, some travelers may feel more comfortable taking added precautions like bringing their own sheets and running dishes through the dishwasher before use. Of course, that means you're now cleaning the home for which you likely already paid a hefty cleaning fee.</p><p>With that in mind, if you are planning a future trip to the Golden State, there's plenty of accommodation choices, including beach bungalows, mid-century desert homes, and tiny mountain houses. We rounded up top-rated Airbnbs in cities such as San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco; as well as coastal getaways in Santa Barbara and Big Sur, wine country retreats in Napa Valley and San Louis Obispo, desert homes in Palm Springs and Joshua Tree, and listings near national parks like Yosemite.</p><p>The following properties were all selected based on the following criteria:</p><ol><li><strong>Airbnb listing is for the entire home (no awkward hallway encounters).</strong></li><li><strong>All are highly-rated, well-located Airbnb listings with a rating as close to 5.0 as possible.</strong></li><li><strong>All homes are listed by Superhosts to ensure a positive experience, with exceptional design, charm, and amenities to guarantee a great getaway.&#160;</strong></li><li><strong>Homes offer an affordable price range, starting at $93 for a Yosemite tiny home and rising to $425 for a Big Sur splurge.</strong></li></ol><h2>Looking for more Airbnbs?</h2><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/unique-airbnb-rentals-hudson-valley-beacon-new-york\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">The best Airbnbs in New York's Hudson Valley</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-airbnbs-vermont\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">The best Airbnbs in Vermont</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/affordable-airbnb-cabins-catskills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">The best Airbnb cabins in the Catskills</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-airbnbs-maine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best Airbnbs in Maine</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-airbnbs-florida\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best Airbnbs in Florida</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-airbnbs-connecticut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best Airbnbs in Connecticut</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-airbnbs-with-pools-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best Airbnbs with pools</a></li></ul><h2>These are the best Airbnbs in California, sorted by price from low to high.</h2>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tTiny house in Yosemite, $93\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eea5d562618b933ec0b5b43?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2020 06 16_at_9.00.00_AM\" height=\"928\" width=\"1237\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Airbnb</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h2><a href=\"https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/196318/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Frooms%2F25193769%3Fsource_impression_id%3Dp3_1592417515_CZdQ%252FDGdADbJNBkc%26guests%3D1%26adults%3D1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Book this tiny house starting at $93 per night</a></h2><p>When visiting Yosemite National Park, the goal should be to spend as much time absorbing wide-open nature and the jaw-dropping beauty of famed peaks like Half Dome and El Capitan as possible &#8212; not cooped up in your lodging.</p><p>That's why a tiny house is a perfect complement to such a trip, and this one is located just about 30 minutes from the park entrance.

Bluetooth speakers, a record player with records, and various analog games like horseshoes and Frisbee will help keep you busy while remaining unplugged.</p><p>This home has just a few days left in October and November.</p><p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.95</p><p><strong>COVID-19 cleaning procedures:</strong> This home participates in Airbnb's&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-new-cleaning-protocol\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"18a34ac984b0eaae3b22940000d05d74\">Enhanced Clean program</a>, meaning the host is committed to a rigorous cleaning protocol developed with leading health and hospitality experts.</p>\n\tSecluded retreat in Santa Barbara, $209\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eea5c643f7370262c2b1f54?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2020 06 15_at_3.25.52_PM\" height=\"924\" width=\"1232\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Airbnb</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h2><a href=\"https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/196318/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Frooms%2F2057705%3Fsource_impression_id%3Dp3_1592417179_%252FzhCkN%252FiWfTfGFAs%26guests%3D1%26adults%3D1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Book this secluded Montecito retreat starting at $209 per night</a></h2><p>Take a romantic coastal drive to the Santa Barbara area and settle into this 717-square-foot ultra-posh Montecito retreat.

Microsoft did not comment at the time of publication. Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment.</p><p>Microsoft last month added a key new feature to Game Pass, its Netflix-style subscription service that gives Xbox and PC gamers access to a vast catalogue of games. Now, Game Pass subscribers can stream many of the included titles directly to their Android phones or tablets, no console required.&#160;</p><p>Notable by its absence at the feature's launch was support for Apple's iPhone and iPad. An Apple spokesperson told Business Insider this summer that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8\">doesn't allow for game streaming in apps like Game Pass</a> or Google's Stadia because it is unable to review each game in the services' respective libraries.&#160;</p><p>Spencer, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4887tnMhkfE&#38;feature=youtu.beu.be\">has said publicly he's determined to offer Game Pass to Apple users</a>, told employees the company is exploring getting to iPhone and iPad devices through their browsers.</p><p>Later on Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508706/microsoft-xcloud-ios-web-browser-2021\">the Verge reported that at the same meeting</a>, Spencer said that streaming with Game Pass would come to Windows 10 PCs next year as well.</p><p>A hint as to what that might look like comes from Amazon, which says that it's able to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455343/amazon-luna-apple-app-store-rules-cloud-gaming-streaming-google-nvidia\">bring its forthcoming cloud gaming service Luna to iPhone</a> by offering it as a web app. In an interview with Engadget, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/luna-amazon-cloud-gaming-interview-pwa-apple-173948922.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFSswkpXjwXbCzl0m9fP5xe2H0eTyV_oTeo6bGxyLNX_4abpReIPNcR1PrCI4dPILSAIfyw8SpI800LRL78mw0EgWRQuJh5ILJiBLAyg5jjOhiuZKFhqZLYq7PIMuUpf_e-Pn_EEYPeWRXh6DDB-vZG2kGoijwDeWvSEpg_iTDo0pg_iTDo0\">Luna engineering and technology head George Tsipolitis</a> said that Amazon worked with Apple to make that functionality possible. Google, meanwhile, makes its similar Stadia service available on PCs and Macs via its Chrome web browser, though it too is not available on iPhone or iPad.</p><p>Apple indicated that Game Pass or Stadia would be allowed to offer game streaming services, only if each individual title in the catalog were available in its own discrete app.</p><p>Microsoft indicated that this approach would be a non-starter for Game Pass, which has dozens of games available: \"Unfortunately, we do not have a path to bring our vision of cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to gamers on iOS via the Apple App Store,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in August.</p><p>Apple's decision not to allow services similar to Game Pass on iOS became a topic during the Congressional antitrust subcommittee's investigation into potentially anticompetitive practices by Big Tech companies including Apple.</p><p>Former Apple App Store director Phil Shoemaker, according to a report the subcommittee released this week, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-arcade-xbox-stadia-blocked-gaming-services-iphone-app-store-2020-10\">claimed Apple doesn't allow services like Game Pass because they compete directly</a> with the Apple's own subscription service, Apple Arcade.</p><p>Apple this week announced an event planned for Oct. 13, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-release-date-announced-october-event-2020-10\">where it is expected to unveil its next iPhone</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Got a

probably necessitate expanding the scope of negotiations with Tehran beyond the current deal, leading Iran to adopt <a

deal</a> in a September 13 opinion piece, in which he wrote that returning to the JCPOA could be the start of broader diplomacy between Tehran and Washington.&#160;</li></ul><p><strong>Simply re-entering the JCPOA would be difficult for both Washington and Tehran, as the current US sanctions architecture is now far more complex than it was when the deal was signed in 2015.</strong>&#160;</p><p>Under its \"maximum pressure\" campaign, the Trump administration has aggressively expanded the scope of sanctions in recent years and will continue to do so for as long as it remains in office. According to a September 29 report by Bloomberg, the White House is considering designating Iran's entire financial system subject to sanctions under Executive Order 13902.</p><p>Such a move would effectively blacklist foreign companies from doing business with not only Iranian banks (which are already heavily sanctioned), but all Iranian financial actors, including the networks used for remittances and Iran's hawala system. The overall impact on the Iranian economy, however, would be limited given the already expansive nature of current US sanctions on Iran's banking sector and exports (which are mostly humanitarian and food shipments).</p><ul><li>In April 2019, the United States designated Iran's entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</li><li>In September 2019, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Iran's central bank and sovereign wealth fund under Executive Order 13224 for providing material support to Hezbollah and the IRGC's Quds Force, both of which are designated as terrorist organizations under the same executive order. &#160;</li><li>In October 2019, the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a final rule determining that Iran was a jurisdiction of primary money-laundering concern under Section 311 of the US Patriot Act.</li></ul><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5665cc6784307618008b7fa4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tehran Iran bazar\" height=\"2333\" width=\"3500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A man shops at a store in a bazaar in Tehran, Iran.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"http://pictures.reuters.com/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&#38;VBID=2C0BXZZQLALAL&#38;SMLS=1&#38;RW=1309&#38;RH=850#/SearchResult&#38;VBID=2C0BXZZQLALAL&#38;SMLS=1&#38;RW=1309&#38;RH=850&#38;POPUPPN=8&#38;POPUPIID=2C04080D3300E\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters/Raheb Homavandi</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Iran would demand the reversal of all US sanctions implemented by the Trump administration, including those not specifically included in the JCPOA, <a href=\"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/iran-inching-away-nuclear-deal-what-happens-now-jcpoa-united-states-sanctions-eu\">before returning to full compliance</a>.&#160;</strong></p><p>Even if a future Biden administration lifts sanctions targeting Iran's oil exports, Tehran will want to see Washington's terrorism and money laundering designations of its financial system reversed. After the JCPOA was implemented, Iran still struggled to attract foreign investment in part because of investor hesitance. As long these US designations and subsequent sanctions remain in place, international financial institutions and other foreign investors will continue to avoid doing business with Iran, thus robbing Tehran of the expected financial benefits under the JCPOA.</p><p><strong>Negotiating With Iran: Then And Now</strong></p><p>The administration of former US President Barack Obama pragmatically separated Iran's missile program and its regional proxy strategy from its nuclear enrichment program. This enabled the White House <a href=\"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/history-iran-nuclear-deal\">to reach a deal that addressed its primary concern</a>&#160;— Iran's potential acquisition of a nuclear weapon — in exchange for suspending its most powerful form of leverage, financial sanctions.</p><p>Since then, however, Iran has shown that it is willing to use its missile and drone capabilities to strike commercial targets in Saudi Arabia, which will make it harder for the United States to reach another comprehensive deal with Iran that does not at least partially address its allies' growing concerns with Iran's missile program. That said, Iran's nuclear enrichment program is not nearly as far along as it was five years ago, meaning the United States may now have more room to hold out on demanding concessions beyond Iran's nuclear program itself.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5669f6c872f2c10f0f8b4bbc?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tehran Bazaar\" height=\"2492\" width=\"3500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>People walk through an alley where most shops are closed, in Tehran&#39;s main bazaar, October 13, 2008.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Reuters/Caren Firouz</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Legal hurdles and potential Congressional backlash from Republicans would impede Biden's ability to quickly reverse some of the Trump administration's additional sanctions.</strong>&#160;</p><p>Lifting the Section 311 designation, in particular — which has effectively made the Iranian financial system toxic for foreign investment — would be Tehran's top priority. But in order to remove this designation, a future Biden administration would have to first prove that Iran had sufficiently addressed the money laundering and terrorism financing concerns voiced by both the US government and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).&#160;</p><ul><li>Republicans are unlikely to have the support in Congress to implement legislation that would constrain a Democratic White House from reaching a quick deal with Iran. But their oversight and scrutiny would likely complicate any attempt to remove the current sanctions on Iran's central bank and/or the IRGC.</li><li>In 2016, Iran launched an action plan with the FATF to address the organization's concerns with money laundering and terrorism financing. But the Trump administration's withdrawal from the JCPOA thwarted Iran's ability to make political progress on the plan, which eventually prompted the FATF to reintroduce countermeasures on Tehran in February.&#160;</li><li>The recent election of a more conservative Iranian parliament has also made the passage of legislation needed to address international concerns with Iran's financial system even less likely.</li></ul><p><strong>Any US-Iran deal reached before mid-2022 would probably be narrow in scope, with both sides making some commitments to return to the JCPOA and engage in comprehensive over an extended period of time. </strong></p><p>Such a deal could see Iran agreeing to forgo further stockpiling of enriched uranium and/or reversing expansion plans on centrifuge R&#38;D. A narrow agreement could also see Tehran reducing the number of advanced centrifuges being installed in exchange for modest sanctions relief, which could entail resuming waivers for a specific volume of Iranian oil exports, suspending sanctions related to other Iranian exports and/or full US support for humanitarian-related trade channels.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f4f7ac655f6001969f01d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"iran deal jcpoa sunset provisions\" height=\"2433\" width=\"1280\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/limits-biden-s-proposed-return-diplomacy-iran\" target=\"_blank\">Straftfor</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>A prolonged negotiation period would force the United States to discuss issues with Iran beyond just the current terms of the JCPOA, as many of the deal's sunset provisions expire in 2023 and 2025.&#160;</strong></p><p>Under the JCPOA's original timeline, the United States would have only been okay with sunset provisions that allow for Iran to restart some nuclear activity and the removal of UN sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program if its relationship with Tehran during the following decade drastically improved.</p><p>But Trump's hardline sanctions strategy in recent years has made such an improvement in US-Iran relations all but impossible. Washington would likely also demand that any successor agreement to the JCPOA extends the timeline for sunset clauses that expire in 2023 and 2025 and includes Iranian concessions on its missile program, which Iran has actively used in regional conflicts over the last three years.&#160;</p><p><strong>Such an expansion of negotiations would prompt Iran to adopt a more hardline position with its nuclear program in order to keep Washington focused on Tehran's primary concern of sanctions relief.&#160;</strong></p><p>Iran's nuclear program&#160;<a href=\"https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/iran-may-be-weak-its-strategy-working-us-trump-sanctions-nuclear-jcpoa\">remains its most valuable negotiation tool against the United States</a>. Tehran will thus want to maintain the most critical aspects of the program, such as the right to enrich uranium and holding on to current stockpiles and centrifuges, until the United States agrees to suspend or remove the vast majority of its economic sanctions on Iran.</p><p>Otherwise, Iran would have to offer more significant concessions on its missile program and regional strategy, which are more important to Iran's overall defense strategy, in order to receive significant sanctions relief. Iran hopes to use its nuclear program as a way to narrow any expansion of talks with the United States beyond it. &#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

However, the online-first system ultimately works in your favor because you'll have your entire order history and personal notes all in one place to reference later.&#160;&#160;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/winc-wine-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our full review of Winc here.</a></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Wines are all based on consumer interests and trends, easy-to-navigate interface, many varietals</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Wine info and notes are only online, a la carte stock goes quickly</p>\n\tThe best subscription for sampling\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f4567c655f6001969efd6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Vinebox\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Connie Chen/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&#38;u=1088116&#38;m=66986&#38;urllink=www.getvinebox.com%2Fproducts%2Fq3-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Vinebox</a> packages European wines in sleek and distinctive single-serving glasses so you can try nine different kinds without committing to whole bottles.</h3><p><strong>Subscription frequency:</strong> Every 3 months&#160;</p><p><strong>Shipping fee:</strong> Free&#160;</p><p><strong>A la carte shop:</strong> Yes&#160;</p><p>It's easy to distinguish Vinebox from the pack: you get no less than nine wines, neatly packed into individual glass tubes and accompanied by a well-designed informational booklet, all stored in sturdy yet gift-worthy packaging.&#160;</p><p>Each quarter's box is pre-curated so you can't customize it to your tastes, but you'll have plenty of fun sipping and sampling each wine. The best part is that you won't feel bad opening and finishing a whole \"bottle\" because it's only a single serving. Vinebox's design is great for casual wine drinkers who hate commitment, plus it's convenient and practical because you don't even need a bottle opener or corkscrew to enjoy your drink.&#160;</p><p>If you do happen to fall in love with one of the samples, you can make use of the $15 credit given to you each quarter. This can be used towards a purchase of the full-sized version. You may also want to gift this unique and beautiful box to a friend whose wine preferences are eclectic or unclear &#8212; with so many varietals packed into every shipment, they're bound to enjoy at least one.</p><p>The particular box I received featured all light and medium-bodied wines, which I just so happen to enjoy. But it would've been even better to see some full-bodied wines represented, for additional variety and range.&#160;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vinebox-wine-subscription-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our full review of Vinebox here.</a></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Good sampling size, memorable packaging, useful info cards</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can't always find or buy the full bottle in the shop</p>\n\tThe best subscription for natural wine\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f4878282c500018c7967f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Plonk\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Connie Chen/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>For natural, organic, and biodynamic wines, you can rely on <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&#38;u=1088116&#38;m=32643&#38;urllink=www.plonkwineclub.com%2Fcollections%2Fall-wine-clubs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Plonk</a> to take care of the expert vetting, thoughtful curation, and spot-on food pairing recommendations.</h3><p><strong>Subscription frequency:</strong> Every month</p><p><strong>Shipping fee: </strong>Free</p><p><strong>A la carte shop: </strong>Yes&#160;</p><p>Plonk, which is British derogatory slang for cheap, low-quality wine, provides wines that are anything but. The online club focuses exclusively on natural wines that are grown with organic, biodynamic, and sustainable vineyard practices, meaning they don't contain pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, or commercial additives (like colorants or artificial sugars). There's also an impressive selection of sulfite-free and unfiltered bottles.&#160;</p><p>If you're interested in the specific distinctions among the terms \"natural,\" \"organic,\" and \"biodynamic,\" founder Etty Klein breaks them down <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/natural-vs-commercial-wine_b_1009052\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p><p>Plonk prides itself on selecting and importing wines from small, boutique winemakers and lesser-known wine regions, flouting big industry names to give you a carefully vetted selection. While other online wine subscriptions may offer natural and sustainable options, few can boast both the convenience and range of Plonk's one-stop natural shop.&#160;</p><p>When you sign up, you have your choice of an all-red, all-white, or mixed variety box, with either four or 12 bottles per shipment. What the included informational printout lacks in glitzy presentation, at least compared to other services, it makes up for in precise tasting notes and ultra-specific food pairings courtesy of Food52. For example, one of my favorite Plonk discoveries, a 2019 Pinot Noir from Margaret River, Western Australia, should be enjoyed with stuffed peppers with lamb, orzo, and halloumi cheese.&#160;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Only natural wine offerings, pre-curated, easy to skip shipments or cancel your subscription&#160;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, cannot be personalized</p>\n\tThe best subscription for value\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f49ecc655f6001969eff8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Firstleaf\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Connie Chen/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>You'll never have to pay more than $15 a bottle at <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.firstleaf.club/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Firstleaf</a>, where the quality and personalization are top-notch.</h3><p><strong>Subscription frequency: </strong>Every one, two, or three months&#160;</p><p><strong>Shipping fee: </strong>$9.95&#160;</p><p><strong>A la carte shop: </strong>Yes&#160;</p><p>Like Winc, Firstleaf has you start out with a quiz so it can better understand your preferences.&#160; When you're finished, it serves up six wines it thinks you'll like, and you can read about each one and decide whether you want to make any swaps. However, you only have six swaps per shipment. So, Firstleaf is that nice \"Goldilocks\" service where you have a bit of control, but you're still steered in the right direction.&#160;</p><p>To draw you in, Firstleaf has a very competitive introductory offer of $39.95 for six wines, including shipping. Afterward, the price goes up to $80, plus $9.95 shipping, but you're still only paying $15 for each bottle, many of which are industry award winners.</p><p>After you've tried every wine in your monthly shipment, you can rate them online. This step is important because Firstleaf will use your ratings to become smarter and hone in on an even better curation for you next month. As your wine knowledge and tastes evolve, so too will the service.&#160;</p><p>I've had the chance to try Firstleaf a few times in the last couple of years, and it's always been reliable. I appreciate that I don't have to do quite so much work in picking out the bottles and that the main effort only comes afterward, once I've tried everything.&#160;</p><p>On top of the existing value of the service, there's a strong referral program: if you share Firstleaf with a friend, they'll get $40 and you'll get $40.&#160;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/firstleaf-wine-club-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our full review of Firstleaf here.</a>&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Flexibility to swap out pre-selected bottles in your order, attractive intro offer, good overall value</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>May take a few boxes/rounds of ratings for the system to understand more specific preferences</p>\n\tThe best subscription curation\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f4b4cc655f6001969f002?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Parcelle\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Connie Chen/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://parcellewine.com/products/parcelle-wine-drop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parcelle Wine Drop</a> combines a truly unique selection of bottles with an informative yet unpretentious wine education from Michelin-starred sommeliers.</h3><p><strong>Subscription frequency: </strong>Every month</p><p><strong>Shipping fee: </strong>Free</p><p><strong>A la carte shop: </strong>Yes</p><p>I love Parcelle's Wine Drop because it has the feel of a cool and exclusive local club but it ships nationwide. Parcelle is based in New York City and enlists the curation and expertise of Michelin-starred sommeliers like the former wine directors of Eleven Madison Park and Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare.&#160;</p><p>The experience indeed feels like you're asking for wine recs at a restaurant. It's arguably even better because your three wines also come with beautifully illustrated info cards and a copy of Parcelle Press, a mini journal that is, again, visually stunning.&#160;</p><p>Founder Grant Reynolds told Insider Reviews, \"The Wine Drop is our shortlist of our favorite wines to have around the house at that time of year. Nothing too fancy but always smart, a bit different, and from small producers focusing on making wines unique to the place they are from.\"</p><p>If you prefer more customization, you'll probably enjoy one of our other picks more, but if you want to leave it up to the pros, try Wine Drop. All three wines I received were hits, and they helped me realize a new love for orange wine.&#160;</p><p>Depending on the wine, the total cost of the individual bottles could come out to less than $95. The Wine Drop I received during September, for example, was $85. In other months, the total may be more. While fluctuating prices may be a dealbreaker for some, I found Wine Drop's tight curation and immersive experience to be compelling enough reasons to continue my subscription.&#160;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Pre-curated, unique variety, beautiful info cards, impressive expertise</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not personalized, could buy the bottles individually for less</p>\n\tWhat else we considered\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f4bf9282c500018c79698?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Verve Wine\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Verve Wine</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fusualwines.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Usual Wines</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Usual Wines' single-serving beaker bottles are certainly eye-catching and memorable. However, the company only offers its subscriptions in red, ros&#233;, and brut, and these wines don't change month-to-month. On the plus side, its wines contain no added sugars or sulfites, and the grapes come from sustainable farms. If you're looking for a straightforward subscription you don't really have to think about, Usual Wines is a good candidate.

Make sure you stick your nose in the glass and really smell the wine. When you drink it, coat your entire palate. After you swallow, think about how long the flavors and textures linger in your mouth.\"&#160;</p><p>The sommelier and wine writer also recommended starting a tasting group with your friends or family. \"Pick a theme and have everyone bring a bottle within that theme.

Each person should bring their bottle wrapped so you can't see the label (don't forget to take the neck foil off, that one is an easy giveaway!), and put the wines out for everyone to taste and guess which wine is which.

href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1314279438398431232\">set to host the town hall</a> in Philadelphia, with George Stephanopoulos as the moderator.</p><p>\"Joe Biden was prepared to accept the CPD's proposal for a virtual Town Hall, but the President has refused, as Donald Trump clearly does not want to face questions from the voters about his failures on COVID and the economy,\" the Biden campaign <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edokeefe/status/1314229045865873416\">said in a statement</a>.\" As a result, Joe Biden will find an appropriate place to take questions from voters directly on October 15th, as he has done on several occasions in recent weeks.\"</p><p>Biden's campaign expressed hope that the commission would move the town hall to October 22 so that President Donald Trump \"is not able to evade accountability.\"</p><p>\"The voters should have a chance to ask questions of both candidates, directly. Every presidential candidate since 1992 has participated in such an event, and it would be a shame if Donald Trump was the first to refuse,\" the statement added.</p><p>The Commission on Presidential Debates had announced earlier Thursday that the next debate would be virtual \"to protect the health and safety of all involved.\" Trump, who is still being treated for COVID-19, backed out.</p><p>\"I'm not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That's not what debating's all about,\" Trump <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-covid-status-rambling-fox-business-interview-bartiromo-2020-10\">said in an interview</a> with Fox Business Network on Thursday morning. \"You sit behind a computer and do a debate — it's ridiculous.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Aaron Rupar  (@atrupar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1314174756430774273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>The Trump campaign said the president would instead hold a rally.</p><p>The president has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-first-debate-strategy-wasted-time-biden-2020-9\">trailed Biden</a> by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/polling-suggests-trump-chances-of-defeating-biden-rapidly-dwindling-2020-10\">significant margins</a> in national polls and in recent polling in battleground states. The decision to opt out of a virtual debate denies Trump exposure to millions of voters with Election Day just weeks away.</p><p>After Biden's announcement on Thursday, the president's campaign also called for the debate to be moved back to October 22 and for the third debate, originally scheduled for October 22, to be moved back a week, to October 29.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KellyO/status/1314241133791391745\">a statement</a>, Trump's campaign manager, Bill Stepien, baselessly accused the commission of attempting to give Biden an advantage via a virtual debate.</p><p>\"As President Trump said, a virtual debate is a non-starter and would clearly be a gift to Biden,\" Stepien said.</p><p>Polls found that Biden <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-debate-poll/\">got much higher marks than Trump</a> for his performance in the first debate, on September 29, two days before the president was diagnosed with COVID-19.</p><p>Later Thursday, the Biden campaign pushed back on the Trump campaign's suggestion to reschedule both debates.</p><p>\"Trump's erratic behavior does not allow him to rewrite the calendar, and pick new dates of his choosing,\" Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1314252287242579971?s=20\">said in a

We're hot, sweaty, tired, and, though we're not exactly sure, we think we're beginning to feel the onset of shin splints.</p><p>But the right activewear gear makes all the difference. It inhibits nuisances like chafing, wet spots, heat-trapping, blisters, and sometimes injuries. At a baseline, it reduces the number of unnecessary challenges so we can focus on the task at hand. Ideally, it helps us push ourselves a little further, and perform a little better. But, in general, it should simply make the act of moving a more enjoyable experience.</p><p>Below, we've ranked the best workout brands to shop based on Insider Reviews' own testing. Each one excels in gear that's functional, stylish, and performs well.

Its packaging is 100% recyclable, its compression leggings are made of 79% recycled polyester from 25 post-consumer water bottles, and its Cupro tees are made from 100% cupro, a fiber made from the waste of the cotton industry. And, while cupro saves a reported 682 gallons of water compared to cotton, the company also pledged to donate 10% of its net profits to Charity Water to offset any water usage that may occur during production.</p><p>However, slow fashion that's also in high demand can lead to stock outages, and Girlfriend Collective doesn't always have what we want available.

part of a series focused on millennial financial empowerment called <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/master-your-money\">Master your Money</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Mike Damazo joined the Navy at 18, but he knew he wanted to own real estate even earlier.</p><p>Growing up in New Jersey, Damazo remembers watching his uncles flip homes for a profit and his mother's and stepfather's desire to buy a house of their own. But when a family member was deported to the Philippines, they moved back there too.</p><p>\"I just remember that family home being kind of taken away from me,\" Damazo, a 35-year-old petty officer stationed in Japan, told Business Insider. \"It was so nice the house in Jersey, and that was the motivation for me to be like, 'OK, I am going to own property, and I'm going to be able to take care of my mom.'\"</p><h2><strong>Years of overspending pushed real estate out of reach</strong></h2><p>It wasn't easy, Damazo realized. Stationed in San Diego for the Navy, he found himself \"spending lavishly to keep up with the Joneses,\" he said. He racked up tens of thousands of dollars in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt\">credit card</a>, auto, and personal-loan debt.</p><p>\"I feel like it was a total of 10 years of my life, just thinking I had enough money, but really it was just living paycheck to paycheck,\" Damazo said.</p><p>A turning point came when Damazo was on deployment and attended a finance class offered by the military. A high-ranking official he looked up to said they were in a lot worse shape than he was financially. That motivated him to become debt-free.</p><p>But shortly after Damazo was pulled over for driving under the influence, a misdemeanor in San Diego. In 2013 he was sent to a new duty station, in Lamoore, California, a rural town outside Fresno. It was a setback, he said, but coincidentally it helped him fast-track his real-estate dreams.</p><p>\"When I got there, I didn't lose any rank, but I took a deep pay cut just because the cost of living in Fresno was way cheaper than San Diego,\" Damazo said. \"I had to really buckle down and get into the nitty-gritty of my finances.\"</p><h2><strong>House-hacking, with leverage</strong></h2><p>In Lamoore, Damazo rented a single room for $500, took on a second job as a sushi chef, and worked hard to pay off more of his debt. Within a year he bought his first property.</p><p>\"I was looking at the housing market and I noticed houses that were 1,300 square feet and cheaper than in San Diego,\" he said. After years of yearning to buy a property in the more expensive coastal market but unable to afford it, the time was finally right in Lemoore.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f621c7257b7da001ee11eb2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mike Damazo Fresno\" height=\"1536\" width=\"2048\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Mike Damazo at his rental property in Lemoore, California.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mike Damazo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The house, a foreclosure, cost $165,000. He took out a <a href=\"https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do\">USDA loan</a>, available to eligible homebuyers in mostly rural areas, and bought the three-bedroom house with nothing down.&#160;</p><p>The mortgage was $1,100 a month, but Damazo had a plan to cover it, and turn a profit. He rented out the two biggest rooms to fellow service members, for a total of $900 a month, and lived in the smallest room himself.</p><p>In the real-estate investment world it's called <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/own-my-home-not-house-hacking-live-for-free\">house-hacking</a>, whereby the owner of a single-family home or multi-unit building lives in the smallest and usually cheapest room or unit, and collects rent from the others.</p><p>Damazo was also collecting from the military. He was getting a basic allowance for housing, known as BAH, of about $900 a month added to his paycheck. The amount is tied to a person's rank, marriage and dependency status, and pay, and is based on local rental market prices.</p><p>Damazo needed to put only $400 toward housing costs, $200 to cover the remaining balance on the mortgage, and $200 into a cash reserve for home maintenance. The rest was his to keep.</p><h2><strong>Building home equity in San Diego</strong></h2><p>Two years later, Damazo got orders from the Navy to return to San Diego. He transitioned the Lemoore property into a full rental and hired a property manager. He pays them 8% of the total rental income — now $1,450 a month — to handle landlording duties and keep an eye out for other real-estate investment deals in the area. Damazo said he pockets about $200 a month after expenses.</p><p>Within six months of moving back to San Diego, he was snatching up more real estate. This time he used a Veterans Affairs loan, which allows eligible active-duty service members to buy with no down payment and no <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-private-mortgage-insurance-definition-cost\">mortgage insurance</a>, and lock in a lower interest rate. Damazo purchased a $350,000 townhouse with nothing down in La Jolla, a tony beach community.</p><p>He and his wife, Grace, lived in the one-bedroom home instead of renting it out, but his housing allowance had been bumped up to $3,000 a month after returning to San Diego. That left him with yet another surplus after paying his monthly mortgage and homeowners' association totaling $2,050.</p><p>Damazo put the townhouse up for sale this summer, when he relocated to Japan. He's hoping to make a profit so he can parlay his earnings into a new investment property, he said, possibly in Texas, where real estate is cheaper.</p><p>For now he's hanging on to the rental property in Lemoore, armed with an exit plan to sell if his costs exceed income generated from tenants.</p><h2><strong>It's just the beginning</strong></h2><p>\"The goal is eight properties, passive income, and just being able to keep it up,\" said Damazo, who runs a YouTube channel called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnJxw7QrJMG9vNAaci8qM-A/videos\">Fitness Wealth</a>,\" where he talks about his own journey to building wealth, shares personal-finance advice, and interviews experts.</p><p>His advice to fellow service members looking to get into real-estate investment is to take advantage of the monthly housing allowance from the military by living below their means.&#160;</p><p>For those who don't have military perks available but are interested in real-estate investing, be patient, he said.</p><p>\"Patience is the biggest thing for someone just starting off,\" Damazo said. \"It's easy to kind of watch and read other people's stories of being so much more of a success in real estate, but just remember that this is your story and you're in your lane. Just take it slow and look for the right deal. And always have an exit strategy, no matter what.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

democracy as we know it.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Actor Sacha Baron Cohen in an <a href=\"https://time.com/5897501/conspiracy-theory-misinformation/\">op-ed for Time Magazine</a> called for an end to the proliferation of conspiracy theories on social media platforms — and the actor zeroed in on Facebook specifically.</p><p>The actor slammed the company for the role it has played in misinformation spreading online, calling out Facebook's algorithm that is designed to promote content that more people find interesting. Cohen also called Facebook out for its refusal to fact-check political ads and remove misleading posts.</p><p>The actor pointed out that conspiracy theories are more easily spread during times of uncertainty.</p><p>\"Donald Trump — who averages <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/13/president-trump-has-made-more-than-20000-false-or-misleading-claims/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">23 lies a day</a> and is the world's greatest superspreader of coronavirus conspiracies —has caught the virus himself. He has a dutiful ally in Facebook — the greatest propaganda machine in history. And this is a time when Americans are especially vulnerable to lies and conspiracies. This trifecta has created a whirlwind of conspiratorial madness,\" Cohen wrote in the op-ed.</p><p>Cohen's damning remarks come as the 2020 presidential election looms just weeks away and as social media sites continue to grapple with policing disinformation on their platforms. Facebook has been in the spotlight specifically for giving QAnon networks a platform. The baseless far-right conspiracy theory spouts the claim that President Trump is secretly fighting a \"deep state\" group of human traffickers. Its scores of supporters found a home on Facebook up until Tuesday when the company said it was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/qanon-banned-from-facebook-dealing-massive-blow-to-conspiracy-group-2020-10\">banning QAnon from its platform.</a>&#160;</p><p>This isn't the first time Cohen has come out as a staunch opponent of Facebook. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sacha-baron-cohen-adl-speech-mark-zuckerberg-silicon-valley-2019-11\">The actor slammed the company</a> — and other Silicon Valley giants — in late 2019 for what he says is the firm's failure to stop the spread of lies and hate speech.</p><p>In January of this year, the actor attacked Zuckerberg in a Twitter post, calling the CEO out for a series of political ads the firm allowed to run on the site that a Guardian investigation found to be riddled with disinformation. \"Mark Zuckerberg, history will judge you harshly — if we still have historians after you help destroy democracy,\" Cohen wrote in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SachaBaronCohen/status/1222571095905243137\">tweet.</a></p><p>Zuckerberg said he does not wish Facebook to be an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-twitter-facebook-no-fact-check-mark-zuckerberg-fox-news-2020-5\">\"arbiter of truth\"</a>&#160;after Twitter opted to attach a warning label to a tweet posted by President Donald Trump in which he falsely stated that \"there is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent.\"</p><p>Facebook's reputation has been tarnished since its handling of user data came to light in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, as well as its involvement in the 2016 presidential election. The social media firm has rolled out a series of moves leading up to this year's election in an effort to stunt the spread of misinformation on the platform.</p><p>In September, Zuckerberg said Facebook would start&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-will-label-trump-early-victory-official-election-results-2020-9\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"13d692d0e66cd09b36f8d33312d1e52c\">labeling posts from candidates</a> that declare victory before the official results can be counted. With the influx of mail-in ballots, it's possible that the nation will not know the election results until after November 3. Facebook also announced it <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-removing-posts-with-content-that-seeks-to-intimidate-voters-2020-10\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"57607c6a178224105806300c92366747\">would attach a label</a>&#160;to content that touches on the \"legitimacy of voting methods, for example, by claiming that lawful methods of voting will lead to fraud.\" President Donald Trump has peddled claims that mail-in voting will lead to election fraud.</p><p>The social media firm has also announced that it would&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-says-it-will-ban-all-political-ads-after-election-2020-10\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\"

dining in at food and beverage outlets, subjected to safe distancing.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>After a phased re-opening, Singapore is cautiously returning to the \"new normal,\" but the impact of the pandemic is still being felt throughout the economy.</li>\n<li>The pandemic has reiterated the need for businesses and individuals to be digitally ready.&#160;</li>\n<li>This article is part of a series called&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/resilient-singapore\" data-analytics-module=\"summary_bullets\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\">Resilient Singapore</a>, which focuses on Singapore's resilient and sustainable growth in the post-pandemic world.</li>\n</ul><p>The annual Singapore Food Festival, a array of local culinary experiences and events, is usually a pitstop for foodies in the city-state. But its 27th edition this year was markedly different as it moved entirely online, with virtual masterclasses and ingredient kits sent to the homes of participants instead.&#160;</p><p>After a three-month \"circuit-breaker\" from April to June — a soft lockdown imposed by the Singaporean government — the country is still in phase two of its re-opening, where most retail, food and beverage, and sports facilities can operate. However, large-scale gatherings and entertainment venues, like the annual food festival, did not receive the green light, requiring organizers to quickly adapt to a new reality.</p><h2><strong>An uncertain global and local outlook weigh on the labor market</strong></h2><p>While the circuit breaker did its job to control community spread, it led to a sharp contraction of the Singaporean economy by 13.2% on a year-on-year basis in the second quarter. The economic situation was worsened by a weak external demand amidst a global economic downturn.</p><p>The virtual food festival was just one of the many initiatives by Singapore's tourism authorities to revive a sluggish lifestyle and tourism sector, which has been badly hit by the pandemic.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7dd68f94fce90018f7b9db?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Resilient Singapore GDP Graphic\" height=\"681\" width=\"827\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Economic Survey of Singapore, Second Quarter 2020\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Resources/Economic-Survey-of-Singapore/2020/Economic-Survey-of-Singapore-Second-Quarter-2020/FullReport_2Q20.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Among the worst-performing sectors are construction, transportation, accommodation, and food and beverage. Some firms have had to hand out pay cuts, while others were left with no choice but to let workers go. All this contributed to Singapore's overall unemployment rate of 2.9%, the highest in more than a decade.</p><p>Government support for affected industries and individuals has been swift with <a href=\"https://www.gov.sg/article/more-support-for-workers-and-jobs-through-the-jobs-support-scheme-and-covid-19-support-grant\">close to SG$100 billion</a> dedicated in a bid to equally protect vulnerable jobs and workers, as well as boost growth in high-performing sectors. Officials assess that the budgets are estimated to<a href=\"https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Resources/Economic-Survey-of-Singapore/2020/Economic-Survey-of-Singapore-Second-Quarter-2020/FA_2Q20.pdf\"> avert a loss in real GDP of about 5.5% in 2020</a> and reduce the rise in the resident unemployment rate by 1.7 percentage points.</p><p>Even with generous government support, experts warned that businesses must also do their part to stay resilient. They should thoroughly assess their own \"developmental potential, taking into account the industry and sector that they are in, and whether the business itself has strong fundamentals,\" <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/many-small-medium-enterprises-here-still-struggling-to-survive\">Mr Kurt Wee</a>, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises, said. \"Once this has been established, businesses can then consider how they can diversify and grow their revenue streams amid COVID-19.\"</p><h2><strong>Future-proofing Singapore's businesses</strong></h2><p>Shifts in consumer behavior brought about by the pandemic accelerated adoption of technologies as people and businesses adapted to new habits. Kian Bin Teo, chief financial officer of Thunes, a global cross-border payments network headquartered in Singapore, echoed the push.</p><p>\"We see many clients, partners, accelerating their interest to work with us, because of the urgency to go digital,\" he said.</p><p>The company connects financial institutions, technology companies, money transfer operators, and banks, to enable seamless cross-border payments. It reported an <a href=\"https://www.thunes.com/2020/08/17/strong-transaction-volumes-and-partner-expansion-drive-global-payment-network-thunes-q2-2020-growth/\">80% increase in transaction volumes</a> for the second quarter, noting a clear shift toward mobile wallets — a trend accelerated by the push towards digital payments because of the pandemic.</p><p>\"This trend will put us in a very good state for the long-term. It validates that we're on the right path,\" Teo said.</p><p>Others, who were not intrinsically digital, seized the opportunity to innovate. Sin Mui Heng (SMH) Food Industries, which makes chilled and frozen dim sum, were met with operational and supply chain challenges at the start of the pandemic. With hotels and restaurants drastically cutting down their wholesale orders, SMH focused on attracting direct consumers.</p><p>\"We dished out whatever we could in the shortest time. These included direct factory sales, work-from-home dim sum packages, marketing to consumers via Facebook, Instagram; and we got ourselves listed on more online stores,\" <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/surviving-supply-chain-shocks-caused-by-covid-19-pandemic\">SMH's Director of Operations Johnson Tay and Director of Business Development Evan Tay</a> told The Straits Times.</p><p>The key to businesses' survival was how quickly business leaders were willing to adapt to a culture of innovation. \"Organizations across Singapore realized how much their ability to innovate fuels their performance and business resilience during the crisis. They were also forced to innovate and accelerate transformation in response to the challenges and new market conditions,\" Sandra Ng of IDC Asia Pacific said in <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/en-sg/2020/09/10/culture-of-innovation/\">a recent study</a> released by Microsoft.</p><p>The global trend of protectionism has not gone unnoticed, and being an open economy, Singapore could be adversely affected by it. The pandemic has no doubt prompted countries to \"look inwards,\" S. Iswaran, Singapore's Minister for Communications and Information said. \"[But] we believe that a more effective way to build resilience is through openness and greater diversification.\"</p><p>He points to the country's network of Free Trade Agreements and digital economy agreements which will facilitate businesses to connect seamlessly with overseas partners. In addition, enterprises in Singapore are given financial incentives to embark on digital transformation, not just to overcome the immediate challenges from the pandemic, but also to reap long-term economic benefits.</p><h2><strong>A resilient outlook, built on a strong foundation&#160;</strong></h2><p>Even as the pandemic lingers, the city-state's strong position as a financial and investment hub and its ability to weather shocks puts it in good stead for recovery. It has continued to attract investment — SG$3.3 billion in capital over the first half of 2020 — bringing total funding this year on track to rival the SG$6.5 billion raised the year before.</p><p>Fundraising rounds from tech startups led the pack, with Grab raising its latest Series I round of SG$1.2 billion in February, and logistics startup Ninja Van's SG$390 million in April, <a href=\"https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/singapores-tech-investments-on-track-to-rival-the-s65b-raised-in-2019-pwc\">as noted in a PwC report</a>.</p><p>Notably, robust leadership and swift government responses to transform the economy will go a long way in ensuring the country's continuity. But the most important factor will be in Singapore's forward-looking mindset. Being a small country surrounded by bigger neighbors, it is in the country's DNA to constantly prove and re-invent itself.</p><p>No investment in nurturing, enriching, and advancing its citizens is considered too hefty — helping to continually maintain a competitive edge and keep its place among global leaders.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-singapore-forges-ahead-during-a-pandemic-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mm8E51qIf_I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 20:04:54 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f7f53d9282c500018c796c5?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"751c55561330632bfc736617ebe3b9f0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn27@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-32-46-730_2a4fb6a9e9685bae.webp","destWidth":910,"destHeight":683,"sourceBytes":77296,"destBytes":77296,"author":"insider@insider.com (Fariza Salleh)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f3d933742f43f001ddfdeac?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn49@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-27-038_226c0b9f1ed12d67.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f7f53d9282c500018c796c5?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn27@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-32-46-730_2a4fb6a9e9685bae.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f7dd68f94fce90018f7b9db?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-32-985_dccaabf0ab90f6c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn17@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-34-423_e05a704acddc6e42.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn65@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-31-252_c7b6995af57816bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn41@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-30-246_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mm8E51qIf_I:UBteqte0C-s:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn45@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-28-294_95d2cf7af58cedb5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mm8E51qIf_I":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214360919},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:40","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:40","title":"Fly larvae eat food waste and can be turned into animal feed — and it's a trend that's catching on around the world","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/insectipro-kenya-nairobi-food-waste-fly-larvae-2020-10","description":"<div style=\"position:relative;

I've been using it in my own home for a while, and in my experience, it is worth the $600 price tag — here's why.</p><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>Unlike conventional robovacs, Neato's are all D-shaped, including the D7. This helps with cleaning corners better than others in my opinion and just looks really unique and interesting.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MPFN55/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_040419_neato-robotics-connected-vacuum-product-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078MPFN55&linkId=840e80adc4a081866f6dfb3414892b07c4a081866f6dfb3414892b07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The D7</a> measures 12.5 inches by 13 inches by 4 inches. The four-inch height is higher than most robo vacs, which means it might have a harder time getting under low-clearance furniture, but wasn't an issue in my experience.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Specs</strong></h2><ul><li>13.21 inch x 12.56 inch x 3.92 inch</li><li>7.5 lbs</li><li>0.7 liters dustbin capacity</li><li>High capacity lithium ion battery with up to 120 minutes and up to 150 minutes charge time</li><li>Quick boost charging</li><li>Battery recharge and resume (up to 2 times)</li></ul><h2><strong>Set-up process</strong></h2><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"592849e2b74af4481b8b464b\" data-title=\"The best robot vacuums\" data-url=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-robot-vacuum\" data-thumbnail=\"https://i.insider.com/5f1765d43f737009b9250a45\" data-shortcode-display-text=\"Related Article Module: The best robot vacuums\">&#160;</bi-shortcode><p>The instructions are easy to understand so set up only took about half an hour, most of which was spent trying to find the wireless connection after setting up the dock and downloading the Neato app. I just had to go through the connection process a few times before it actually connected. I finished by upgrading the firmware and then charged the vac for an hour and a half before taking it for a spin.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Review of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MPFN55/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_040419_neato-robotics-connected-vacuum-product-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078MPFN55&linkId=840e80adc4a081866f6dfb3414892b07c4a081866f6dfb3414892b07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Neato D7</a></strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MPFN55/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_040419_neato-robotics-connected-vacuum-product-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078MPFN55&linkId=840e80adc4a081866f6dfb3414892b07c4a081866f6dfb3414892b07\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"It cleaned over my carpet and hardwood floors without any major problems.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\"><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ca60c4a16c9584b6f5e833d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Neato D7 3\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>It cleaned over my carpet and hardwood floors without any major problems.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></a></p><p>If I'm going to use a robovac, I don't want to monitor it as it goes around my house.

You can also save up to three maps so you can conceivably use this vacuum to clean three floors, should you be so lucky to have that much space.</p><p>The vacuum also comes with three ultra-performance filters designed to pick up 99% of allergens and dust mites. And, you can choose between eco and turbo cleaning modes; with turbo mode, the D7 uses maximum suction to pick up debris as small as 10 microns. Cleaning&#160;the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MPFN55/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_040419_neato-robotics-connected-vacuum-product-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078MPFN55&linkId=840e80adc4a081866f6dfb3414892b07c4a081866f6dfb3414892b07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Neato D7</a> is relatively easy, which I appreciate since I use the vac daily. After each cycle, you remove the dustbin from the top of the vac and tap out as much gunk from the filter as you can, or use the attached cleaning tool to cut out hairs and fibers off the brush. The filter has a screen over it so you can't really use the cleaning tool to brush out the debris.</p><p>To test how well <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MPFN55/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_040419_neato-robotics-connected-vacuum-product-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078MPFN55&linkId=840e80adc4a081866f6dfb3414892b07c4a081866f6dfb3414892b07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the D7</a> actually cleans up, I put a few tablespoons each of all-purpose flour, coffee grounds, and kitty litter on my carpet and hardwood floor and let the D7 do a cleaning cycle. On both the carpet and hardwood, the vacuum removed all of the coffee grounds and kitty litter without a trace leftover.</p><p>The flour was a bit trickier, which seems to be the norm for robotic vacuums. On the carpet, it removed about 90% of the flour; on the hardwood, it was closer to 75%. I also sprinkled flour in corners of different rooms and though the vac didn't get everything, it came within a quarter of an inch of the corners, which is better than any of the other robotic vacuums I've tested.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MPFN55/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_040419_neato-robotics-connected-vacuum-product-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078MPFN55&linkId=840e80adc4a081866f6dfb3414892b07c4a081866f6dfb3414892b07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The D7</a> also does a great job with pet hair, which I didn't have to purposely set out because we have two cats who get the job done just fine. When I run the vacuum on its regular schedule, I didn't notice any cat hair left on the floor.</p><p>As far as noise levels go, this is also the quietest robotic vacuum I've ever tested. My sound meter measured it at 66 decibels from a foot away, which is just slightly louder than a normal conversation from three feet away.&#160;</p><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"5a522912c32ae6751a8b4b8b\" data-title=\"This new robot vacuum is one of the best investments you can make to save time this year\" data-url=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/eufy-robovac-11-plus-robot-vacuum-review-2018-1\" data-thumbnail=\"https://i.insider.com/5a539d783225deb4198b4d37\" data-shortcode-display-text=\"Related Article Module: This new robot vacuum is one of the best investments you can make to save time this year\">&#160;</bi-shortcode><p>The \"Connected\" part of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MPFN55/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_040419_neato-robotics-connected-vacuum-product-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078MPFN55&linkId=840e80adc4a081866f6dfb3414892b07c4a081866f6dfb3414892b07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">D7's</a> name comes from its smart capabilities. You can control the vacuum using the Neato app, Google Home and Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple Watch, and Samsung SmartThings.

But I probably shouldn't lay all of the blame on the Neato. Between having a five-year-old and just not putting much emphasis on tidiness, I gave the vacuum plenty of obstacles to conquer and it definitely had the most trouble with small toys that were left out.</p><p>Overall, the app is useful. It tells you when your Neato is stuck and when to empty the dustbin, and you can easily buy replacement parts and access maintenance tutorials. At the same time though, I wasn't incredibly impressed. Many times when I wanted <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MPFN55/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_040419_neato-robotics-connected-vacuum-product-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078MPFN55&linkId=840e80adc4a081866f6dfb3414892b07c4a081866f6dfb3414892b07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the D7</a> to dock or start cleaning, I would have to wait a few minutes for it to connect. I also couldn't get the zone cleaning to operate correctly because the device may have had trouble accurately mapping our constantly changing decor or the obstacle course made up of toys strewn everywhere.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Like I mentioned earlier, it's also <em>really</em> expensive.</p><h2><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p>Overall, I'm happy with how the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MPFN55/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_040419_neato-robotics-connected-vacuum-product-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078MPFN55&linkId=840e80adc4a081866f6dfb3414892b07c4a081866f6dfb3414892b07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Neato Robotics D7 Connected Robot Vacuum</a> performed.

In February, Flywheel — which filed for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flywheel-sports-filing-for-bankruptcy-and-closing-all-studios-2020-9\">Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September</a> — announced that it would permanently shutter all studios and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flywheel-at-home-shuts-down-trade-in-bike-free-peloton-2020-2\">rescinded its at-home bike and membership service</a> after Peloton sued the company for patent infringement, specifically copying its proprietary design and technology. Meanwhile, companies <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/virtual-fitness-streaming-subscriptions-exercise-program-peloton-pandemic-2020-9#ob-6\">ranging from tech giants like Apple</a> to emerging fitness brands like Obé have launched competitor membership programs this year.&#160;</p><p>Now, SoulCycle will also take a stab at capturing a piece of the increasingly lucrative at-home fitness market. And while <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/style/soulcycle-peloton-home-exercise-bikes-coronavirus.html\">some experts have previously anticipated</a> the company will continue to face an uphill battle against Peloton, particularly coming to market so late in the pandemic, others say the company's rabid following may help it carve a niche.&#160;</p><p>\"There is a cult following with SoulCycle, so I think they will be very successful in bringing people over to their new system,\" Claude Zdanow, founder and CEO of marketing agency holding company Stadiumred Group, told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>SoulCycle's national rollout also comes on the heels of Peloton announcing a cheaper version of its wildly popular stationary bicycle in September, part of a push from founder and CEO John Foley to democratize the brand and reach new consumers.</p><p>\"Our goal is to be the go-to at-home fitness solution for as many people as possible,\" John Foley, Peloton CEO and co-founder,

Pro.</li>\n<li>Spatial audio gives the AirPods Pro a surround sound effect, making audio feel more open and immersive.</li>\n<li>The AirPods Pro can track your head movements, making it possible to

Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Apple's iOS 14 update didn't just bring improvements to the iPhone — it's introduced a couple of new features for AirPods as well.</p><p>Most notably, AirPods Pro owners will now be able to take advantage of a new feature called spatial audio. As its name implies, spatial audio creates an effect that makes it feel like the sound is coming from a surround sound speaker rather than from your AirPods. The result is a more immersive sound that adjusts automatically as you move your head or your iPhone, making it almost feel like you're in a movie theater.</p><p>The addition shows that Apple is investing in new features for AirPods beyond hardware-based upgrades, which can hopefully make Apple's wireless earbuds continue to feel new and fresh even after years of use. It also shows how audio technology is becoming <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-over-ear-headphones-launch-soon-sonos-bose-disappear-store-2020-10\">a more important part of Apple's core product lineup</a> as it's rumored to be working on a cheaper new HomePod speaker and its first pair of over-ear premium headphones.</p><p>I tried out the AirPods Pro's spatial audio when watching \"The Mandalorian\" on Disney Plus and \"See\" on Apple TV Plus, and found that it provided a much more open sound. With the content playing on my phone, which was placed to my right on my couch, it sounded like the audio was coming from several directions, especially right in front of me.</p><p>If I didn't know any better, I would have checked to make sure my AirPods were connected properly since the audio sounded so expansive and not like it was coming from earbuds. Without spatial audio turned on, the content sounded much more contained and concentrated.&#160;&#160;</p><p>If you want to use spatial audio with your AirPods, you'll have to make sure you own a pair of AirPods Pro and an iPhone 7 or later. The feature also works when using AirPods Pro with the third-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the 11-inch iPad Pro, the third-generation iPad Air, the sixth-generation iPad, and the fifth-generation iPad mini. Of course, all of these devices will need to be running iOS 14 or the latest version of iPadOS.</p><p>You'll also want to make sure spatial audio is turned on. To do this, open your iPhone's settings menu, tap \"Bluetooth,\" and look for your AirPods Pro in the list of devices. Tap the \"i\" button next to it and make sure the \"Spatial Audio\" switch is activated. You can also control spatial audio by launching the Control Center and pressing and holding on the volume bar. Any content encoded in 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound or Dolby Atmos should work.&#160;</p><p>It's one of the few features Apple has added to AirPods in iOS 14, along with battery notifications that can alert you when your headphones need to be charged and automatic switching between devices.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

recently updated their laws</a> for the social media age by enacting legislation to explicitly allow voters to post pictures of their marked ballots, while other states have passed laws further restricting photography and phone use at polling place, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/secrecy-of-the-ballot-and-ballot-selfies.aspx?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=Zippy+News%3A+Announcing+the+NCFR+Olson+Grant&utm_campaign=Zippy+News+-+1%2F29%2F2020%2F29%2F2020\">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.&#160;</a></p><p>Issues around ballot selfies have also been recently been litigated in court.&#160;</p><p>After New Hampshire passed a law explicitly banning ballot selfies on social media in 2014, <a href=\"http://indepthnh.org/2017/04/03/nh-ballot-selfies-remain-legal-as-u-s-supreme-court-declines-review/\">it was struck down by a federal appeals court</a>, which ruled that the law violated the 1st Amendment right to freedom of speech, and that lawmakers had insufficient evidence to prove that such a measure was necessary to prevent vote-buying.&#160;</p><p>David Levine, the election security fellow at <a href=\"https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/author/david-levine/\">the Alliance for Securing Democracy</a> and a former election official in Idaho and Washington, DC, told Insider that the debate over ballot selfies is likely to become even more potent in the future as voting from home becomes a more accessible and popular option to cast a ballot.&#160;</p><p>\"There are some folks who express concern about ballot secrecy and coercion, but there are others who say that people who want to should be able to take that risk...of losing their own right to privacy,\" Levine said. \"It's really important for voters to have a real understanding of what doing something like that entails and what applicable state laws are in place.\"</p><p>While rules around ballot selfies can be difficult to enforce and it's rare for states to prosecute voters for posting photos of their ballots, you'll want to make sure not to do anything that could lead to your vote being challenged or even thrown out.&#160;</p><p>In the 2016 election, pop star Justin Timberlake <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/26/entertainment/justin-timberlake-selfie/index.html\">caused a stir</a> by taking a selfie of him casting his ballot while voting early in his hometown of Memphis, which could have run the risk of violating a state ban on voters taking photographs in polling places.&#160;</p><p>In addition to laws against publicly showing how you voted, there are many states that restrict voters from taking pictures or using their cellphones within polling locations themselves to protect the privacy of other voters and their voting choices.&#160;</p><p>\"As a former state and local election official, another thing we had to sometimes deal with too was not only just somebody capturing a picture of their ballot, but also what else they might capture a picture of in the polling place that<br>could run the risk of capturing other people's information,\" Levine said.&#160;</p><p>Even before the pandemic, election officials have cautioned that voters taking time to snap photos or selfies at polls could lead to longer lines and less efficient service at in-person voting locations.&#160;</p><p>This year, with many localities likely to have fewer in-person voting locations available due to the pandemic, election officials are encouraging voters to be as mindful as possible of how much time they take to vote — including getting the perfect angle and lighting for a selfie.&#160;</p><bi-shortcode id=\"expanded-coverage\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-source=\"insider-voter-guide\" data-show-header=\"true\">Expanded Coverage Module:

attractive to subscribers.&#160;</p><p>In the summer of 2019, for a limited time, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/spotify\">Spotify Premium</a> subscribers could get a <a

If you want to use your existing Hulu account, you'll need to drop these add-ons before proceeding.&#160;</li><li>You need to pay for Hulu directly, and not be billed though a service like Roku.

href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/02/trump-white-house-coronavirus-positive-425229#stepien\">at least 35 people contract the virus</a>. The list of those who've been infected includes the first lady and a number of top aides to the president.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The infections are largely suspected to be linked to a Sept. 26 event at the Rose Garden where Trump announced that he was nominating Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court. Many attendees could be seen without masks and there was a lack of social distancing. A number of those who went to the event, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/utah-sen-mike-lee-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-2020-10\">including Republican senators</a>, have since tested positive.&#160;</p><p>Though Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19 just a week ago, he's already back in the Oval Office despite the fact that he could still be contagious. Trump spent the weekend at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was transferred after his condition worsened last Friday. The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> says a person with COVID-19 should not be around other people for at least 10 days after symptoms first appear.&#160;</p><p>Trump downplayed the threat of COVID-19 for months prior to contracting the virus, and flouted public health recommendations such as wearing a mask and staying six feet away from others. Just two days before he tested positive, the president mocked former Vice President Joe Biden during the first presidential debate for routinely wearing a mask.&#160;</p><p>It's unclear whether <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-solo-town-hall-trump-backed-out-virtual-presidential-debate-2020-10\">the next two presidential debates</a> will happen given that Trump has the virus and he rejected the possibility of holding a virtual debate to ensure everyone's safety.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The messages included misleading or outright false claims, and the users did not disclose their relationship with Turning Point Action, the Post reported.&#160;</p><p>Turning Point Action's field director, Austin Smith, told the Post at the time that the campaign was \"sincere political activism conducted by real people who passionately hold the beliefs they describe online\" and shouldn't be compared to a troll farm.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-removes-fake-accounts-linked-to-turning-point-usa-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/S4W-OhWEQ50\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 18:49:41 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f626f57323fc4001e0d6b15?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"6c7aed978a0cc7438be5d7bd27b565f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn19@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-23-284_bef9f19602de7ca5.webp","destWidth":1953,"destHeight":1465,"sourceBytes":91440,"destBytes":91440,"author":"ahartmans@businessinsider.com (Avery Hartmans)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f7f4048c655f6001969efab?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn55@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-33-769_6d975c528fadb034.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-35-019_9a9d6c6ab005de32.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn80@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-27-776_fcdec87e8a595561.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn41@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-30-246_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=S4W-OhWEQ50:DtGb5pqtC7c:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn73@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-32-744_695e042e5b819f71.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/S4W-OhWEQ50":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn1@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-26-986_d0413cdb33442998.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214360902},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:40","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:40","title":"Lime's CEO explains how the scooter company's 'near death experience' during the pandemic helped set it up to turn a profit next year","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/lime-ceo-pandemic-pivot-company-on-track-turn-profit-2021-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f6dcfea74820019ca6096?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Wayne Ting, CEO, Lime\" height=\"3648\" width=\"5472\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Wayne Ting, a four-year Uber veteran, took over as Lime&#39;s CEO in May amid the pandemic.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lime</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Lime's bike and scooter revenues plunged 95% when the pandemic hit in the spring, CEO Wayne Ting told Business Insider..&#160;</li>\n<li>But it's come out stronger than ever thanks to a pivot to become a one-stop app for any and all electric vehicles to get around.&#160;</li>\n<li>Ting says the company is on track to turn a profit for the first time next year.

But thanks to a shift in focus&#160; — and a buzzy deal with Uber to take over the ride-hailing firm's micro-mobility suite — the company says it's on track to turn a profit next year.</p><p>\"Our vision for Lime is to be <em>the</em> platform for mobility under five miles,\" said Ting, who spent four years at Uber before joining Lime in May. \"If you're in a city and are going from point A to point B, we want you to open the Lime app and know you can get there using the mode at the price point that you want.\"</p><p>He doesn't care if that's on a Lime scooter, a Jump bike, or the app's newest offering: a Wheels-branded sit-down scooter, available in four US cities this winter with more to follow. Every new vehicle, Ting says, helps Lime find new riders that might be averse to their original stand-up scooter for one reason or another.</p><p>\"Our main scooter product is very popular with younger people, and with slightly more men than women,\" Ting said. \"But with eBikes, for example, we see people who are older, we see more women riders than men riders.\"</p><p>After all, whether you're sitting or standing, \"the actual underlying technology isn't that different.\"</p><p>That should take some of the frustration out of arriving in a city, seeing a handful of differently branded vehicles, and having to choose which new app to download and use to move around. After an explosion of new micro-mobility companies, flush with venture capital cash, launched in recent years, Lime expects to see further consolidation similar to Uber's exit earlier this year.</p><p>\"I think 2020 into 2021 is a turning point for micro-mobility,\" Ting said. \"Covid was a near-death experience for a lot of us. But all of the trends underlying the growth of micro-mobility feel like they're going faster.\"</p><p>Specifically, he pointed to electrification, which is happening from bikes and scooters all the way to full-size cars. California, notably, has announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gasoline-powered-passenger-vehicles-in-2035-2020-9\">prohibit the sale of new internal combustion-powered automobiles</a> after 2035. The sharing economy, he also said, should continue to grow alongside Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, and a whole host of other platforms.</p><p>\"Historically in this industry, if you look at the amount of money that's flowed into it and the amount of money that it appears to have lost,\" Ting said. \"It seems staggering. I think one of the great things about Covid and the moment we've gone through, is it's forced companies to get better and think about the long term.\"</p><p>\"The people who can't get serious about building a great business,\" he continued, \"sometimes don't make it through.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a
