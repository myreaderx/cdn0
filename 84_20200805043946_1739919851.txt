Well, we’re not QUITE at August 6th just yet, but <em>Brawlhalla</em> on mobile has nevertheless arrived in the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brawlhalla/id1491520571\">App Store</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.ubisoft.brawl.halla.platform.fighting.action.pvp\">Google Play Store</a>. If you’re unfamiliar with the game, it’s more or less the same style of fighting game as <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. as your goal is to launch your opponents off the edge of the arena or into the stratosphere such that they’re not able to make their way back to solid ground. It uses a pretty simplified set of controls for a fighting game, also modeled after <em>Smash</em>, and the strategy of the game really revolves around timing and utilizing each character’s strengths and weaknesses in any given situation. And boy are there a lot of characters in <em>Brawlhalla</em>. Again channeling its inner <em>Smash</em>, many of the characters are guest stars from other parts of the gaming world.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLgow3nFhxA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>As you can see in that trailer, the mobile version of <em>Brawlhalla</em> features extensive virtual control customization, and it also fully supports physical controllers complete with in-game menu navigation. <em>Brawlhalla</em> has always strived to be “free to play done right\" and features sort of a <em>League of Legends</em> style character rotation system as well as non-essential cosmetic items sold as IAP. Basically there’s no way to pay to win, but it does feature a Battle Pass for earning rewards at a greater clip or a one-time All Legends IAP that will unlock every current character and all future characters for a price of $20. I love this method as for 20 bucks I can get access to every character but it doesn’t remove the enjoyment and sense of progression of earning new items and such. So if you even remotely enjoy fighting games, especially <em>Smash</em>, then you have no reason not to check out <em>Brawlhalla</em> for free on iOS or Android and throw down with people across every other gaming platform out there.</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 01:25:54 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/maxresdefault-1.jpg","linkMd5":"63a121c8141c3c24fb5c643fdf9e072f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn78@2020_3/2020-08-05/1596602379943_9f8f0ff7d296f070.webp","metaImg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/maxresdefault-1.jpg","author":"Jared Nelson"},{"createdTime":"2020-08-05 12:39:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-05 12:39:24","title":"A Sort of New-ish ‘Diablo Immortal’ Gameplay Trailer Was Show at ChinaJoy this Past Weekend","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270507","description":"<p>This past weekend the annual conference ChinaJoy took place in Shanghai, and was notable for being one of the only gaming conferences to actually happen in person since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and basically cancelled all of the in-person events of 2020. Also of note is that Blizzard trucked out <em>Diablo Immortal</em> again and showed off a new-ish trailer for the game. I say “new-ish\" because a lot of this footage is just rehashed from the game’s <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2018/11/02/diablo-for-mobile-announced-at-blizzcon/\">original annoucnement trailer</a> from BlizzCon 2018, but after the immense backlash from fans towards this mobile <em>Diablo</em> game, we haven’t seen a whole lot of <em>Immortal</em> in the time since. So I guess even a slightly updated trailer is worth being excited for? Maybe? Give it a look for yourself.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQiN4VmWbNw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>To be honest we were all extremely excited by the original announcement of <em>Diablo Immortal</em> two years ago, as a full-fledged <em>Diablo</em> game on mobile has long been a dream of mobile gaming enthusiasts. But boy howdy did Blizzard’s fans not share our excitement. We <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2018/11/05/blizzards-mistake-with-diablo-immortal-was-not-tricking-gamers-into-thinking-its-a-pc-first-title/\">speculated</a> that it mostly had to do with how Blizzard announced and presented the game, and that they probably should have been able to read the room a bit better and know that a convention center full of rabid fans waiting for some sort of grand <em>Diablo 4</em> news wasn’t going to jump for joy over a mobile game announcement. In fact, one of the developer’s responses of “Do you guys not have phones?\" during a Q&amp;A session about whether <em>Diablo Immortal</em> would ever be released on PC has achieved legendary meme status. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270507\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270508\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_558238e.jpg 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_558238e-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_558238e-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_558238e-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>It’s kind of a shame because, based on <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2018/11/02/diablo-immortal-hands-on-this-will-not-be-good-for-my-battery/\">our hands-on time with <em>Diablo Immortal</em></a>, it’s a bad ass <em>Diablo</em> game that plays perfectly well on the touchscreen. Now that <em>Diablo 4</em> was officially announced at last year’s Blizzcon, maybe there’s room for people to get a little more excited about <em>Diablo Immortal</em>. Unfortunately, the in-person BlizzCon planned for later this year has been cancelled, and we don’t know for sure yet whether or not an online version will take its place. If so, that will most likely be the next time we get some more concrete details in regards to a planned release date for <em>Diablo Immortal</em>, but hopefully in the meantime a slightly reworked old trailer will suffice.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 00:17:30 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_558238e.jpg","linkMd5":"5b600c4c9fdb75cf18d79945fd7f3dd0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn86@2020_4/2020-08-05/1596602382358_755a4dedcae7615a.webp","author":"Jared Nelson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270507":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-05 12:39:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-05 12:39:24","title":"SwitchArcade Round-Up: ‘Skully’ Releases Today, Plus the Latest Sales Featuring ‘Hatsune Miku’, ‘Tangledeep’, and More","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270482","description":"<p>Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for August 4th, 2020. You know, I’m not going to fight the tide today. It’s a slow day, and there’s no two ways around that. We’ve got one new release to look at, and we’ll certainly do that. There are some new sales, and I’ve made the list. The outgoing sales are also here, because I’m nice that way. And that’s just the way things are today. So we get a bit of a shorter one this time, but worry not: the next few days have quite a few new releases on the schedule. Let’s go!</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Skully ($29.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270483\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270482\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/skully.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/skully-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/skully-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/skully-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em>Skully</em> is an odd ball game. No, <em>literally</em>. You play as a rolling skull that has been reanimated with magical mud and given the task of solving the disputes of a very special family. At first it seems like Morph Ball: The 3D Platformer, but you’ll eventually unlock the ability to transform into three other forms. You’ll have to use all of your abilities to make it through the levels and gain your freedom. There are some performance issues in this Switch version of the game, but nothing so serious that the game isn’t playable. It’s certainly a different spin on the typical 3D platformer, if nothing else. I’ll be doing a review of this one soon, but so far the only real problem is the camera’s inability to keep up with ol’ Skully at times.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Lots of new sales today, if nothing else. And some really good ones in there, too. <em>Tangledeep</em> is an awesome roguelike, and yes, I said ‘rogue<em>like</em>‘ and not ‘rogue<em>lite</em>‘. I don’t throw that term around casually. <em>Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Megamix</em> is on sale, offering a jam-packed rhythm game experience that fans of the genre should check out. NIS America is running discounts on most of its games that weren’t on sale last week. Even the less exciting titles on the list aren’t the usual gang, so do have a look and see what catches your eye. As for the outbox, there are some really awesome games in there that may not be on sale again soon. <em>The Touryst</em>? Cool. Some of those <em>Arcade Archives</em>, especially <em>Metal Slug X</em>? Retro cool. <em>Atelier Ryza</em>? Adorable cool.
