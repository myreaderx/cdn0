But they won&#8217;t have an easy time making an escape, because a cute but obnoxious koala named Pretty Boy (musical comedian <strong>Tim Minchin</strong>, who will also be providing original songs) joins the escape, and he also happens to be their nemesis. In pursuit is <strong>Eric Bana</strong> as the zookeeper Chaz, accompanied by his adventure-seeking mini-me Chazzie (<strong>Diesel Cash La Torraca</strong>).</p>\n<p>The cast also includes <strong>Rachel House</strong> (<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>) as Jacinta the great white shark, country singer <strong>Karl Urban</strong> as Doug the cane toad, <strong>Celeste Barber</strong> as Skylar the koala, <strong>Wayne Knight</strong> as Phil the platypus, <strong>Aislinn Derbez</strong> as Legs the redback spider, YouTube star <strong>Lachlan Ross Power</strong> as Tasmanian Dave, and <strong>Jacki Weaver</strong> as Jackie the crocodile.</p>\n<p><em>Back to the Outback</em> will be directed by <strong>Clare Knight</strong>, who worked as an editor on <em>The LEGO Movie 2</em> and the <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> trilogy, and <strong>Harry Cripps</strong>, writer of the Australia family comedy <em>Penguin Bloom</em>, is behind the script. In an official statement, Knight said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have always been touched by stories of hidden beauty. Maddie is both uniquely beauty and beast, and to get to present that message in comedy is the icing on the cake.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cripps is happy to showcase the wilderness of Austraila and paint these creatures in a new light:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Growing up in Australia, I spent a lot of time in the Blue Mountains which has many different types of snakes and spiders, and I always preferred them to the cute cuddly animals, so it&#8217;s such a treat to make a film where the heroes are these poisonous but beautiful little creatures. This film is a love letter to Australia&#8217;s incredibly diverse and unique wildlife.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniela Mazzucato</strong> is producing and <strong>Akiva Goldsman</strong> is executive producing through his Weed Road Pictures along with <strong>Greg Lessans</strong>, who developed the story with Cripps.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, only the title treatment above has been revealed, so we don&#8217;t know what this Australian adventure will look like. Hopefully it won&#8217;t look like a bargain bin movie made to dupe grandparents into buying movies for their grandkids.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/back-to-the-outback-movie/\">Netflix&#8217;s Animated Animal Adventure &#8216;Back to the Outback&#8217; Will Star Isla Fisher, Eric Bana, Guy Pearce &#038; More</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=A5XXD7eKPnU:JqqD5HD9x1E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=A5XXD7eKPnU:JqqD5HD9x1E:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=A5XXD7eKPnU:JqqD5HD9x1E:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=A5XXD7eKPnU:JqqD5HD9x1E:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=A5XXD7eKPnU:JqqD5HD9x1E:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=A5XXD7eKPnU:JqqD5HD9x1E:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/A5XXD7eKPnU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 01:00:23 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtotheoutback-logo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"520952bb7011299b16fbd7d7a71c4631","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn75@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-09-57-481_0cfceaa77beb126e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":33630,"destBytes":19488,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtotheoutback-logo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn75@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-09-57-481_0cfceaa77beb126e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=A5XXD7eKPnU:JqqD5HD9x1E:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn59@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-10-14-205_a7af94f83a187630.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=A5XXD7eKPnU:JqqD5HD9x1E:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-10-14-363_a584b1628ef157c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/A5XXD7eKPnU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn70@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-14-287_d4fe18bcab82d741.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984470},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"‘Song Exploder’ Volume 2 Trailer: Trent Reznor, Dua Lipa, The Killers, and More Explore How They Create Music","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647934","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/song-exploder-volume-2-trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-647960\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/song-exploder-volume-2-trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"song exploder volume 2 trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/song-exploder-volume-2-trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/song-exploder-volume-2-trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/song-exploder-volume-2-trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/song-exploder-volume-2-trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Song Exploder</em></strong> is back for more.

I hope so, because here comes <em>Song Exploder </em>volume 2. The Netflix series is adapted from the podcast of the same name hosted by Hrishikesh Hirway, who said: &#8220;I first interviewed Trent Reznor for a Nine Inch Nails episode of the podcast back in 2017, and afterwards, as I was packing up my microphone and laptop, he asked me, &#8216;Have you ever thought about making this into a TV show?&#8217; It was just a glimmer of an idea back then. I&#8217;m so excited that it’s come to life, and I get to share four more episodes of the series with these beloved artists. They&#8217;re all so different from one another in terms of sound and background, and I can&#8217;t wait for people to see and hear their stories, and the unique path they each took to create these songs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new episodes will include:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dua Lipa, who delves into the personal struggles and musical influences that went into the making of her hit song &#8220;Love Again&#8221; from her second studio album, <em>Future Nostalgia</em>; the Multi-Platinum band The Killers who break down &#8220;When You Were Young,&#8221; the deeply personal song that felt like a turning point for the band; Oscar, Grammy and Emmy-winning composer and Rock &#38; Roll Hall of Fame inductee Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails who discusses the powerfully haunting song &#8220;Hurt,&#8221; the final track on NIN&#8217;s second studio album, <em>The Downward Spiral</em>; and Natalia Lafourcade, the Grammy and 14-time Latin Grammy-winning singer and songwriter, who explains how she channeled her history and homeland of Veracruz, Mexico, to create the hit song &#8220;Hasta La Raíz.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ll confess I haven&#8217;t watched the first volume of this show yet, but I might have to check out the Trent Reznor episode, since <em>The Downward Spiral</em> was a huge album for me back in my gloomy, depressing teen years (I&#8217;m still gloomy and depressing, by the way – I&#8217;m just older now). The series &#8220;weaves together in-depth interviews, archival footage, and raw recordings as each artist breaks down their song, layer by layer, sharing intimate insight into the personal inspiration behind the music and lyrics.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Song Exploder</em> volume 2 premieres globally on Netflix on <strong>December 15</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/song-exploder-volume-2/\">&#8216;Song Exploder&#8217;

Meanwhile, the standard three-day weekend total stands at $9.72, which is enough to surpass <em>Tenet</em>&#8216;s opening weekend of $9.35 million. That means <em>The Croods 2</em> now has the biggest opening weekend in theaters since the coronavirus pandemic began back in March. Yikes.</p>\n<p>With this latest box office victory, if you want to call it that, Univesral Pictures has now held the top spot on the domestic box office charts for five weeks in a row. <strong><em>Come Play</em></strong> and <strong><em>Let Him Go</em></strong> (released by Focus Features under the Universal banner) previously took the top spot, and <strong><em>Freaky</em></strong> was number one for two weeks in a row.</p>\n<p>Speaking of <em>Freaky</em>, the body swap horror comedy took the number two spot, but it didn&#8217;t even break $1 million. The weekend before Thanksgiving, it was the only movie to <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/nearly-700-theaters-closed-over-the-weekend-dropping-freaky-box-office/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earn more than $1 million</a>. But over the holiday weekend, it only earned just under $800,000. Perhaps that&#8217;s because the advertising for the movie&#8217;s arrival on VOD began over the weekend, keeping more people from heading out to theaters. But more likely, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the third weekend for the movie in the middle of a pandemic.</p>\n<p>Still holding strong in the number three spot is<strong><em> The War with Grandpa</em></strong>, adding just over $585,000, making its grand total nearly $17.2 million after eight weeks in theaters. And the rest of the top five is filled out by the aforementioned Focus Features releases <em>Let Him Go</em> and <em>Come Play</em>, earning $453,695 and $373,770 respectively.</p>\n<p>The box office is likely to keep being uninspiring throughout December until<em> Wonder Woman 1984</em> arrives in theaters on Christmas Day. That has the potential to have the biggest theatrical opening of the pandemic, but since it&#8217;s also getting released on HBO Max at the same time, perhaps the numbers won&#8217;t be so high. Maybe there&#8217;s a chance for <em>Monster Hunter</em> to make a dent at the box office, which is slated to hit theaters on Christmas as well.

But the most famous version of <em>The Price Is Right</em> began in 1972 with host <strong>Bob Barker</strong>, and starting today, the free TV streaming service Pluto TV is offering an entire channel dedicated to The Price Is Right episodes hosted by Happy Gilmore&#8217;s most formidable opponent.<span id=\"more-647912\"></span></p>\n<p>Pluto TV announced (via Deadline) the launch of <strong>The Price Is Right: The Barker Era</strong> as a new channel thanks to a new deal with Fremantle&#8217;s BUZZR, the TV network that hosts an impressive library of game show content from over the years. The new channel will play 24/7 with tons of fan favorite episodes that have been in circulation on TV over the years, but the real draw will be episodes that have been seen on TV since they aired roughly 40 years ago, including milestone episodes where beloved games like Plinko were introduced, as well as some big double Showcase winners. If you happen to be watching on Christmas Eve, there will also be some special festive episodes that will air throughout the day.</p>\n<p>Though comedian Drew Carey has been hosting <em>The Price Is Right</em> for 13 years now, turning him <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2557907/the-price-is-right-at-nights-drew-carey-talks-covid-19-changes-including-his-new-beard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">into the next Santa Claus</a>, it&#8217;s the Bob Barker era that fans love the most. There might be a new generation of kids who grew up with Carey, but Barker was a mainstay of the series since he was there from the beginning of the new format in 1972. He was effortlessly charming and funny, and it will be a lot of fun to go back to some of his earlier episodes from the 1970s and 1980s.</p>\n<p><em>The Price Is Right</em> has been a favorite game show of mine since I was a little kid. As a youngster who was initially obsessed with Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars, I was initially drawn to the Showcase Showdown because of the big spinning wheel involved. Plus, as a kid who knew nothing about retail prices, I wasn&#8217;t very good at any of the other games and would merely throw out random numbers. That&#8217;s also why Plinko was one of my favorite games to catch on the show, because after all the guessing was done, I could watch the Plinko chips bounce around and hope for big money.</p>\n<p>As I grew up,<em> The Price Is Right</em> became a comfort on those days when you were stuck at home in bed with the flu. Everyone knows the show is medicinal, but doctors just don&#8217;t want to admit it for fear of losing patients. If there&#8217;s one great conspiracy theory in the world, that&#8217;s it. Hopefully you won&#8217;t be getting sick anytime soon, but maybe you can call in sick and enjoy some retail games.</p>\n<p>Amy Kuessner, SVP of Content Strategy and Global Partnerships at Pluto TV, said in a statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8220;<i>The Price is Right</i> is classic feel-good TV and a part of television history with beloved host Bob Barker at the helm. These iconic game shows have not been televised in 40 years, and Pluto TV is thrilled to be the exclusive home of these classics, as they bring our viewers back in time to a treasured era of television.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mark Deetjen, BUZZR General Manager, added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bringing the most cherished era in <em>The Price Is Right</em> history back to television is sure to be a dream come true for all game show fans. The golden age of game shows was a time when families would come together to watch this fun and engaging genre of television from the comfort of their living rooms.  Pluto TV’s mission to offer accessible entertainment to homes across America harnesses this very same spirit and we couldn’t think of a more perfect partner to help us reintroduce this iconic content.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Pluto TV, you can <a href=\"https://pluto.tv/live-tv/pluto-tv-spotlight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">watch it on your browser</a> or download the app to watch on smart TVs, streaming devices, and your phone or tablet.

Then Benedict Cumberbatch shows up with several shaky American accents, which he toggles through as he emotes enough for the Academy to notice. But the actor that really sealed the deal for me while watching the trailer for <em>The Mauritanian</em> — which brings an unbelievable and harrowing true Guantanamo story to life — is the presence of French actor Tahar Rahim, who completely stole my attention in the 2009 crime drama, <em>A Prophet</em> (or <em>Un prophète</em>). Rahim&#8217;s intense charisma even threatens to unseat the film&#8217;s biggest stars, and it seems like director <strong>Kevin Macdonald</strong>, giving Rahim&#8217;s Mohamedou Ould Slahi an incredibly cinematic introduction and portraying him with equal turns sympathy and mistrust. Both Rahim and Foster are both apparently <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/awards/the-mauritanian-oscars-jodie-foster-tahar-rahim-oscars-release-1234838153/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">being pushed in the Oscar race</a>, which makes Rahim&#8217;s big Hollywood debut even more exciting.</p>\n<p>Rahim&#8217;s Slahi is the main character after all, as the film is based the former Guantanamo prisoner&#8217;s memoir <em>Guantanamo Diary</em>, which he published while imprisoned in the detention camp, before being released in 2016. Writers M.B. Traven, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani adapted the memoir into the screenplay, while Adam Ackland, Leah Clarke, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lloyd Le vin, Beatriz Levin, Mark Holder, Christine Holder, Branwen Prestwood Smith, Michael Bronner produced the film.</p>\n<p>Also starring in <em>The Mauritanian</em> is<strong> Zachary Levi</strong> and<strong> Saamer Usmani</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>The Mauritanian</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Captured by the U.S. Government, Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahar Rahim) languishes in prison for years without charge or trial. Losing all hope, Slahi finds allies in defense attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) and her associate Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley). Together they face countless obstacles in a desperate pursuit for justice. Their controversial advocacy, along with evidence uncovered by formidable military prosecutor, Lt. Colonel Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch), eventually reveals a shocking and far reaching conspiracy. Based on the New York Times best-selling memoir, this is the explosive true story of a fight for survival against all odds.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Mauritanian</em> is scheduled to hit theaters on <strong>February 19, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-647935\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/370832id1d_The-Mauritanian_Tsr1sht_sRGB_1080x1350-700x875.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"875\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/370832id1d_The-Mauritanian_Tsr1sht_sRGB_1080x1350-700x875.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/370832id1d_The-Mauritanian_Tsr1sht_sRGB_1080x1350-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/370832id1d_The-Mauritanian_Tsr1sht_sRGB_1080x1350-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/370832id1d_The-Mauritanian_Tsr1sht_sRGB_1080x1350.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-mauritanian-trailer/\">&#8216;The Mauritanian&#8217; Trailer: Jodie Foster and Benedict Cumberbatch Face Off in Court in Real-Life Guantanomo Drama</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5WTpzkp8sQE:W75YxgL4Wjg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5WTpzkp8sQE:W75YxgL4Wjg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5WTpzkp8sQE:W75YxgL4Wjg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5WTpzkp8sQE:W75YxgL4Wjg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5WTpzkp8sQE:W75YxgL4Wjg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5WTpzkp8sQE:W75YxgL4Wjg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/5WTpzkp8sQE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:30:28 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-mauritanian-700x291.jpg","linkMd5":"1531833a6fdbffe886118e4212ac63f0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn12@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-57-207_e148d5ae5651dfdf.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":291,"sourceBytes":13905,"destBytes":7962,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-mauritanian-700x291.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn12@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-57-207_e148d5ae5651dfdf.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/370832id1d_The-Mauritanian_Tsr1sht_sRGB_1080x1350-700x875.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-10-14-348_f807ba761ff1bc39.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5WTpzkp8sQE:W75YxgL4Wjg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn64@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-230_b17dd5580b0a414e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5WTpzkp8sQE:W75YxgL4Wjg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn87@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-10-14-180_e8491b72e1346910.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/5WTpzkp8sQE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn20@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-10-14-146_56ba5c84b3af26f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984466},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"‘Wonder Woman 1984’ Will Be the First Title to Stream in 4K on HBO Max","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647979","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-640876 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/galgadot-wonderwoman-goldenarmor-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Wonder Woman 1984 4k\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/galgadot-wonderwoman-goldenarmor.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/galgadot-wonderwoman-goldenarmor-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>HBO Max has been missing several key features since it launched earlier this year, but chief among them has been the ability to showcase titles in 4K.

The stubborn delay in hammering out terms of that negotiation has left Roku customers out to dry, but industry rumblings suggest that a deal will be worked out by the time <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> makes its grand debut on the service.</p>\n<p>As for other 4K content on HBO Max, the press release promised that the streamer &#8220;will expand these capabilities to further films and TV series, as well as adding support for additional devices, throughout 2021.&#8221; About damn time.</p>\n<p>HBO Max is one of my favorite streaming services (yep, there are so many that I have to have favorites now), but the lack of 4K has been nothing short of an embarrassment. Fingers crossed that the people working on incorporating that tech are able to move quickly and get that capability expanded to applicable titles throughout its entire library in early 2021. Pretty soon this pandemic is going to be over, and I have a feeling that viewing numbers are going to go down across the board (at least for a little while), so it&#8217;d be nice to be able to stream more of this content in the best way possible.</p>\n<p><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> arrives on <strong>December 25</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wonder-woman-1984-4k/\">&#8216;Wonder Woman 1984&#8217; Will Be the First Title to Stream in 4K on HBO Max</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i1TT0QyTmqA:LNVD7DlSs7U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i1TT0QyTmqA:LNVD7DlSs7U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i1TT0QyTmqA:LNVD7DlSs7U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i1TT0QyTmqA:LNVD7DlSs7U:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i1TT0QyTmqA:LNVD7DlSs7U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i1TT0QyTmqA:LNVD7DlSs7U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/i1TT0QyTmqA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 21:30:21 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/galgadot-wonderwoman-goldenarmor-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"e76cb3acb7b4f5d570f1872e6dda4cb8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-47-568_8451643f12443bd6.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":52030,"destBytes":39250,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/galgadot-wonderwoman-goldenarmor-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-47-568_8451643f12443bd6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i1TT0QyTmqA:LNVD7DlSs7U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn92@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-10-15-157_105ba1b61ef1eb02.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i1TT0QyTmqA:LNVD7DlSs7U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn31@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-15-233_0f36797aebf48dba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/i1TT0QyTmqA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn82@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-14-205_c3fec037365b0014.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984484},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"“Theft” Brings Some Shock and Awe to ‘His Dark Materials’ With the Help of Paddington Bear","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647847","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-647850\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-e1606795961242-700x343.jpg\" alt=\"his dark materials theft review\" width=\"700\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-e1606795961242-700x343.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-e1606795961242-360x176.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-e1606795961242.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>His Dark Materials</em></strong> is only getting better with each episode of its second season, with the third episode, &#8220;Theft,&#8221; finally bringing an end to the sluggish witches vs. Magisterium plot and getting to the real action. And by real action, I mean Will and Lyra sitting down in a movie theater to watch <em>Paddington</em>.</p>\n<p>No, I don&#8217;t really mean that. But that scene is a pivotal example of how <em>His Dark Materials</em> is letting loose its dour, epic fantasy trappings to embrace some of the awe and whimsy that was mostly absent from its first season. Pairing that quiet moment of connection with Will and Lyra in the crowded movie theater (along with the quiet comedy of Lyra being introduced to popcorn for the first time) with the escalating stakes of a stranger stealing Lyra&#8217;s alethiometer and Lyra&#8217;s mother getting closer to finding her makes for a thoroughly exciting episode of <em>His Dark Materials</em>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-647847\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-647849\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-4-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-4-700x394.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-4-360x203.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-4.jpg 1008w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Only the Children Are Left</h2>\n<p>One of my favorite things about <em>His Dark Materials</em> this season is how much of a presence Pan is shown to be, compared to his curious absence in long stretches of season 1 (owing, likely, to budget). One of the remarkable things that sets <em>His Dark Materials</em> apart from other fantasy franchises is the existence of the daemons: the other half of humans who represent a person&#8217;s soul, in walking, talking animal form. And we get to see Pan act as Lyra&#8217;s soul in this episode, or rather, as her conscience — nagging her and doubting her motives as she goes on her own self-serving mission to learn about Dust with Dr. Mary Malone (<strong>Simone Kirby</strong>), defying the alethiometer&#8217;s orders for her to help Will find his father.</p>\n<p><strong>Dafne Keen</strong> is becoming wonderfully adept at showing Lyra&#8217;s natural arrogance, throwing around smirks and sneaky jabs about mustaches. But Lyra&#8217;s trademark cockiness comes back to bite her, as she is quickly accosted by said mustachioed policeman, who is searching for Will at a perplexed Mary&#8217;s office. Lyra smoothly lies in response to the cop&#8217;s rapidfire questions, before letting down her guard and accidentally giving Will away, her face dropping when she realizes what she&#8217;s done. A chase quickly ensues, leading Lyra right to the car door of Lord Boreal, or Sir Charles Latrom as Lyra knows him, who offers her a ride home. Lyra happily takes his offer, and distractedly fields his smooth questions (Ariyon Bakare, again, shining when given the chance to actually play the snake) before just as quickly leaving his car, almost forgetting her backpack with the alethiometer in it. But she soon discovers the alethiometer to be missing and for Latrom to be &#8220;nothing more than a thief,&#8221; as Pan declares. Lyra&#8217;s panic is palpable, and it&#8217;s never been more clear that Lyra has been thrust into an alien world — bringing something much more interesting to her character, as she relies on her own cockiness more.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Will (<strong>Amir Wilson</strong>) finds his way to Lyra after spending the day searching Citagazze for her, where he found only a standoffish Angelica (Bella Ramsey, so wonderfully scrappy and earthy in her brief appearances) who rejects his questions about the myserious Torre degli Angeli and tells him about how the Spectres killed or chased out all the adults in the city, leaving him with an ominous warning about his impending adolescence. But upon finding Lyra at the botanical gardens back in his world, where she tearfully admits that she lost the alethiometer, Will takes her to the movie theater in one of the most delightful scenes of the series thus far. Not just for the fact that they&#8217;re playing <em>Paddington</em> at the theater, but for those small moments of emotional intimacy that play out over a comedic scene — Will and Lyra admitting that they worried about each other while Lyra steals his popcorn and calls it disgusting. The scene ends with a lovely little moment of Pan peeking his nose out of the backpack to watch <em>Paddington</em> in awe, and it feels like <em>His Dark Materials</em> is no longer afraid of embracing the magical side of its story.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-647851\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-1-700x350.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-1-700x350.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-1-360x180.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-1-768x384.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-1.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>When The Fog Lifts</h2>\n<p>The B-plot of the episode follows Lin-Manuel Miranda&#8217;s adventuring aeronaut, Lee Scoreseby, who finds himself drawn by strange winds to a sad northern fishing town, where he trades whisky for information on Stanislaus Grumman, the explorer who was said to have a connection to a powerful weapon. His information leads him to a nearby Observatory where Grumman used to work, manned by Dr. Haley (<strong>Angus Wright</strong>, a British character actor making a meal of his short scene), who is quick to accuse Lee of being a heretic and shoot at him. It&#8217;s a chilling reminder of the religious fanaticism that controls the world, as is the next scene that sees Lee captured by the Magisterium&#8217;s forces, who had been called by Dr. Haley before Lee instinctively shot him dead.</p>\n<p>In an intriguing invented scene for the series, we get the only meeting between two of the most important adults in Lyra&#8217;s life: Lee Scoresby and Mrs. Coulter (<strong>Ruth Wilson</strong>, killing it again with the chilling menace and trembling vulnerability, what more can I say?). It&#8217;s a scene that isn&#8217;t in the books, but Miranda and Wilson absolutely sell the hostility that gives way to wary trust, as Mrs. Coulter frees Lee out of her love for Lyra. Oh, and Mrs. Coulter finally finds out where Lyra is, thanks to a conveniently placed other prisoner, Asriel&#8217;s manservant, who reveals that Lyra traveled into the other world.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-647848\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-3-700x420.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-3-700x420.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-3-360x216.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-3-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-3.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The End of Destiny</h2>\n<p>Lyra, Lyra, Lyra. It&#8217;s all about our resident prophecy girl, who is revealed to be the chosen one to bring an “end of destiny,&#8221; declares Serafina Pekkala&#8217;s daemon Kaisa, in conversation with Iorek Byrnison. It&#8217;s a welcome return to see Iorek again — whose home is now melting because of Asriel&#8217;s tear in the sky — though it occurred to me how funny it was that this very serious and straightforward exposition scene takes place between two talking animals. Only on <em>His Dark Materials</em>.</p>\n<p>Also grappling with destiny is Dr. Mary Malone, who is on the verge of making a scientific breakthrough with dark matter, but hits a wall after Lyra suddenly disappears. Kirby&#8217;s grounding presence offers a nice bit of normalcy in all the fantastical and intense happenings of the episode, and getting a peek at her domestic life (complete with a concerned sister and cute nieces), only proves how watchable she is. I like to see Mary struggling, in a rut, and spending time with her and her frustrated family life communicates that too. Finally, when science fails her, Mary turns to faith, bringing out the I Ching sticks to study — the intercutting of her using the sticks with the Cave waking up and reflecting the sticks&#8217; patterns is a nice touch. Mary&#8217;s scientific breakthrough timing with the climax of Will and arriving at Boreal&#8217;s mansion, where he shows his hand and offers a deal: retrieve the &#8220;subtle knife&#8221; from the Torre degli Angeli, and he&#8217;ll return the alethiometer.</p>\n<h2>Subtle Sidenotes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The show is really hinting at the importance of those botanical gardens…</li>\n<li>I wonder if the Paddington shout-out is a nod to the famously mocked CGI bears of <em>The Golden Compass</em> or to the shared backer to both <em>His Dark Materials</em> and <em>Paddington</em>, Anton. I&#8217;m choosing to think the former.</li>\n<li>No Andrew Scott this episode, but I would recognize that voice mystically whispering &#8220;Return&#8230;&#8221; and that mouth anywhere!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/his-dark-materials-theft-review/\">&#8220;Theft&#8221; Brings Some Shock and Awe to &#8216;His Dark Materials&#8217; With the Help of Paddington Bear</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=F8DlsphHadk:9NwYh0vDkBg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=F8DlsphHadk:9NwYh0vDkBg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=F8DlsphHadk:9NwYh0vDkBg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=F8DlsphHadk:9NwYh0vDkBg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=F8DlsphHadk:9NwYh0vDkBg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=F8DlsphHadk:9NwYh0vDkBg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/F8DlsphHadk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 17:00:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-e1606795961242-700x343.jpg","linkMd5":"398e737d978077662c7c2644855e34c1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn23@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-09-44-829_1c970d57a6f55001.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":343,"sourceBytes":22715,"destBytes":12056,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-e1606795961242-700x343.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn23@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-09-44-829_1c970d57a6f55001.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-4-700x394.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn64@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-15-318_311a92413d02d839.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-1-700x350.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn16@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-10-14-157_0821ffb79583b971.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-theft-3-700x420.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn32@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-348_53afbbbcc352ed83.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=F8DlsphHadk:9NwYh0vDkBg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn59@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-10-15-265_00f41f308eccbe9c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=F8DlsphHadk:9NwYh0vDkBg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-179_a62473b686e42661.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/F8DlsphHadk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn78@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-10-14-190_d3ecc9845696204f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984474},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"‘Blindspotting’ TV Show Finds Its Cast; Rafael Casal Reprising His Role From the Movie","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647936","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-647954 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Blindspotting-TV-show-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Blindspotting TV show\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Blindspotting-TV-show.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Blindspotting-TV-show-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The gentrification-themed comedy/drama <em><strong>Blindspotting </strong></em>was one of the best movies of 2018, and it&#8217;s been more than a year since we heard that a TV spin-off was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/blindspotting-tv-spin-off-starz/\">in the works at Starz</a>. Now the cast for the <em>Blindspotting</em> TV show has been locked in. We already knew the series would focus on <strong>Jasmine Cephas Jones</strong>&#8216; Ashley character from the movie, but now we know that <strong>Rafael Casal</strong>, who co-wrote and co-starred in the film, will be serving as the showrunner and will also reprise his role as Miles in a recurring capacity.<span id=\"more-647936\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/blindspotting-series-starz-cast-1234842936/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> reports that <strong>Daveed Diggs</strong> and Rafael Casal, who wrote and starred in the movie, are returning to write and executive produce the series, with Casal not only taking the reins as showrunner, but also getting behind the camera to direct an episode of the new series. (Carlos López Estrada directed the film, but does not appear to be involved with this spin-off.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Diggs and I are thrilled to continue our partnership with Lionsgate by expanding the <em>Blindspotting</em> world as a series on Starz,&#8221; Casal said in a statement. &#8220;This story, the incredible cast and the production are a dream. We are making the kind of show we have long hoped to see on television, centered around just some of the amazing kinds of characters the Bay Area has to offer.&#8221; In a statement of his own, Diggs said that the show will ultimately be &#8220;about how a broken prison system affects all of us and, like the film, we&#8217;re using comedy to talk about very real systemic effects in the country with the largest prison population in the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jasmine Cephas Jones (<em>Hamilton</em>, <em>#FreeRayShawn</em>) is playing Ashley, &#8220;a woman who is nipping at the heels of a middle-class life in Oakland until Miles, her partner of 12 years and father of their son, is suddenly incarcerated, leaving her to navigate a chaotic and humorous existential crisis when she is forced to move in with Miles&#8217; mother and half-sister.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin Earl Turner</strong> has been hired as a writer on the series and to play a character named Earl, &#8220;who is fresh out of jail and wearing an ankle bracelet while doing a year of house arrest. He is just trying to kill time and lay low.&#8221; <strong>Atticus Woodward</strong> (<em>Shameless</em>) will take over the role of Sean, Miles&#8217; and Ashley&#8217;s &#8220;sweet, smart, and energetic son.&#8221; <strong>Jaylen Barron</strong> (<em>Shake It Up</em>) has quite the role as Trish, Miles&#8217; younger half-sister, &#8220;who might be wilder than he is. While she is quite a handful, she is the most loyal and loving person you’ll ever meet.&#8221; And finally, <strong>Candace Nicholas-Lippman</strong> (<em>Good Trouble</em>) will play Ashley&#8217;s close friend Janelle, &#8220;who is equal parts TOWN as hell and worldly. She has just returned to the neighborhood in Oakland after spending many years in Bali.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the trailer for the original movie:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9-HBqVbtTo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/blindspotting-tv-show/\">&#8216;Blindspotting&#8217; TV Show Finds Its Cast; Rafael Casal Reprising His Role From the Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BPzuzBEzgc4:bNnV_1UrsVQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BPzuzBEzgc4:bNnV_1UrsVQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BPzuzBEzgc4:bNnV_1UrsVQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BPzuzBEzgc4:bNnV_1UrsVQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=BPzuzBEzgc4:bNnV_1UrsVQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BPzuzBEzgc4:bNnV_1UrsVQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/BPzuzBEzgc4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 22:00:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Blindspotting-TV-show-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"6cfb5ed58e15b17c09651c48119bcc2c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn68@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-58-358_adffbbbfaf239a95.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":38287,"destBytes":25682,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Blindspotting-TV-show-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn68@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-58-358_adffbbbfaf239a95.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BPzuzBEzgc4:bNnV_1UrsVQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn56@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-10-15-247_e62969e480bd461c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=BPzuzBEzgc4:bNnV_1UrsVQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn40@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-10-14-259_20e0e285a9e2a0ae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/BPzuzBEzgc4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn27@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-10-15-277_463e1e0e18f643d9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984466},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"The Quarantine Stream: ‘His Dark Materials’ is a Dark Adventure into Adolescence","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647875","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-590676\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-ep-5-e1575275838851-700x334.jpg\" alt=\"his dark materials the lost boy review\" width=\"700\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-ep-5-e1575275838851.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-ep-5-e1575275838851-360x172.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/the-quarantine-stream\"><strong>The Quarantine Stream</strong></a>, a new series where the /Film team shares what they’ve been watching while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Show</strong>: <em><span class=\"aCOpRe\">His Dark Materials</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Where You Can Stream It</strong>: HBO and HBO Max</p>\n<p><strong>The Pitch</strong>: Set in an alternate world where humans’ souls take the form of walking, talking animals called daemons, <em>His Dark Materials</em> starts off as a fantasy-adventure series involving child kidnappers and a brash young heroine named Lyra before it unfolds into an ambitious retelling of John Milton&#8217;s <em>Paradise Lost</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’</strong><strong>s Essential Viewing:</strong> <em>His Dark Materials</em> has been having trouble shaking off the taint from the 2007 adaptation of Philip Pullman&#8217;s first book in the trilogy, <em>The Golden Compass</em>. Roundly mocked for its shoddy CGI visuals and criticized for being a <em>Harry Potter </em>knock-off, <i>The Golden Compass </i>nearly doomed <em>His Dark Materials</em> to being cast off to the dustbin of failed YA adaptations. But enter BBC and the duo of executive producer <strong>Jane Tranter</strong> and writer<strong> Jack Thorne</strong>, who wanted the rest of the world to take the series as seriously as its thousands of book fans do. The result: the BBC/HBO co-production <em>His Dark Materials</em>, a dark journey into adolescence that goes through its share of growing pains, before finally coming into its own with its currently-airing second season.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-647875\"></span></p>\n<p><em>His Dark Materials</em> opens in an alternate world so unlike ours: filled with talking polar bears, witches, and souls that take the shape of talking animals, ruled by the oppressive Magisterium, a religious organization whose depiction has gotten the Catholic Church angry with this series on more than one occasion. In this world lives Lyra Belacqua (<strong>Dafne Keen</strong>), a headstrong orphan raised in the austere halls of Oxford’s Jordan College, whose best friend is one day kidnapped by &#8220;Gobblers,&#8221; a group that may or may not have ties to the Magisterium. Following the trails left by Roger and her adventurer uncle Lord Asriel (<strong>James McAvoy</strong>), Lyra becomes entangled in a plot that has divine, world-shattering ramifications. Literally.</p>\n<p>As the first season unfolds, <em>His Dark Materials</em> breaks open its fantasy world to reveal the existence of parallel worlds — including our own present-day one. It&#8217;s the kind of science-fantasy twist that elevates <em>His Dark Materials</em> from the kind of <em>Harry Potter</em> cast-off that it had been originally billed as, and which deepens its rich philosophical themes. Without getting into too many spoilers, <em>His Dark Materials</em> goes from a typical fantasy-adventure into one of the god-killing variety.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself – teasing things that the show hasn&#8217;t even reached yet, though it&#8217;s clear that the team behind <em>His Dark Materials</em> is as eager to get to the good stuff as I am. It was one of the failings of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/his-dark-materials-review/\">the first season of <em>His Dark Materials</em></a>, which too heavily foreshadowed things to come, losing the impact of some of those late-story twists. But after an entertaining, if uneven, first season, <em>His Dark Materials</em> has finally found its footing as a thrilling fantasy show in its own right, by embracing some of the whimsy that the &#8220;grim&#8221; and &#8220;mature&#8221; first season left on the table and by embracing the story&#8217;s science-fantasy trappings.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-his-dark-materials/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8216;His Dark Materials&#8217; is a Dark Adventure into Adolescence</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xOPLEW96ecs:14XoSUho9hc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xOPLEW96ecs:14XoSUho9hc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xOPLEW96ecs:14XoSUho9hc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xOPLEW96ecs:14XoSUho9hc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xOPLEW96ecs:14XoSUho9hc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xOPLEW96ecs:14XoSUho9hc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xOPLEW96ecs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:00:20 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-ep-5-e1575275838851-700x334.jpg","linkMd5":"e7bea1cca8d4dc3e53f921d8703961b9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn80@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-10-11-115_0f9310999551c357.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":334,"sourceBytes":32213,"destBytes":16432,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/his-dark-materials-ep-5-e1575275838851-700x334.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn80@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-10-11-115_0f9310999551c357.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xOPLEW96ecs:14XoSUho9hc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn90@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-171_eefde6c9ff5018b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xOPLEW96ecs:14XoSUho9hc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn12@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-15-153_e9bc3ab7fa8b5d91.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xOPLEW96ecs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn47@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-14-986_5b4bffd3499d9d97.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984470},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"New ‘Van Helsing’ Movie Coming From Producer James Wan and ‘Overlord’ Director Julius Avery","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647941","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-van-helsing-movie.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-647952\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-van-helsing-movie-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"new van helsing movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-van-helsing-movie-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-van-helsing-movie-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-van-helsing-movie-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-van-helsing-movie.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Universal continues its quest to bring back characters from the classic Universal Monster movies. The latest is a new <strong><em>Van Helsing</em></strong> movie which, thankfully, won&#8217;t have anything to do with the terrible 2004 movie starring Hugh Jackman. This new <em>Van Helsing</em> comes from producer <strong>James Wan</strong> and director Julius Avery, who helmed <strong><em>Overlord</em></strong>. Van Helsing originated in Bram Stoker&#8217;s <em>Dracula</em> and has been played on screen by actors like Edward Van Sloan, Peter Cushing, Anthony Hopkins, and, yes, Hugh Jackman.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-647941\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has the scoop on the new <em>Van Helsing</em> movie, reporting that Julius Avery is set to direct and James Wan will produce. Avery will also re-write a script previously written by Eric Pearson. Plot details are not available at this time, but it&#8217;s safe to assume the story will involve the character of Van Helsing hunting monsters. In Bram Stoker&#8217;s <em>Dracula</em>, Abraham Van Helsing is a Dutch doctor who is the first to realize that there&#8217;s a vampire on the loose.</p>\n<p>In 2004, Universal tried to launch a whole <em>Van Helsing</em> franchise with Hugh Jackman playing a younger version of the character (renamed Gabriel Van Helsing for some dumb reason). While it wasn&#8217;t exactly a flop – it grossed $300.2 million worldwide – the overall reaction to the flick was so negative that Universal gave up on any plans for a sequel. Now, they&#8217;re going to try this again. And all I can say is: please don&#8217;t make this a generic action movie. Just because Van Helsing is known for hunting monsters doesn&#8217;t mean you have to turn him into an ass-kicker. This isn&#8217;t <em>Indiana Jones</em>.</p>\n<p>This won&#8217;t be the first time Universal attempted to revive a <em>Van Helsing</em> movie after the Jackman film. In 2012 <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tom-cruise-attached-star-van-helsing-producing-alex-kurtzman-roberto-orci/\">word broke</a> that the studio was developing a new <em>Van Helsing</em> with Tom Cruise attached to star. Guillermo del Toro was also mentioned as a potential director. While that didn&#8217;t pan out, Cruise did go on to star in another Universal Monster reboot – <em>The Mummy</em>.</p>\n<p>Released in 2017, <em>The Mummy</em> was supposed to be the start of an entire cinematic universe called Dark Universe, inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The plan was to create a series of interconnected monster movie reboots, and Universal put out a big announcement revealing that people like Johnny Depp and Javier Bardem were set to appear in eventual films. But <em>The Mummy</em> was a disappointment and Universal eventually gave up on the Dark Universe.</p>\n<p>But the monsters would live to fight another day. Because the studio went back to the drawing board and hired Leigh Whannell to make <em>The Invisible Man</em>. The film received high praise from critics and hauled in $134 million worldwide against a $7 million budget. It also signaled a new start for the studio: instead of putting together a connected cinematic universe, Universal is now set to create standalone horror movies. Since <em>The Invisible Man</em>, a slew of projects have been announced: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/invisible-woman/\"><em>Invisible Woman</em></a> from director Elizabeth Banks; the <em>Dracula</em> spin-off <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/renfield-movie/\"><em>Renfield</em></a><em> </em>from director Dexter Fletcher; Paul Feig’s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dark-army-update/\"><em>Dark Army</em></a>, which is said to feature classic Universal monsters; <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/monster-mash-movie/\"><em>The Monster Mash</em></a>, which we don’t really know a whole lot about; a new take on <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wolfman-reboot-director/\"><em>The Wolfman</em></a> starring Ryan Gosling and directed by <em>Invisible Man</em> filmmaker Leigh Whannell; and a recently announced <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lord-and-miller-universal-monster-movie/\">untitled movie</a> from producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller set to star Channing Tatum.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-van-helsing-movie/\">New &#8216;Van Helsing&#8217; Movie Coming From Producer James Wan and &#8216;Overlord&#8217; Director Julius Avery</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=THsBMRfW4Ws:RPzGdvqQt5o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=THsBMRfW4Ws:RPzGdvqQt5o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=THsBMRfW4Ws:RPzGdvqQt5o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=THsBMRfW4Ws:RPzGdvqQt5o:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=THsBMRfW4Ws:RPzGdvqQt5o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=THsBMRfW4Ws:RPzGdvqQt5o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/THsBMRfW4Ws\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 19:30:48 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-van-helsing-movie-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"7b71cd73997b6365900795a348d354f4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-10-11-490_c38e5036154656b2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":60207,"destBytes":47030,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/new-van-helsing-movie-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-10-11-490_c38e5036154656b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=THsBMRfW4Ws:RPzGdvqQt5o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn47@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-14-368_6a35b2cbf778b894.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=THsBMRfW4Ws:RPzGdvqQt5o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn22@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-10-14-179_67d4de6ecc236bf4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/THsBMRfW4Ws":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn17@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-10-14-191_fb099bd044ce3088.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984485},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"Freeform’s 25 Days of Christmas Marathon Kicks Off Today – See the Full Schedule","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647898","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-596362\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-700x377.jpg\" alt=\"disney+ movies disappearing\" width=\"700\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-700x377.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-360x194.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-768x414.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s here.

Seriously, the Tim Allen-starring movies are all over the Freeform 25 Days of Christmas Marathon, rivaling <em>Home Alone</em> for most-featured title in this schedule. But those films, as well as animated classics like <em>Frosty the Snowman</em> and <em>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</em>, all appear in this 25-long day marathon. Notably missing are the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies, once a frequent holiday staple at Freeform, but now over at Peacock after <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/harry-potter-streaming-gone/\">getting passed around</a> several streaming platforms. But no fear, you can just watch <em>Home Alone</em> a million times.</p>\n<p>See the full schedule for Freeform&#8217;s 25 Days of Christmas Marathon below.</p>\n<p><strong>TUESDAY, DEC. 1</strong><br

His name is Grogu, and executive producer <strong>Jon Favreau</strong> has known that since the first season, but it was fellow executive producer <strong>Dave Filoni</strong> who figured out how to finally reveal it with the debut of <strong>Rosario Dawson</strong> as Ahsoka Tano.</p>\n<p>Speaking of which, do you remember back when everyone was freaking out about Jon Favreau <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-holding-baby-yoda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">snapping a photo</a> of <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> creator <strong>George Lucas</strong> holding Baby Yoda way back at the beginning of the year? It just so happens that Rosario Dawson was in full wardrobe and make-up as Ahsoka Tano that day, and she was there for that viral moment.<span id=\"more-647888\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/11/rosario-dawson-dave-filoni-mandalorian-ahsoka-tano-grogu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vanity Fair</a> had an extensive chat with both Dave Filoni and Rosario Dawson about last weekend&#8217;s episode of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, entitled &#8220;The Jedi.&#8221; It was a huge moment for longtime fans of the<em> Clone Wars</em> animated series because it brought Dave Filoni&#8217;s creation to life in the live-action <em>Star Wars</em> universe. The debut of the character also allowed fans an opportunity to finally learn The Child&#8217;s name. Filoni explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The name has been around for a while. Jon told me early on in season one what it would be, which made me start to think about how people could learn the name. This gave me the idea that Ahsoka, who is very compassionate, would be able to connect with the Child, and that without words they could probably communicate through memories and experiences. Through that connection, she learns the name and then tells Mando and the audience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Though he&#8217;s 50 years old, Grogu doesn&#8217;t speak. He makes adorable sounds, but he hasn&#8217;t communicated with words. Through the Force, Ahsoka Tano is able to connect with him psychically and learn about what he&#8217;s been through. I&#8217;m not sure his name is as big of a deal as what his species might be called, but it&#8217;s nice that they didn&#8217;t contrive a way to reveal the information before now. But Filoni admits he had to force himself to stop just short of winking at fans by having someone call him Baby Yoda:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I thought one of the most compelling things about introducing Ahsoka is that she is one of the few, few people that we could encounter in a story and she would say, &#8216;All right. I met someone like him. I’ve only ever seen one other being like this.&#8217; I had to stop myself from doing something ridiculous like have her say, &#8216;Is that a Yoda baby?&#8217; It almost <em>demands</em> to be said.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>With &#8220;The Jedi,&#8221; fans were given yet another crossover between the animated side and the live-action of <em>Star Wars</em>, following the arrival of Katee Sackfhoff as Bo-Katan. But this episode that actually provided an even more surreal <em>Star Wars</em> moment, especially for Rosario Dawson. One of the days she was shooting scenes as Ahsoka Tano was the same day that George Lucas <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-holding-baby-yoda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visited the set of <em>The Mandalorian</em></a>. Dawson revealed that she was on-hand for the moment that took the internet by storm. She told Vanity Fair:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I actually got to be there on the day that there’s that photo. Someone took a picture of George Lucas holding Baby Yoda. I’m still calling him Baby Yoda—Grogu! I was there that day. I was all dressed up, I was just off to the side of that photo, all done up as Ahsoka. And I remember it broke the internet when that picture came out.

There&#8217;s a <em>Hellraiser</em> TV series in the works at HBO, with <em>Halloween</em> director David Gordon Green at the helm. And then there&#8217;s a <em>Hellraiser</em> reboot from filmmaker David Bruckner (<em>The Night House</em>). And now here&#8217;s perhaps the biggest <em>Hellraiser</em> news of all: the American rights to the franchise are now back in the hands of original creator <strong>Clive Barker</strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-647860\"></span></p>\n<p>Clive Barker has had next to nothing to do with the <em>Hellraiser</em> franchise since <em>Hellbound: Hellraiser II</em> in 1988, but that&#8217;s about to change. Per THR, a lawsuit settlement has resulted in the U.S. franchise rights to <em>Hellraiser</em> to revert back to Barker on December 19, 2021. As <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/hellraiser-writer-reclaiming-u-s-franchise-rights-after-lawsuit-settlement\">THR</a> reports:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Under the termination provisions of the Copyright Act of 1976, authors may recapture rights from publishers after waiting a prescribed period (usually 35 years for newer works) and sending a notice within a five-year window. Baker did so, but met resistance from Larry Kuppin, the producer who had once purchased New World Pictures from Roger Corman&#8230; but the parties have come to a deal. The judge has now been presented with a proposed consent judgment that states that Barker will recapture U.S. rights on December 19, 2021.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That means that after December 19, 2021, anyone who wants to make yet <em>another</em> sequel to <em>Hellraiser</em> will need to get Barker&#8217;s approval. This is fairly big news since there has been an endless supply of subpar direct-to-video <em>Hellraiser</em> sequels over the years. That&#8217;s not to say there won&#8217;t <em>still</em> be mediocre <em>Hellraiser</em> sequels, but at the very least, they&#8217;ll have Barker&#8217;s blessing.</p>\n<p>This news comes on the heels of two other developments regarding <em>Hellraiser</em>. There&#8217;s a <em>Hellraiser</em> TV series being developed for HBO, and it was recently announced that Barker had come aboard as an executive producer on that project, with Barker <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hellraiser-tv-series-clive-barker/\">saying</a> he was &#8220;delighted the Hellraiser mythology is seeing a new life. It’s time the stories went back to their roots. I’m eager to bring to a new audience the most powerful and ancient elements of horror: the darkest evil invading our human lives and how we must find in ourselves the power to resist it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s a <em>Hellraiser</em> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hellraiser-reboot-director/\">reboot</a>. David Bruckner is directing a script from Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowski. It&#8217;s unclear where that project stands at the moment – Barker wasn&#8217;t listed as attached to the reboot in any capacity before, and if the film isn&#8217;t made by December of next year, he&#8217;s going to need to sign off on it. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll learn more about that soon.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hellraiser-rights/\">&#8216;Hellraiser&#8217; Rights Return to Creator Clive Barker Next Year</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8hXEZ8-Rh6I:ZnY4wNVCTRE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8hXEZ8-Rh6I:ZnY4wNVCTRE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8hXEZ8-Rh6I:ZnY4wNVCTRE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8hXEZ8-Rh6I:ZnY4wNVCTRE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8hXEZ8-Rh6I:ZnY4wNVCTRE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8hXEZ8-Rh6I:ZnY4wNVCTRE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/8hXEZ8-Rh6I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 22:30:26 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hellraiser-rights-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"58291ad091f42a43abe1cfc5d039c6de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-44-747_d0d6922bded13973.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":46222,"destBytes":29858,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hellraiser-rights-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-44-747_d0d6922bded13973.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8hXEZ8-Rh6I:ZnY4wNVCTRE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn88@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-155_07871097a99ea7a2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8hXEZ8-Rh6I:ZnY4wNVCTRE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn76@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-15-289_6d5c3f856db41991.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/8hXEZ8-Rh6I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn24@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-15-294_f208a4ad419d1499.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984485},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"Sci-Fi Pic ‘Stowaway’, Starring Anna Kendrick and Toni Collette, Headed to Netflix","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647983","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stowaway.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-648009\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stowaway-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Stowaway\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stowaway-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stowaway-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stowaway-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stowaway.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Netflix has picked up <strong><em>Stowaway</em></strong>, a sci-fi film featuring <strong>Anna Kendrick</strong> (<i>A Simple Favor, Pitch Perfect</i>), <strong>Toni Collette</strong> (<i>Velvet Buzzsaw, Hereditary</i>), <strong>Daniel Dae Kim</strong> (<i>Hawaii Five-O, Lost, Always Be My Maybe</i>), and <strong>Shamier Anderson</strong> (<i>Race, Destroyer</i>).

Penna and Morrison also worked on <em>Arctic</em>, the 2018 film starring  Mads Mikkelsen. As for <em>Stowaway</em>, the film is already in the can, having shot in 2019 in Germany at Bavaria Studios in Munich and at MMC Studios in Cologne, with VFX handled by RISE | Visual Effects Studios. Producers include Aram Tertzakian, Nick Spicer, Jonas Katzenstein, Maximilian Leo and Ulrich Schwarz. Executive producers are Maxime Cottray, Nate Bolotin, Ryan Morrison and Philipp Stendebach. The production companies behind the flick are XYZ Films, Augenstein Filmproduktion, RISE PICTURES, and RainMaker Films.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On a mission headed to Mars, an unintended stowaway (Anderson) accidentally causes severe damage to the spaceship’s life support systems. Facing dwindling resources and a potentially grim outcome, a medical researcher (Kendrick) emerges as the only dissenting voice against the clinical logic of both her commander (Collette) and the ship’s biologist (Kim).</p></blockquote>\n<p>This premise – one crew member turning against a captain on a ship – is nothing new, really. It&#8217;s the set-up of <em>Mutiny of the Bounty</em>, and it&#8217;s also used in <em>Crimson Tide</em>. The difference here, of course, is that the ship is in space, so there&#8217;s that. And while Kendrick is known more for comedic work at this point, the synopsis makes it sound as if <em>Stowaway</em> is going to be played straight. That&#8217;s fine – all I ask is that we get at least one scene where Toni Collette loses her shit and yells at everyone. Please.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no word yet on when we might see <em>Stowaway</em>, but it obviously won&#8217;t be anytime in 2020. Unless Netflix wants to drop the film this month without warning, which <em>could</em> happen but probably won&#8217;t. The best bet is that we&#8217;ll see <em>Stowaway</em> sometime in 2021, so keep an eye out for it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/stowaway/\">Sci-Fi Pic &#8216;Stowaway&#8217;, Starring Anna Kendrick and Toni Collette, Headed to Netflix</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mIJeoSry_wU:Fln3vfkAes4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mIJeoSry_wU:Fln3vfkAes4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mIJeoSry_wU:Fln3vfkAes4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mIJeoSry_wU:Fln3vfkAes4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mIJeoSry_wU:Fln3vfkAes4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mIJeoSry_wU:Fln3vfkAes4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/mIJeoSry_wU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Dec 2020 01:30:21 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stowaway-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"11006deddebea5f222ae104e483292d7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-58-776_d93c2950db41da2e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":47557,"destBytes":35368,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stowaway-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-09-58-776_d93c2950db41da2e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mIJeoSry_wU:Fln3vfkAes4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn99@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-10-15-322_6c3ec4f50907540c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mIJeoSry_wU:Fln3vfkAes4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn67@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-15-111_dc393c87a3032719.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/mIJeoSry_wU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn10@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-10-14-270_de66ce991b2e7e67.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984470},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"Melissa McCarthy Doesn’t Listen to Our Pleas, Re-teams With Ben Falcone for Netflix Series ‘God’s Favorite Idiot’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647950","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-477405\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/melissa-mccarthy-ben-falcone-the-boss-e1523449946491-700x346.jpg\" alt=\"super-intelligence\" width=\"700\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/melissa-mccarthy-ben-falcone-the-boss-e1523449946491-700x346.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/melissa-mccarthy-ben-falcone-the-boss-e1523449946491-360x178.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/melissa-mccarthy-ben-falcone-the-boss-e1523449946491-768x380.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong>: you&#8217;re one of the most talented actresses working today.

And each new project has only delivered diminishing returns, each less funny and more insulting than the last.

McCarthy certainly found her groove on television before making the leap to feature films, then back to TV again. But it&#8217;s clear that this comedy partnership — which has given us critically slammed films like <em>Tammy, The Boss, The Life of the Party</em>, and now <em>Superintelligence</em> — just isn&#8217;t working. I guess this is what they mean when they compare marriage to a ball-and-chain.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/gods-favorite-idiot-melissa-mccarthy/\">Melissa McCarthy Doesn&#8217;t Listen to Our Pleas, Re-teams With Ben Falcone for Netflix Series &#8216;God&#8217;s Favorite Idiot&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=gPBzdbAUB7A:HgIT9TZSkkw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=gPBzdbAUB7A:HgIT9TZSkkw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=gPBzdbAUB7A:HgIT9TZSkkw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=gPBzdbAUB7A:HgIT9TZSkkw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=gPBzdbAUB7A:HgIT9TZSkkw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=gPBzdbAUB7A:HgIT9TZSkkw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/gPBzdbAUB7A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 20:30:23 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/melissa-mccarthy-ben-falcone-the-boss-e1523449946491-700x346.jpg","linkMd5":"2af17c777dc0d0874c44c80e726a48e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn19@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-44-834_6601385e65d51e4f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":346,"sourceBytes":45959,"destBytes":30770,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/melissa-mccarthy-ben-falcone-the-boss-e1523449946491-700x346.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn19@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-44-834_6601385e65d51e4f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=gPBzdbAUB7A:HgIT9TZSkkw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn87@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-221_b120d2d0230ecc4d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=gPBzdbAUB7A:HgIT9TZSkkw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn52@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-446_0f4df00b3c3d6325.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/gPBzdbAUB7A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn98@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-150_3bb6b680f2140ab5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984484},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"Pixar’s ‘Soul’ Filmmakers Talk the Challenges of Creating The Great Before, Early Story Ideas & More [Interview]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647840","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-647858 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joe-thegreatbeyond-700x302.jpg\" alt=\"Pixar's Soul Interview\" width=\"700\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joe-thegreatbeyond-700x302.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joe-thegreatbeyond-360x155.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joe-thegreatbeyond-768x332.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joe-thegreatbeyond.jpg 1244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Pete Docter</strong> is the chief creative officer of Pixar Animation, so he already has his hands full.

As Joe desperately tries to show 22 what’s great about living, he may just discover the answers to some of life’s most important questions.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What were some of the biggest challenges of coming up with the ethereal planes that make up The Great Beyond and The Great Before? Was it harder than coming up with a similar kind of plane of existence that we see as the construct inside Riley&#8217;s mind in <em>Inside Out</em>?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pete Docter</strong>: Yeah, it&#8217;s similar in its complexity and abstraction. Neither of them allowed us to go do research to look at cars or bugs or whatever. It really requires you to explore your own internal feelings. In this film we started out by talking to a lot of religious experts, looking for any hints of what people say happens before we&#8217;re born. Actually, it was somewhat freeing because we found very few. A lot of people talk about the afterlife, and that would be kind of a dangerous subject to get into. But in our case, we were talking about pre-life, and because there wasn&#8217;t a lot out there, we could make it up.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me say this before, but the idea really came from watching my kids, and from the moment they were born, recognizing there&#8217;s already some personality there. There&#8217;s a sense of humor or fear or whatever, depending on the person. How does that happen? How is it that we&#8217;re born into the world with a personality? That&#8217;s crazy to think about. So it was exploring how that came to be and then doing tons of iterations trying to figure things out.</p>\n<p><strong>Were there any visualization concepts for The Great Before that you were fascinated by but didn&#8217;t end up working for one reason or another?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Docter</strong>: Anything that we loved and really worked well for the story is in the movie. Along the way, there&#8217;s just cool stuff that doesn&#8217;t quite work for the story. So those get cut. The whole thing is kind of a blur in my head to be honest. There were so many different iterations and things we tried. Early on, it was kind of Greek-inspired. We were thinking that you get your personality and your wisdom of life, at least in western civilization, from the Greeks. But these are souls that were born around the world in China, Japan, Russia, so they can&#8217;t all come from Greece. So we wanted it to be more abstract and non-representational, so you see those strange forms in the film, and it was actually really difficult to come up with those.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of strange forms, the lost souls was a concept that I was surprised by, because not only are they scary visually, but it feels like a bit of a dark concept for children to embrace. Was it difficult coming up with a way to execute that idea without being too scary for kids? And were you worried at all about crushing the dreams of kids who want to become stock brokers?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Docter</strong>: <em>*laughs*</em> Well, the lost souls are really intriguing. Early on they were just an observation that some people have a real passion for something in particular, and other people just seem to wander through life with no real focus or vision, and sometimes they feel lost. As the film developed, we realized the difference between someone with a passion that connects them to life or separates them from it can be pretty thin. Somebody who loves movies might stop going outside and meeting other people and only watches movies and writes reviews and things like this <em>[Editor&#8217;s note: I feel attacked, but not really]</em>. That was a really interesting pivot for us when we made that observation.</p>\n<p><strong>Kemp Powers</strong>: Yeah, in &#8220;The Zone&#8221; itself, on a base level, everything living on Earth is psychically manifested in one way or another in The Zone. So there are elements of The Zone that have become background fodder that were much more significant at one point. Some of the mounds are what we call dream bubbles, and that used to be a bigger part of the story. The manifestation of people&#8217;s dreams was very visible as you worked your way through the landscape. It was about this idea of passionate people who are, for lack of a better word, just lost. They&#8217;ve fallen into obsession and are going through their life like zombies. How would we manifest that person in this landscape that&#8217;s literally the representation of all the psychic energy on Earth on another plane?</p>\n<p><strong>With Pixar&#8217;s creative process, I&#8217;m sure there are many more elements that were once part of the story that ended up being changed as the film was developed. Can you talk about any of the specific major changes to the story from its earliest inception to the final cut?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Docter</strong>: Yeah, there are tons. The movie actually started as a heist film, and it was entirely in the soul world. It was about this soul who wanted to get back to his life, and he was trying to steal a pass to do it. We quickly recognized that if we&#8217;re really talking about what makes life worth living, and we don&#8217;t actually go show real life, then there&#8217;s going to be a lot of talking about it but not a lot of proving it to the audience. So that was one.</p>\n<p>There was one version where 22, the soul who doesn&#8217;t want to go to Earth, was the main character. There was a version, I think in the first script, where Joe wasn&#8217;t a musician, he was an actor. He was going to be in Death of a Salesman. Ironic, huh! One thing about that was being an actor felt a little bit selfish, like he just wants to be famous, and it was a little hard to get behind. That evolved into him becoming a jazz musician.</p>\n<p><strong>Powers</strong>: There was a version that started in The Great Before where Joe doesn&#8217;t even know who he is.</p>\n<p><strong>Docter</strong>: Oh yeah! That was intriguing.</p>\n<p><strong>Powers</strong>: So in The Great Before, Joe is like, &#8220;Who am I, and where am I?&#8221; He&#8217;s like Alice already down the rabbit hole. And then he would see glimpses of his life and gradually figure out who he was. We learn things in this process by trying all of it. So there have been so many iterations and versions of the story that, hopefully, even if we completely throw it out,, we don&#8217;t really throw it out because we learn things from that version that inform the version that we finally land on.</p>\n<p><strong>Pete, you&#8217;re also the chief creative officer at Pixar. How do you balance taking on a movie like this as a director while you&#8217;re overseeing everything that Pixar is working on? What&#8217;s a normal day like for you?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Docter</strong>: It&#8217;s kinda crazy, but luckily we have a deep bench of talented people, both on this film and throughout the studio. So I leaned a lot on other folks. On the film, we delegated a ton to other people, our leads and supervisors. Within the studio as well, I was able to ask folks like Andrew Stanton, Peter Sohn, and Dan Scanlon to help boost up and look over some of the other projects. Now that the film is done, that&#8217;s shifting a little bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Dana, this is your first time producing a full feature for Pixar, can you talk about any major lesson you learned during the process and how it compared to your previous work at the studio?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dana Murray</strong>: Yeah, I had never worked with so much of the external talent. I had worked so much within Pixar and those teams, but with the music I got to work with [Jon] Batiste and Trent [Reznor] &#38; Atticus [Ross], and also all the actors. That whole world was all new to me and really fun and exciting.</p>\n<p><strong>To wrap up, Pete, what&#8217;s your involvement on the upcoming Monsters Inc. series on Disney+, and how is that coming along?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Docter</strong>: They are doing that kind of on their own. They&#8217;re trying to check in with us to make sure they don&#8217;t take any turns that weren&#8217;t in concert with the films. Bob Peterson has been helping with some of the writing. He&#8217;s not been writing, he&#8217;s just been advising. In a nutshell, we&#8217;re advising and supervising in whatever way we can to try and be helpful.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Pixar&#8217;s Soul arrives exclusively on Disney+ starting on <strong>December 25, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/pixars-soul-interview-pete-docter-kemp-powers-dana-murray/\">Pixar&#8217;s &#8216;Soul&#8217; Filmmakers Talk the Challenges of Creating The Great Before, Early Story Ideas &#038; More [Interview]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=490W-4YEqV8:uFOKN0_aQyg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=490W-4YEqV8:uFOKN0_aQyg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=490W-4YEqV8:uFOKN0_aQyg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=490W-4YEqV8:uFOKN0_aQyg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=490W-4YEqV8:uFOKN0_aQyg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=490W-4YEqV8:uFOKN0_aQyg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/490W-4YEqV8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joe-thegreatbeyond-700x302.jpg","linkMd5":"ed9edf7fdc47200e4e74390e24f9c90f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-44-702_a5a8aea2e9d49101.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":302,"sourceBytes":39822,"destBytes":27352,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soul-joe-thegreatbeyond-700x302.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-09-44-702_a5a8aea2e9d49101.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=490W-4YEqV8:uFOKN0_aQyg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn83@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-14-350_a489ce839a2252ad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=490W-4YEqV8:uFOKN0_aQyg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-049_b2b717fd56862d6c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/490W-4YEqV8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn8@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-10-14-300_52daf6fe637aa4f0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984466},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"‘The Offer’: Armie Hammer to Star in Paramount+ Show About Making ‘The Godfather’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=648010","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-648017 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Armie-Hammer-in-The-Offer-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Armie Hammer in The Offer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Armie-Hammer-in-The-Offer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Armie-Hammer-in-The-Offer-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Apparently, someone just made <strong>Armie Hammer</strong> an offer he couldn&#8217;t refuse.</p>\n<p>That offer: to play producer Al Ruddy in <em><strong>The Offer</strong></em>, an <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-offer-tv-series-making-of-the-godfather-paramount/\">upcoming television series</a> about the making of Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s cinematic classic <em>The Godfather</em>. The show is aiming to be one of the big titles for the streaming service Paramount+, which is soon being rebranded from its current name, CBS All Access. Get more info about Armie Hammer in <em>The Offer</em> below.<br />\n<span id=\"more-648010\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Hammer (<em>The Social Network</em>, <em>The Lone Ranger</em>, <em>Rebecca</em>) has been cast as Al Ruddy in <em>The Offer</em>, a 10-episode limited event series that&#8217;s supposed to be one of the signature shows of ViacomCBS&#8217;s new Paramount+. Ruddy has apparently kept several stories about the making of <em>The Godfather</em> to himself over the years, and this show is going to be based on those never-before-revealed experiences.</p>\n<p>We actually interviewed Ruddy earlier this year, and while <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/how-did-this-get-made-al-ruddy-interview/\">the entire conversation</a> is well worth your time, I wanted to highlight this little excerpt of Ruddy describing how he got the job as the producer of <em>The Godfather</em>. It starts with Charlie Bluhdorn, who owned Paramount&#8217;s parent company, bursting into an office meeting and asking Ruddy point blank how he would approach making this movie:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I looked at this crazy fucking guy and I said to myself: if I start talking about the book, I’ll be toast. This guy was focused on giving me <i>one </i>minute of time and he was gone, right? So I looked at him and I said to him, &#8216;Charlie, I want to make an ice blue terrifying movie about people you love.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That did the trick, and he went on to win an Oscar for his work producing the movie. Ruddy will executive produce this series, which is being written and executive produced by <strong>Michael Tolkin</strong> (<em>Escape at Dannemora</em> and <em>The Player</em>).</p>\n<p>On a surface level, this is probably one of the least interesting casting bits we&#8217;re likely to learn about this event series, simply because Ruddy is not nearly as iconic or instantly identifiable as several of the other major players involved in the making of the film, many of whom will be depicted here. We&#8217;re still waiting to see who will eventually step into the roles of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, and Diane Keaton, and those will probably be the ones that folks have strong opinions about in advance because we can imagine the comparison. But Hammer can be exceptional with the right material (see: <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>, <em>Sorry to Bother You</em>), so hopefully he&#8217;s a good fit for this project.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/armie-hammer-in-the-offer/\">&#8216;The Offer&#8217;: Armie Hammer to Star in Paramount+ Show About Making &#8216;The Godfather&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DMt9CBufT2g:sve42-1bbj4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DMt9CBufT2g:sve42-1bbj4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DMt9CBufT2g:sve42-1bbj4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DMt9CBufT2g:sve42-1bbj4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DMt9CBufT2g:sve42-1bbj4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DMt9CBufT2g:sve42-1bbj4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DMt9CBufT2g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 23:00:19 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Armie-Hammer-in-The-Offer-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c640a8d68c1e7d1859d9bb056907f020","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-44-949_177eee246cb4a91c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":36671,"destBytes":23922,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Armie-Hammer-in-The-Offer-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_5/2020/12/02/12-09-44-949_177eee246cb4a91c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-14-268_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DMt9CBufT2g:sve42-1bbj4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn84@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-10-15-100_d64479b537fae28d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_6/2020/12/02/12-10-15-542_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DMt9CBufT2g:sve42-1bbj4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn3@2020_1/2020/12/02/12-10-15-133_86e27201905fefbc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DMt9CBufT2g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn76@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-10-14-201_eaad25173a3cc8f9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910984485},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:44","title":"Heart Biopic: ‘Portlandia’ Star Carrie Brownstein Directing Film About the Female-Led Rock Band","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=647790","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-647812 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Heart-biopic-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Heart biopic\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Heart-biopic.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Heart-biopic-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Heart, the rock band that rose to popularity in the 1970s and &#8217;80s thanks to its shredding guitar riffs and powerful vocals from sisters <strong>Ann</strong> and <strong>Nancy Wilson</strong>, is getting the biopic treatment.</p>\n<p><strong>Carrie Brownstein</strong>, the Peabody Award-winning writer and actress who starred alongside Fred Armisen in the comedy series <em>Portlandia</em>, is set to direct the Heart biopic for Amazon Studios.<span id=\"more-647790\"></span></p>\n<p>In a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CIHGjwTnmq-/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SiriusXM&#8217;s Lyndsey Parker</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/carrie-brownstein-to-direct-heart-biopic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">THR</a>), Heart co-founder, lead singer, and guitarist Ann Wilson spilled the beans about the biopic of the band.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s [a biopic] in the works,&#8221; she confirmed. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you all about it, because it&#8217;s still being written right now. Carrie Brownstein is writing it. I saw the first draft of the script. It&#8217;s really cool. She&#8217;s working with the movie company Amazon, and with producer <strong>Lynda Obst</strong>, who did <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Some of Obst&#8217;s other producing credits include <em>Interstellar</em>, <em>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</em>, <em>Contact</em>, <em>The Fisher King</em>, and <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em>.</p>\n<p>Wilson also revealed that Anne Hathaway is one of the actresses who have already come forward to express interest in starring in the film as Ann, but evidently, the real Ann was not impressed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s exactly right for it, you know?&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>The script – or at least the draft that Wilson has read – &#8220;started in childhood and ended in the &#8217;90s,&#8221; indicating that this will not be a contained slice of life film but instead a full-on exploration of the band&#8217;s formation and its epic highs in those decades. Why filmmakers keep choosing to make music biopics in that style in the wake of <em>Walk Hard</em>, I&#8217;ll never know. But general audiences obviously eat this stuff up, as evidenced by <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> being nominated for all of those Oscars not too long ago and Rami Malek actually winning Best Actor, so if Queen and Elton John can have their moment in the biopic spotlight, why not Heart?</p>\n<p>As for Brownstein, she&#8217;s an acclaimed musician herself. She&#8217;s been part of bands like Sleater-Kinney, Excuse 17, and Wild Flag, and is a talented guitarist in her own right who was likely inspired by Heart&#8217;s power ballads when she was coming up in the music scene. She has directed several episodes of television, but this will be her feature directorial debut.</p>\n<p>Here are a few of Heart&#8217;s greatest hits, including the jaw-dropping &#8220;Crazy on You,&#8221; the gnarly &#8220;Barracuda,&#8221; and the soaring earworms &#8220;What About Love,&#8221; &#8220;These Dreams,&#8221; and &#8220;Alone.&#8221;</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZuW6BH_Vak?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

Things would only get worse for Quibi, which saw a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/quibi-subscriber-numbers-90-percent-drop/\">drop in subscribers</a> after its 90-day trial offered at launch ended, and the loss of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/quibi-losses/\">billions of dollars</a> in its first quarter.</p>\n<p>Katzenberg and CEO <strong>Meg Whitman</strong> launched the start-up with the intention of providing viewers with an on-the-go alternative to streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu, combining the ease of short YouTube videos with the prestige of big-name actors and creators. But it was a complete failure on all of those counts, failing to rustle up attention or praise for the short-form storytelling, which was really just long-form storytelling chopped up in 10-minute intervals. Katzenberg would end up blaming the weak April 2020 launch of Quibi on the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, claiming that lockdown had rendered his streaming service — designed for working people on the go to watch content while commuting or on their breaks — useless.</p>\n<p>But it feels like Quibi was doomed from the start — an ill-fated venture by out-of-touch executives who thought they had a finger on the pulse of streamers. It would almost be sad if it wasn&#8217;t so funny. Now, Quibi joins the echelons of expensive failed entertainment experiments, alongside <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/moviepass-charging-cards-after-shutdown/\">MoviePass</a>.
