The same can be said about children. A good sleep helps a child to wake up rested and refreshed. Good sleep not only helps to relieve stress, but also ensures a good pastime for you and your child.</p>\n<p>There are no strict rules about how to sleep and there is always possible individual adaptation. Your child is unique. If you fit a common practice, good for you. Some approaches are more effective than others. But below I provide you the most effective ones.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consider a sleep as one of the main priorities</strong> in your family and make it a part of your daily schedule. Discuss with your child’s doctor the problems connected with your child’s sleep. Most of them are very easy to solve.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn to recognize sleep problems of your child</strong>. You should pay attention to the quality of your child’s sleep, whether he wakes up at night, snores, or doesn’t want to go to sleep, etc. These sleep problems can affect a child’s behavior during the day, for example, he will be tired, cranky and will want to sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistency</strong>. As in all other cases, you must be consistent – it’s the key to success. Without it, you can’t change your child’s behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Teamwork</strong>. If both parents are engaged in child’s upbringing, it’s important to discuss the strategy and act as a team.</li>\n<li><strong>Establish a regular time when you go to bed and when you get up</strong>. These simple rules will greatly facilitate your child’s and your own life and will allow you to plan your actions in advance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is no fixed time when a child should go to sleep, because need for sleep, and lifestyles are very different from one child to another. However, you can search for the typical sleep requirements for different age groups of children, and use them as a guide. Note that these rules can’t be applied to infants and children younger than 4 months, because their biological rhythms haven’t been formed yet.</p>\n<h3>Clothes and temperature in the bedroom.</h3>\n<p>And again – there are no clear rules, but the main thing – dress your child like yourself. Also note that usually sleeping in a cool (not cold) room is much better than in the hot one.</p>\n<h3>Giving things</h3>\n<p>Sleep means separation, and this process can be facilitated by giving such things as dolls, teddy bear, blanket, etc. Your child will develop a sense of security because of this, will control the situation, and therefore will calm down quickly.</p>\n<h3>Sleeping with parents</h3>\n<p>Some parents think that for a good emotional development a child should sleep in one bed or at least in one room with them. Here are different points of view. I think this is a bad idea.</p>\n<p>Everyone sleeps better alone. Children who sleep with you in the same room or even in the same bed can’t learn to fall asleep on their own and they may have problems with sleeping in future. Also remember about snoring.</p>\n<p>A child who sleeps with you in the same bed can seriously affect your intimate and sexual life. The longer a child sleeps with you in the same bed, the more difficult it is to decide if it’s time for him to move to his room. Sleeping separately is also very important for a child to be able to form his personality.</p>\n<p><strong>Goodbye</strong>. Kids will always want to do something before going to bed – kissing, embracing, drinking some water, etc. They can be very creative. Do everything possible to avoid such situations and to do it all before they go to bed. Let your child know that if he went to bed, he must remain there.</p>\n<p><em>Any thoughts concerning the topic?

They are simple and easy to implement. And will help you to make your house a place where you will want to come back.</p>\n<h2>5 Rules for Creating Comfortable and Clean House</h2>\n<h3>1. Sort and get rid of unnecessary things.</h3>\n<p>Getting rid of trash and ordering the right things is essential to keep your house in order. Examine your house. Find a place where there’s the greatest number of accumulated junk. And dedicate 15-30 minutes a day in order to clean such a corner. Divide all things into groups: the necessary, rarely necessary and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Things from the first group should be located in the area where they can be easily reached without a long search. For rarely used items prepare the appropriate place – so that they would not interfere, but could be found by all family members.</p>\n<p>As for unnecessary things, it’s recommended to divide them into three parts: give away, throw away and not defined. And the last should be the smallest.</p>\n<h3>2. Delegate and encourage.</h3>\n<p>Involve other family members in running the household. Discuss with the family which works should be performed at home and allocate responsibilities among family members. For example, your child or spouse coming back home can buy the necessary products. If you are afraid about what will be purchased, you should do it several times together. The same applies to other cases.</p>\n<p>Encourage your family members with a kind word, a smile. Talk about how important it is what they do. Show the value of their contribution to the creation of comfort at home.</p>\n<p>And remember, planning, motivation, organization and control – is also a job. And someone must do it.</p>\n<h3>3. Clean your house gradually every day.</h3>\n<p>Another key to successful home management is the principle of regularity. Take 15-20 minutes every day for general cleaning, lay things out, wipe the dust, wipe the sink and stove.</p>\n<p>Accustom yourself and your loved ones to immediately clean up after themselves. And the house will be fresher, cleaner and more comfortable.</p>\n<h3>4. Rational use of space.</h3>\n<p>Optimize space, removing the seasonal and seldom-used things on the upper shelves. Use visualization, tagging shelves and boxes in different colors, markers, etc. Arrange a small basket for garbage in a bathroom and at your computer. This list of tips can go on, but the main thing here is your very individual approach.</p>\n<h3>5. Plan and control the execution of plans.</h3>\n<p>Household, finance (including purchases), preparing for holidays and celebrations, menus and much more – all this must be planned beforehand.</p>\n<p>As a result, you’ll be able to schedule household chores for a week with the distribution of days and responsibilities. Besides, you’ll have a list of things to do this week, but without being tied to a specific time. This schedule will be a document by which you can control the execution of all tasks at home.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.oplife.org/great-tips-to-keep-your-house-clean-and-comfortable/\"
