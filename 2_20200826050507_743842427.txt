You may remember <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/oculus-announces-plans-to-build-augmented-reality-glasses/\">years</a> of \"Oculus Connect\" <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/carmack-oculus-quests-power-is-comparable-to-xbox-360-or-ps3/\">conferences</a>, which focused on the company's efforts in virtual reality and other \"mixed reality\" mediums. That conference is dead. It's Facebook Connect now.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://tech.fb.com/introducing-the-new-facebook-reality-labs-plus-save-the-date-for-facebook-connect-on-september-16/\">a Tuesday announcement</a>, Facebook exec Andrew Bosworth cited the company's broader product portfolio as a reason to expand its conference's definition beyond Oculus. To back that claim up, however, he only cited two Facebook products: <a href=\"https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio\">Spark AR</a>, the camera-software toolset used to identify faces and add silly effects and filters, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/facebook-portal-smart-displays-put-messenger-on-your-countertop/\">Portal</a>, the company's webcam-chat hardware platform. Having attended many Oculus Connect conferences, I can safely say neither of those product lines received much focus (and attending VR-interested developers didn't express interest in it either).</p>\n<h2>Now it’s FRL, soon it’s FBOS?</h2>\n<p>What's more, Facebook used the Tuesday announcement as an opportunity to rename its <em>entire</em> Oculus VR division: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/facebookrealitylabs\">Facebook Reality Labs</a>. That name may sound familiar, since it was given to a number of skunkworks teams working on experimental VR-like features and hardware (including years of focus on 3D spatial audio at its Seattle-area office).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1701161#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1701161&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DsAKxmnx4y4:wJrM65m9Sfc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DsAKxmnx4y4:wJrM65m9Sfc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DsAKxmnx4y4:wJrM65m9Sfc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DsAKxmnx4y4:wJrM65m9Sfc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DsAKxmnx4y4:wJrM65m9Sfc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=DsAKxmnx4y4:wJrM65m9Sfc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 18:32:30 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/facebook-oculus-glitch-800x450.jpg","linkMd5":"7a9f307bbe882bbb5dbab4430d570c80","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_4/2020/08/26/05-04-36-919_458162449f442e52.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":38629,"destBytes":19908,"author":"Sam Machkovech","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/facebook-oculus-glitch-800x450.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_4/2020/08/26/05-04-36-919_458162449f442e52.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DsAKxmnx4y4:wJrM65m9Sfc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn31@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-04-54-855_b6c26cb44785d0ef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=DsAKxmnx4y4:wJrM65m9Sfc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn45@2020_4/2020/08/26/05-04-46-237_3969f72dfeb84e7e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn83@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-04-46-780_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-04-46-317_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598418257453},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 13:04:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 13:04:17","title":"FDA’s promotion of post-COVID plasma treatment was as bad as it appeared","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1701250","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228174569-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a man speaking from behind a podium.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228174569.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"683\" data-width=\"1024\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, speaking at the press conference in which he badly mangled statistics.

The move was controversial from the start, with reports indicating that the EUA was opposed by a number of health experts, including National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci. The press conference didn't settle matters, with a growing chorus of scientists saying that the data presented in support of the EUA <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/health/fda-blood-plasma.html\">had been misrepresented</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday night, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn acknowledged that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveFDA/status/1298071620414824452\">he had made a significant error</a> in presenting the benefits of the treatment, and he followed that statement with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a7f0e8aac34a860ad502912564681b7c\">an apology on Tuesday</a>. But Hahn pushed back against indications that the approval of the treatment on the eve of the Republican National Convention was motivated by political pressure.</p>\n<h2>Wrong kind of risk</h2>\n<p>The treatment at issue involves taking the antibody-containing plasma from those who have recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection (convalescent plasma) and giving it to those currently suffering from COVID-19 symptoms. At Sunday's press conference, the principle justification for allowing this treatment under an EUA was a 35 percent drop in mortality for those receiving plasma in the first three days of treatment—specifically, Hahn said 35 of 100 people \"would have been saved\" by this treatment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1701250#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1701250&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=tuww65W4cPE:fQmDdYSh56s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=tuww65W4cPE:fQmDdYSh56s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=tuww65W4cPE:fQmDdYSh56s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=tuww65W4cPE:fQmDdYSh56s:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=tuww65W4cPE:fQmDdYSh56s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=tuww65W4cPE:fQmDdYSh56s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 21:00:15 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228174569-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"a1beeabf2161c2a6df8ec441cf482122","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_4/2020/08/26/05-04-18-324_509e7ffd5b21ee70.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":99774,"destBytes":39430,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1228174569-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_4/2020/08/26/05-04-18-324_509e7ffd5b21ee70.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=tuww65W4cPE:fQmDdYSh56s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn59@2020_5/2020/08/26/05-04-46-177_a2ec2cf85e5a7e00.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=tuww65W4cPE:fQmDdYSh56s:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn42@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-04-46-349_10adf8b0f3f8b315.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn83@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-04-46-780_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-04-46-317_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598418257581},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 13:04:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 13:04:17","title":"Florida order requiring all schools to reopen was illegal, judge rules","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1701162","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getty-classroom-desks-800x449.jpg\" alt=\"A school classroom filled with empty desks.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/getty-classroom-desks.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1168\" data-width=\"2080\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Getty Images |  Mayu Tanaka | EyeEm)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Florida's state government cannot force schools to reopen this month, a judge ruled yesterday. The state's order to reopen K-12 schools disregarded safety risks posed by COVID-19 and gave schools no meaningful alternative, according to the <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/florida-school-reopen-order.pdf\">ruling</a> issued by Judge Charles Dodson of the Second Judicial Circuit in Leon County.</p>\n<p>On July 6, Florida Department of Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran issued an emergency order stating, \"Upon reopening in August, all school boards and charter school governing boards must open brick and mortar schools at least five days per week for all students.\" Schools that don't meet this requirement could lose state funding. Corcoran, Governor Ron DeSantis, and other state officials were then sued by the Florida Education Association, a statewide teachers' union; the NAACP; and several individual teachers and parents.</p>\n<p>After summarizing the health risks of reopening schools during the pandemic, the judge wrote that the state's order to reopen schools \"takes none of that into consideration. It fails to mention consideration of community transmission rates, varying ages of students, or proper precautions. What has been clearly established is there is no easy decision and opening schools will most likely increase COVID‐19 cases in Florida. Thus, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success in procuring a judgment declaring the Order is being applied arbitrarily across Florida.\"</p></div><p><a

Even iFixit says it's \"striking how much extra real estate the [Galaxy Note 20] Ultra devotes to its camera modules.\" Samsung does its best from the outside to make all the lenses look the same, but actually the center 108MP sensor is much larger than the top wide-angle sensor, and the bottom periscope camera is an even bigger sideways assembly.</p>\n<p>Multiple cameras have become a nearly mandatory marketing tool in the smartphone business, but I sure hope users are getting their money's worth out of actually using them. Every big component in a smartphone takes room away from other features or additional battery capacity (see: the headphone jack argument). With a single camera, Samsung and other manufacturers would have a lot more room to play with.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1701235#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1701235&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=l-SdXolJhNc:bX58T-CQkqY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=l-SdXolJhNc:bX58T-CQkqY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=l-SdXolJhNc:bX58T-CQkqY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=l-SdXolJhNc:bX58T-CQkqY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=l-SdXolJhNc:bX58T-CQkqY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=l-SdXolJhNc:bX58T-CQkqY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 22:05:18 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-1-980x735.jpg","linkMd5":"a68ae97fd6acdad7dc434146e323c7ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn23@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-04-27-665_c9aa3c9e2c91e264.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":735,"sourceBytes":117682,"destBytes":70116,"author":"Ron Amadeo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-1-980x735.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn23@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-04-27-665_c9aa3c9e2c91e264.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=l-SdXolJhNc:bX58T-CQkqY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn38@2020_5/2020/08/26/05-04-54-531_de62d84691a847b3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=l-SdXolJhNc:bX58T-CQkqY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/26/05-04-46-420_fc4f4f0463d0c125.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn83@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-04-46-780_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-04-46-317_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598418257453}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 13:04:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 13:04:17","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 05:04:17 +0000","fetchMs":301,"handleMs":1797,"totalMs":51875,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"bceac9edea701b3bbc15b4add9e5f9ed","hostName":"us-021*","requestId":"c7f7e781743f45c78987d26d7db9d70e_2","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":281012,"bgimgsTotal":7,"bgimgsGithubTotal":7,"articlesImgsTotal":23,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":23,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":1,"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx6":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx4":1,"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx32":1,"myreaderx3":1,"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx11":1,"myreaderx22":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx23":1,"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx30":1,"myreaderx5oss":1,"myreaderx31":1,"myreaderx29":1,"myreaderx18":1,"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 01:13:03","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/22/17-13-07-041_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
