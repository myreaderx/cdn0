And “The Vow” features an astonishing amount of footage showing Raniere and other high-level NXIVM members at work — for that reason alone, the series is worth watching for anyone interested in the NXIVM story.</p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div> \n<p>However, it’s also hampered by some unfortunate storytelling choices. For one thing, by parceling the story out over nine hour-long episode, the series often feels unnecessarily drawn out and repetitive.</p> \n<p>And by focusing on a handful of high-ranking NXIVM members who subsequently became important whistleblowers and critics (including Mark Vicente, the filmmaker responsible for a great deal of that behind-the-scenes footage), “The Vow” has also <a href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/in-the-nxivm-docuseries-showdown-seduced-is-the-clear-1845420016\">opened itself up to criticism</a> that it downplays the stories of Raniere’s true victims and obscures the extent of his crimes (unlike the Starz documentary “Seduced”) .</p> \n<p>In addition to reviewing the series, we also discuss <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/disney-73-million-subscribers/\">the latest Disney+ growth numbers</a> and the new season of “The Bachelorette.”</p> \n<p>You can listen to our review in the player below, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/original-content/id1271763098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subscribe using Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;or find us in your podcast player of choice.
