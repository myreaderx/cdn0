Some of them hang on the wall, interlocked into beautiful narratives, while others tell their stories standing free&#8230; and ALL of them are gorgeous / make me wish i knew how to use a kiln! I have questions about Emily&#8217;s childhood {because for some reason I always want to know that part!}, we talked about how she found her way to ceramics, her current process, stained glass, mushrooms, grief, grandmothers, haircuts and more. Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;ll make sense. Look/listen under that lovely photo of Emily in her studio <em>{shot by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/amberfouts/\">Amber Fouts</a> for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/luxemagazine/\">Luxe Magazine</a>}</em>, or subscribe on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/jealous-curator-art-for-your/id996338562\">Apple Podcasts</a> and/or <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2ELjX4nIVWpI3XMNW139WN\">Spotify.</a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s kick things off with the first piece of Emily&#8217;s I ever saw / instantly became obsessed with.
