Since the program started, Rachel’s team has retained more than 84 percent of the program’s participants. </p><p>We sat down with Rachel to discuss her role and the importance of diversity in the workplace. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><b>How do you explain your job at a dinner party?</b></p><p>I help underrepresented Googlers find “their happy place” at Google. It can be difficult to know where to go for career support, especially when you’re talking about a company as big and complicated as Google. But to make our products reflect our users, our employees need to be representative of all our users. Our team’s goal is to help ensure that, once they’re here, underrepresented Googlers stay and thrive. Sometimes, that means working with them to navigate a challenge in their current role, and other times, it’s connecting them to a new internal opportunity. </p><p><b>You started the retention team two years ago. What was your inspiration?</b></p><p>The program started after we learned that Black+, Latinx+ and Native American+ employees in the U.S., where Google is able to report across race, were leaving Google at faster rates than the average, and women were leaving at a faster rate globally. Prior to this role, I was the Global Community Inclusion Lead for the Black Googler Network and HOLA (now Familia), two of our employee resource groups. During that time, I saw the retention challenges firsthand, which inspired me to champion our retention efforts. Through all my time at Google, mentors and others guided me through career highs and lows, and I wanted to help others the way they helped me. </p><p><b>Talk more about the “attrition gap.” What is it and what does it mean for Google?</b></p><p>Attrition refers to the number of employees who are leaving a company. We spend a lot of time hiring, and once employees are here, we want them to stay. In order to improve overall representation, we need to improve retention. It’s our job to make sure underrepresented employees find satisfaction in their role, feel included at work and have opportunities to develop and grow. Right now, we’re the only company <a href=\"https://diversity.google/annual-report/\">reporting attrition data externally</a> and we’re using this data to inform how we approach our diversity and inclusion efforts. </p><p><b>What specific things has your team done to improve retention?</b></p><p>If an underrepresented Googler is looking for support, they are referred to our team by People Operations, Employee Resource Groups, word of mouth or direct outreach. Each Googler in the program is then matched one-on-one with a retention and progression consultant to advocate on their behalf. The consultant might serve as a mentor or coach, connect the Googler to other support options, or locate internal mobility opportunities. </p><p>For example, a Googler came to us thinking about leaving Google for a competitor. She enjoyed her role and team but wanted a career change. We connected her to a sponsor through the Black Leadership Advisory Group (BLAG), as well as the Mobility Experience team, which helps Googlers transfer to new roles, to help her find a new opportunity. Through this process, the Googler decided to stay at Google and got more involved in the Black+ leadership community. Today, she loves her new role and mentors other underrepresented Googlers on her new team. </p><p><b>What are you most proud of? </b></p><p>There is nothing more rewarding than helping Googlers find deeper career fulfillment at Google—whether in their current role, through internal mobility or making sure their feedback is heard. My team gets flooded with “thank you” notes, “you’ve changed my life” notes … Googlers seriously make me cry every day.</p><p><b>What’s next for your team?</b></p><p>As part of Google’s <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/commitments-racial-equity/\">ongoing commitments to racial equity</a>, our team will double in size, and each product area or function at the company will have a designated consultant. We’re also expanding our focus beyond retention to helping Googlers progress their careers.</p><p><b>What advice do you have for people that are a part of underrepresented groups starting out in their careers?</b></p><p></p><p>Stay focused on your purpose. No matter who you are, there will probably be many obstacles that may come your way, but staying focused on your north star will help you stay grounded.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/_FG6jUWtfIc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 22:20:00 +0000","feedId":10675,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c6ccdd169897d9eb25ea06956132b18c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/_FG6jUWtfIc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn32@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-16-48-579_21fd630366381351.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599293796652},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","title":"Measure conversions while respecting user consent choices","link":"https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/measure-conversions-while-respecting-user-consent-choices/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>With so many people around the world turning to online shopping this year, advertisers need to measure how effective their digital campaigns are at driving online sales. What’s more, data-protection authorities in Europe may now require many businesses to obtain consent from users on their digital properties for activities related to advertising and/or analytics—impacting advertisers’ understanding of how users are converting on their sites.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Last month, we <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/admanager/google-integrates-iab-europe-tcf-v2/\">shared</a> that we’ve integrated our ads systems with the IAB Europe’s <a href=\"https://iabeurope.eu/tcf-2-0/\">Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) v2.0</a>. For businesses that choose to use this method to gather user consent, Google’s ad systems will read and respect the Transparency and Consent String, so businesses can comply with applicable regulations.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>For advertisers who choose not to use TCF v2.0, we’re introducing a new solution to offer more flexibility in how they use Google tags alongside their user consent tools. Consent Mode introduces two new tag settings that manage cookies for advertising and analytics purposes for advertisers using the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/gtagjs\">global site tag</a> or <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/\">Google Tag Manager</a>. These two settings can be used to customize how Google tags behave before and after users make their consent decisions – helping advertisers more effectively measure conversions, while respecting user consent choices for ads cookies and analytics cookies.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Using Consent Mode with Google’s ad platforms</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Attributing conversions to the campaign that drove them is a key priority for advertisers. It helps them better optimize campaign bids and reallocate budget towards the best performers. With Consent Mode, advertisers can achieve greater insight into conversion data while also making sure that the Google tags helping them measure conversions are reflecting users' consent choices for ads cookies.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Once Consent Mode is implemented, advertisers will have access to a new tag setting, “ad_storage,” which controls cookie behavior for advertising purposes, including conversion measurement. If a user does not provide consent for ads cookies, Google tags will not use cookies for advertising purposes.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Let’s say someone visits your website and makes their consent selection for the use of ads cookies on your cookie consent banner. With Consent Mode, your Google tags will be able to determine whether or not permission has been given for your site to use cookies for advertising purposes for that user. If a user consents, conversion measurement reporting continues normally. If a user does not consent, the relevant Google tags will adjust accordingly and not use ads cookies, instead measuring conversions at a more aggregate level.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"E02573839-Google-GMP-Consent-Mode-Blog-Table-Aug20_v05_Google-Keyword-Blog-Inline.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/E02573839-Google-GMP-Consent-Mode-Blog-Tab.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>With Consent Mode, you can update Google tag behavior based on the user consent selection.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>With Consent Mode, campaigns running on Google Ads, Campaign Manager, Display &amp; Video 360, and Search Ads 360 will be able to continue reporting conversions – while respecting users’ consent choices for ads cookies. And because you’re able to retain conversion measurement in your campaign reporting, you’ll be able to continue attributing conversions to the right campaign and optimize your campaign bidding efficiently.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Using Consent Mode with Google Analytics</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Consent Mode also works with Google Analytics. This means that Analytics will be able to understand and respect user consent for ads cookies. For example, when the “ad_storage” tag setting is disabled for unconsented users, Analytics will not read or write ads cookies, meaning that optional features that rely on <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7532985\">Google signals</a>, like remarketing, will be disabled.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>In addition to the “ad_storage” tag setting, Consent Mode provides advertisers with a new tag setting, “analytics_storage,” which controls analytics cookie usage. Let’s say you would like to request consent for both analytics and ads cookies from users on your website. You can use Consent Mode to update Google tag behavior based on the user selection for each type of cookie. Analytics will adjust data collection based on user consent for each of the “ad_storage” and “analytics_storage” settings. For example, if a user does not provide consent for ads cookies (and therefore advertising purposes are disabled), but does provide consent for analytics cookies, advertisers will still be able to measure site behavior and conversions in Analytics as the “analytics_storage” setting will be enabled.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Getting started</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Consent Mode is available in beta to a limited number of advertisers that operate in Europe and already use the global site tag or Tag Manager. To learn more about the feature, visit our Help Center <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9976101\">here</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>If you’re interested in getting started with Consent Mode, please reach out to your Google account team. Implementing Consent Mode requires adding a few lines of code above your global site tag or Tag Manager container. To help with this process, we have partnered closely with several Consent Management Platforms. A few are already integrated with Consent Mode and are ready to help.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"cmp logo 1200.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/cmp_logo_1200.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Consent Management Platforms that are already integrated with Consent Mode.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Changes designed to improve user privacy are continuing to impact the digital advertising ecosystem, and we’re committed to helping your business navigate this new environment.

In 2017 alone, more than 1.1 million women-led businesses generated nearly $1.5 billion in revenue and created more than 10 million jobs across the United States.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Despite this rapid growth and enormous potential, women-led companies across the US and Canada face disproportionate challenges when it comes to scaling and expansion. There are nearly three times more men-owned companies that employ 50 or more people compared to companies that are owned by women—and among the small group of women-owned businesses that do reach this size, the founders are disproportionately white women. In Canada, data showed that companies with under 20 employees have been the hardest hit during the current pandemic and, as women are more likely to own newer and smaller businesses, the impact on women founders is more significant than their male counterparts.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>To learn more about the current state of women’s entrepreneurship—and identify how we can level the playing field for success for female founders of all backgrounds—Google for Startups teamed up with Endeavor Insight for the <a href=\"https://endeavor.org/content/uploads/2015/06/Women-in-Entrepreneurship-Report-Endeavor-Insight-and-Google.pdf\">2020 Women in Entrepreneurship Report</a>. Intended to offer practical steps on how to better support women founders, this research included interviews and surveys of more than 1,000 business leaders, conversations with organizations that support women, a review of existing entrepreneurship studies, and analyses of national data. The report also reveals the potential economic and social benefits that could be gained if women were to achieve gender equality in entrepreneurship.

The dataset includes trends at the U.S. county-level from the past three years in order to make the insights more helpful to public health, and so researchers can account for changes in searches due to seasonality.</p><br/><p>Public health currently uses a range of datasets to track and forecast the spread of COVID-19. Researchers could use this dataset to study if search trends can provide an earlier and more accurate indication of the reemergence of the virus in different parts of the country. And since measures such as shelter-in-place have reduced the accessibility of care and affected people’s wellbeing more generally, this dataset—which covers a broad range of symptoms and conditions, from diabetes to stress—could also be useful in studying the secondary health effects of the pandemic.</p><p>The dataset is available in Google Cloud's <a href=\"http://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-datasets/covid19-search-trends\">COVID-19 Free Public Dataset Program</a> and is downloadable in CSV format from Google Research at <a href=\"http://goo.gle/covid19symptomdataset\">Open COVID-19 Data GitHub repository</a>. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Advancing health research with privacy protections</h3><p>The COVID-19 Search Trends symptoms dataset is powered by the same anonymization technology that we use in the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/\">Community Mobility Reports</a> and other Google products every day. No personal information or individual search queries are included. The dataset was produced using <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfAdemDkLsc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">differential privacy</a>, a state-of-the-art technique that adds random noise to the data to provide privacy guarantees while preserving the overall quality of the data.</p><p>Similar to <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US\">Google Trends</a>, the data is normalized based on a symptom’s relative popularity, allowing researchers to study spikes in search interest over different time periods, without exposing any individual query or even the number of queries in any given area. </p><p>More information about the privacy methods used to generate the dataset can be found in <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-public-data-symptom-search/Google%20COVID-19%20Search%20Trends%20Symptoms%20Dataset%20-%20Anonymization%20Process%20Description.pdf\">this report</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>What’s next</h3><p>This early release is limited to the United States and covers searches made in English and Spanish.

In the fall, you see boots and flannels appear; in winter, we break out the cable knit sweaters. Come spring, light jackets start showing up, and summer means it’s time for shorts and sandals. But this year, I’ve been wearing a nearly uninterrupted uniform of workout clothes since March.</p><p>I wanted to see how widespread the effect of quarantine was on personal style, so I turned to Google Trends to find out. Here’s a look at some of the latest fashion-related Google Trends that people are searching for:</p><p>While searching for shorts seems like the status quo for hot summer months, according to Google Trends, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AD-FnEyc109dmMI8mL9L7-fOosSkwX3nKpxvBIXTTW3c7aOU_S_kYZ-Y3icd9PCkCaiuKo60vagYn-soMF9cIfdKk0ZelrJPHBu0Eo2UiDHBlv0RQpLLEuccOWOs8inArk3xJshVpqSFdTxeSmPNhK1nJokrz3V6mV5E5V4\">search interest in “shorts”</a> reached an all-time high this June in the U.S. More specifically, “biker shorts” was the most searched type of shorts over the past three months (interestingly, we also saw an increase in <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F01sgl\">search interest</a> for “cycling” in March). “Biker shorts” was followed by “short shorts,” “running shorts” (my personal faves)—though “denim shorts” and “cargo shorts” followed next, so apparently there is still some interest in “real” clothes out there.</p><p>One garment has remained buried in my dresser for quite some time now: pants. So I wasn’t surprised to see that while search interest in pants isn’t currently at an all-time low, there was a significant dip in the U.S. in March...which certainly corresponds with the period of time that sheltering in place caused me to move in a comfier direction. Meanwhile, even though much of the U.S. is currently experiencing warmer temps, search interest in <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-05-26%202020-08-26,2019-05-26%202019-08-26,2018-05-26%202018-08-26&amp;geo=US,US,US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F056f2w,%2Fm%2F056f2w,%2Fm%2F056f2w\">“sweatpants”</a> has been much higher this summer than it was the previous two years; same goes for <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-05-26%202020-08-26,2019-05-26%202019-08-26,2018-05-26%202018-08-26&amp;geo=US,US,US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0142wf,%2Fm%2F0142wf,%2Fm%2F0142wf\">pajamas</a>:</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Quarantine styles sweatpants google trends\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screenshot_2020-09-01_at_10.11.34_PM.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Quarantine styles pajamas Google Trends\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screenshot_2020-09-01_at_10.11.42_PM.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Of course, pre-quarantine fashion pieces have taken a hit: Searches for <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F02c66t\">wedding dresses</a>, <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0280yrc\">tuxedos</a> and <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m,2019-05-25%202019-08-25,2018-05-25%202018-08-25&amp;geo=US,US,US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F01rkbr,%2Fm%2F01rkbr,%2Fm%2F01rkbr\">neckties</a> are all down.

In 2020, many of us have found digital tools to be a real lifeline. We've used them to connect with loved ones and teach our children during lockdown. Governments have used them to share vital information with citizens. And businesses across Europe are using them to reach customers and <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/grow-with-google/free-tools-and-training-help-economic-recovery-europe-middle-east-and-africa/\">recover more quickly</a> and sustainably. As we look to the future, it's important that regulation keeps pace with change, and Google supports Europe's effort to create a more responsible, innovative and helpful internet for everyone.</p>\n  <p>That's why we are <a href=\"https://blog.google/documents/89/Googles_submission_on_the_Digital_Services_Act_package_1.pdf\">submitting our response today</a> to the consultation for the European Digital Services Act (DSA), drawing on our 20+ years experience in building technology that both helps people and creates greater <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/helping-europeans-succeed-googles-impact-in-europe/\">economic opportunity</a>. Well-designed regulation gives consumers confidence that their interests are being protected as they shop, search and socialize online. It also provides businesses with protection from opaque or unfair practices.</p>\n  <p>Our response encourages European policymakers to build on the success of the e-Commerce Directive and focus on three key areas:&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>A more responsible internet: Introducing clearer rules for notifying platforms of illegal content while protecting fundamental rights of expression and access to information&nbsp;</li>\n   <li>A more innovative internet: Encouraging <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/grow-with-google/free-tools-and-training-help-economic-recovery-europe-middle-east-and-africa/\">economic growth</a> and innovation by enabling Europeans to build the next generation of apps, businesses and services, and exporting European creativity and culture around the world</li>\n   <li>A more helpful internet: <a href=\"https://blog.google/documents/88/Googles_submission_on_a_New_Competition_Tool.pdf\">Competition regulation</a> which supports product innovations, helps people manage their data and provides businesses with the tools to grow&nbsp;</li>\n  </ul>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>A more responsible internet</b></p>\n  <p>Because of our commitment to safety, we invest heavily in technology and people to combat illegal content, and we welcome an updated legal framework. We would encourage legislators to&nbsp; provide greater clarity on the rules, roles and responsibilities of online platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>The e-Commerce Directive set vital ground rules for conduct and responsibility online, which helped online innovation thrive. Whether an individual is claiming defamation, a studio is claiming that a video infringes on copyright or a government is seeking to remove a terrorist video, it’s essential to provide clear notice about the specific piece of content to the online platform.&nbsp; The platform then has a responsibility to take appropriate action on that content. This is especially important given the significant differences in what is considered illegal content across EU Member States.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>We are continually seeking to improve our technical systems and processes to identify illegal content. While breakthroughs in machine learning and other technology have <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/responsible-policy-enforcement-during-covid-19/\">significantly enhanced our ability to detect bad content</a>, such technology is still unable to reliably understand context, which is often critical in determining whether or not content is legal, for example distinguishing violent content from a human rights organization documenting abuses. Mandated use of such technology would lead to overblocking of Europeans’ speech and access to information. This is why platforms should be encouraged to further invest in these innovations while retaining the invaluable nuance and judgment that comes with human input.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Google's products are designed to encourage people to share their views safely and respectfully, and have been a force for creativity, learning and expression. In order to ensure that fundamental rights are respected, it's important for the DSA to focus on capturing illegal content, so lawful speech isn't caught in the net. However, this should not prevent further actions on lawful-but-harmful content, such as cyber-bullying, through self- and co-regulatory initiatives, such as the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/working-together-fight-disinformation_online/\">EU Code of Practice on Disinformation</a> and the <a href=\"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitment-to-fighting-illegal-hate_39/\">EU Code of Conduct on Hate Speech</a>, both of which Google joined from the start. Google also invests in easy-to-use reporting processes and clear guidelines to help ensure a positive online experience.</p>\n  <p>We are committed to providing greater transparency for our users and governments so that they better understand the content they are seeing and how to notify us of concerns. The DSA should support these kinds of constructive transparency measures while ensuring that platforms can continue to protect user privacy, ensure commercially sensitive information is not revealed and prevent bad actors from gaming the system. Google has long been a leader in transparency, including disclosing data on content moderation, <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/government-removals/overview\">content removal requests</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/stopping-bad-ads-to-protect-users/\">blocking bad ads</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b><br /></b></p>\n  <p><b>A more innovative internet</b></p>\n  <p>The e-Commerce Directive, which the DSA will update, has guided Internet services, users and European society through 20 years of economic growth fueled by innovation, including entirely new industries ranging from app developers to YouTube creators.&nbsp; The next wave of online innovation will play a vital role in helping people, governments and businesses overcome the many challenges - medical, societal, economic - that come with a global pandemic.</p>\n  <p>To foster innovation, the DSA should reflect the wide range of services offered by the tech industry. No two services are the same and the new act should be rooted in objectives and principles that can be applied, as appropriate, across this broad, diverse ecosystem.&nbsp; This will ensure that everyone - platforms regulators, people and businesses -&nbsp; are responsible for the parts they play.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <p><b>A more helpful internet</b></p>\n  <p>People want to save time and get things done when they are online. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/\">Our testing</a> has consistently shown that people want quick access to information, so over the years we’ve developed new ways to organize and display results. For example, when you are searching online for a restaurant, you can at the same time quickly access directions because a map has been integrated into Google’s Search results pages - saving you the time and effort of a second search through a map app or website. Integrations also help small businesses to be found more easily and to provide relevant information to their customers such as <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/grow-with-google/free-tools-and-training-help-economic-recovery-europe-middle-east-and-africa/\">delivery, curbside pickup or takeaway options</a> during lockdown periods, and can help people in times of emergency such as the <a href=\"https://crisisresponse.google/emergencylocationservice/how-it-works/\">Android Emergency location feature</a>. New rules should encourage new and improved features and products which help European consumers get things done and access information quickly and easily.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Artboard 1@2x (1).jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Artboard_12x_1.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>European startups and entrepreneurs also need online tools to help grow their businesses more easily and at a lower cost.

As the Commission updates its regulations, it should ensure new rules don't add undue cost and burden for European businesses in ways that make it harder to scale quickly and offer their services across the EU and around the world.</p>\n  <p>We agree that competition between digital platforms is strengthened by measures that allow people to move between platforms without losing access to their data, which also makes it easier for new players to enter or expand in digital markets. Google offers a wide range of tools that allow people to be in control of their online experience, such as Google&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Account\">“My Account”</a>, which helps users choose the privacy settings that are right for them, or Google&nbsp;<a href=\"https://takeout.google.com/\">Takeout</a>, which allows users to export their data. Similarly, providing access to aggregated datasets could&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/research/open-source-and-open-data/\">benefit R&amp;D in a range of industries</a>&nbsp;while safeguarding user data privacy.

I continued exploring computing while attending Wilkes University as a Business Administration major through work-study at the campus computer lab.  </p><p>My fledgling interest in technology took a hiatus when I left college early and joined the U.S. Army, where I served as an Infantry Scout/Sniper in the 10th Mountain Division based at Fort Drum, New York. I just missed Desert Storm, but I deployed to South Florida as part of Joint Task Force Andrew, Somalia for Operation Restore Hope and Haiti for Operation Restore Democracy.  </p><p>After leaving the Army, I renewed my interest in computing, started earning industry certifications and became a help desk analyst. Starting in that role gave me an incredible opportunity to learn, as I worked my way through positions ranging from systems administrator to network engineer to IT director and cloud consultant before coming to Google. </p><p><b>What’s your role at Google?</b></p>I’m a <a href=\"https://goo.gle/3jYiDT3\">Technical Account Manager</a> (TAM) in <a href=\"https://goo.gle/2D6XjKG\">Google Cloud</a>’s Professional Services Organization (PSO). I’m based out of the Google office in <a href=\"https://goo.gle/2EDLbkO\">Reston, Virginia</a>. What I enjoy most about my role is working closely with customers at all levels—strategic, tactical and operational—to get the most value out of Google Cloud Platform and help solve their biggest problems. One exciting project I’m working on is helping a global energy company that is using Google Cloud to help accelerate their growth and transition to more sustainable and renewable power.<p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"IMG_2181.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_2181.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Eric at Noogler (new Googler) orientation.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><b>Why did you decide to apply to work at Google?</b></p><p>As cloud computing grew, I set a personal goal to work for one of the top cloud service providers. Google was at the top of that list because of what I knew about the innovative culture and talented people. Just as I was preparing to apply, a Google recruiter reached out and asked if I was interested. The timing was perfect and I felt like my career was coming full circle especially since I moved to Washington, D.C. and started my IT career the same year that Google was founded!</p><p><b>How did the recruitment process go for you? </b></p><p>The recruitment process was exceptionally smooth. My recruiter was great at answering any and all questions, giving feedback and providing tips on the interview process. While the interviews were tough, it was the best hiring process I’ve experienced.</p><p><b>What do you wish you’d known when you started the process?</b></p><p>Google is great for veterans! After I came onboard, I joined the Google Veterans Network (VetNet), an internal community of military veterans and civilian allies, dedicated to unifying, connecting and serving the military community. Also, I’m currently helping mentor veterans interested in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/certification\">Google Cloud Certification</a> through a program called <a href=\"https://vetsintech.co/\">VetsInTech</a>. When fellow Vets ask me about jobs at Google, I tell them what a supportive environment it is and send them to <a href=\"http://g.co/vets\">g.co/vets</a>.</p><p><b>What inspires you to come in every day?</b></p><p>Every day I’m inspired by the opportunity to help customers succeed, work with amazing people, and help grow Google Cloud.</p><p><b>Do you have any tips you’d like to share with aspiring Googlers?</b></p><p>Preparation breeds confidence. Interviewing at Google can be stressful, but if you prepare and practice it is much less so. Don’t be afraid to ask questions throughout the process, including during the interview when you need clarification.</p><p><br/></p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/moExeINomY8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":10675,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_2181.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"2a81cf34afd563c585cdc8afa5352180","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn61@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-16-36-828_f4ffb0d480adca08.webp","destWidth":750,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":61039,"destBytes":32222,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_2181.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn61@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-16-36-828_f4ffb0d480adca08.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/moExeINomY8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn12@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-16-48-558_174a7e78b6ac46f6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599293796652},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","title":"Explore Kids Space: A way to nurture your kid's curiosity","link":"https://blog.google/technology/families/kids-space/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Parents have told us that they’re constantly wrestling with the role of technology in their children’s lives, and this is especially true for the many families who are spending more time at home.

When you hop in your car or on your motorbike and start navigating, you’re instantly shown a few things: which way to go, whether the traffic along your route is heavy or light, an estimated travel time, and an estimated time of arrival (ETA). While all of this appears simple, there’s a ton going on behind the scenes to deliver this information in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Today, we’ll break down one of our favorite topics: traffic and routing. If you’ve ever wondered just how Google Maps knows when there’s a massive traffic jam or how we determine the best route for a trip, read on. <br/></p><p><b>Live traffic, powered by drivers all around the world</b><br/></p><p>When people navigate with Google Maps, aggregate location data can be used to understand traffic conditions on roads all over the world. But while this information helps you find <i>current</i> traffic estimates —whether or not a traffic jam will affect your drive <i>right now</i>—it doesn’t account for what traffic will look like 10, 20, or even 50 minutes into your journey. This is where technology really comes into play.</p><p><b>Predicting traffic with advanced machine learning techniques, and a little bit of history</b></p><p>To predict what traffic will look like in the near future, Google Maps analyzes historical traffic patterns for roads over time. For example, one pattern may show that the 280 freeway in Northern California typically has vehicles traveling at a speed of 65mph between 6-7am, but only at 15-20mph in the late afternoon. We then combine this database of historical traffic patterns with live traffic conditions, using machine learning to generate predictions based on both sets of data. </p><p>Recently, we partnered with DeepMind, an Alphabet AI research lab, to improve the accuracy of our traffic prediction capabilities. Our ETA predictions already have a very high accuracy bar–in fact, we see that our predictions have been consistently accurate for over 97% of trips. By partnering with DeepMind, we’ve been able to cut the percentage of inaccurate ETAs even further by using a machine learning architecture known as Graph Neural Networks–with <a href=\"http://deepmind.com/blog/article/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks\">significant improvements</a> in places like Berlin, Jakarta, São Paulo, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington D.C. This technique is what enables Google Maps to better predict whether or not you’ll be affected by a slowdown that <i>may not have even started yet</i>! </p><p><b>Keeping it fresh</b></p><p>For most of the <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/bright-side-of-sitting-in-traffic.html\">13 years</a> that Google Maps has provided traffic data, historical traffic patterns have been reliable indicators of what your conditions on the road could look like—but that's not always the case. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, traffic patterns around the globe have shifted dramatically. We saw up to a 50 percent decrease in worldwide traffic when lockdowns started in early 2020. Since then, parts of the world have reopened gradually, while others maintain restrictions. To account for this sudden change, we’ve recently updated our models to become more agile—automatically prioritizing historical traffic patterns from the last two to four weeks, and deprioritizing patterns from any time before that.</p><p><b>How Google Maps selects routes</b></p><p>Our predictive traffic models are also a key part of how Google Maps determines driving routes. If we predict that traffic is likely to become heavy in one direction, we’ll automatically find you a lower-traffic alternative. We also look at a number of other factors, like road quality. Is the road paved or unpaved, or covered in gravel, dirt or mud? Elements like these can make a road difficult to drive down, and we’re less likely to recommend this road as part of your route. We also look at the size and directness of a road—driving down a highway is often more efficient than taking a smaller road with multiple stops.</p><p>Two other sources of information are important to making sure we recommend the best routes: authoritative data from local governments and real-time feedback from users. Authoritative data lets Google Maps know about speed limits, tolls, or if certain roads are restricted due to things like construction or <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/get-around-safely-these-new-google-maps-features/\">COVID-19</a>. And incident reports from drivers let Google Maps quickly show if a road or lane is closed, if there’s construction nearby, or if there’s a disabled vehicle or an object on the road. Both sources are also used to help us understand when road conditions change unexpectedly due to mudslides, snowstorms, or other forces of nature.<br/></p><p><b>Putting it all together</b><br/></p><p>So how exactly does this all work in real life? Say you’re heading to a doctor’s appointment across town, driving down the road you typically take to get there. When you leave the house, traffic is flowing freely, with zero indication of any disruptions along the way. With Google Maps’ traffic predictions combined with live traffic conditions, we let you know that if you continue down your current route, there’s a good chance you’ll get stuck in unexpected gridlock traffic about 30 minutes into your ride—which would mean missing your appointment. As a result, Google Maps automatically reroutes you using its knowledge about nearby road conditions and incidents—helping you avoid the jam altogether and get to your appointment on time.</p><p>Predicting traffic and determining routes is incredibly complex—and we'll keep working on tools and technology to keep you out of gridlock, and on a route that's as safe and efficient as possible.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/pfXJKojO4YM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":10675,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a3d9368fbe07ca6c84c1748a0dd0234f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/pfXJKojO4YM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn28@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-16-48-436_a21c74ad4b5ad5f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599293796652},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","title":"Partnering with NSF on human-AI collaboration","link":"https://blog.google/technology/ai/partnering-nsf-human-ai-collaboration/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Today, in partnership with the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), we are announcing a National AI Research Institute for Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration.

In the past few years we’ve seen the increasing use of AI to support people and their decision making in sectors like medicine, education, transportation and agriculture. Conversely, people also support AI systems and their decision making through training data and model design, testing and operation, and continued feedback and iteration on system performance.

In June, just in time for the monsoon season, we reached an important milestone: our systems now extend to the whole of India, with Google technology being used to improve the targeting of every alert the government sends. This means we can help better protect more than 200 million people across more than 250,000 square kilometers—more than 20 times <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/tracking-our-progress-on-flood-forecasting/\">our coverage last year</a>. To date, we’ve sent out around 30 million notifications to people in flood-affected areas. </p><p>In addition to expanding in India, we’ve partnered with the <a href=\"http://www.hydrology.bwdb.gov.bd/\">Bangladesh Water Development Board</a> to bring our warnings and services to Bangladesh, which experiences more flooding than any other country in the world. We currently cover more than 40 million people in Bangladesh, and we’re working to extend this to the whole country. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Flood forecasting map\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/pasted_image_0_7_raLW0zb.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Coverage areas of our current operational flood forecasting systems.

One survey we conducted found that 65 percent of people who receive flood warnings before the flooding begins take action to protect themselves or their assets (such as evacuating or moving their belongings). But we’ve also found there’s a lot more we could be doing to help—including getting alerts to people faster, and providing additional information about the severity of floods.</p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"pasted image 0 (8).png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/pasted_image_0_8_CiVBkhL.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Checking how our flood warnings match conditions on the ground.

And in areas where we can produce depth maps throughout the floodplain, we’re sharing information about depth in the user’s village or area.</p><p>We’ve also overhauled the way our alerts look and function to make sure they’re useful and accessible for everyone. We now provide the information in different formats, so that people can both read their alerts and see them presented visually; we’ve added support for Hindi, Bengali and seven other local languages; we’ve made the alert more localized and accurate; and we now allow for easy changes to language or location.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"flood forecasting alerts.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/flood_forecasting_alerts.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Alerts for flood forecasting</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Partnering for greater impact </h3><p>In addition to improving our alerts, Google.org has started a collaboration with the <a href=\"https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/\">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a>. This partnership aims to build local networks that can get disaster alert information to people who wouldn’t otherwise receive smartphone alerts directly. </p><p>Of course, for all the progress we’ve made with alert technology, there are still a lot of challenges to overcome. With the flood season still in full swing in India and Bangladesh, COVID-19 has delayed critical infrastructure work, added to the immense pressure on first responders and medical authorities, and disrupted the in-person networks that many people still rely on for advance notice when a flood is on the way.</p><p>There’s much more work ahead to strengthen the systems that so many vulnerable people rely on—and expand them to reach more people in flood-affected areas. Along with our partners around the world, we will continue developing, maintaining and improving technologies and digital tools to help protect communities and save lives.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/oiGmYJah7fM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":10675,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/pasted_image_0_7_raLW0zb.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"31c1978192f47244f3d47d02641ca022","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn10@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-16-36-926_026f2fe21b48d321.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":836,"sourceBytes":927462,"destBytes":120290,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/pasted_image_0_7_raLW0zb.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn10@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-16-36-926_026f2fe21b48d321.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/pasted_image_0_8_CiVBkhL.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn32@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-16-48-679_07020b51bd995d5b.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/flood_forecasting_alerts.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn24@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-16-48-755_c0893c69541766df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/oiGmYJah7fM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn52@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-16-48-440_9f9abae0a2c3986c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599293796652},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","title":"Playlists that bring the news home","link":"https://blog.google/products/assistant/your-news-update-google-podcasts/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Podcasting is more popular than ever, and news is the <a href=\"http://analytics.podtrac.com/blog/2020/5/4/weekly-podcast-data-amid-the-coronavirus-crisis-update-through-may-3-2020\">fastest-growing category</a> in podcasts. But there often tends to be a focus on national and broader news topics; it’s harder to find on-demand quality audio journalism at the local level, or about things that are personally relevant to listeners. </p><p>We want to help bridge that gap with new, intelligent audio news experiences that deliver local stories and more personalized content.

This format helps people hear stories from a variety of local and national publishers all in one place. <br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>Listening to local news on Google Assistant</h3><p>The news cycle is currently dominated by topics like COVID-19, racial injustice and the recent hurricanes and wildfires, and while these stories all have important national angles, they're also directly affecting people's lives and local communities. Local stories already feature prominently in Your News Update, but now we’re also making it easier for people in the U.S. to listen to local news with the help of Google Assistant. Just ask your Google Nest smart speaker “Hey Google, play local news” or “Hey Google, play news about [your city],” and you’ll hear a mix of native audio and text-to-speech local news stories. </p><p>To help you listen to text-based stories more easily, this feature uses new text-to-speech voices that sound more natural and well-suited for reading the news—think of it as our version of a newscaster. This new voice model was trained on reading longer segments of text and goes beyond just reading words out loud by incorporating voice pitch, sound length and stress on certain words and syllables. With this new technology, we can convert a wealth of content to audio for listeners while giving it a human touch.</p><p>Whether you’re listening on your commute, during a walk or in your home, we’re working to provide smarter, compelling news experiences made just for you. </p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/8BSw2CQRQOI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":10675,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/podcast_device_8_31_2020_nowhite_i1x.gif","linkMd5":"19984f837251892da2f8c7e7e41184ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn6@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-16-44-900_94367e88b4dd54a7.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":1322519,"destBytes":1483294,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/podcast_device_8_31_2020_nowhite_i1x.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn6@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-16-44-900_94367e88b4dd54a7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/8BSw2CQRQOI":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599293796652},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","title":"Digital talent and Taiwan’s economic recovery","link":"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/digital-talent-and-taiwans-economic-recovery/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Taiwanese graduate Katie knows the power of self-belief. As COVID-19 hit towards the end of her time at university, she was worried about the prospects of getting a job and nervous going into her interviews with potential employers. In the end, it wasn’t just her technical skills that helped her get a role with Phillips Taiwan—it was her ability to explain what she offered them, something she’d learned in the <a href=\"https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage\">Google Digital Garage</a> training program. \"There are many topics, but the one I especially remember is about building your confidence — that’s even more important with the need for online interviews during a pandemic,” Katie said.  </p><br/><p>Taiwan’s response to COVID-19 was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/15/how-taiwan-beat-the-coronavirus.html\">fast and effective</a>, but the economic impact of the pandemic means that many Taiwanese share Katie’s concerns about what comes next.

Students are now back in the classroom, but Taiwan wants to help its teachers continue to improve their ability to use digital tools through programs like the <a href=\"https://www.junyiacademy.org/event/junyi-x-google-remote-learning-package/\">Cloud Innovation Teacher Training Program</a>: an initiative with <a href=\"https://official.junyiacademy.org/\">Junyi Academy</a> and Taipei City to train 600 teachers from 300 schools. Junyi is also working to incorporate Google’s <a href=\"https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/s/en/home\">CS First</a> computer science curriculum in Taiwanese primary schools, so kids can grasp the fundamentals of technology as part of their education. </p><br/><p><b>Advancing knowledge</b></p><br/><p>Taiwan has great potential in fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning, with a talented generation of Taiwanese developers beginning to come through. To meet their appetite for new skills, we and our partners are developing programs like <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/goo-bucket-1/202006/200609-aibootcamp/ai_public.html?fbclid=IwAR3m8A1Dybf3jVXUc_JHoFVtyXt4f0qPNtH4tyPgIfNvH2bff3QXAFs09L0\">AI Boot Camp</a> — a joint initiative with the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Artificial Intelligence Research Center — the <a href=\"https://events.withgoogle.com/ml-study-jam-basic-tw/\">ML Study Jam</a> program, and the Google <a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en_cn/university/taiwan/\">University Relations Program</a>, which provides university scholarships. </p><br/><p>With these new and expanded efforts, we hope to contribute to a strong economic recovery from COVID-19, and continue creating new digital opportunities for all Taiwanese in the years ahead.  </p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/_f3irb_7g18\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 +0000","feedId":10675,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/2019.11.30_0880.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"60c709adf9da0d6d6cc54a759f170251","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn66@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-16-36-950_417e52b4ab821afd.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":667,"sourceBytes":71661,"destBytes":37334,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/2019.11.30_0880.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn66@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-16-36-950_417e52b4ab821afd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/_f3irb_7g18":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-16-48-435_09f3a3fd3a16f17d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599293796652},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:16:36","title":"Learn how to find image licensing information on Google Images","link":"https://blog.google/products/search/learn-how-find-image-licensing-information-google-images/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Google Images is a great place to find visual inspiration and useful web pages to help make your ideas a reality. Sometimes, bringing your ideas to life requires finding an image you can use—like when you’re looking to communicate a message, decorate a space or do something creative on the web. But with a seemingly infinite number of images online, finding the right image to use, and knowing how to use that image responsibly, isn’t always a simple task. </p><br/><p>After collaborating closely with image creators, stock image providers and digital content associations, we’re launching several new features on Google Images to address this need. These features will make finding the right image to use, as well as guidelines for how to license an image for your business or personal project, much easier than before.</p><br/><p>First, we’re making it easier to find licensable images. For results where the publisher or image creator provided licensing information, we will display a “licensable” badge over the image. When you select a badged image to view, we will show a link to the license details of the image, and if provided by the publisher, you’ll also find a link to where you can purchase or license the image. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Final_1800sq_Licensable_SRP_and_Viewer_shadow.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Final_1800sq_Licensable_SRP_and_Viewer_sha.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>You can also filter results to only return those images that include licensing information.

select an image to view on Google Images and it’s made available by the publisher.</p><br/>Image creators, licensors and publishers can learn more about these features, including implementation steps
