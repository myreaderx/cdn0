nation mourns the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman ever appointed to the prestigious seat. Her death at age 87 marks the end of a remarkable 27-year tenure in the United States’ highest court, despite her years-long cancer battle. Film fans have two primary sources with which to celebrate the life of the feminist icon known in some circles as The Notorious R.B.G, namely the lauded 2018 documentary <strong>RBG</strong> as well as the biopic <strong>On the Basis of Sex</strong> starring Felicity Jones and Armie Hammer from that same year. Betsy West and Julie Cohen, who directed <strong>RBG</strong>, released a statement this evening…</p>\n<p><em><strong>“Like so many Americans, we are crushed by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,”</strong></em> <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/09/rbg-reaction-ruth-bader-ginsburg-death-documentary-directors-1234579957/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">West and Cohen said jointly</a>. <em><strong>“Even had she not become a Supreme Court Justice, Ginsburg earned a place in history for what she did to win equality for American women. When we asked her several years ago how she wanted to be remembered, she said with characteristic modesty, ‘Just as someone who did whatever she could, with whatever limited talent she had, to move society along in the direction I would like it to be for my children and grandchildren.’ ”</strong></em></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1149269\" src=\"https://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/xJXjSQbQxyYkX2YA1wlllYYpoaP-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/xJXjSQbQxyYkX2YA1wlllYYpoaP-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000.jpg 640w, https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/xJXjSQbQxyYkX2YA1wlllYYpoaP-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000-140x79.jpg 140w, https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/xJXjSQbQxyYkX2YA1wlllYYpoaP-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000-227x128.jpg 227w, https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/xJXjSQbQxyYkX2YA1wlllYYpoaP-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000-311x175.jpg 311w, https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/xJXjSQbQxyYkX2YA1wlllYYpoaP-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000-310x174.jpg 310w, https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/xJXjSQbQxyYkX2YA1wlllYYpoaP-1200-1200-675-675-crop-000000-480x270.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></img></p>\n<h3>KYLIE HEMMERT’S RECOMMEND: Prisoners</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GT0MVIE/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=comingsoon&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00GT0MVIE&#38;linkId=2e5a15dd4079e0af3e24d9654ed1390b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to purchase!</a></p>\n<p>Denis Villeneuve’s Oscar-nominated mystery thriller <strong>Prisoners</strong> features some of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal’s best performances onscreen. The story follows Jackman’s character as he takes matters into his own hands after his daughter and her friend go missing while Gyllenhaal’s Detective Loki pursues multiple leads as the pressure mounts to solve the case and find the missing girls. Boasting a fantastic ensemble cast (including Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano), the character-driven drama explores the darkest corners of human nature, particularly how seemingly good people can sometimes cross irredeemable lines when driven by anguish, revenge, and desperation.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1149270\" src=\"https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/thumbnail-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/thumbnail-1.png 640w, https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/thumbnail-1-632x474.png 632w, https://cdn3-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/thumbnail-1-536x402.png 536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></img></p>\n<h3>GRANT HERMANNS’ RECOMMEND: Lethal Weapon Season 1</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KU7SCIY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=comingsoon&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B01KU7SCIY&#38;linkId=5f1db23c24f28ab6f42fd00071137ba0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to purchase!</a></p>\n<p>As we gear up for the exciting return of Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Richard Donner for a fifth installment in the hit action-comedy film franchise, I think it’s high time we go back and give Fox’s small-screen adaptation of<strong> Lethal Weapon</strong> a second chance, namely its first season. Arriving on the heels of the lackluster TV adaptation of<strong> Rush Hour</strong>, I had no expectations for a series based on one of the best buddy cop films in the genre and found myself very surprised by how well the pilot worked and to see how it just continued to bloom and improve from episode to episode really made the show an absolute joy to watch week to week, especially for the chemistry between stars Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford. Combining explosive action, outrageous comedy and a further evolution of its fan-favorite duo than the films generally had time for, <strong>Lethal Weapon</strong> was truly an outstanding series for both fans of the franchise and newcomers.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1149268\" src=\"https://cdn1-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/462649ecd5e4a01ce4a0a5c07cc7674a.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"267\"></img></p>\n<h3>MAGGIE DELA PAZ’S RECOMMEND: Election (1999)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0023CIY0G/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=comingsoon&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B0023CIY0G&#38;linkId=75194c0111e8db368c9d81b975179af4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to purchase!</a></p>\n<p>Starring Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick, <strong>Election</strong> centers around a high school election where an overachieving senior named Tracy Flick tries her best to become the student body president. However, her easy path to victory gets immediately undermined due to her teacher Jim McAllister’s unreasonable resentment against her. To give Tracy a run for her money, Jim encourages popular football player Paul Metzler to also run for presidency. As Jim gets distracted with the election and his childish hate towards Tracy, he doesn’t seem to realize that his personal life is also getting affected by it.</p>\n<p>This 1999 black comedy film is easily one of Witherspoon’s best performances before becoming a full-fledged A-lister she is known today. Her effective portrayal of a determined and egotistic know-it-all student would definitely make the audience get annoyed with the character while also at the same time, making her a favorite among its cast. As for Broderick, it’s funny and ironic to see him portray a role that is the total opposite of his iconic 80s’ character Ferris Bueller.</p>\n<p>Even though the film had a poor box office performance, it still garnered critical acclaim and had earned director Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. In addition to Witherspoon and Broderick, it also featured Chris Klein and then break-out star Jessica Campbell, who both also gave charming performances as Paul Metzler and Tammy Metzler. However, like other early high-school comedy films during the 80s up to the 2000s, this film does feature a few red-flagged moments. But despite that, it is still an entertaining movie that will appeal to people who are obsessed with old teen films such as <strong>Mean Girls</strong>. With only two months to go before the upcoming U.S. presidential election, I think now is the perfect time for you to check out or revisit <strong>Election</strong>!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1149271\" src=\"https://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/09/cod-modern-warfare-remastered_mp_overgrown-1_wm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\"></img></p>\n<h3>JEFF AMES’ RECOMMEND: Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072FP29S9/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=comingsoon&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B072FP29S9&#38;linkId=8722100ce1594f711a19bdbb0c9496b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to purchase!</a></p>\n<p>On the heels of that stunning <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</strong> trailer this week, I decided to go back and revisit an old friend: <strong>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</strong> — the 2007 classic that, for me at least, truly established COD as one of the best gaming franchises on the market. Thanks to a remastered edition that greatly improves the graphics and overall gameplay, Modern Warfare continues to pop and surprise unlike any other for roughly 7-10 hours, depending on your finger abilities. It’s simplistic gaming at its finest, free from the depressing tones of modern-day titles like <strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong> and the shoddy, even perplexing, <a href=\"https://www.comingsoon.net/games/features/1148592-cs-plays-marvels-avengers-mulitplayer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">glitch-infested gameplay of <strong>Marvel’s Avengers</strong></a>. In <strong>Modern Warfare</strong>, players need only pick up their gun of choice and blast the holy Hell out countless bad guys in a myriad of missions executed amidst eye-popping locales.
