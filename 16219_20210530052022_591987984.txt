Now, it’s hard to pin point what Kenesha does… because she does <em>so</em> much! Painting, illustrations, murals, ceramics, brand collaborations, and most recently she’s become the author and illustrator of a beautiful children’s book titled <em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/665549/many-shapes-of-clay-by-kenesha-sneed/\">“Many Shapes of Clay, A Story of Healing”</a>.</em> It’s such a lovely and uplifting book which, sadly, came out of losing her father suddenly in 2018. I’m sure many of you know, I also lost my dad unexpectedly in 2018, so a book about healing sounds really wonderful to me. Kenesha and I are starting from her childhood in “the dirt”, and working our way right up to today. You can listen right up there under Kenesha looking fabulous, or subscribe on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/jealous-curator-art-for-your/id996338562\">Apple Podcasts</a> and/or <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2ELjX4nIVWpI3XMNW139WN\">Spotify.</a></p>\n<p>First up, a peek at some of the ceramics that, well, changed her life!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2021/05/21/many-shapes-of-clay/kenesha_sneed2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38370\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38370\" src=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kenesha_sneed2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"4266\" /></a></p>\n<p>Gorgeous! Ummm, how much do I love that she was going to the ceramics studio before work, during her lunch break, and then again after work!? Clearly, she&#8217;d found her thing.</p>\n<p>Another thing she happens to be <em>realllllly</em> good at&#8230; painting, both small and LARGE-SCALE!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2021/05/21/many-shapes-of-clay/kenesha_sneed3/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38371\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38371\" src=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kenesha_sneed3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"3754\" /></a></p>\n<p>Love! The top most mural is the first one she ever did <em>{with help from her partner, and her brother-in-law, artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/officialtetro\">Nathaniel Tetro</a>}</em>. The swimmer at the bottom was the five-panel piece she was talking about. Her colors and shapes are so, so, so fantastic.</p>\n<p>Oka, and today&#8217;s main attraction&#8230; Kenesha&#8217;s very first, absolutely beautiful children&#8217;s book, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/665549/many-shapes-of-clay-by-kenesha-sneed/\">&#8220;Many Shapes of Clay &#8211; A Story of Healing&#8221;</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/2021/05/21/many-shapes-of-clay/kenesha_sneed4/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-38372\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38372\" src=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kenesha_sneed4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"2442\" srcset=\"https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kenesha_sneed4.jpg 584w, https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kenesha_sneed4-367x1536.jpg 367w, https://www.thejealouscurator.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kenesha_sneed4-490x2048.jpg 490w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Such an important message, delivered in such a lovely and caring way.

Thank you so much to Kenesha for not only coming on the podcast today, but for writing such a beautiful story. I hope it helps children <em>{of all ages}</em> deal with grief, and more importantly, help them with the healing process. Thanks to you for listening, there will be more ART FOR YOUR EAR next weekend.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Other links:</em></strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tactilematter/\">Kenesha on Instagram</a></em></li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/665549/many-shapes-of-clay-by-kenesha-sneed/\">&#8220;Many Shapes of Clay&#8221;, AVAILABLE NOW!</a></em></li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://prestelpublishing.penguinrandomhouse.de/PublishingHouse/Prestel/58500.rhd\">Prestel Publishing</a></em></li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://presentperfectlit.com/\">Present Perfect</a> {Literary Agency, San Francisco}</em></li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/officialtetro\">Nathaniel Tetro</a>, Artist / Brother-in-law!</em></li>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.otis.edu/\">Otis College of Art &#38;
