With the introduction of DRS 2.0 in vSphere 7.0, the core DRS algorithm and drmdump format have changed significantly. This means there are significant differences while using DRS Dump Insight and understanding the drmdump analysis compared to the prior versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the key differences between&#160;DRS 1.0 dumps&#160;and&#160;DRS 2.0 dumps include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Each DRS 1.0 dump corresponds to a single DRS run; no such correspondence exists for DRS 2.0 dumps.</li><li>A DRS 2.0 dump contains two types of dump-sections:<ul><li><strong>Full dump (aka cluster dump):</strong> Dumped periodically and the dump contains almost all the information required to reconstruct the cluster state.</li><li><strong>Partial dump:</strong> Dumped whenever a vMotion is initiated by DRS and there are power-on failures.</li></ul></li><li>The timeline in DRS Dump Insight 2.0 is very different from that of 1.0.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In DRS 1.0, the timeline includes a line chart:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-2-vMotion-Timeline-1024x640.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4660\" srcset=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-2-vMotion-Timeline-1024x640.png 1024w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-2-vMotion-Timeline-300x188.png 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-2-vMotion-Timeline-768x480.png 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-2-vMotion-Timeline-1536x960.png 1536w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-2-vMotion-Timeline-2048x1280.png 2048w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-2-vMotion-Timeline-600x375.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While in DRS 2.0, the timeline includes a scatter graph on which you can click each dot and learn more about the changes DRS made to the cluster:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-10-vMotion-Timeline-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4661\" srcset=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-10-vMotion-Timeline-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-10-vMotion-Timeline-2-300x169.png 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-10-vMotion-Timeline-2-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-10-vMotion-Timeline-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-10-vMotion-Timeline-2-752x423.png 752w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-10-vMotion-Timeline-2-576x324.png 576w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-10-vMotion-Timeline-2-600x338.png 600w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-10-vMotion-Timeline-2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-11-Timeline-info-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4662\" srcset=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-11-Timeline-info-2.png 621w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-11-Timeline-info-2-300x191.png 300w, https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/files/2021/06/Fig.-11-Timeline-info-2-600x383.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn how to read these graphs and to understand how DRS Dump Insight works, see the&#160;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/techpaper/performance/drs-dump-insight-user-guide-perf.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">DRS Dump Insight User Guide</a>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/2021/06/drs-dump-insight-2.html\">DRS Dump Insight 2.0—What is it and where can I find more information?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/performance\">VROOM!
