Though it&#8217;s not surprising, or even unusual, to hear that Apple had carved out special deals for larger companies, the company has continued to insist the App Store is an even playing field for <em>all</em> developers, both large and small. That&#8217;s not the case, the documents reveal, as larger companies got deals allowing them to pay less in commission or had access to faster app reviews and dedicated personnel for their needs.</p>\n<p>In addition, the documents detail how Apple&#8217;s control of the App Store allows it to unilaterally make decisions about app pauses and removals. This impacts large companies, like Spotify, as well as small developers, like those detailed in these emails:</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Documents from the US antitrust investigation into Apple on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/471031858/Documents-from-the-US-antitrust-investigation-into-Apple#from_embed\">Documents from the US antitrust investigation into Apple</a> by <a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View TechCrunch's profile on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/publisher/17551504/TechCrunch#from_embed\">TechCrunch</a> on Scribd</p>\n<p><iframe id=\"doc_2689\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"Documents from the US antitrust investigation into Apple \" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/471031858/content?start_page=1&#38;view_mode=scroll&#38;access_key=key-GHLioghI3MYIuhkltH00\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.75\"></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Here are key sections that pertain to Apple &#38; the App Store:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apple Cut a Special Deal with Amazon, pp. 34-51; 67-69</strong>: Though Apple claims an even playing field for developers, its rules didn&#8217;t apply to larger companies. As part of an extensive deal with Amazon over its Prime Video app and Apple device sales on Amazon.com, Amazon agreed to remove &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of unauthorized (not necessarily counterfeit) sellers of Apple products, to give Apple control over its experience on the retail site, among other things. Apple let Amazon pay a 15% commission for in-app sign-ups on Prime Video subscriptions, instead of the 30% apps have to pay during their first year.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple Cut a Special Deal with Baidu, pp. 52-54</strong>: Apple also negotiated with Baidu to make it the default search engine in China, and as part of that agreement, offered it access to an &#8220;App Review Fast Track,&#8221; where Baidu would be allowed to send Apple a beta app for review to speed up the approval process. Apple also assigned two key contacts to work with Baidu. Again, not surprising that a big company got special treatment, but the party line is that all developers are treated equally. Access to faster app reviews is not something accessible to all developers, under certain conditions, or even publicly documented.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple Considered a 40% Commission, pp. 107-109:</strong> Apple in 2011 debated raising its commission to 40%. &#8220;I think we may be leaving money on the table if we just asked for about 30% of the first year of sub,&#8221; one exec said. Tim Cook, in the hearing, said Apple wouldn&#8217;t raise commissions because it competed for developer interest, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Requiring Apple&#8217;s Apps as the Default, pp. 32-33:</strong> Apple, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2020/07/07/iphone-change-default-email-browser-apps-ios-14/\">until recently</a>, never allowed iOS users to make a different app from a third-party developer their default app for that task on their device. That means map links open in Apple Maps and Calendar appointments lead to Apple&#8217;s Calendar app, and so on. The upcoming iOS 14 release will allow users to change their default browser and email apps, however. The documents indicate Apple was in possession of complaints from users who wanted to be able to personalize their device to their own needs. Today, Apple still has no plans to allow third-party apps to be set as the default for maps, music, voice assistance, messages, reminders, notes and others, which impacts startups and indie developers who make quality products but can&#8217;t gain a foothold on iOS/iPadOS.</li>\n<li><strong>Requiring WebKit for all browsers, pp. 55-56:</strong> Apple emails discussed Opera&#8217;s 2010 plans to submit <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1147274/operamini_submitted.html\">a browser it claimed was &#8220;up to 6 times faster than Safari,&#8221;</a> noting that &#8220;it is unlikely that this Opera release is using our webkit, which is required.&#8221; Opera, a much smaller company than Apple, was hoping to challenge Apple&#8217;s control over the browser experience by taking claims to the press &#8212; a tactic often used to demonstrate the limits of developers&#8217; rights to distribute apps on iPhone.</li>\n<li><strong>Banning Apps for Spam, pp. 1-5</strong>: Apple banned a developer for spamming the App Store, despite the developer&#8217;s claim that he was only creating separate apps because of issues with discoverability on the App Store. The developer, which published a series of maps/guides apps, said people could search for a city by name and find the standalone maps app for that city. But they weren&#8217;t being directed to the consolidated app that Apple demanded replace the individual ones, for those same searches. The developer said he would much rather use one single app, as that would be easier to maintain, but had built separate ones because of discoverability issues. Internal Apple emails indicate that Apple stopped accepting the developer&#8217;s submissions, forcing them to migrate to a consolidated app.</li>\n<li><strong>App Store Fraud, pp. 6-18</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/technology/pressure-on-apple-builds-over-app-store-fraud.html\">The NYT in 2012 reported</a> on issues around fraudulent charges hitting developers&#8217; apps, which had amounted to millions of dollars for at least one developer over the course of a year. Though fraud is a prevalent problem with digital purchases, the developers&#8217; larger complaint was not that fraud occurred &#8212; they didn&#8217;t blame Apple for that, necessarily &#8212; but that Apple was unresponsive to their requests for help. Apple didn&#8217;t reply to emails and didn&#8217;t offer a dedicated phone line for complaints, they said. Apple&#8217;s internal emails indicated the company didn&#8217;t believe there was a real issue with fraud. (&#8220;We&#8217;ve repeatedly answered this question and haven&#8217;t yet identified a case where there is an actual issue,&#8221; one exec said.) Apple execs also said the issue had to do with developers who had high levels of refunds and the timing of their refunds. The emails indicated that Apple would &#8220;intentionally reply with a standard and rather vague response&#8221; about how reporting won&#8217;t reconcile due to timing differences and noted that &#8220;we do not individually investigate each query.&#8221; But the company was aware that some developers had issues. &#8220;It is unfortunate as the issue is very small as a percentage of our business and impacts a very small percentage of our developers,&#8221; Apple said. Of course, at Apple&#8217;s scale, anything that happens to a handful of developers will be a &#8220;small percentage&#8221; of its business. But for developers, it could be their entire business.</li>\n<li><strong>App Store Search Changes, pg. 21; pg. 28: </strong>A November 2015 email indicated that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/13/app-store-search-just-got-smarter/\">App Store Search changes</a> implemented that month made it harder to find some apps. For example a search for keyword &#8220;Twitter&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2015/11/improved-app-store-search\">never returned the app</a> &#8220;Tweetbot for Twitter,&#8221; at all, despite the app&#8217;s high ranking and general popularity, evidenced by reviews. Meanwhile, an app that hadn&#8217;t been updated since 2008 (Tweeter) would appear in the search results. Phil Schiller forwarded the email to Apple execs with a note &#8220;FYI.&#8221; (TechCrunch had also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/24/apple-adjusts-its-app-store-algorithm-impacting-some-ipad-developers/\">reported</a> at the time the changes had impacted the rankings of several iPad apps.) Search issues continued in 2017, as another email indicated that the developer&#8217;s app wasn&#8217;t being returned for critical App Store keyword search terms in the first 100 results, even for an exact keyword match. While Apple may experience technical problems when it makes changes, developers are left with no resource when those changes effectively &#8220;disappear&#8221; them from the App Store.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple Removes Parental Control Apps, pp. 70-76, 80-87:</strong> Tim Cook was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apple-ceo-tim-cook-questioned-over-app-stores-removal-of-rival-screen-time-apps-in-antitrust-hearing/\">directly questioned about Apple&#8217;s removal of screen time apps</a>, and responded that the removals were related to those apps&#8217; use of privacy-invading MDM technology. The documents indicate even Apple was concerned about its move to ban the apps, given their removal directly followed the launch of Apple&#8217;s own Screen Time solution. &#8220;This is quite incriminating. Is it true?&#8221; one exec asked after The NYT covered the story (four months after <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/apple-puts-third-party-screen-time-apps-on-notice/\">TechCrunch broke the news</a>!). The apps that were banned didn&#8217;t all use MDM, we reported. In addition, Apple didn&#8217;t offer a pathway to compliance with regard to apps&#8217; off-brand use of MDM <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/04/apple-lets-parental-apps-use-mdm-strict-privacy/\">until June 2019</a>. In Congress&#8217; stash of emails from impacted developers, one said they spent an additional $30K trying to fix the problem, but was specifically told &#8220;we no longer support Parental Control Apps&#8221; even though the App Store still had several listed. A number of consumers also complained about how the apps they relied on had disappeared.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple used App Store to Block Large Companies&#8217; Apps, Too, pp. 77-79, 80-98, 97-98, 102-106:</strong> Indie developers weren&#8217;t the only ones at the mercy of Apple&#8217;s control over the App Store. Verizon (Disclosure: TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company&#8217;s parent), Spotify, T-Mobile, Amazon and Valve (Steam) also had submitted complaints about their apps not being allowed in or being paused, due to terms violations, and being forced to use Apple&#8217;s in-app purchases. Spotify, for example, said it had built a special landing page just for compliance with App Store Rules about not directing users to non-App Store purchase mechanisms. But Apple rejected its app updates for sending an email after a trial period to users directing them to upgrade from Spotify&#8217;s website. &#8220;Apple claimed that Spotify could not communicate with its own customers, inside its own app, about the existence of its own Premium service — even if there was no link, button, or mention of any offer of any kind,&#8221; Spotify legal wrote to Apple legal. &#8220;Shortly after our meeting in early July, Apple objected to an out-of-app welcome email to free users, claiming that this email violated the App Store Rules because it mentioned the Premium service,&#8221; it said. Apple directly competes with Spotify, which has money to pay expensive lawyers. What are indie developers to do when met with similar situations?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/tech-antitrust-hearing\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tech-antitrust-hearing-banner.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Breaking News</h2>\n<p><strong>Trump administration to order China-based ByteDance to sell <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> U.S. Operations</strong></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2019460\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2019460\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2019460\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg 3441w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?resize=1536,998 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?resize=2048,1331 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1177990254-1.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2019460\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credit: Costfoto / Barcroft Media (Photo credit should read Costfoto / Barcroft Media via Getty Images</p></div></p>\n<p>The Trump administration said on Friday it will sign an order directing ByteDance to divest its ownership of the U.S. app, TikTok, if it wants to continue to operate in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-31/trump-to-order-china-s-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-u-s-operations-kdaib6eb?utm_source=webpush&#38;utm_campaign=BreakingNews%7CStory%7CQECGTFDWRGG601\">Bloomberg reported.</a> The app&#8217;s associations with China have been under increased scrutiny in the U.S., along with other Chinese tech firms.

href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> a significant question lingers: Where will brands go next for their digital marketing needs?</p>\n<p>The case for the breakup is clear: Brands want to distance themselves from third-party business practices that do not align with their values. Specifically, they are disenchanted by what even <a href=\"https://cleaver.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-cleaver-leads-congressional-call-for-facebook-to-strengthen-policies\">some members of Congress are calling Facebook’s “lackadaisical”</a> approach to enforcing community standards, allowing an epidemic of paid political misinformation and hate speech to persist on the user-driven platform.</p>\n<p>However, with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Facebook and Amazon representing <a href=\"https://marketingland.com/almost-70-of-digital-ad-spending-going-to-google-facebook-amazon-says-analyst-firm-262565\">just under 70% of global digital ad revenue</a>, a clean break from the tech giants is easier said than done. Advertisers, like anyone facing a breakup, must look within. After all, they don’t want to make the same mistakes and they cannot just throw newly freed up advertising dollars at a new social network ad platform, where similar conflicts could easily follow.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>With introspection, advertisers will see that this is more than just a war on disinformation and hate speech. A data war is brewing, pressuring businesses to diversify data sources. As brands compete to understand the needs and preferences of today’s consumers, consumers are concurrently responding with more <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/01/do-you-care-about-privacy-as-much-as-your-customers-do\">guarded protection of their online data</a>.</p>\n<p>To win this war, brands must reclaim data autonomy and infuse their digital media strategy with more diversified data. But they cannot do it alone and they cannot do it within the current system.</p>\n<h2>Time to brandish holistic data</h2>\n<p>Whether Facebook adjusts its community standards to appease dismayed advertisers has yet to be seen. But in the interim, as advertisers walk out the door, it’s worth noting that Facebook’s reliance on online data may soon be obsolete anyway.</p>\n<p>One of the key differentiators for Facebook’s ad platform has been its ability to help level the playing field for smaller brands by cost-effectively captivating the right audiences. But the platform primarily draws insights from audiences’ behaviors online. The next wave of data-based marketing must employ tools that blend first-party data and qualified third-party data to offer a holistic view of customer behaviors, both online and offline.</p>\n<p>Offline data sets, which include location intelligence, interactions, purchase history, contact information and demographics are lynchpins in the next digital media wave because they allow brands to develop a more human view of consumer data and create meaningful marketing moments. For example, location intelligence, an extremely potent tool that is currently <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2020/03/26/as-covid-19-pushes-businesses-to-their-limit-the-cloud-rises-above/\">helping brands pivot during COVID-19</a> disruptions and is even <a href=\"https://streetfightmag.com/2020/03/30/amid-covid-19-pandemic-accurate-location-data-can-save-hassles-and-even-lives/\">protecting public health</a>, can drive personalized, alluring marketing campaigns with massive ROI opportunities.</p>\n<p>The leading integrated data providers are managing extremely rich datasets, which increase in value daily as consistent tracking yields higher quality data. Such powerful and enriched data stacks offers brands visitor insights based on a specific location after an ad is interacted with on any device — requiring no guesswork for the marketing team. Brands are able to pinpoint exactly which messages resonate with which segments of their audience at which time. This precision ultimately helps them craft the right message for the target consumer — and deliver it at the exact right moment.</p>\n<h2>Marching orders for combat</h2>\n<p>Brands want to cut Facebook loose but where do they go next? How do they achieve data autonomy and make omnichannel strides in digital marketing? If the boycott movement is to succeed, revolutionary changes to the digital marketplace are needed.</p>\n<p>A newly imagined system must be organized outside the proprietary grasp of any one single tech conglomerate. Otherwise, advertisers will lack ownership of the data they need to reach new audiences. Or they’ll once again get mixed up with similar paid political disinformation and hate speech across user-generated platforms, sending them straight back into the arms of Facebook.</p>\n<p>Rather than rely on a single centralized social media platform, transparent media partners and publishers must come together on a shared central system that takes an omnichannel approach to building lookalike (LAL) audiences. A LAL puts advertisers in front of new audiences by finding users that, while they may be unfamiliar with their brand, are very similar to the buyer personas of their current customers. The LAL for each advertiser would be constantly tested and refined to keep pace with the rapidly changing marketplace.</p>\n<p>Facebook currently operates on a LAL model but it is almost exclusively generated by online data from their users. The next step is expanding on this model and infusing offline and third-party data with a company’s first-party data, putting them in front of a LAL across a range of media partners and platforms. This will help build a core conversion audience, while constantly scaling new LALs for each brand.</p>\n<p>Such a system would require collaboration, enlisting many players in a co-op style undertaking. For example, to get it off the ground, it would be helpful if about 20 of the large brands boycotting Facebook invest some of their newly freed advertising dollars to establish the data and publisher sharing co-op network.</p>\n<p>Once the advertiser framework is set, the co-op would need to identify media outlet partners such as news websites, blogs, apps, podcasts and social media outlets. The co-op would negotiate a performance-based publisher relationship for every player, effectively increasing content monetization for publishers’ content channels.</p>\n<h2>Reinventing the digital media landscape</h2>\n<p>This would be a transformational movement, galvanizing brands with data autonomy and increasing customer engagement across an entire network of media platforms — not just one platform. Each advertiser’s first-party data, which they’ve already given to Facebook, would be analyzed to isolate data overlaps within the co-op. This would essentially lay the foundation for building a core conversation audience, helping each advertiser tap new LALs.</p>\n<p>Brands advertising with the co-op would gain access to more enriched, robust insights on consumers than Facebook could ever offer, leading to a higher return on investment for the $336 billion spend on digital advertising annually.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, it would help brands future-proof their digital marketing efforts and grant them greater freedom in choosing where their advertising dollars are being spent.</p>\n<p>That is how the war is won.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/hIqFFSl75D0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 01 Aug 2020 15:16:13 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1148107944.jpg?w=562","linkMd5":"0a694bdc657a583d7a1016ce5d6e15e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn21@2020_1/2020-08-02/1596348542390_ee01716ce79ae6c8.webp","author":"Walter Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn9@2020_5/2020-08-02/1596348541659_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_3/2020-08-02/1596348542749_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn97@2020_3/2020-08-02/1596348541776_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn37@2020_2/2020-08-02/1596348541943_b24a9bf746a3f7fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=hIqFFSl75D0:IIuMrVpFiaM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_1/2020-08-02/1596348543165_79f9e8a13e201278.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn41@2020_4/2020-08-02/1596348543123_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/hIqFFSl75D0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn57@2020_1/2020-08-02/1596348541887_50688caae4c443e5.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-02 14:08:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-02 06:08:57","title":"TikTok says it’s “not planning on going anywhere” in response to pending U.S. ban","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2025953","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> U.S. General Manager <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/vanessa-pappas\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"vanessa-pappas\">Vanessa Pappas <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has posted a video message to the platform that appears to be a response to reports from Friday that President Trump is working on an effective &#8220;ban&#8221; of the app in the U.S., a plan he shared with reporters from the White House pool on board Air Force One.

We&#8217;re looking into it with Microsoft and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> but for now we haven&#8217;t heard that anything material is different here &#8212; the deal was always contingent on tacit, if not explicit, approval from the administration. We will update if we hear more. Original story follows.</p>\n<p>China&#8217;s ByteDance has agreed to divest its <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> operations in the US, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-bytedance-exclusive/exclusive-bytedance-offers-to-forgo-stake-in-tiktok-to-clinch-u-s-deal-sources-idUSKBN24X3SK\">according to a report in Reuters</a>. Under the deal, Microsoft would take over stewardship of the data of U.S.-based users. The deal allows another company besides Microsoft to operate TikTok in the United States. This would allow the service to continue to operate in the United States, sidestepping the alleged executive order threatened by President Trump.</p>\n<p>Allegedly, ByteDance had previously sought a deal that would allow the company to retain a minority stake in the company. That plan was apparently recently abandoned after the White House rejected the proposal.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Under this new deal, Microsoft would be in charge of protecting U.S.-based users&#8217; data, and another U.S.-based company would be allowed to operate TikTok.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear if this deal would be enough to allow TikTok to continue to operate within the United States.</p>\n<p>Microsoft and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>This news comes hours after President Trump told reporters that he was going to sign an executive order banning the Chinese-owned app from operating within the United States. In response, ByteDance issued the following statement, which we initially reported <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/trump-ban-tiktok/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>“100 million Americans come to TikTok for entertainment and connection, especially during the pandemic. We’ve hired nearly 1,000 people to our US team this year alone, and are proud to be hiring another 10,000 employees into great paying jobs across the US. Our $1 billion creator fund supports US creators who are building livelihoods from our platform. TikTok US user data is stored in the US, with strict controls on employee access. TikTok’s biggest investors come from the US. We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and safety as we continue working to bring joy to families and meaningful careers to those who create on our platform,” said a TikTok spokesperson.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/r4gO1QH_VVs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 01 Aug 2020 13:54:20 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1183804986.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"6b43df8c836326f67ad8778413328b9f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn25@2020_4/2020-08-02/1596348542277_9b3dda4420a90879.webp","author":"Matt Burns","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn9@2020_5/2020-08-02/1596348541659_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_3/2020-08-02/1596348542749_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn97@2020_3/2020-08-02/1596348541776_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn9@2020_3/2020-08-02/1596348542787_782ee322195673d4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=r4gO1QH_VVs:SbU5C5nLNj4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn57@2020_5/2020-08-02/1596348541871_763b0b7e39675413.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn41@2020_4/2020-08-02/1596348543123_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/r4gO1QH_VVs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn73@2020_2/2020-08-02/1596348542805_9ca0405ea2244038.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-02 14:08:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-02 06:08:57","title":"Apple’s partners and Samsung apply for India’s $6.6 billion local smartphone production program","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2025925","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">South Korean giant Samsung, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple’s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> contract manufacturing partners Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron, and Indian smartphone vendors Micromax and Lava among others have applied for India’s $6.6 billion incentive program aimed at boosting the local smartphone manufacturing, New Delhi said on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The scheme, called Production-Linked Incentive Scheme, will offer a range of incentives to companies including a 6% financial incentive on additional sales of goods produced locally over five years, with 2019-2020 set as the base year, India’s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a press conference.</p>\n<p>22 companies have applied for the incentive program &#8212; that also includes manufacturing of electronics components &#8212; and have agreed to export 60% of their locally produced units outside of India, said Prasad.

With that out of the way, let’s talk money, upstart companies and the latest spicy IPO rumors.</span></p>\n<h2>Affirm dreams of an 11-figure SPAC</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are tired of reading about special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, we hear you. We’re sick of them as well. But they keep cropping up, this time in the form of a possible IPO alternative for Affirm, a fintech unicorn that has raised more than $1 billion to provide consumers with point-of-sale installment loans. (Rates from 0% to 30%, terms of up to 36 months.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Affirm is effectively a lending company that plugs into e-commerce firms. Researching this entry I had an idea in the back of my head that Affirm had a super-neat credit system to rate users. But reading through </span><a href=\"https://www.affirm.com/help/apply-for-a-loan/loan-approvals\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">its own FAQ</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and what </span><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/loans/personal-loans/affirm-personal-loans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NerdWallet has to say</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the company, its methods seem somewhat pedestrian.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless, distribution is key for the company, and Affirm recently </span><a href=\"https://www.affirm.com/business/blog/affirm-shopify-partner-split-payments\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">linked up with Shopify</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That should provide it another dose of growth. The very sort of thing that IPO investors want. The WSJ </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirm-prepares-ipo-that-could-value-fintech-firm-at-up-to-10-billion-11596143292?mod=searchresults&#38;page=1&#38;pos=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Affirm could go public this year, perhaps via a SPAC, at a valuation of $5 to $10 billion.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/working-to-understand-affirms-reported-ipo-pricing-hopes/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">did my best to map out what those valuations implied</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, generally finding that Affirm needs to have </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hella</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> loan volume to make the sort of money that a $10 billion figure implies. Of course, I was trying to make numerical sense. The stock market in 2020 is a bit more relaxed than that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this SPAC talk is still mostly bullshit, mind. We are </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/jamfs-ipo-underscores-hot-demand-for-tech-shares/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">seeing public debuts this year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And every single one of them that has been of note has been a traditional IPO, at least as far as I can recall. The running history of direct listings and SPAC debuts that matter is pretty slim.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, Coinbase and Asana and DoorDash and Airbnb, among others, are in need of liquidity and could yet pull the trigger on a more exotic debut. Hell, Qualtrics could do something wild </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/why-is-sap-spinning-qualtrics-out-via-an-ipo/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in its impending IPO</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but we doubt it will.</span></p>\n<h2>Market Notes</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest market news this week had little to do with startups.

But last weekend it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/sap-will-spin-out-its-8b-spin-in-qualtrics-acquisition/\">decided to spin out</a> the experience management provider to finally go public on its own. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/sap-decision-to-spin-out-qualtrics-20-months-after-spending-8b-surprises-industry-watchers/\">analysts Ron Miller talked to</a> speculated about strategic issues on the SAP side, and concluded this was more of an internal reset combined with the financial gain from a promising offering.</p>\n<p>Qualtrics, meanwhile, already put the Utah startup scene on the map for people around the world. Having grown strongly post-acquisition, it is now set up to be the largest IPO in state history. Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/why-is-sap-spinning-qualtrics-out-via-an-ipo/\">Alex Wilhelm with more analysis in Extra Crunch</a>:</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<blockquote><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/bvp-nasdaq-emerging-cloud-index\">metrics from the Bessemer Cloud Index</a>, cloud companies with growth rates of 35.5% and gross margins of 71.3% are worth around 17.3x in enterprise value compared to their annualized revenue.</p>\n<p>Given how close Qualtrics is to that averaged set of metrics (slightly slower growth, slightly better gross margins), the 17.3x number is probably not far from what the company can achieve when it does go public. Doing the sums, $800 million times 17.3 is $13.8 billion, far more than what SAP paid for Qualtrics. (For you wonks out there, it’s doubtful that Qualtrics has much debt, though it will have lots of cash post-IPO; expect the company’s enterprise value to be a little under its future market cap.)</p>\n<p>So, the markets are valuing cloud companies so highly today that even after SAP had to pay a huge premium to buy Qualtrics ahead of its public offering, the company is still sharply more valuable today after just two years of growth.</p></blockquote>\n<h2><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-389997\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/risk.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/risk.jpg 385w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/risk.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/risk.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/risk.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" /></h2>\n<h2>Back to the era of nation-states</h2>\n<p>The tech industry is getting broken down and reformed by national governments in ways that many of its leaders do not seem to have planned for as part of scaling to the world, whether you consider TikTok&#8217;s ever-shrinking global footprint or leading tech CEOs getting called out by Congress.

But publicly traded companies have been some of the biggest beneficiaries (see previous item), and the action around earlier-stage startups has been less clear. Lucas Matney and Alex <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/six-leading-investors-assess-the-remote-work-startup-landscape/\">caught up with six investors who have been focused on various parts of the space</a> to get the latest for Extra Crunch. Here&#8217;s a pithy description of fundraising trends that companies are experiencing, from Elliott Robinson, a growth-stage investor at Bessemer:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>How competitive are remote-work tooling venture rounds now?</b></p>\n<p>Incredibly competitive. I think one dynamic I’ve seen play out is that the basket of remote-work companies that are really high-performing right now are setting lofty price expectations well ahead of the raise. Many of these companies didn’t plan on raising in Q2/Q3, but with COVID tailwinds, they are choosing to raise at some often sight-unseen-level valuation multiples.</p>\n<p><b>Are prices out of control?</b></p>\n<p>I think it depends on your definition of out of control. The reality is that many of these companies are raising money off cycle from their natural fundraising date for two reasons: One, they are seeing once in a lifetime digital transformation and adoption of remote-work tooling solutions. And, two, so many investors have raised sizable funds during the last nine months that they are leaning into investing in these companies — one of the few segments that will likely continue to see tailwinds as COVID cases continue to rise again in the U.S. Other traditional software value props may face significant headwinds in a uncertain COVID world. Thus, growth equity investors are paying high multiples to get a shot at the category-defining RW app companies.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2023592\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-155573159.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-155573159.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-155573159.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-155573159.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-155573159.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-155573159.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-155573159.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<h2>Haptics in a pandemic-stricken world</h2>\n<p>Haptics are a great sort of gee-whiz technology, but the practical future of touch-based communication is all over the place — VR devices are suddenly more interesting, touchpads less so. Devon Powers and David Parisi are academics and authors who focus on the space, and they wrote a big guest post for TechCrunch this week that sketched out some of the ups and downs of the decades-old concept. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/the-hype-haplessness-and-hope-of-haptics-in-the-covid-19-era/\">Here&#8217;s a key excerpt</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting haptics right remains challenging despite more than 30 years’ worth of dedicated research in the field. There is no evidence that COVID is accelerating the development of projects already in the pipeline. The fantasy of virtual touch remains seductive, but striking the golden mean between fidelity, ergonomics and cost will continue to be a challenge that can only be met through a protracted process of marketplace trial-and-error. And while haptics retains immense potential, it isn’t a magic bullet for mending the psychological effects of physical distancing.</p>\n<p>Curiously, one promising exception is in the replacement of touchscreens using a combination of hand-tracking and midair haptic holograms, which function as button replacements. This product from Bristol-based company Ultraleap uses an array of speakers to project tangible soundwaves into the air, which provide resistance when pressed on, effectively replicating the feeling of clicking a button.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ultraleap.com/company/news/press-release/cen-ultraleap-touchless-tech/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ultraleap.com/company/news/press-release/cen-ultraleap-touchless-tech/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1596040714584000&#38;usg=AFQjCNGJynpfPJ3teeXsvabp-0c8sBegZQ\">Ultraleap recently announced that it would partner with the cinema advertising company CEN</a> to equip lobby advertising displays found in movie theaters around the U.S. with touchless haptics aimed at allowing interaction with the screen without the risks of touching one. These displays, according to Ultraleap, “will limit the spread of germs and provide safe and natural interaction with content.”</p>\n<p>A recent study carried out by the company found that more than 80% of respondents expressed concerns over touchscreen hygiene, prompting Ultraleap to speculate that we are reaching <a href=\"https://www.ultraleap.com/company/news/press-release/end-of-public-touchscreens/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ultraleap.com/company/news/press-release/end-of-public-touchscreens/&#38;source=gmail&#38;ust=1596040714584000&#38;usg=AFQjCNFeSh0jR0qOgmmMpTS5JNy--QqUwA\">“the end of the [public] touchscreen era.”</a> Rather than initiate a technological change, the pandemic has provided an opportunity to push ahead on the deployment of existing technology. Touchscreens are no longer sites of naturalistic, creative interaction, but are now spaces of contagion to be avoided. Ultraleap’s version of the future would have us touching air instead of contaminated glass.</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2025877\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-31-at-4.48.33-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"714\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-31-at-4.48.33-PM.png 3470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-31-at-4.48.33-PM.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-31-at-4.48.33-PM.png?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-31-at-4.48.33-PM.png?resize=768,536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-31-at-4.48.33-PM.png?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-31-at-4.48.33-PM.png?resize=1536,1071 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-31-at-4.48.33-PM.png?resize=2048,1428 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-31-at-4.48.33-PM.png?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<h2>Finding the best investors for you: The TC List and Europe surveys</h2>\n<p>Speaking of investors, TechCrunch has been busy with a few other projects to you find the right ones faster.</p>\n<p>First, Danny Crichton has pushed a third update to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/the-techcrunch-list/\">The TechCrunch List</a>, due to the ongoing flood of recommendations. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-techcrunch-list-update/\">In his words</a>: &#8220;Now using more than 2,600 founder recommendations — more than double our original dataset — we have underscored a number of the existing investors on our list as well as added 116 new investors who have been endorsed by founders as investors willing to cut against the grain and write those critical first checks and lead venture rounds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check it out and filter by location, category and stage to narrow down your pitch list. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">If you are a founder and haven’t submitted your recommendation yet, </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYuKc3aZfXlHq-7bOAhIbHKtbn7nJEbbqKoi4iPQWSCYn1oQ/viewform\">please</a> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYuKc3aZfXlHq-7bOAhIbHKtbn7nJEbbqKoi4iPQWSCYn1oQ/viewform\">fill</a><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYuKc3aZfXlHq-7bOAhIbHKtbn7nJEbbqKoi4iPQWSCYn1oQ/viewform\"> out our very brief survey</a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">. </span>If you have questions, we put together a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/pages/the-techcrunch-list-faq/\">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page that describes the qualifications and logistics, some of the logic behind the List and how to get in touch with us.</p>\n<p>Second, our editor-at-large Mike Butcher is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-great-techcrunch-survey-of-europes-vcs-be-featured-in-our-survey/\">embarking on a virtual investor survey of European countries</a>, to help Extra Crunch provide a clearer view about what&#8217;s happening in the Continent&#8217;s startup hubs in the middle of the world going crazy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">TechCrunch is embarking on a major new project to <a href=\"https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6\">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe.
