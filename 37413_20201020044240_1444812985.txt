It offers an excellent, entertaining overview of what the plugin does, and why you might want to use it.

So, here we go !</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-9732\"></span></p>\n<h3>Loudness Penalty &#8211; FAQ</h3>\n<h4>Do I have to measure the whole song ?</h4>\n<p>Yes &#8211; streaming services calculate the level changes by measuring the whole song, so we need to as well, if we want accurate results. You can do this faster than realtime if you like, using applications like iZotope RX or Pro Tools Audiosuite.</p>\n<h4>Can‚Äôt I just use an LUFS meter ?</h4>\n<p>Yes, but TIDAL is the only streaming service using LUFS at the moment, so while LUFS estimates can get you in the right ballpark, in our experience they can be wrong by as much as 3 dB. The values reported by Loudness Penalty are typically within half a dB of the actual results, often within 0.1 dB</p>\n<h4>What does ‚ÄúAuto Gain‚Äù do ?</h4>\n<p>The Auto Gain function smoothly adjusts the Preview level to automatically follow the latest result for the currently selected streaming service, once per second. </p>\n<p>For example if you‚Äôve selected Spotify and the reported penalty changes rapidly, you‚Äôll hear the Preview level adjust to reflect this. You should always disable this function once you have an overall value for a song, and want to compare the way it sounds with reference material.</p>\n<h4>It‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù, is it ?</h4>\n<p>That‚Äôs a great question <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"üôÇ\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs true that if you‚Äôre happy with the way your song sounds in comparison to similar reference material after normalisation, it doesn‚Äôt really matter if it‚Äôs turned down by a few dB or not. And in fact personally I‚Äôm quite comfortable with a ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù of 0 to -2 on YouTube, for loud songs. So in that case No, it‚Äôs only a &#8220;penalty&#8221; in theory.</p>\n<p>However whenever I see score of -3, -4 or lower, personally I can‚Äôt help wondering how things might sound with less limiting, and a less aggressive reduction as a result. And in fact in my opinion and experience, a few dB less peak limiting almost always sounds <a href=\"http://productionadvice.co.uk/make-music-pop\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">just as good, if not better</a>.</p>\n<p>But if you try the same experiment and find you prefer the sound of your music <em>with</em> more limiting and a more aggressive penalty, then of course that‚Äôs the sound you should go for ! We certainly <strong>don‚Äôt</strong> ever suggest people should master towards LUFS ‚Äútargets‚Äù &#8211; quite the opposite. You can read more about this subject <a href=\"http://productionadvice.co.uk/no-lufs-targets/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and suggestions for a method we <strong>do</strong> recommend for achieving optional loudness and dynamics <a href=\"http://productionadvice.co.uk/how-loud/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>So the honest answer is, we deliberately chose the name to be a little provocative and thought-provoking. We could have gone with Loudness Adjustment, Loudness Offset or Loudness Preview, but they just weren‚Äôt as ‚Äúhooky‚Äù!</p>\n<p>We have the best intentions, though. Our hope is that the name will make people curious about this issue, and encourage them to find out more and try their own experiments &#8211; and make it quick and easy. </p>\n<p>Ultimately it‚Äôs what <em>sounds</em> best that should be the deciding factor, not the numbers. That‚Äôs why the Preview function is so important &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.meterplugs.com/loudness-penalty\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Loudness Penalty</a> is a tool intended to help you hear past the ‚Äúloudness deception‚Äù, and make the best musical decisions for your songs &#8211; <em>whatever</em> they might be.<br />\n&#160;<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://productionadvice.co.uk/loudness-penalty-faq/\">Loudness Penalty Plugin &#8211; FAQ</a> is a post from Ian Shepherd's: Production Advice Subscribe to the newsletter for great content from the archives, special offers and a free interview - for more information, click here</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:49:18 +0000","feedId":37413,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png","linkMd5":"e28ecb9af2efb22856b334e36175dd2d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn47@2020_2/2020/10/20/04-42-39-326_63b481a2e19f668f.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":620,"destBytes":1362,"author":"Ian Shepherd","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn47@2020_2/2020/10/20/04-42-39-326_63b481a2e19f668f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603168959196}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 12:42:39","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 12:42:39","feedId":37413,"fetchDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 04:42:39 +0000","fetchMs":13450,"handleMs":14192,"totalMs":28847,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"28b677c0686b1311e8d67d204ad5933d","hostName":"europe21*","requestId":"5076f4bf599f495ea3b7b3bedeb3bad6_37413","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":1362,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx22":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:10:50","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 05:25:12","id":37413,"name":"Production Advice","url":"http://productionadvice.co.uk/feed/","subscriber":86,"website":null,"icon":"https://productionadvice.co.uk/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"make your music sound great","weekly":null,"link":"https://productionadvice.co.uk"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":1362,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603168931498,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":13507,"msg":"Ëé∑ÂèñxmlÂÜÖÂÆπ"},{"spend":14192,"msg":"Ëß£ÈáäÊñáÁ´†"},{"spend":0,"msg":"‰∏ä‰º†Â∞ÅÈù¢ÂõæÂà∞cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"Ê≠£ÊñáÈìæÊé•‰∏ä‰º†Âà∞cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"‰øÆÊ≠£Â∞ÅÈù¢Âõæ‰∏ä‰º†Â§±Ë¥•ÈáçÊñ∞‰∏ä‰º†"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn47@2020_2/2020/10/20/04-42-39-326_63b481a2e19f668f.webp","sourceBytes":620,"destBytes":1362,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":37413,"totalSpendMs":1123,"convertSpendMs":4,"createdTime":"2020-10-20 12:42:39","host":"europe-59*","referer":"http://productionadvice.co.uk/?p=9732","linkMd5ListStr":"e28ecb9af2efb22856b334e36175dd2d,e28ecb9af2efb22856b334e36175dd2d","githubUser":"myreaderx22","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1„ÄÅÊ≤°ÊúâRefererÂ≠óÊÆµ","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"620 B","destSize":"1.3 KB","compressRate":"219.7%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx22":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
