continent. Why? According to Canon, they want to &#8220;support local retail partners&#8221; by sending customers their way.</p>\n<p>The announcement was published on September 1st, and it&#8217;s a notice of sorts: on September 30th, the Canon Australia online store will shut down &#8220;for the foreseeable future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The unprecedented challenges currently facing the Australian market has seen Canon Australia re-examine the best way to help consumers access our products, services and support,&#8221; writes Canon. &#8220;As a result, we are proudly streamlining our efforts in supporting local retailers to drive competition in the local market and bring you the best value product offers, promotions, services and experiences possible.&#8221;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465831\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465831\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/canonstore-800x610.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"610\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465831\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465831\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Many items are already marked &#8220;Out of Stock&#8221; on the online store as of this writing.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Customers can still order products from the Canon Australia online store from now until September 30th, and they will still receive free shipping and Canon&#8217;s &#8220;14 Day Peace of Mind return policy.&#8221; After thatâ€”or if you&#8217;re looking at a product that&#8217;s on backorderâ€”you&#8217;ll need to order from one of Canon&#8217;s official retail partners.

Instead, you&#8217;ll see sections like Portrait and Essentials, each of which is made up of different AI tools like BodyAI, FaceAI, and IrisAI for portraits, AtmosphereAI, SkyAI, and Sunrays for landscape editing, and more general tools like CompositionAI and StructureAI to change the overall look of an image.</p>\n<p><div class=\"fluid-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\"><div class=\"fluid-iframe__inner\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yJ6_Sz2bmw0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p>\n<p>To be clear, those more traditional tools are still there, probably hiding under the &#8220;PRO&#8221; tab you see in the screenshots below. We asked Luminar about this and they said that they&#8217;re &#8220;keeping most of the traditional editing tools.&#8221; Luminar AI just puts a heavy emphasis on using the aforementioned AI tools and the program&#8217;s built-in AI templates <em>first</em>, in the hopes that you&#8217;ll never have to fiddle with sliders again.</p>\n<p>â€œLuminar AI will help make image editing easier for everyone. Weâ€™ve removed the boring and difficult parts of photo editing without sacrificing creativity,&#8221; says Skylum CEO Alex Tsepko. &#8220;Luminar AI will be a great tool in a creatorâ€™s workflow. They can focus on great results â€” not on the process of editing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s announcement is sort of a &#8220;first step&#8221; sneak peek, with more details to be revealed in the next few months ahead of release. For now, everything we know is contained on <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fskylum.com%2Fluminar-ai\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">this website</a> and in the screenshots included below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/Deep-Eyes-Jessica-800x514.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"514\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465792\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/Delicate-Kate-800x514.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"514\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465793\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/Stunning-Mountain-800x514.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"514\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465794\" /></p>\n<p>Luminar AI will be available as a stand-alone application or as a plug-in for both macOS and Windows sometime &#8220;this holiday season.&#8221; For now, interested photographers can pre-order it at a special early bird price (limited to 30,000 orders) of $60 for current Skylum product owners or $70 for new customers. </p>\n<p>Note that if you <em>do</em> manage to snag that early bird deal, you&#8217;ll get access to the app earlier than the rest of the world, and will also be invited to join the Luminar AI Insider program&#8230;

iPhone flash sync technology to the test. Using just an iPhone and a Profoto B10, he set out to find out if professional off-camera flash is the &#8220;future&#8221; of iPhone photography. </p>\n<p>For those who aren&#8217;t familiar, Profoto unveiled its Air X technology <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2020/07/08/you-can-now-use-profotos-b10-studio-strobes-with-your-smartphone/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">back in July</a>, calling it &#8220;an innovation that rewrites the rules of photography.&#8221; That&#8217;s because Air X allows you to sync an iPhone with a professional-grade <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fpp901163.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Profoto B10</a> or <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fpp901164.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">B10 Plus</a> monolight at speeds up to 1/25,000sâ€”something that simply wasn&#8217;t possible before.</p>\n<p>Still, what works on paper doesn&#8217;t always translate to real life, and so Hall decided to update his own Profoto B10 and put the technology to the test in a real life portrait shoot using an iPhone as his main camera. That&#8217;s what he does in the video above, and the results&#8230; well&#8230; they&#8217;re pretty impressive.</p>\n<p>This is what the system looks like when you&#8217;re actually shooting:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/fstoppers_how_to_photograph_bridal_portraits_on_iphone_phone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"510\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465640\" /></p>\n<p>And these are the kinds of photos that Hall was able to capture using the combination:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/sample1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"714\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465714\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/sample2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"411\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465715\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/sample3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"631\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465716\" /></p>\n<p>For the sake of comparison, Patrick also shot some side-by-side images that show the difference that the off-camera flash can actually make.</p>\n<p>On the left is an image captured using only natural light and exposing for the background; in the middle is an image captured using only natural light and exposing for the subject; and on the right is the same scene captured using the off-camera flash to balance the light. If anything, the final image is a little over-exposed, which allowed Hall to drop the flash power in order to capture the final image from that scene.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/1-800x326.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"326\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465642\" /></p>\n<p>Despite his initial skepticism, Hall was definitely impressed by how well the B10 + iPhone combo performed. For now, the tech is still limited to the (relatively expensive) <a

src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks-shelves1-800x464.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"464\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465657\" /></p>\n<p>Revisiting my photography book collection has brought me much enjoyment during the lockdown. A dozen years ago, as the business of photography was good, I used the disposable income to start collecting. In this article, I summarize what I wished I knew back then, not only as a photographer and book collector but also from the perspective of a former art gallery owner and current publisher.</p>\n<h3>Why Collect Photography Books?</h3>\n<p>The prevalent digital consumption of photographs cannot replace the viewing of photography in print. Seeing original prints at exhibits is irreplaceable, but there are only so many museums and galleries even in a major metropolitan area such as the San Francisco Bay Area. Photography books, defined as books where the message is primarily carried by photographs, are the most practical entry into a photographerâ€™s work. </p>\n<p>Unlike magazines, they are physical objects of beauty, with superior production values such as materials, design, and printing. The sequencing, layout, and combination of images and text add layers of meaning and complexity beyond single photographs. Books from a lasting record of works of art. They can rise to the level of works of art themselves, but unlike the art in the museum or gallery, that is a piece of art that you can hold in your hand. </p>\n<p>The simplicity and materiality of the book provide an experience altogether distinct from electronic media. Book pass through ages. In our personal lives, they are often loaded with sentimental value. It can be argued that without books, there would be no modern civilization.</p>\n<p>There are many approaches to photography book collecting that are equally valid. Two ends of the spectrum are to collect solely based on personal taste, ignoring any other external opinions, and to collect based solely on rarity, seeking vintage first editions in excellent condition. I took a middle road, seeing photography books as a vehicle to discover more about photography and deepen my knowledge of its significant artists. </p>\n<p>I was not trying to build an egg nest with the collection, because I wanted foremost to focus on contents and buy books according to interest rather than as an investment opportunity. However, there is no denying that the mercantile aspect of the hobby can be fun and educational, as it mobilizes quite a bit of knowledge: you have to do your research, budget, and prioritize your acquisitions. </p>\n<p>It could be profitable: once I noticed that Mack was going to re-issue Masahisa Fukaseâ€™s <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRavens-Masahisa-Fukase%2Fdp%2F1910164836%2F%3Ftag%3D8419-20\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\"><em>Ravens</em></a>, therefore ensuring my continued access to the work, I resold for $1,000 the copy of the Rat Hole Gallery edition bought for less than $100. Note, however, that monetization is always uncertain (the stock market is for that!), and there are indications that the book market is softer than it used to be. Unlike book dealers, even if they seek appreciation in value, collectors generally do not seek to monetize it. Like in all collecting the process can be more satisfying than the resulting ownership.</p>\n<p>Photography books have become highly collectible over the last two decades, thanks to a recent appreciation and recognition of that particular medium, and maybe nostalgia for physical objects. Some books can quickly become worth more than their list price. Once I understood that carefully chosen books can be resold for a profit if needed, I was less hesitant to spend serious money that way. </p>\n<p>There were years when I spent more on books than on photography gear. I sometimes bought multiple copies to resell as a way to finance the hobby, a trade of sorts. While that mercantile aspect of collecting should remain secondary to the love of the books, it is by far the easiest to explain and quantify, kind of like the technical mechanics of photographs, and that is why I will focus on it. The definition of a collectible is: worth more used than what it cost new.</p>\n<h3>The Value Cycle</h3>\n<p>The factors that make any given object collectible are scarcity and demand. Because of the need for quality reproductions, photo books cost much more to print than other books, and therefore they are more expensive. Higher prices result in demand often too small to justify a large print run. Except for some popular coffee-table books, a print run of a few thousand copies is considered large for a photography book. At the same time, although small, the demand often remains steady. Eventually, copies become scarce and valuable. The cycle for desirable books goes like that:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Book is sold near list price upon release, as novelty is a major selling point.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Once the novelty wears out, deep discounts (50% is not uncommon on Amazon) become available. In industry jargon, the book has gone from â€œfrontlistâ€� to â€œbacklistâ€�: in catalogs, it is no longer fully described, but merely listed.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Copies are mostly sold out from the warehouse and large booksellers. At this point, they are available only via independent bookstores, and on Amazon via third-party sellers rather than Amazon itself. Prices start to rise back to list price.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Book is collectible, with new copies offered for increasing multiples of the original list price, and used copies in excellent condition not too far behind.</p>\n<p>Buying at stage 1 guarantees that you get a copy at list price but at that point, it is possible that the price will go down and the book will not become collectible. A book entering stage 3 is likely to reach stage 4, so for those collectors that focus on the â€œcollectibleâ€� aspect, this may be the safest time to buy. If at that point you are still on the fence, if do not buy and later you find yourself wanting the title, it may no longer be affordable, or even available at all.</p>\n<p>For maximum savings, the best time to buy the books is in stage 2. However, some coveted books never go to this stage and instead quickly sell out upon release and become collectible. This can go pretty fast. Despite its print run of 5,000, the first printing of <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Ftreasuredlandsbook.com%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\"><em>Treasured Lands</em></a> (2016) sold out in less than a month. Watching the pre-orders, I initiated a reprint before the book even hit the stores. </p>\n<p>Despite the book not checking most of the usual collectibility factors, in the few months between the fourth printing running out and the fifth printingâ€™s availability, the price of a new copy rose to more than three times the list price, while damaged copies sold over the list price. Pre-publication copies of Alec Sothâ€™s <em>Broken Manual</em> sold at art fairs such as Paris Photo. By the official publication date, not a single copy was available from the publisher. I passed on the limited edition available from the artist because it was priced in the high hundreds of dollars. Copies now start at $6,500.</p>\n<p>Other books never leave stage 2, and their price keeps dropping over time, as there is no demand. My first book, <em>Beautiful North America</em> retails for a fraction of its list price. That book was not my best effort: I only provided images as required by the publisher. Given the target market of discount stores, their effort in editing, design nor printing quality wasnâ€™t the greatest. I regret this book, and in that case, it would seem that the marketâ€™s assessment of its value is correct. However, there also are plenty of absolutely great books that never become collectible and can be bought at bargain prices.</p>\n<h3>Factors to Look For</h3>\n<p><strong>Authorship</strong>. Generally speaking, books that are a compilation of images by several photographers, especially if derived from stock libraries, lack an authorial voice and therefore are seldom considered works of art. That is the case of many coffee-table books. Exceptions include vernacular photography when curated in some clever way (as pioneered by Mandel and Sultanâ€™s Evidence) and some exhibit catalogs.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465658\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465658\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_new_topographics-800x645.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"645\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465658\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465658\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">In 1975, The New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape was a rare revolutionary exhibit. Even though published 35 years later, the exhibit survey was a much sought after record of it.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Significance/appeal of the artist and work</strong>. Work by artists without institutional art world recognition (exhibited in museums and galleries, reviewed in major publications) is less likely to be collectible and the same principle applies to their books. Some artists have such a reputation and manage so carefully their editions, that almost every one of their books becomes collectible. For a given artist, their earlier work or first breakthrough publication is often more sought after. If their career is, sometimes unfairly, defined by a publication, like Robert Frank by The Americans, it is no surprise that demand for that particular publication will be higher.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465659\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465659\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_americans-800x466.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"466\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465659\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465659\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Although more than 50,000 copies were printed, after Robert Frankâ€™s passing, demand for <em>The Americans</em> quickly drove used copies to more than five times the list price. Reprints have since then reappeared for the work, but not for the monumental catalog of the exhibit dedicated to the book.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Printing quality</strong>. Some older books, such as Brassaiâ€™s <em>Paris de Nuit</em> used to great effect the photogravure printing process to produce rich and sooty blacks. However, generally speaking, photographic printing quality made such great strides in the 1980s that most books published prior look mediocre compared to recent books. The newer books, therefore, provide more enjoyment even though they may not be as valuable as the older, rarer books. </p>\n<p>Some publishers are known for their uncompromising attention to printing quality. In a publisherâ€™s output, not every book is of the same quality. Within their commitment to publishing most of William Egglestonâ€™s work, Steidlâ€™s <em>Chromes</em> volume set was exceptionally well printed, whereas the follow up <em>Los Alamos</em> is just very good. Word has gotten out, and the former is more sought after.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465661\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465661\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_ansel_adams-800x460.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"460\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465661\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465661\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">After finding a copy of the first edition of the Portfolios of Ansel Adams, I was disappointed by the printing quality compared to the modern version. After reviewing several, I found out that the big jump in quality occurred between the 1st edition (1977) and the second edition (1982). Their advertising on the cover page was justified.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Elaborate Productions</strong>. A lot more goes into book production than printing quality, and this can include special materials for casings, unusually large trims, of which the most well-known example is Helmut Newtonâ€™s <em>Sumo</em>, elaborate slipcases, fold-out pages, and unconventional types of binding. For books that exist both as hardcover and softcover, the former is always preferable.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465662\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465662\" style=\"width: 726px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_nazraeli-726x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"726\" height=\"800\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465662\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465662\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A family-owned publisher like Nazraeli pays individual attention to every book, tailoring design, materials (such as the bamboo boards for Michael Kennaâ€™s Hokkaido), slipcases, trims (Jeff Liaoâ€™s Habitat 7 is 24Ã—12 inches, edition of 500) to fit each body of work and create a unique object.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Size of the print run</strong>. Everything being equal, the smaller the print run, the more valuable the book. Coffee-table books destined to the general public often have large print runs above 10,000. As a photography contributor to the two latest National Geographic books about national parks, I received a contract that stated a print run of 50,000 each. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, many publishers specializing in â€œartsyâ€� photography books, especially in Europe, issue print runs in the hundreds. Being geared for the collector market, they often specify the edition size, a piece of information generally not available otherwise. Because of the cost of setting up offset presses and the lack of other economies of scale, the smaller the print run, the higher the production costs per unit, and therefore the higher the retail price. </p>\n<p>In measurable terms such as page per dollar, those books can be an order of magnitude more expensive than mass-produced coffee-table books. Even though those editions are not limited in the sense that the publisher leaves to door open for a reprint, in practice, they rarely occur because demand is limited to collectors.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465663\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465663\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_500ed-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465663\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465663\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The copyright page of both those diminutive titles states that they are issued in an edition of 500.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Publisher</strong>. Books from some publishers (for example National Geographic) are hardly ever collectible, while almost everything that some other publishers put out is. This is simply because the laterâ€™s productions always check the four criteria mentioned above so they become known for publishing significant artists, in exquisitely crafted books of generally short print runs. This in turn generates prestige that attracts the best, a self-reinforcing loop. </p>\n<p>Steidl was the gold standard, with their art publishing program partly funded by some other aspects of their publishing enterprises, but while they remain a major force many contemporary photographers seem to have migrated to Mack. </p>\n<p>Non-profit publishing, a model that works well for photography books, is represented by museum or university presses, and associations such as Aperture and Radius. The later puts out books representing a great value given their production quality. The renewed interest in the photography book and the increased accessibility of publishing and printing resources has led to a profusion of very small publishers, whose work often surpasses that of more established ones. Some of the most prized books are artist books, sometimes made by hand.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465665\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465665\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_weston-800x668.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"668\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465665\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465665\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lodima Press, a small publisher created by a pair of fine art photographers, has used up to 600 line-screen whereas 175 line-screen (which requires 350 PPI) is standard â€“ the Brett Weston portfolios, containing only about a dozen images each, retailed for $60 or more.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Limited editions</strong>. Sometimes, concurrently to a trade, unlimited edition, a limited, numbered edition of the same work is offered. Those books are certainly more valuable, but I normally pass on them because they can expensive, especially if the offering includes a print. I find them worth it when the limited edition is a different and more appealing presentation of the work.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465667\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465667\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_killip-800x484.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"484\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465667\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465667\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chris Killipâ€™s <em>Here Comes Everybody</em> came in two editions. The trade edition looks like any other photo book. The limited edition (300 copies) is an elaborate production that resembles a photo album with tissue overlays and tipped-in plates, recreating the way the book originated.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>First editions</strong>. <em>Editions</em> refer to a book being re-issued with substantial updates, a different presentation such as softcover vs. a hardcover, or a different publisher. They are more relevant to guidebooks or technology tutorials, but even art books are sometimes re-issued with additional images or commentary. Editions are often mentioned as part of the title. </p>\n<p><em>Printings</em> refer to the book being re-issued in identical or near-identical form. They are indicated on the copyright page. If you donâ€™t find a mention such as â€œ2nd printingâ€�, there may be a series of numbers on the copyright page such as â€œ10 9 8 7 6 5 6 5 4 3 2â€�, with the last number representing the printing. Sometimes, only the year of the printing is indicated, and you need to research the printing history of the book to figure out which printing it is. </p>\n<p>Even if a book has a large total print run, the number of copies of the first edition and first printing (sometimes abbreviated as first edition) can be much smaller, which makes it valuable to collectors seeking rare books.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465668\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465668\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_decisive_moment-800x454.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"454\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465668\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465668\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">When Steidl reissued Henri Cartier-Bressonâ€™s <em>The Decisive Moment</em>, I bought a copy to use for reading, as my 1952 first edition copy was literally falling apart. Despite the availability of the reprint, the value of such a tattered copy didnâ€™t fall, while copies in excellent condition continued to command high prices.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Condition</strong>. Everything else being equal, in the collector world, a bookâ€™s condition is the most important factor in determining its value because even if an old book is not particularly rare, a copy in excellent condition is. From worst to best, the following terms are used: poor, fair/acceptable, good, very good, near fine, fine/like new, new. </p>\n<p>Most collectors consider that â€œgood isnâ€™t good enoughâ€�, and seek books in condition at least â€œvery goodâ€�: minor signs of wear, but no tears and no markings. It is important to take good care of oneâ€™s books. The better the book is, the more likely one is to share it with others, so the more likely it will get worn out no matter how careful you are. For this reason, some collectors like to buy two copies of titles they are excited about, one to read, and the other to keep in pristine condition, under the publisherâ€™s shrinkwrap.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_muir1-800x334.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"334\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465669\" /></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465670\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465670\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_muir2-800x255.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"255\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465670\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465670\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Three printings of the same book (John Muirâ€™s Our National Park) in fair, good and fine condition.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Removable elements</strong>. Some books were issued with a dust jacket. When buying used, a bit of research is necessary to figure out if that was the case, since dust jackets are often missing from used offerings. A first edition (later printing) copy of John Muirâ€™s <em>Our National Parks</em> with a dust jacket is worth ten times more than one without. Because of the bookâ€™s size, the dust jacket for Edward Westonâ€™s <em>My Camera at Pt. Lobos</em> is frequently damaged, so a dust jacket in excellent condition is particularly rare. To separate photographs from captions or commentary a separate booklet may be included, for instance when the book is printed full bleed like Sebastio Salgadoâ€™s major projects.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465671\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465671\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_belly_band-800x586.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"586\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465671\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465671\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Quite a few Japanese books include belly bands. Easily lost or damaged, not mentioned by the publisher, they sometimes contribute to most a bookâ€™s value.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Signed copies</strong>. There is a saying that the difference between a poster and an art print is the artistâ€™s signature. It is not entirely true, because the printing process matters a great deal. Still, an artistâ€™s signature helps in conferring to a book the status of an art object. Some signatures are rarer than others, and this varies from book to book. </p>\n<p>The very social Ansel Adams signed many more books than Edward Weston. When <em>My Camera at Pt. Lobos</em> was published, Edward Weston was sick with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, so signed copies are extremely rare. The proper spot for a signature is normally the half-title page â€“ the page where the only type is the title. Signatures can be obtained at lectures, gallery openings, and of course book signings. Pre-signed copies are sometimes available from the publisher or a gallery. Inscribed copies include, in addition to the signature, an inscription to a person. When the person is not of particular note, the inscription devaluates the signature, however, when they are, the inscription makes the book a valuable â€œassociation copyâ€�.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465672\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465672\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks_inscribed-800x507.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"507\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465672\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465672\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I like my books personalized as a memento of a connection with the artist. A book just signed may have a higher resale value, but I plan to hold onto those.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>What to Collect?</h3>\n<p>If you buy books that you like, whether they appreciate doesnâ€™t matter. With experience, you will be able to spot good books, well-made, and with inspired works in any genre, collectible or not. However, if you stick only to your present interests, you may be missing a lot of the vast world of photography. There are so many photography books out there that knowing where to start can be daunting. Anybody who studies literature reads through a list of classics. Photography has also its classics, representing a consensus of curators and critics.</p>\n<p>In the 20th century, the history of the photography book was kind of hidden within the history of photography. Since the beginning of this century, its narrative as a full medium has emerged. In 2001, Andrew Roth published the first authoritative English-language study of photography books, <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBook-101-Books-Photographic-Twentieth%2Fdp%2F0967077443%2F%3Ftag%3D8419-20\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">The Book of 101 Books: Seminal Photographic Books of the Twentieth Century</a>. </p>\n<p>Three years later, Martin Parr and Gerry Badger vastly expanded Rothâ€™s survey with <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhotobook-History-Gerry-Badger-2004-11-19%2Fdp%2FB01K0TUUR8%2F%3Ftag%3D8419-20\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">The Photobook: A History (Volume I)</a>, followed by <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhotobook-History-Gerry-Badger-2004-11-19%2Fdp%2FB01K0TUUR8%2F%3Ftag%3D8419-20\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Volume 2</a> (2006) and <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPhotobook-History-III-Martin-Parr%2Fdp%2F0714866776%2F%3Ftag%3D8419-20\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Volume 3</a> (2014).

To see what titles caught the attention of the blogosphere in a given year, refer to an initiative called the â€œphotobook meta-listâ€� that attempts to aggregate many â€œbest of the yearâ€� lists. </p>\n<p>The first photobook meta-list was created by Marc Feustel in <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marcfeustel.com%2Feyecurious%2Fphotobooks-2011-and-the-winner-is%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">2011</a>.

Since 2015, Viory Schellekens has been compiling another meta-list, and discovering that hers was more meticulous and informative than mine, I decided to pass the baton. Here are the links to Vioryâ€™s lists: <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fviorys%2Fposts%2F10207042980207205\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">2015</a>, <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FViory.Schellekens%2Fposts%2F1141053922630276\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">2016</a>, <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fmetalist2017\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">2017</a>, <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2FdaUPW\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">2018</a>, <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FViory.Schellekens%2Fposts%2F2509730949095893\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">2019</a>.

They sell photobooks as commodities, unlike the bookstores specializing in photography books such as <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.photoeye.com%2Fbookstore%2Findex.cfm%3Fcatalog%3DZJ289\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Photo-Eye</a> in Santa Fe or <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashwoodbooks.com%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Dashwood Books</a> in NYC. Those stores are run by people who know and love the medium, and are often able to procure hard to find books, foreign titles, or signed copies. </p>\n<p>If a title sells fast via other channels, the publisher may not send copies to Amazon at all, since of all bookstores, Amazon terms are the most unfavorable to publishers. As a result, if you placed a pre-order or order on Amazon for that â€œhotâ€� title, by the time you realize that it will not be fulfilled, the title may already have entered collectible territory.</p>\n<p>If you are knowledgeable, you can sometimes find bargains browsing used bookstores, and also make trades. However, the better the selection, the better the owner will be aware of the value of their books. In the San Francisco Bay Area, Moeâ€™s Books in Berkeley has the best selection. Such places are particularly valuable because you get to see in person many books. Their number has been declining, as the market has been moving away from brick-and-mortar towards online.</p>\n<p>Although not specializing in photography books, used bookstore networks such as <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Abebooks</a>, <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alibris.com%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Alibris</a>, and <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblio.com%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Biblio</a> give access to reliable professional used booksellers, especially those affiliated with the Antiquarian Booksellersâ€™ Association of America, whose meticulous descriptions can be relied upon. The best way to mobilize those vast resources is to use the bookstore meta search engine <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bookfinder.com%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Bookfinder.com</a>. </p>\n<p>I try to buy books directly from artists when possible in order to obtain a signature. It also helps them financially, since a book sold through retail earns the author only 5-10% of the list price. If you really get bitten by the photography book bug, you may want to travel attend some of the fairs and festivals dedicated to the medium that takes place annually. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/photobooks-shelves2-800x471.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"471\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465673\" /></p>\n<p>Collecting photography books is a great hobby that I highly recommend provided that you donâ€™t plan to move too often.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>About the author</strong>: QT Luong was the first to photograph all America&#8217;s 62 National Parks &#8212; in large format.

The streets were completely abandoned, a surreal version of our new reality.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/005045110030-800x531.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465864\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/005045110036-800x531.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465865\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/005045120019-800x531.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465866\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/005045130005-800x531.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465867\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;I had a lot of anxiety during lockdown, it was a time full of uncertainty,&#8221; Brad says. &#8220;Being a creative person I was looking for some sort of outlet after being alone for 3 months. I went outside when phase 1 of reopening the city began, but everything seemed to be abandoned. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It only made me feel more uncomfortable. This uncanny feeling of strangeness and emptiness comes through in the photos.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/005045140011-800x531.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\"

was any way to turn his Game Boy Camera into a functioning webcam so that (in his words) &#8220;I can be an a** to people I don&#8217;t respect.&#8221; Well, someone came through and showed that it is actually possible to do this.</p>\n<p>The whole thing started with user u/eye_for_an_homonculi on the r/Gameboy subreddit, who had a bit of a passive aggressive axe to grind. Earlier this week, he asked the subreddit if there was any way to use his Game Boy Camera as a webcam in order to &#8220;piss off&#8221; some people who had placed some ridiculous streaming rules onto a &#8220;professional development test&#8221; he had to take. </p>\n<p>Irony aside, after putting the question out there, retro gamer and hardware modder <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbernard.c%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Bernard Capulong</a> came through.

Few cameras (if any) manage to hold their MSRP/starting price for longer than a few months, so if Canon is willing to release this camera at $999 (or less), they expect to sell most of them at $100 or $200 below that price, bringing the full-frame barrier to entry all the way down into the $700 range for a brand new camera.</p>\n<p>Case in point: the Canon EOS RP, which debuted at $1,300 less than two years ago, <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fcarp.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">can be had for $1,000 brand new</a> as of this writing.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465805\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465805\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/carp_1-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465805\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465805\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Canon EOS RP debuted at $1,300 in February of 2019.

We all love cheaper gear&#8230; but Canon would likely lose money selling this camera in an attempt to get people hooked on the RF mount and its (mostly expensive) lenses.</p>\n<p>Still, with each new mirrorless camera release we see more comments asking for a stills-only full-frame camera that doesn&#8217;t bother with the expense or technology required to integrate high-quality video. Maybe that&#8217;s what Canon has in store for this ultra-affordable entry-level camera. Or maybe they&#8217;ll cut some other corner like leaving out the EVF.

business going, but the century-old Rode&#8217;s (as the community knew it) is likely gone for good.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Image credits:</strong> Header photo by Google Street

src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/ultimateportraitfeat-800x420.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"420\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465901\" /></p>\n<p>A while back, Fujifilm announced that they were working on a 33mm f/1 lens. Recently it was announced that they had scrapped that lens to work on a 50mm f/1, which would result in a more compact lens. With a super-fast 56mm f/1.2 already in the Fuji lens lineup, will a 50mm f/1 be different enough? We were lucky enough to get a sample 50mm f/1 to test out for a short while.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2020/09/03/fujifilm-unveils-xf-50mm-f-1-0-lens-the-fastest-fuji-lens-ever-made/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">The XF50mm f/1</a> is a chunky lens, which is to be expected given itâ€™s fast aperture. Despite its size, the lens has a minimalistic design with no switches and only an aperture ring. The aperture ring is a bit easier to change than some of Fujiâ€™s other lenses, which some photographers may like, but I found myself accidentally bumping it and changing apertures on more than one occasion. </p>\n<p>If you plan on manually focusing a lot, the focusing ring is nice and large and has a smooth throw with 120Âº of rotation to make manual focusing easy and precise. Like all other weather-resistant XF Lenses, it is protected against moisture and dust, and shouldnâ€™t have any issues when shooting in less than ideal environments. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PT_07_XF50mmF1_0_T4_Diagonal-1-800x648.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"648\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465902\" /></p>\n<p>The lens has a 77mm front filter thread, which is larger than most of Fujiâ€™s lenses, but a common size for CPL and ND/VND filters. It has 12 elements in 9 groups, with 1 aspherical element and 2 ED elements. </p>\n<p>It comes in at a hefty 845 grams, only about 100 grams less than the XF50-140mm f/2.8. The lens alone is just over 4 inches long, add the lens hood and youâ€™re looking at almost 6.5 inches. Even though it feels good to hold, itâ€™s not likely to be a lens youâ€™re always reaching for due to its size. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PT_05_XF50mmF1_0_T4Top-1-800x680.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"680\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465903\" /></p>\n<h3>Image Quality and Performance</h3>\n<p>Fuji went all-in on making this lens a great performer wide open, and the image quality supports it. The XF50mm f/1 is sharper than the XF56mm f/1.2 wide open, and it becomes more apparent the closer you get to your subject. </p>\n<p>As you stop down the lenses, the sharpness becomes more equal, but if youâ€™re buying an f/1 lens, chances are you want to shoot wide open. The close focus distance is very similar between the two lenses, right around 70cm, which is more than close enough for tight headshots. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/15ft_Side_By_Side-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465904\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/4ft_Side_By_Side-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465905\" /></p>\n<p>Light flaring and chromatic aberrations are minimal. The only time I saw any blue fringing was when shooting directly up until the sun through some leaves, and even then, itâ€™s a lot less than some f/1.4 and f/1.8 lenses Iâ€™ve used in similar situations. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF4743-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465906\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF4743-Edit-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465907\" /></p>\n<p>Autofocus speeds on the 50mm are average compared to the rest of the Fuji lineup. While the focus is precise and accurate, the speed isnâ€™t as fast as some of Fujiâ€™s fast primes and zooms, which is to be expected given the amount and size of the glass inside the lens. Face and Eye-AF worked well when tested on an X-T3 and X-T4. For videographers, the focus transitions are smooth, but itâ€™s not the quietest lens from Fuji. Focus motor noise is noticeable when using the in-camera mic, but it wasnâ€™t present when using a shotgun mic on the hotshoe. </p>\n<h3>Sample Images</h3>\n<p>These sample photos were taken with the <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fifjxt3b.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">X-T3</a> and <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fifjxt4b.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">X-T4</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF4724-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465908\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF4735-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465909\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF4857-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465910\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF0035-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465911\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF0249-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465912\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF9814_1-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465913\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF9368-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465914\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF9691-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465915\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF9854-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465916\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/HeadshotAtF1-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465917\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF4982-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465918\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF4923-HDR-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465919\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF4945-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465920\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/DSCF4928-HDR-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465921\" /></p>\n<h3>Who Is It For?</h3>\n<p>Coming in at $500 more than the <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fifj56xf.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">56mm f/1.2</a>, the $1,499 price tag on the 50mm f/1 can be a tough pill to swallow for some, especially considering itâ€™s only a half-stop faster.

data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">infrared photography</a>, full spectrum photography, or other things. Weâ€™ve been really excited about the R5/R6 release, and had plans to add some cooling mods and overhaul it into a proper video camera. </p>\n<p>Reports from <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eoshd.com%2Fnews%2Fcanon-eos-r5-so-called-overheat-timer-defeated-by-a-single-screw-in-battery-door%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\"><em>EOSHD</em></a> that Canon uses an overheat timer rather than actual temperature readings left us a bit disappointed, and calls into question whether physically cooling down the camera can actually give any more shooting time. </p>\n<p>Andrew Reid was able to bypass this timer by using a screw to override the safety shutoff switch in the battery door compartment and do a hard shutdown during recording, but this seems to corrupt video files. â€œMath Classâ€� on Baidu recently showed that removing the clock battery can also bypass this timer. A firmware update by Canon on the R5 has also recently extended the shooting length by a seemingly arbitrary time, showing that software can absolutely affects shutdown times. </p>\n<p>These data so far suggest that the camera keeps internal time, keeps time when the camera is off, and uses these values to influence if shooting can resume. A hard shutdown corrupts some data being written, preventing a time limit from being established. The clock battery removal suggests that without a clock keeping time while the camera is off, there is no way to establish a countdown timer, and the camera defaults to zero on the shooting time. </p>\n<p>With this knowledge, we wanted to investigate how the camera functions without a clock battery, could we identify a physical clock chip on the board, and is there a more advanced modification that could be made to interrupt the clock timer communication without affecting date/time settings. Right now we only have the R6 to work with, but we suspect the R5 works similarly. If anyone has an R5, please contact us.</p>\n<p>So first, letâ€™s start with the clock battery. It can be found on the back of the main circuit board.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/battery-1-800x420.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"420\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466044\" /></p>\n<p>The first thing we wanted to check was, how does missing the battery affect general performance? The clock is of course reset, but on other Canon cameras it has prevented saving shooting settings and custom settings, which would be deal breaker. </p>\n<p>So we set some custom menus, changed some shooting values, and some menu settings, and then proceeded to remove the clock battery. Leaving the board completely powered off without any battery source for about 30 minutes, we re-assembled the camera sans battery and checked it out. We received the expected prompt for time/date, but were pleasantly surprised to find the rest of our settings were still there. Nice! </p>\n<p>We also found that the camera keeps time as long as the main battery is in place, even when turned off. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/timerchip2-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466033\" /></p>\n<p>Next up, could we trace out where the battery leads connect to. Visually checking, the leads from the battery immediately go down into the board to a middle layer, so we could not visually trace them out. Oh well, we have a multimeter! </p>\n<p>Running a continuity check from the leads, I was able to trace the right lead to the common ground right away. The left positive lead was a bit harder, but the trace must come out somewhere, so I went around testing components throughout the board on both sides. A bit tedious, but I was able to identify only one chip that the battery feeds into.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/timerchip-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466031\" /></p>\n<p>We needed a microscope to read the chip, but were able to identify it as the RX8130 Real Time Clock, complete with a 59 page documentation PDF. Bingo. This is what keeps time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/chip.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"219\" height=\"200\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-466034\" /></p>\n<p>The wiring diagram for the RX8130 looks like this (see below). I was able to identify the clock battery feeds into pin 10 through a 470 ohm resister. Pin 7 also connects to ground. Interestingly, pin 6, 2, and 3 either connect to nothing, or connect to something directly going down under the board. We need to remove the chip to see more definitively, but potentially they are not used.</p>\n<p>Pin 4 from the documentation is used for the frequency out, and this connects to a 6 pin chip immediately to the right that reads only pQ on it, hopefully someone has more insight on this chip. Pin 5 leads elsewhere on the board we canâ€™t identify. Pins 1 connects to a distant BGA mounted chip with what looks like a smoothing capacitor connection to ground. Pins 8 and 9 also connect elsewhere we canâ€™t trace yet and also feature smoothing capacitors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/manual-800x537.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"537\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466035\" /></p>\n<p>So far, thatâ€™s all the progress we made. We like to be transparent in what our mods do, so we decided to open up our research here as we go. </p>\n<p>Based on this chipâ€™s documentation, our basic understanding is that this chip receives power from the main board first, and if there is no power there, it draws power from the backup button cell battery. The chip is able to keep time, and can output time data, as well as other stored data, there is some room for general bit storage. The chip is also able to send interrupt and data signals back out, but so far it doesnâ€™t look like those pins are necessarily being used. Canon may not be using the internal interrupt and timer functions, and may be doing that elsewhere using this chip as only a timekeeper.</p>\n<p>Our next plan is to verify this with an R5, and pop the chip out and see if we can measure any signals on a scope during the actual overheat event. In the meantime, from how the settings storage is handled, it looks like we should be able to just remove the clock battery, or put the clock battery on a separate toggle switch. Also, we can of course bypass the hard reset screw approach Andrew Reid did, and just put a hard switch on the power leads to the main board. We can even control these switch with a microcontroller and force a hard reset through software if needed, say something like, after you hit record the camera cycles a hard shutdown after 15 minutes, or cycles an ordered shutdown paired with a clock reset as a coordinated event. </p>\n<p>We also want to check how the camera behaves if there is no clock power even when the camera is on. I suspect a hard error, but who knows! BUT WE NEED AN R5 to start. Please, internet. If you have one you can loan or sell us, weâ€™ll share what we find publicly and give you first access to our Frankenstein bypassed ultimate R5 mod.</p>\n<p><strong>One final important comment</strong>: While it seems definitive that Canon is using a timer circuit to shut down the R5 in overheating, we can only speculate as to why for now. It is possible that it&#8217;s there to &#8220;cripple&#8221; the camera, but itâ€™s still very possible that there are some overheating concerns for this weather sealed body, and they are shutting down based on a timer schedule for now for longevity.</p>\n<p>I would approach any of these bypass strategies with extreme caution, as they will probably not only void your warranty, but potentially fry your camera from extended shooting. We still plan to open up the R5 and add a heatsink thatâ€™s thermally fused to the overheating chips and card slots, and attach this heatsink to an aluminum cage for dissipation, as well an active fan. In this cooled context, we expect to keep the R5 very cool for extended shooting, but it would require the timer shutdown to be bypassed.</p>\n<p>So let us know what you think and if you have any chip insight! What would you like us to try next?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>About the author</strong>: Ilija Melentijevic is a scientist/photographer and owner of <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fkolarivision.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Kolari Vision</a>, an infrared camera conversion business based in New Jersey.

Case in point: in this video, filmmaker Sareesh Sudhakaran of <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUC7gBcKzHKc0oOR5-XiWdlFQ\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Wolfcrow</a> explains how great movies will often use the &#8216;Three Color Rule&#8217; to capture and keep a viewer&#8217;s attention.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve shared many tips, tutorials, and breakdowns about <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/?s=color+theory\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">color theory</a> over the years, but Sudhakaran&#8217;s video takes a simple approach. He picks a few critically acclaimed films like <em>Joker</em>, <em>Her</em>, <em>Amelie</em>, and <em>Drive</em>, and shows you how the cinematographer, DOP, and editors used the so-called &#8220;Three Color Rule&#8221; to focus the audience&#8217;s attention on the story.</p>\n<p>The basic rule is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You have three important colors in your frame: about 60% of the frame is the predominant or primary color, about 30% is a secondary color, and the last 10% is an accent color.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the movie <em>Her</em>, for example, Sudhakaran identifies the primary color as a brown, the secondary color as red, and the accent color as a barely noticeable blueish shade:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/her_colors-800x440.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"440\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465983\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not always this obvious, but great films are remarkably consistent about the color grading choices they make in order to maintain a mood, direct the audience&#8217;s attention, and sometimes outright tell the view what&#8217;s going on, using color as the vehicle for that message.</p>\n<p>This video is a great reminder of the powerful role that color can play in bringing a series of workâ€”or even a single, still imageâ€”together into a cohesive whole. Everybody&#8217;s approach to using color will (and should) differ, but if you&#8217;re trying to develop a personal &#8220;style&#8221; that is recognizable, it would be foolish to pay close attention to things like genre, composition, lighting, posing, props, or even camera brand, and leave color as an afterthought.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2020/06/26/an-ode-to-harry-gruyaert-a-master-of-color-photography/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">the great Harry Gruyaert</a> once said, &#8220;if you shoot in color, it has to be the first thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(via <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Flaughingsquid.com%2Fthree-color-rule%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Laughing Squid</a>)</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?a=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?a=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:xgp37Vp8p2g\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?i=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:xgp37Vp8p2g\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?a=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?a=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?i=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?a=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?i=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?a=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?i=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PetaPixel/~4/smTGfcnKCn8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 14:20:48 +0000","feedId":607,"bgimg":"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/her_colors-800x440.jpg","linkMd5":"5554a22d04456f410e24c668c8e0fbeb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn6@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-48-04-800_0791fe432dfe5a68.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":440,"sourceBytes":58402,"destBytes":20780,"author":"<a href=\"https://petapixel.com/author/dlcade/\">DL Cade</a>","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/her_colors-800x440.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn6@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-48-04-800_0791fe432dfe5a68.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn14@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-48-04-824_de7088392fb5a9b8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?i=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:xgp37Vp8p2g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn9@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-48-15-525_dade5b0ca0d61d49.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn92@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-48-17-572_701e8443590d36d5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?i=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn9@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-48-18-632_5c98d2129643d1c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?i=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn30@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-48-14-255_3c941b7b6df7cac5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/PetaPixel?i=smTGfcnKCn8:ZXctKr63djw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/PetaPixel/~4/smTGfcnKCn8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn67@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-48-15-127_cdcbeac9b849dede.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599238084506},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:48:04","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:48:04","title":"A GoPro Drone Tour Through the 500-Year-Old Castle on Mont-Saint-Michel","link":"http://petapixel.com/?p=465873","description":"<p><center><div class=\"fluid-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\"><div class=\"fluid-iframe__inner\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wk9quCrd-bw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

Fujifilm has unveiled the <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fifj50xf.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Fujinon XF 50mm f/1.0 WR</a>â€”the fastest lens Fuji has ever made and the world&#8217;s first f/1.0 autofocus lens for mirrorless cameras.</p>\n<p>Fuji has dubbed this lens &#8220;The One&#8221;, and is promising that it will change the way you work by providing the incredibly shallow depth-of-field and extreme low-light performance of an f/1.0 lens <em>without</em> sacrificing autofocus or skimping on the weather sealing.</p>\n<p>â€œWeâ€™re really excited about the XF50mmF1.0 R WR,â€� says Fujifilm&#8217;s Victor Ha, senior director of marketing and product management at Fujifilm North America. â€œNot only is it the fastest interchangeable lens Fujifilm has ever produced, but itâ€™s also an incredible tool for visual storytellers to use in telling their stories because its autofocus can achieve critical focus at very shallow depth of fields.â€�</p>\n<p>You can get an overview of the new lens in the video below:</p>\n<p><div class=\"fluid-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\"><div class=\"fluid-iframe__inner\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/soUkgIR6g-c\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p>\n<p>Optically, the lens is made up of 12 elements in 9 groupsâ€”including one aspherical element and two extra-low dispersion (ED) elementâ€”which pair with a 9-blade rounded aperture that goes from f/1.0 to f/16. As you might imagine, this lens is all about that maximum aperture and what it will allow you to do&#8230; not just obliterate the background, but in low-light as well.</p>\n<p>At f/1.0, the lens allows the Fuji X-Pro3 and X-T4 cameras&#8217; autofocus systems to operate at just -7EV (previous limit was -6EV), promising &#8220;fast and precise low-light autofocus, even in near-darkness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking of autofocus, the lens&#8217; AF system is powered by a direct current (DC) motor that relies on the Fuji X-Series PDAF for directions. However, if you want to go full manual, you&#8217;ll find a nice looooong 120Â° focus throw on the focus ring itself, making it possible to actually nail focus with a little help from from peaking and focus assist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/fujilens_2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"541\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465782\" /></p>\n<p>OF course, in order to pack all of this into a single lens, Fuji wasn&#8217;t exactly able to make this a &#8220;compact&#8221; optic. The 50mm f/1.0 features a 77mm filter thread, measures 4.07-inches (103.5mm) long and weighs in at 1.86lb (845g), which is&#8230; hefty for a 50mm. </p>\n<p>However, that does include an autofocus motor <em>and full weather sealing</em>, making this a &#8220;WR&#8221; lens that&#8217;s protected against dust and moisture, and can be used reliably at temperatures as low as 14Â°F (-10Â°C).</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at this impressive optic:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PT_02_XF50mmF1_0_lensSide-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465770\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/MAIN_XF50mmF1_0_lens_Diagonal_edit-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465769\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PT_03_XF50mmF1_0_T4Front-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465771\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PT_04_XF50mmF1_0_Pro3Front-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465772\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PT_05_XF50mmF1_0_T4Top-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465773\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PT_06_XF50mmF1_0_Pro3Top-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465774\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PT_07_XF50mmF1_0_T4_Diagonal-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465775\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PT_08_XF50mmF1_0_Pro3_Diagonal-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465776\" /></p>\n<p>And here are some photos and videos that show what this ultra-fast Fuji lens can do IRL: </p>\n<p><div class=\"fluid-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\"><div class=\"fluid-iframe__inner\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/paRjvewPruo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p>\n<p><div class=\"fluid-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\"><div class=\"fluid-iframe__inner\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QylirpHBScM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p>\n<p><div class=\"fluid-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\"><div class=\"fluid-iframe__inner\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wllifhG5gk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465781\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465781\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/xf50mmf1-r-wr_img_04-ahaf-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465781\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465781\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shot at 50mm, f/1.0,  1/125 and ISO 640 | Photo by Jamie Stoker</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465784\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465784\" style=\"width: 533px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/xf50mmf1-r-wr_img_02-ahaf-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465784\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465784\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shot at 50mm, f/1.0,  1/900 and ISO 800 | Photo by Yukio Uchida</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465780\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465780\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/xf50mmf1-r-wr_img_01-ahaf-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465780\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465780\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shot at 50mm, f/1.0,  1/1000 and ISO 320 | Photo by Knut Koivisto</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The Fujifilm XF 50mm f/1.0 WR is expected to ship in &#8220;Fall 2020,&#8221; but you can <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fifj50xf.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">pre-order it</a> starting right now for $1,500.

class=\"fluid-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\"><div class=\"fluid-iframe__inner\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s27PieFs5CE\" frameborder=\"0\"

Morgan and Kenneth Merrill over at <em>The Slanted Lens</em> decided to answer a question that popped up several times in the comments of a previous video: can the pixel shifting on a Micro Four Thirds or full-frame camera match the output of a 100MP medium format sensor? </p>\n<p>The three cameras being tested here are the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III, the Sony a7R IV, and the Fujifilm GFX 100, and the point was simple: limitations of pixel shift photography aside, can the output from the Olympus and Sony&#8217;s respective &#8216;pixel shift&#8217; modes out-perform the standard, single-shot performance of the 100MP medium format GFX 100?</p>\n<p>The side-by-side test involved capturing photos of The Broad art museum, since its architectural style and location was ideally suited for highlighting issues like aliasing and any problems with dynamic range.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/Pixel-Shift-Thumbnail-2_DSCF0012_crop_sm-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466005\" /></p>\n<p>First, they compared the full-frame Sony to the medium format GFX. When using the pixel shift mode with the Sony, you have two options: a 4-image stack that spits out a sharper version at the same 61MP resolution as a single shot; or a 16-image stack that produces a whopping 240MP file.</p>\n<p>You can see side-by-side comparisons of the output from the Fuji and the Sony (in both modes) below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift12.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift12-800x449.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466012\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift15-800x448.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466013\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift18.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift18-800x449.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466014\" /></a></p>\n<p>Next, they compared the Olympus output to both the Sony and the Fuji GFX.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the quality of the Olympus file came out <em>much</em> sharper if you process the files in Olympus&#8217; own Workspace software, as compared to using Photoshop. You can see a side-by-side below and there&#8217;s really no comparison: if you&#8217;re using the pixel shift mode on your Olympus camera, definitely use Workspace to stack the images.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift26.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift26-800x449.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466016\" /></a></p>\n<p>The rest of the comparisons were done using the Workspace version (obviously) in order to keep quality as high as possible.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the Olympus 4-image stack against the Sony with no image shift, and then the against the Sony&#8217;s 4-image stack mode:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift28.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift28-800x448.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466018\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift27.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift27-800x448.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466017\" /></a></p>\n<p>Finally, you can see the Olympus pixel shift image followed by the GFX all by itself below. For some reason, they didn&#8217;t show these side-by-side in the video:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift31.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift31-800x449.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466020\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift35.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/PixelShift35-800x449.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-466021\" /></a></p>\n<p>An interesting aside: Jay makes a good point at the very beginning of the video before jumping in. It&#8217;s worth reprinting in full just to keep these kinds of technical comparisons in perspective:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The reality of photography is: if it&#8217;s creative, and it communicates, and people will pay you for it, that&#8217;s commercial art. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you shot it with a shoebox, with a piece of tin, with a hole pocked in the front of it. It doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>So these kinds of conversations are interesting. But the reality is that they are for tech heads.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with being a &#8220;tech head&#8221; and enjoying the occasional pixel-peeping comparison, but it&#8217;s worth keeping Jay&#8217;s words in mind since sensor size comparisons tend to get people&#8217;s blood pressure into the danger zone.</p>\n<p>Anyway, to see this intriguing comparison

the day, a teenager made an unwise camera choice<sup>1</sup> to record what he was experiencing in case he might later forget. In reality, the choice was really to consciously notice the world around him and single out the bits that mattered â€“ starting immediately with the things he was involved in, which at the time was the crazy period of growing up known as â€˜universityâ€™. </p>\n<p>Heâ€™d used the family camera before, of course â€“ for the obligatory vacation and landmark images and with the admonition not to â€˜waste film on pictures without people in them.â€™ University represented freedom and the first time he could decide what to aim the camera at â€“ back then, merely his friendsâ€™ silly poses and an image or two without people that he felt compelled to take, but wasnâ€™t sure why. It wouldnâ€™t be until much, much later that the process was a conscious one and more importantly, transcended the medium.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50183403786_c22ac76537_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"799\" height=\"536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465601\" /></p>\n<p>I had no idea that the decision to start seeing the world around me would not just sustain me through the creative depression of the corporate wilderness for the better part of a decade, but take me to places Iâ€™d never even dreamed of. It would give me a respite in lunch-hour sized chunks from the sheer mind-numbing boredom of audit. It would bring me to the attention of the watch collecting community â€“ in lieu of actually being able to afford anything at the time â€“ and brand principals in the early days of online forums, and later supply my first professional job. </p>\n<p>It would take me through a part-time contributor position at a magazine that would lead to editor, disagreements over commercial/editorial integrity, and the formation of my site, <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mingthein.com%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">mingthein.com</a>, to write the truth and present it how I felt was right, independent of influence or dependency on advertising. It would lead me to make â€˜pictures without people in themâ€™ for companies and individuals Iâ€™d never thought Iâ€™d be involved with, let alone creatively contributing to. </p>\n<p>It would put me in a position to take user feedback and personal experience to directly develop better products with just about all of the major camera manufacturers â€“ and it would leave a lot of things tainted in the harsh light of reality. It would train me to think like an entrepreneur and be self-sufficient, and give me the ability to present the best face of my projects to the world. It would give me a meditative reprieve from times when I didnâ€™t want to dwell too much on my immediate situation. </p>\n<p>It would lead me to question and seek to understand art, human psychology, my own motivations, and what truly motivates us; it would help me to understand the meaning of balance in more ways than one. Above all, it would make me close friends around the world. For all of that, Iâ€™ll always be thankful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50250138358_0c0c591583_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"531\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465602\" /></p>\n<p>It hasnâ€™t always been an easy ride, as anybody close to me will confirm. Iâ€™ve had my fair share of uncertain income, business mistakes, taking on jobs I wasnâ€™t entirely sure I could pull off and unpleasant surprises from clients, unrelated individuals, industry peers and entities, and everything in-between. Iâ€™ve been the target of jealousy and smear campaigns and entitlement and copyright infringement. </p>\n<p>Some of that frustration Iâ€™ve shared on my site before. Months of drought alternated â€“ often back to back â€“ with months so full I barely had time to sleep and was running on pure adrenalin. Iâ€™ve held anywhere between three and six ostensibly full-time jobs at any given time, for most of my full time professional photographic career since 2012 â€“ a close friend once joked that I was doing the work of six for the pay of two and a half, which is not far from the truth. </p>\n<p>I entered professional photography at a rapidly changing time and probably the last period to really make a run of things before fragmentation into quantity, the whole social media influencer mess; my guess at the time was Iâ€™d have 3-5 years before Iâ€™d have to figure out what to do next.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50250787301_519882bae4_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"531\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465604\" /></p>\n<p>During the times Iâ€™d previously dabbled in trying to turn pro, Iâ€™d figured out that I would have to have a diversified approach: a professional portfolio that was focused enough to look specialized but with enough skills to take on pretty much any job; a public presence to build reputation and audience; something with more consistent income like teaching or education (which turned into workshops and videos); and something to put all of the pieces together to deliver unique value: this would be the consulting side for the camera companies. </p>\n<p>It seems that the strategy worked a little <em>too</em> well, because to this day people seem to assume all I do is reviews â€“ even though thatâ€™s less than 5% of the content of my site. But they played an important part since validation is by far the most commonly searched-for thing photographically. Why thatâ€™s the case, Iâ€™ll never know â€“ everybody has different objectives, and opinions are therefore of at best relative value.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50266889211_fd28acb462_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"531\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465605\" /></p>\n<p>As it turns out, my workload split itself pretty much equally between professional work, education, consulting, and my site. In the last eight and a half years, I shot 202 assignments excluding those for my own watch company; led nearly 50 workshops around the world including smuggling six Americans into Cuba in 2014; produced close to 200 hours of educational video and two years of the weekly photoshop workflow series; wrote 1,815 posts (and owe Robin Wong a big thanks for another 80+) and replied to nearly 100,000 of your comments. </p>\n<p>At peak, there were nearly a <em>quarter of a million</em> unique visitors every month, and there have been just shy of 30 million visitors to date. I had half a dozen exhibitions internationally and nearly fell out of a plane making a series that in the end, never got shown. </p>\n<p>I worked with Hasselblad, DJI, Zeiss, Olympus, Leica, Sigma, Sony, was an ambassador for three of those brands, and nearly started my own camera company. I wore out three keyboards writing my site, and a further four Wacom tablets in retouching and post-processing. Lastly: I donâ€™t have an exact number, but my best guess is I shot more than two million images.</p>\n<p>Thatâ€™s a lot of work â€“ an entire lifetime, for some; certainly a careerâ€™s worth for me. (And for increasing numbers of dishonest others, a place to steal content to farm ad revenue.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50183662272_3cf86ab05d_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"536\" height=\"799\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465606\" /></p>\n<p>If things are starting to take on a tone of finality, thatâ€™s because this is the point at which I confirm the suspicions youâ€™ve been having: Ming Thein the writer and <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fmingthein.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">mingthein.com</a> are both going into retirement. Between the demands of my â€˜otherâ€™ job, not being able to travel, and trying not to repeat myself â€“ Iâ€™ve run out of things to say. </p>\n<p>There really isnâ€™t anything meaningful which we have not covered on my site in the usual rational, systematic fashion with plenty of images â€“ there are certainly subtleties on subtleties about approach and theory and philosophy that we could continue to debate, but at that point, Iâ€™d be writing dissertations for an audience of at best, one. The truth is, Iâ€™ve said everything I wanted to say and more; Iâ€™ve done enough thinking and dissection about how and why I shoot that the whole enormous mass has become intuitive â€“ and I want to go back to applying that and shooting the things that interest me, for me, without feeling the need to create content for the entertainment of somebody else. </p>\n<p>The internet has a nasty habit of a short attention span: they tend to look at things in tl;dr terms and not bother to use the search function. There is admittedly quite a lot of frustration in having a comment taken out of context and applied without relativity; a really good example is the inability to decouple equipment from process from creative objective. </p>\n<p>Yes, I go through a lot of gear. No, it isnâ€™t for the sake of having the Next Best Thing or some sort of placebo â€“ itâ€™s because Iâ€™m in search of what I think of as <em>envelope</em>; the ability to achieve very specific creative objectives, which change â€“ and therefore so must the tools.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50209553908_d5d85c53e5_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"634\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465607\" /></p>\n<p>But it does get tiring having to explain this all the time. Iâ€™ve always said that the very best position to be in as a photographer is an amateur: a person who engages in the activity for the love of it, without the constraints of shooting to a clientâ€™s expectation â€“ be that a social media audience or a paying employer. This is <em>my</em> chance to go back to being an amateur, at least for a little while. </p>\n<p>The whole COVID situation has enforced a strange motivation on us creatives: at the start, I had one of my most productive periods because there wasnâ€™t a lot else to do being under lockdown and unable to leave the house. But it was productivity in a different avenue â€“ I did a lot of designing, and almost no writing or photographing. Iâ€™ve long come to accept that creativity needs multiple outlets; a single medium isnâ€™t enough to fulfill oneâ€™s vision. </p>\n<p>But for photographers, the last few months has been a bad period not just professionally but also creatively: when youâ€™re constrained to the same familiar environment youâ€™ve probably already photographed to death within the first few months of moving in, whatâ€™s left? Youâ€™re forced to either not shoot, reshoot the same images, or try to see something different in the familiar. Many documented the personal process of lockdown, including myself; but after a while, routine looks the same. But the process of doing it felt oddly familiar: it was like starting to shoot all over again, and I kinda liked it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50250998137_29be50a108_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465608\" /></p>\n<p>The first time you do anything creative is difficult, because youâ€™re not just grappling with trying to get the desired outcome from the building blocks youâ€™ve got, but also the entire mechanical process of things. There are experiments that yield results that move you for reasons you donâ€™t quite understand, and unfortunately cannot repeat; and others that fail completely. </p>\n<p>It was really that feeling of challenge and constraint again, and with the very same initial backdrop of documenting my personal sphere: itâ€™s very easy to make different images of different subjects youâ€™ve never seen before; it isnâ€™t so easy to make different images of subjects you see all the time, but likely fail to notice. </p>\n<p>I found myself being forced to really <em>see</em> again, and in the process realized how much Iâ€™d been stuck in my comfort zone. The weight of experience becomes a tangibly corporeal thing that can sometimes hold you back from experimenting because of the expectations attached. Ironically, it seems the task of exiting my comfort zone would happen within the most comfortable of zones.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50250806191_791f37eddc_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465609\" /></p>\n<p>Except this time I had the vocabulary and technique to get the images I saw in my mindâ€™s eye; but I just need that eye to see differently. I needed to not care about who would see the images (i.e. nobody); what I would use them for; what else I had to do with my time â€“ in short, nothing more than whether I liked the result or not. All of the rational means of assessing and curating I use like <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mingthein.com%2F2016%2F07%2F28%2Fthe-four-things-redux%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">the four things</a> arenâ€™t so much ignored as practiced and internalized to the point of becoming intuitive. </p>\n<p>I have had, and can have, pretty much whatever hardware I want; I can extract the full potential from that hardware. I needed an irrational, emotional thing to match an irrational, emotional process â€“ something limited and constrained, but not constraining; something tactile and encouraging but not emotionless and functional. Yes, I did buy something; no, Iâ€™m not going to say what it is so I can avoid the risk of having it â€˜spoiledâ€™; I donâ€™t need the affirmation of the internet that I made the right choice â€“ I <em>know</em> I made the right choice <em>for me</em>. </p>\n<p>I enjoy the process of using it and it enables and encourages the kind of images that Iâ€™m making now â€“ the images in this post â€“ that move me but require no justification to anybody else. Odd as it may sound, the lack of negative emotional connotations for my tools is very important to me. Itâ€™s one of the reasons I have very few holdovers from previous collaborations/jobs/engagements; the creative in me needs a new, clean tool for a new job, and the businessman needs fiscal efficiency and low wastage.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50250805826_1d05bb4dc2_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"799\" height=\"536\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465612\" /></p>\n<p>There will always remain the need for dichotomy and contrast, however: I will still continue to produce work for my long-standing clients, and Iâ€™m fairly sure this creative loop will result in better work than before. I will still produce all of the images for <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ming.watch%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">my watch company</a> because thereâ€™s a certain nice continuity between seeing a design that doesnâ€™t exist, to translating it through physical process into an object, to being able to highlight detail and intent. </p>\n<p>As much as I hate retouching dust (now worse than ever with the kind of resolution media asks for and the insensitive cropping that accompanies it) â€“ we arenâ€™t going to move to CG imaging. Hell, I donâ€™t even composite images â€“ Iâ€™ve had more than one client surprised when they find out all of the watch images are a single shot in-camera and you can really see the same thing with your own eyes if the lights are set up right. It is a hard-won and exceptionally masochistic lost art that I have no intention of relinquishing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50251016092_6b1b96761f_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"537\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465613\" /></p>\n<p>At the same time as the world around us is changing and Iâ€™m grateful for having had the opportunity to travel to the places I have with the freedom we had previously â€“ the immediate world around me is also changing. My daughter is growing up, and as much as I never quite understood the obsession and lack of objectivity that comes with photographing oneâ€™s children â€“ itâ€™s starting to make a little more sense to me. </p>\n<p>The last couple of years have seen less photography and documentary of the younger one, offset against being busy with other things or directly involved and not having free hands or mental space to shoot â€“ but I have the sudden realization that time has skipped a gear and now seems to be progressing faster again. Itâ€™s certainly time for me to put a bit more effort once again into trying to freeze her personality in a defining moment or two. </p>\n<p>Sheâ€™s also turned into a bit of a camwhore, but I guess the outcome was always binary with a photographer father: either comfortable with being in front of the lens, or avoiding it entirely. At times Iâ€™m probably almost more self-conscious than she is about the camera.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50250998102_83ba96e677_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"531\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465615\" /></p>\n<p>In a post-pandemic world, Iâ€™m left wondering if faces are going to become a very personal thing; a mask lends a degree of not just immunological protection but also personality protection; itâ€™s almost like the anonymity of the internet. Weâ€™re seeing a lot of bad behavior thatâ€™s a lot harder to do if you know the person in front of you, and they know you; itâ€™s just no longer personal anymore. </p>\n<p>Maybe if we go back to being able to travel again, weâ€™re never quite going to have the same experience because people wonâ€™t look different; the subtle cues we get from the faces and expressions around us will be lost behind the mask. It makes me really want to take up portraiture; not just of the people I know or posed models, but a wide variety of subjects â€“ almost more to feel whatâ€™s really going on at the present moment than to make an interesting image. </p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve said previously that portraiture is really the record of the relationship between the photographer and subject; but perhaps it can be more â€“ itâ€™s also the unspoken thoughts and emotions behind what was held back.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50210074106_1d1b4cfb04_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"531\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465616\" /></p>\n<p>There are professions that are always going to be a bit morose no matter how you view them â€“ an undertaker, for example â€“ but photography isnâ€™t one of them. Anything creative (except perhaps accounting) should come with a sense of liberation and the satisfaction of having made order and beauty out of incoherent parts. When that joy is no longer present, then I sincerely believe youâ€™re doing it wrong. </p>\n<p>There is a tricky balance between focusing entirely on photography and not having any meaning to photograph and focusing on other things and failing to see; the pro almost inevitably errs on the former side, and the majority of the population, the latter. The hobbyist gets lost in the camera store.</p>\n<p>I look back at the highlight reel of my own work, and realize the images that spoke to me then and still speak to me today are almost all spontaneous, and produced during those fleeting periods where curiosity balanced opportunity â€“ the last day of a work trip set aside for personal meandering; the free afternoon of a workshop; the time when the weather was crap and we shot documentary on the assembly line instead of on location.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50250980522_c294fd84a0_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"531\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465617\" /></p>\n<p>Planned images are limited by oneâ€™s means and imagination. Serendipitous ones are unlimited by chance and oneâ€™s subconscious. I need to travel again, but not hold any preconceptions about what Iâ€™m going to see, or inhibitions against photographing it. Development of any kind â€“ creative or otherwise â€“ can only happen if the right things are broken down in the process. It means leaving your comfort zone and trying something new; of not being afraid that the next step may lead down a dead end. </p>\n<p>Professional photography, my site, teaching, consulting â€“ has gone from being dangerously scary with a side of <em>doki-doki</em> excitement to business as usual; nobody told me what I was supposed to do, but I eventually found a comfortable process. Itâ€™s probably going to be harder to break those habits than anything.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50173395181_a0b627f823_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"537\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465618\" /></p>\n<p>I feel like the only obvious thing left is the question of whatâ€™s next â€“ <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ming.watch%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Horologer MING</a> is now no longer a new venture; at some point in the last year I got the distinct feeling weâ€™d transitioned from being the new kids to having our own defined niche in the industry establishment. The plan was already brewing during peak photography for me; by 2016 the wheels were in motion and in 2017, our first model was released to much nail biting and eventually success. </p>\n<p>In the three years since our public debut, weâ€™ve released 16 models, been shortlisted for and won the industryâ€™s biggest award, and become both commercially viable and sought after. We wonâ€™t make the mistake of growing too fast and being unable to uphold the level of collector engagement we started off with; instead, weâ€™ll aim for a sustainable point that lets us have meaningful conversations with our buyers, make watches that continue to interest us personally and have the resources, time and mental overhead to make interesting images and drive engaging cars. </p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve come to realize that the spark required to keep oneâ€™s enthusiasm alive is maintained both by not fixating too much on one thing and being open to cross-disciplinary inspiration; itâ€™s hard to keep an open mind if you canâ€™t see beyond your immediate situation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50250156738_b3511237be_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465619\" /></p>\n<p>Iâ€™m not ruling out another publicly shared/photographic project in the future, but right now I have no idea what form that might take â€“ or if it will happen at all. Iâ€™ve been so caught up in the â€˜business as usualâ€™ of keeping my site/ client commitments/ teaching/ consulting etc. running that Iâ€™ve frankly not had a lot of time to think about a major change in format or direction. </p>\n<p>Perhaps it will eventually come after some time off, and probably like most inspiration â€“ come at the least expected point. The truth is, Iâ€™ve been a photographer for so long at this point â€“ longer than I havenâ€™t been one â€“ I canâ€™t <em>stop</em> being one. It isnâ€™t possible to turn off the seeing, it isnâ€™t possible to completely lose that impulse to frame and capture â€“ even if it diminishes from time to time. </p>\n<p>I do know this, however â€“ itâ€™ll have to be something that lets me make images in line with my creative and personal benchmarks first and foremost; <em>I</em> will always be the â€œclientâ€�. The curation thus remains simple and there is nothing to defend, apologize or make excuses for â€“ or be overly sensitive of an external opinion about.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50250998022_d7d799a361_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"564\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465620\" /></p>\n<p>I started off wanting to record my experiences. At around the same time, I acquired more than a passing interest in watches and cars; I got a â€˜realâ€™ job to pay for that and realized it wasnâ€™t at all what I wanted to do, even if I was quite successful at it. I didnâ€™t really become â€˜meâ€™ until I accepted that I would have to take some risks and do an unlikely combination of things to make the puzzle work; it came back to photography, and then watches. </p>\n<p>Even my watch collecting journey has gone in a circle from affordable to knowledgable and off the deep end to back to now producing accessible pieces <em>with</em> the benefit of knowledge obtained after coming back from the abyss â€“ it is somehow therefore fitting that the â€˜retirement cameraâ€™ is also the descendant of the one that resulted in my biggest previous creative shift, and a company Iâ€™d worked with previously. My fate indeed has a strong sense of deja vu about it â€“ but Iâ€™m okay with that, because it feels like I got a second chance. </p>\n<p>Some of you may be disappointed that this post doesnâ€™t contain a sort of retrospective â€˜best ofâ€™; Iâ€™d argue the opposite because itâ€™s instead a glimpse into whatâ€™s to come. Iâ€™ll leave a clue: itâ€™s really about photographing <em>light</em> first, transients second, and everything else as a supporting actor. Light and timing transcend the subject from what it is most of the time, into what it could be.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/50198311372_d5b31bb2df_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465621\" /></p>\n<p>Itâ€™s been an intense eight and a half years.

examples, techniques and tips to get you inspired for your own shoot. Firstly, letâ€™s answer; what is minimalist photography? </p>\n<p>Minimalist photography is a form of photography that is distinguished by extreme simplicity. It focuses solely on the smallest number of objects and it is normally composed in a clean, clinical way with very little differences in the colours and tones of the image.</p>\n<p>In the example below, we use long exposure photography to create a minimalist effect of a lighthouse out at sea. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/minimalist_1-800x398.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"398\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465994\" /></p>\n<p>Using long exposures in landscape photography is a great way to get that minimalist look. In this shot, itâ€™s allowed the waves of the water to blend together to create this smooth effect. This eliminates the texture and tones of the water which further enhances the minimalist effect. </p>\n<p>To view exactly how this shot was taken and the equipment used, check out the video up top.</p>\n<h2>More Examples of Minimalist Landscape Photography</h2>\n<p>In the landscape shot below, the minimalist effect has been created by a clever use of composition and by removing the color from the scene. The shotâ€™s main focus is the rock and the majority of the image is taken up by the sky. The shot can be broken up into just 3 parts. Going from the bottom you have the line of water, the triangle of the rock, then a sky with only a graduation of grey. </p>\n<p>The image has been broken down to the minimal of objects, colors and tones, thus given a perfect example of minimalist landscape photography. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465995\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465995\" style=\"width: 533px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/adrian-5fTfCvbJWWA-unsplash-533x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465995\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465995\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Faows.co%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Adrian</a>, CC0</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<p>Here is another example of a long exposure landscape. Again, this effect has smoothed out the water and the color scheme of the shot is harmonious using only blues and purples with an accent color of orange. There is a small focal point within one-third of the frame which helps give the image a bit of interest. </p>\n<p>A calming example of a minimalist landscape photo. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465997\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465997\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/3-800x450.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465997\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465997\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Camera Settings &#8211; f/16 &#8211; ISO 100 &#8211; 35mm Focal length &#8211; 120 second</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<p>Proving again that long exposures are a good tip for creating this effect, here with have a shot made up of very little shapes and tones. If you break it down, you have a triangle in the centre, flanked by the smooth toneless water and at the top of the image a rectangle of blank sky. </p>\n<p>As with the others, itâ€™s a shot showing very little color, tones and objects which is creating a lovely minimalist effect.  </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_465998\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465998\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/fabrice-villard-k87jn9fnYdY-unsplash-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"size-large wp-image-465998\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.enclosed.ch%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Fabrice Villard</a>, CC0<br /></figcaption></figure>\n<p>To learn a few of the basic techniques involved in capturing images like these, check out the video up top.

The first is a metadata-based system, and the second is a &#8220;Video Authenticator&#8221; that will analyze photos and videos and provide a &#8220;confidence score&#8221; that tells you whether or not the media has been altered by AI.</p>\n<p>The metadata system that Microsoft talks about sounds similar to <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2020/08/04/this-is-how-adobes-upcoming-photo-authenticity-system-will-work/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Adobe&#8217;s upcoming &#8220;Authenticity&#8221; system</a>: one program is used by the original creator to add certain tags to an image, and another checks those tags to tell you whether or not you&#8217;re looking at the original or a manipulated version. That seems pretty straight forward, and not terribly ground-breaking. </p>\n<p>What sounds far more interesting is the so-called &#8220;Microsoft Video Authenticator,&#8221; which is actually meant for both stills and video. According to Microsoft:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Video Authenticator can analyze a still photo or video to provide a percentage chance, or confidence score, that the media is artificially manipulated. In the case of a video, it can provide this percentage in real-time on each frame as the video plays. It works by detecting the blending boundary of the deepfake and subtle fading or greyscale elements that might not be detectable by the human eye.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can see the system in action, frame-by-frame, in the GIF below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/Disinf-GIF.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-465614\" /></p>\n<p>The tech was designed to fight <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDeepfake\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">deepfakes</a>: manipulated photos and videos that are created by deep-learning algorithms (hence: <em>deep</em> fake).

the much-rumored and heavily leaked <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fpcs5.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Lumix S5</a>: a compact, entry(ish)-level full-frame mirrorless camera that packs a lot of impressive video and stills features into a more compact and affordable L-mount body.</p>\n<p>A lot of the &#8220;core&#8221; features of the Panasonic S5 are similar to <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fpcs1.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">the more expensive S1</a>: it uses the same 24MP BSI CMOS sensor, can shoot 96MP photos in high-res multi-shot mode, and boasts 5-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS) with up to 6.5 stops of shake reduction when you use a compatible lens. </p>\n<p>The Lumix S5 just packs all of this into a more compact body that uses dual SD card slots (one UHS-II and one UHS-I) instead of SD and CFExpress, a lower resolution LCD screen (1.84M dots) and EVF (2.36M dots), and no top-mounted LCD screen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5_9-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465576\" /></p>\n<p>In terms of improvements, Panasonic has focused primarily on autofocus performance, low-light performance, and video features. </p>\n<p>The AF system has been re-vamped and updated with the latest deep-learning technology to improve speed and precision, and the company&#8217;s Depth from Defocus (DFD) system used for continuous AF has been improved as well (which hopefully means less &#8220;wobble&#8221; in video).</p>\n<p>In terms of low-light shooting, the Lumix S5 features Dual Native ISO for cleaner performance at high ISO when shooting either stills or video. In V-Log, your native ISOs are 640 and 4000, but you can crank the ISO up to a (probably unusable) 51,200, just like you can on the S1.</p>\n<p>Finally, when it comes to video features, the S5 has a lot on offer with even more to come via firmware update. At launch, you&#8217;ll be able to shoot 4K/60p video at up to 10-bit 4:2:0 with an APS-C crop, or 4K 30p/24p video at up to 10-bit 4:2:2 using the full sensor width. If you slap an external recorder on it, you can output 4K/60p 10-bit 4:2:2 footage over HDMI no problem. And yes, you can also output RAW video when using an Atomos Ninja V.</p>\n<p>In that sense, you can think of the Lumix S5 as a more balanced, lighter, and <em>much cheaper</em> little brother to the video-centric <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fpcs1h.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Panasonic S1H</a>&#8230; or maybe a full-frame GH5.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at the new camera:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465579\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5_1-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465570\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5_2-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465571\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5_4_edit-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465572\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5_5-800x470.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"470\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465573\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5_7_edit-800x458.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"458\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465574\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5_8-800x370.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"370\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465575\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5_10-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465577\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/s5_11-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-465578\" /></p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a quick hands-on from <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fpcs5.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Adorama</a> that covers the basics of what this camera can do and who will probably find it the most useful:</p>\n<p><div class=\"fluid-iframe\" style=\"max-width: 800px;\"><div class=\"fluid-iframe__inner\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/INQigcirBG8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></p>\n<p>The Panasonic Lumix S5 is available to pre-order starting today for <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fpcs5.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">$2,000 body-only</a>, or <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fpcs5k.html%3Fkbid%3D67085\" rel=\"norewrite follow external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">$2,300 in a kit</a> with the new 20-60mm f/3.5-5.6 lens.

\n<p>“Looking back at David’s photographs, I am filled with deep pride,” writes Dr. Jill Biden in the foreword. “He captured it all: the hours of work, the questions and negotiations, the emotions

It is alive, and its power will continue to transform our nation for the betterâ€¦These photographs invigorate me for the challenge ahead, and I hope they do the same for you.”</p> \n<p>We sat down with Lienemann, as he cradled his 16-month daughter Millie in their New Mexico home, to hear his story of the eight years he spent in the White House with the VP and what he wants Americans to see.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465502\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465502\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465502\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/P101515LJ-0097.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465502\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  David Lienemann (kneeling) photographs President Barack Obama delivering a statement on Afghanistan, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Oct. 15, 2015.

I reached out to my former boss <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&amp;key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FObama-Intimate-Portrait-Pete-Souza%2Fdp%2F0316512583%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fdchild%3D1%26keywords%3Dpete%2Bsouza%26qid%3D1598126543%26sr%3D8-2\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Pete Souza</a> who was the director of the Photo Office, who connected me with his agent David Black.

It’s obviously challenging to narrow down from hundreds of thousands of photos to just a couple of hundred images to try to tell the story of eight years. I really wanted to give readers a sense of who Joe Biden is. A family man, a man of faith, who always wanted to know how government policies would affect the working-class people in the neighborhood where he grew up. </p> \n<p>The book encompasses a wide variety of photographs, from the early days of the Obama Biden Administration to the first trip to Iraq as VP, where he swore in new US Citizens in a 4<sup>th</sup> of July Ceremony meeting with wounded warriors and grieving families who lost loved ones to gun violence. The highs and lows of the administration.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465493\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465493\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465493\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/20120907-124055.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465493\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks at a campaign event at the Strawbery Banke Museum in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Sept. 7, 2012.

There are just so many to choose from! But, in the book, my favorite image is of Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, the Vice President’s oldest son, and they’re standing backstage at the 2012 Democratic National Convention with Dr. Jill Biden waiting to go on stage. Amidst all the cheering and the music and thousands of people packed into an arena in Charlotte, Beau is quietly leaning over to straighten his father’s tie. There’s something really personal and kind about the moment.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465492\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465492\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465492\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/20120906-211259.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465492\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Vice President Joe Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, and Beau Biden hold backstage as Dr. Biden is introduced at the Democratic National Convention, at Time Warner Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, September 6, 2012.

Have any gone on the record?</strong></p> \n<p>I took a couple of photos on my iPhone for work, and they are in the Archives, yes. I didn’t actively use it to shoot with because the quality of the files didn’t really match up with the quality of DSLR files at the time.</p> \n<p><strong>Are you trying to be invisible while you are at important meetings?</strong></p> \n<p>Always! Which doesn’t mean I never tripped over something while moving around the room. I tried to use quiet cameras, avoided flash whenever possible, and just tried to blend in, to not distract or take away from what was going on.</p> \n<p><strong>How challenging is this job to work in the White House?</strong></p> \n<p>I talk about it a little bit in the introduction to the book. It’s a really unique job and an incredible opportunity as well. You alluded to this earlier, about trying to be invisible while you’re in the room taking photos. You want to be there to capture every moment because something that seems mundane one day might turn out to be an immensely meaningful moment later on. </p> \n<p>At the same time, the more photographs you take, the more there is to sift through, and unfortunately, you can only work so many hours in a day. It also can be a bit of a 24-7 job sometimes. I worked a lot of holidays and missed a lot of time with my family. I also met my now wife at an event with the Vice President.</p> \n<p><strong>How much did you travel with the VP?</strong></p> \n<p>Honestly, not sure on the mileage as they tracked his mileage, and I missed a few trips with him. [I] went on a couple of trips with Dr. [Jill] Biden, safe to say, over a million miles though. Forty-seven states and sixty-four countries, I had to go back and count them all up to make sure the numbers were correct.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465499\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465499\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465499\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/20160604-141859.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465499\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Vice President Joe Biden engages in a super soaker battle during the 2016 Biden Beach Boardwalk Bash held at the Naval Observatory Residence in Washington, D.C., June 4, 2016.

I’m not completely up to speed on how the National Archives handle records, but I think they become more public over time, but I think it’s still handled, to some extent, by request.</p> \n<p><strong>Do you shoot JPEG or RAW?</strong></p> \n<p>Actually, I shoot both. The first couple of years, cameras only had a single card slot. We archived the RAW files, and the JPEGs were just there in case something went wrong with the card since they were slightly easier to recover with file recovery software. In the later years, when cameras had dual slots, RAW files went on one card and JPEGs to a second card that just lived in the cameraâ€¦ again as sort of a redundancy in case of card failure.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465497\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465497\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465497\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/20160401-151525.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465497\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Vice President Joe Biden drives his restored 1967 Corvette with Jay Leno during a taping of “Jay Leno’s Garage” at the USSS training facility in Laurel, Maryland, April 1, 2016.

What was your software of choice?</strong></p> \n<p>Editing in the sense of choosing photographs, I used <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&amp;key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.camerabits.com%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">Photo Mechanic</a> to browse images and tag them.

Editing actual images, yes, in the traditional journalism sense of cropping, adjusting exposure, and trying to achieve an accurate color representation of a room. But not editing in the sense of adding or removing people from the room.</p> \n<p><strong>What is your deadline for delivery?</strong></p> \n<p>Depends, photos for social media, the <a href=\"http://apicdn.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&amp;key=dae5b94bb21a32cc7c141a041d18f05b&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2Fpetapixel.com%2Ffeed%2F&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"follow external noopener noreferrer\">White House Website</a>, or release to the media were prioritized and happened as quickly as was possible. Posed photos of folks from a photo line after an event, we tried to get out as quickly as possible, but the process wasn’t perfect.

(Official White House Photo by David Lienemann)\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p><strong>Would you ever drastically crop, like making a horizontal frame into a vertical photo?</strong></p> \n<p>Sure. We had something called Jumbos. They were large photos in the West Wing of the White House that were periodically changed out. I had one vertical jumbo frame at the end of the hallway, and sometimes I’d shot plenty of verticals and had no problems filling it, and sometimes we were scrambling to try to find something that would crop nicely from a horizontal.</p> \n<p><strong>Is it OK to crop out unimportant people from the frame?</strong></p> \n<p>I think I cropped more because I hadn’t shot the image the way I wanted, whether the camera was tilted slightly, or I hadn’t used a long enough lens, couldn’t get close enough to achieve the image I was trying to create to tell the story.</p> \n<p><strong>How do you win the trust of the important people you work within the White House?</strong></p> \n<p>That’s an interesting question I thought about when I was writing for the book, and I’ve talked to photo students about before. There’s obviously the background check side of working there where the government does a deep dive into your background to make sure you aren’t a spy. But building trust with the Vice President and Cabinet members takes time, being respectful and obviously not sharing things that are said behind closed doors or posting on social media.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465495\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465495\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465495\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/20130303-160029.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465495\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Vice President Joe Biden marches across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with Congresswoman Terri Sewell and Congressman John Lewis, during the 48th annual Bridge Crossing Ceremony in Selma, Alabama, March 3, 2013.

When I was in the West Wing or most of the time on the road, I had a 24-70 on one camera body, it just covers so much range for the kind of photos I was making given the access I had. My second camera sometimes had a 70-200, 35, or 85mm lens depending on what was happening. In rare occasions, I’d use something much longer or wider, but the bulk of my photographs were captured on a 24-70mm.</p> \n<p><strong>If you had to use only one lens on a foreign trip, which would it be?</strong></p> \n<p>Foreign travel at the White House? Probably that 24-70, 2.8. In most countries, they had arranged access with my counterpart, and so I wasn’t stuck on a riser 100 feet away. Foreign travel for me as a private citizen? I shoot an awful lot with a 35mm lens now, and then for that second lens, something in the super-telephoto range like a 100-400mm.</p> \n<p>Sorry for the delay. The baby came in to see what I was up to.</p> \n<p><strong>What is the baby’s name? How old?</strong></p> \n<p>Her name is Millie. She’s 16 months.</p> \n<p>Don’t ask how many photos I’ve taken of her, I have no idea, but I’m sure it’s a ridiculous number.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465491\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465491\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465491\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/20110701-135348.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465491\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Vice President Joe Biden talks with Nate Tamarin, Shailagh Murray, Fran Person, Mike Donilon and Matt Teper about his speech to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Convention, aboard Air Force Two, en route to Las Vegas, Nevada, July 1, 2011.

I also dabbled with Leica, Nikon, and in the last year of the administration, a Fuji X-Pro2, which I loved as a digital rangefinder, plus weight/size and silent shooting. Since the end of the administration, I’ve used both Fuji and Sony cameras.</p> \n<p><strong>Was the sound of the shutter on the Canon DSLR distracting to Joe?</strong></p> \n<p>I honestly don’t think he was. We used [Canon] 5D cameras, which are pretty quiet, and they are silent. If you’re trying to take photos during a TV interview, you want to be silent. If he’s consoling someone who lost their child or their parent or spouse, you want to not distract from that moment.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465496\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465496\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465496\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/20130727-140923.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465496\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Vice President Joe Biden talks with Commander Timothy Wilke, on board the Littoral Combat Ship U.S.S.

And I’d occasionally use it outside for photos if the lighting really required it. But I’m not much of a flash photographer. I’ve always tried to work with available light as much as possible.</p> \n<p><strong>If both Obama and Biden were present, then were both Pete [Souza] and you shooting simultaneously?</strong></p> \n<p>I’m not sure I understand the question.

How long did the session last? </strong></p> \n<p>From setup to teardown, probably 30 minutes? I’d been working on another idea with my colleague Chuck Kennedy, so we’d set up some lights and dialed in a concept a little bit. Then the VP asked if we could try a photo in front of his desk at the end of the day, so while he went to his last meeting of the day with President Obama, I set up a light with a large poster board sized bounce card. Chuck stood in for a couple of frames to make sure everything looked good, and we moved the computer, phone, etc. off the VP’s desk.</p> \n<p><strong>Did you photograph Biden at his residence as well as the White House?</strong></p> \n<p>Sure, he held meetings there occasionally, hosted foreign leaders for meals, the Bidens hosted receptions there, holiday parties.</p> \n<p><strong>How did you transition from Cornell College with a BA in Economics and Business in 2005 to photojournalism?</strong></p> \n<p>I studied economics and business at Cornell College, but realized in my junior year that I wasn’t sure that Excel spreadsheets and crunching numbers was how I wanted to spend my time after graduation. I’d always really liked photography. I’d been freelancing for the local weekly paper and had spent some time job shadowing at the Cedar Rapids<em> Gazette,</em> which covered eastern Iowa. I was really fortunate to get a string of newspaper internships after college, which gave me a tremendous amount of experience in photography. Going to college in Iowa also meant that I was exposed to a lot of politicians and political activity during the runup to the Iowa caucus.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465490\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465490\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465490\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/20110211-092726.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465490\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Vice President Joe Biden boards Air Force 2 at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland February 11, 2011.

I saw and was inspired by his ability to connect with Americans on the campaign trail as a “regular Joe.” He always took the time to talk to everyone in the room.</p> \n<p>So, when he was picked as the VP nominee, I started reaching out to everyone I knew in his office to see if I could join the campaign as his photographer. And when he got sworn in as Vice President, I moved to Washington and joined the photo office about six weeks later.</p> \n<p><strong>What was it like for a 24-year-old, when you started at the White House?</strong></p> \n<p>It was an incredible experience. I’d worked as a freelance photographer covering the campaign in 2007, so I covered then-Senator Biden and Senator Obama and of all the other candidates that were running in 2007-08. But as you alluded to, going from being a journalist to a 24-year-old White House photographer, traveling with the Vice President of the United States all over the country and all over the world. It was a really, incredible opportunity to get to serve in the Obama Biden administration.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_465503\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-465503\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-465503\" src=\"http://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2020/09/V110612DL-1118.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" />\n <figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-465503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama,Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden wave to the crowd as confetti rains down, following the Presidentâ€™s election night remarks at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois, Nov. 6, 2012.

That would end up being the longest stint for any photographer at the White House.</strong></p> \n<p>I’m not positive, but I believe my old boss Pete Souza worked for most of President Reagan’s two terms as well as all eight years of the Obama administration.</p> \n<p>That said, right now I’m focused on sharing with the American people who the Joe Biden I got to know during my eight years at the White House is, and trying my best to help him get elected… I don’t have any plans for January.</p> \n<p><strong>What do you shoot for fun?</strong></p> \n<p>I love taking photos of the outdoors, hiking, and camping.
