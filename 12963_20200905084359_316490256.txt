The 1960s were a great period for hazy yet brilliant time for artistic fluorescence. We see psychedelic design often used even today for commercial work. However, the psychedelic design concept seems to be losing its original history that most people are forgetting about.</p>\n<p>The history of psychedelic design is vast and widespread throughout the globe and time. It crossed thousands of borders and even dominated graphic arts for a decade between the 1960s and 1970s. You can say that the story of Psychedelic design goes back to 80 years ago. Let us have a look at the history of psychedelic design –</p>\n<p>There are some striking characteristics of psychedelic design and art: amazing subject matter, spiral patterns, bright colors, kaleidoscopic and extreme details with <a href=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/typography-ideas/\">groovy typography</a>. All of these elements are present in several art movements that precede the Psychedelic Design like Art Nouveau, Vienna Secession as well as Surrealism. There is no coincidence to this; these moments were highly influential when the psychedelic generation studied art.</p>\n<h2>1. Pyschelic Design and Art Nouveau:</h2>\n<h3>1. What is Art Nouveau?</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-64635 size-full\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-art-nouveau.jpg\" alt=\"Psychedelic Design - what is art nouveau\" width=\"1000\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-art-nouveau.jpg 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-art-nouveau-320x179.jpg 320w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-art-nouveau-917x514.jpg 917w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-art-nouveau-768x430.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>During the late 1800s, new technology in terms of electrical power, telephones, and cars revolutionized the way the world works and how it looks. Some people, especially artists, living through this technological revolution, were not necessarily fond of all these new developments. This led to a conflict that led to the emergence of a new global artistic movement referred to as Art Nouveau. Art Nouveau is a French term that literally means &#8220;new art.&#8221; The idea and inspiration behind this movement were to make art that would reflect city life&#8217;s vibrancy. To do so, they started using flat, decorative patterns, organic and plant motifs, and feminine figures. It would often be stylized with fluid abstract forms. The movement created a visual language that would then be used almost everywhere – from architecture to paintings, textiles, and many other fields.</p>\n<p>The ideology of Art Nouveau dictated that aesthetics and utility should go hand in hand. They also believed that no object was too mundane to be designed as beautiful. Even advertisements for something as basic as biscuits and champagne would be illustrated beautifully. The idea was to create advertisements as beautiful as possible while also making them informative.</p>\n<h3>2. Contrast and similarity of Art Nouveau and Psychedelic Design:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64636\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Contrast-and-similarity-of-Art-Nouveau-and-Psychedelic-Design.jpg\" alt=\"Contrast and similarity of Art Nouveau and Psychedelic Design\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1443\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Contrast-and-similarity-of-Art-Nouveau-and-Psychedelic-Design.jpg 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Contrast-and-similarity-of-Art-Nouveau-and-Psychedelic-Design-208x300.jpg 208w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Contrast-and-similarity-of-Art-Nouveau-and-Psychedelic-Design-710x1024.jpg 710w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Contrast-and-similarity-of-Art-Nouveau-and-Psychedelic-Design-768x1108.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>If we come back to the psychedelic era of the 1960s, it was also a time of cultural upheaval like the 1800s that inspired Art Nouveau. If we talk about the United States, the epicenter of this change was San Francisco. Hundreds and thousands of youngsters descended to San Francisco descended to the city for protests in forms of drum circles and concerts. There were many concerts back in the 1960s. Most of them would be dance concerts that would feature psychedelic bands like Jefferson Airplane and Grateful Dead. Also, there was one sure way of getting more people to come to your concert – creating a good poster. Back in the 1960s, these iconic bands were just starting out by playing back to back shows at important venues like the Avalon and Fillmore.</p>\n<p>Hence, to advertise this new generation of hippie bands, venues were quick to understand that plain typeface and using grayscale photos weren&#8217;t going to be enough. Hence, venues started commissioning work from small group artists. These small group artists came up with a brand new formula for their concert posters. It had influences from various art movements like surrealism, comics, and Art Nouveau.</p>\n<h3>3. What did Psychedelic Design pick up on from Art Nouveau?</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-64644 size-full\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-did-psychedelic-design-pick-up-1.jpg\" alt=\"Psychedelic Design - what did psychedelic design pick up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-did-psychedelic-design-pick-up-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-did-psychedelic-design-pick-up-1-320x180.jpg 320w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-did-psychedelic-design-pick-up-1-917x516.jpg 917w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-did-psychedelic-design-pick-up-1-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>When the Art Nouveau movement reached the mid-1960s, it started facing some resurgence. Especially in textiles, dynamic floral designs seemed to be a natural fit that suited the hippie aesthetic. Based on the art pieces of Art Nouveau, some modern-day artists of the 1960s took some of the Art Nouveau samples that resonated with them and turned the dial upon them. Art Nouveau gained popularity for its feminine figures, most often nude and flowing hair and other such characteristics.</p>\n<p>This was a style that resonated with the psychedelic designers, and they picked on it. Most of the psychedelic posters are designed in a way to be covered edge to edge with intrinsic detailed two-dimensional illustrations. You could see a lot of flowers and abstract curves in psychedelic design. Some of the psychedelic designers also used images pulled directly out of an Art Nouveau poster. However, they made radical changes to their <a href=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/color-pickers/\">color palette</a>. As the music of Sans Francisco spread across the world, so did their aesthetics. The artists behind such psychedelic designs got their share of fame. The posters they made with the vibrating colors and winding lines captured the energy of the 1960s.</p>\n<h3>4. Characteristics of Psychedelic Design:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64638\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/characteristics-of-psychedelic-design.jpg\" alt=\"characteristics of psychedelic design\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/characteristics-of-psychedelic-design.jpg 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/characteristics-of-psychedelic-design-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/characteristics-of-psychedelic-design-917x917.jpg 917w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/characteristics-of-psychedelic-design-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The color palette: </strong>Art Nouveau designers used soft pastels, whereas Psychedelic artists preferred high-contrast and intense colors. It was said that these colors could make the viewer&#8217;s eye &#8221;vibrate&#8221;, which is a term to define an LSD tripper&#8217;s visual experiences.</li>\n<li><strong>Typography: </strong>Psychedelic Design has the most abrupt and <a href=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/designers-guide-to-custom-typography/\">innovative use of typography</a> for its design. It makes use of fonts that are cloudy, curly, and barely legible. This concept of using such fonts started first on a 1902 poster designed by the Australian designer Alfred Roller. In the 60s, artists adapted this bold, dynamic typeface and pushed it to a new extreme. They would soften the lines and obscure its edges, which made it almost illegible. This design trend wanted the typography to be almost illegible on purpose. The purpose was to grab the audience&#8217;s attention long enough to figure out what the entire poster was trying to say.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>2. Op Art and Pop Art Movement&#8217;s Influence:</h2>\n<h3>1. Op Art:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-64639 size-full\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/op-art.jpg\" alt=\"Psychedelic Design - op art\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/op-art.jpg 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/op-art-320x213.jpg 320w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/op-art-917x612.jpg 917w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/op-art-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Op art is short for Optical Art. It is a style of abstraction that depends on geometric lines, shapes, and color juxtapositions that help create optical illusions for the viewers. This art movement also gained decent popularity during the 1960s. Such art usually featured grids, patterns, and effects like diminishing or curved objects. This movement was led by artists who were interested in understanding various perpetual effects.</p>\n<p>Pop was a term that was an earlier associate with popular culture, rather than art. The objective of Pop art was to blur boundaries between high and low popular cultures. It was one of the major artistic movements for the United States of the 20th century. The term was first tossed in Britain during 1955. However, the Americans took the consumerist cause with far superior conviction and effect. Hence they have deemed the pioneers of the movement. Pop art and pop culture talk about mass media products that were evolving during the late 1950s and 1960s. It was an attempt to break down the barrier between traditional and contemporary culture.</p>\n<h3>2. Pop art:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-64640 size-full\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pop-art.jpg\" alt=\"Psychedelic Design - pop art\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pop-art.jpg 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pop-art-320x226.jpg 320w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pop-art-917x648.jpg 917w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pop-art-768x543.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Pop art also highlighted some of the popular culture elements as a protest against elitist art culture and the general seriousness around it. This marked the return of sharp paintwork and representational art. This led to the glorification of underappreciated objects and ordinary businesses. This was done to make art more relevant and meaningful for everyday people and increase the target audience&#8217;s potential pool. Both these movements naturally went hand in hand with psychedelic design, adding more visual elements to it.</p>\n<p>Let us breakdown one of the most iconic psychedelic poster to better understand the psychedelic elements of this psychedelic design poster:</p>\n<h2>3. The Breakdown -The Man with Spiral Glasses:</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64642\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Man-with-Spiral-Glasses-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Man with Spiral Glasses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1114\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Man-with-Spiral-Glasses-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Man-with-Spiral-Glasses-1-269x300.jpg 269w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Man-with-Spiral-Glasses-1-917x1022.jpg 917w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Man-with-Spiral-Glasses-1-768x856.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Victor Moscoso designed this poster. If you notice the above poster, it has certain clear elements from op and pop movement and other design elements that we have discussed so far that are unique to psychedelic designs. This image has circles with spirals inside those circles as background. There is a border around the image which also has text inside it. It also features a man with a top hat and long hair. There is also text on the man&#8217;s chest and shoulders. Such a poster can be used to reflect a dance concert. Moscoso mostly wanted the man to have a perception that he is someone who loves having fun.</p>\n<p>He paired this fun-loving man with a bright background, which helps this poster stand out and appeal to the right target audience.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Whitespace: </strong>He also kept <a href=\"https://line25.com/inspiration/are-you-using-whitespace-in-your-website-designs\">whitespace between the circles</a> on the outside of the background and the borders. This could be to keep the theme of circle geometry and further enhance the design by using illusions created by the spiral circles.</li>\n<li><strong>Clustering:</strong> He has also used clustering to cluster the background, the man, and the text on the man in layers on top of each other and placed them in the center of the artwork. If you cluster these elements together, the poster seems busier when using a more overpowering image, true to true psychedelic design principles.</li>\n<li><strong>Overlapping:</strong> Another important design element used in this poster is overlapping. The man is at the front of the background, and the text is on top of the man. The eyes can be looked at as spiral glasses that are meant to align perfectly with the patterned circles used in the background. This creates a visual illusion effect. The text on the man&#8217;s chest has important information regarding the concert. Hence Moscoso made it clear to keep it on the topmost layer of all other layers.</li>\n<li><strong>Negative Space: </strong>If you notice, the space between circles of the background is filled with the same red color used in the circles. This is to make the image look busy and bright, enhancing the psychedelic design.</li>\n<li><strong>Tone: </strong>This poster also uses very bright and vibrant red and blue colors. This helps the poster stand out from other posters. It is one of the most prominent design aspects of a psychedelic design.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, Moscoso&#8217;s poster is a fantastic representation of what psychedelic visual design looks like. Especially the idea of creating an optical illusion through a background in more than one layer is a fantastic touch. It serves the purpose and looks enticing enough for anyone looking at the poster to want to do for a dance concert.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>This was the history and relevance of psychedelic design and everything it has to offer. Psychedelic design is generally considered an art style used by people who like being high on drugs and have a distorted sense of the world. This misconception is highly incorrect. It was a movement based on other important art movements like Art Nouveau, Surrealism, and others. It was for a cause and a form of protest against the industrial and technological age of the 1960s, to keep real art alive. You can incorporate psychedelic designs for your music posters, wall graffiti, and website design to make full use of the benefits of psychedelic design.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LearnWebdesign/~4/vlkrKOzYae0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 14:30:19 +0000","feedId":12963,"bgimg":"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-art-nouveau.jpg","linkMd5":"9edecdb86a4c6617632ed9fd4b4cbc29","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn14@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-43-23-951_f0f42fe99e359011.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":560,"sourceBytes":94003,"destBytes":68820,"author":"Harsh Raval","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-art-nouveau.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn14@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-43-23-951_f0f42fe99e359011.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Contrast-and-similarity-of-Art-Nouveau-and-Psychedelic-Design.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn31@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-43-39-107_468e2b1b69d68197.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-did-psychedelic-design-pick-up-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn10@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-43-27-099_5717d73ad8d41170.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/characteristics-of-psychedelic-design.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn68@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-43-26-844_26706697c37f7dd1.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/op-art.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn96@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-43-26-230_33ce266630c4e874.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pop-art.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn29@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-43-27-982_2bf38f220137a6f0.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Man-with-Spiral-Glasses-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn90@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-43-26-382_12c5ab3db829ddc4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-43-26-032_7ac685392b9dd41a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn14@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-43-26-895_45542a2dba173fee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=vlkrKOzYae0:JggqYXGNnJA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?d=TzevzKxY174":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-43-25-936_7ee2b9e424836896.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LearnWebdesign/~4/vlkrKOzYae0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn7@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-43-56-721_1cabc70a08c9fe3e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295403559},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:43:23","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:43:23","title":"3dcart eCommerce Platform – REVIEW","link":"https://www.webdesigndev.com/?p=64959","description":"<p>Today, we will be looking at <a href=\"https://www.3dcart.com/\">3dcart</a>, one of the longest-running eCommerce platforms in the industry. Since its launch in 2000, businesses of all sizes have powered their online stores with this software. It now comes bundled with dozens of essential or otherwise invaluable tools for building and optimizing a shopping site. Let’s look over some of the many features that 3dcart provides and see why it is such a popular and excellent solution.</p>\n<h2>Flexible Site Editor</h2>\n<p>Among the most important qualities an eCommerce platform can have is exceptional customization. 3dcart’s templates are not rigid, and their premade layouts are not “take it or leave it.” The site editor, refined over a span of twenty years, offers unprecedented freedom. Almost every single aspect can be toggled, moved, removed, or adjusted to match the vision of the store owner.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64960\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4.png 480w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4-320x240.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></p>\n<h2>Secure Hosting</h2>\n<p>High-level security is a must for online shopping. Every eCommerce transaction requires the exchange of sensitive data, which hackers are always targeting. To eliminate the threat of identity theft, every 3dcart plan comes with Level 1 PCI Compliant security. The software also provides security seals, which users can add to the site so visitors can know they are protected.</p>\n<p>Also included with each plan is top-of-the-line hosting, which goes beyond receiving their own tag-free domain name. The company guarantees 99.94% uptime, daily back-ups, and defenses against DDoS attacks.</p>\n<h2>Mobile Responsive Themes</h2>\n<p>Online shoppers are increasingly doing their browsing and buying on mobile devices. However, many online stores do not have a version of the site designed specifically for smartphones. This mistake makes navigation more difficult and inconvenient for people on the go.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64961\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2.jpg 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2-320x163.jpg 320w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2-917x467.jpg 917w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2-768x391.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>In recognition of this trend, all of 3dcart’s 100-plus themes come with responsive design. This feature automatically alters page layouts based on the configuration of the screen. Websites with responsive themes will look and function just as well on vertical-oriented phone screens as they do on more horizontal computer windows.</p>\n<h2>Real-Time Shipping and Tax Calculations</h2>\n<p>As people add items to their cart, the cost of shipping and taxes may increase accordingly. Some stores only account for these additional charges at the end of the checkout process. This deceptive practice is ideal for turning potential customers away right at the finish line. Recent <a href=\"https://www.3dcart.com/ecommerce-market-statistics.html\">eCommerce statistics</a> cite it as the most common reason for cart abandonment.</p>\n<p>With real-time shipping and tax calculations, two features available with every 3dcart plan, customers do not need to be surprised. With each change to the cart, the software automatically adjusts the final price. Shoppers can see the total cost of their current order just by clicking on the cart. One convenient measure can decimate the site’s cart abandonment rate.</p>\n<h2>Analytics Software</h2>\n<p>Google Analytics is a must-have for eCommerce users interested in building the best possible version of their store. The tool comes built into the 3dcart platform. People can use it to track customer behavior, conduct tests, and see the results of changes to their store. The program also shows rates for conversions, site traffic, cart abandonment, bouncing, product sales, navigation, and more. All this information can give store owners a better idea of how they can optimize their site.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64962\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"515\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image5.png 750w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image5-320x220.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></p>\n<h2>Omnichannel Connections</h2>\n<p>When an entrepreneur decides to <a href=\"https://www.3dcart.com/start-an-ecommerce-business.html\">start an eCommerce business</a>, they do not need to stick with just one point of sale (POS). 3dcart’s omnichannel software can connect multiple POS to the same inventory. Store owners have the freedom to set up shop at popular online marketplaces, such as Facebook, Amazon, and eBay. It can even connect to mobile POS and brick-and-mortar locations.</p>\n<p>The links between all these channels can save time and effort for store owners. For example, when an item’s stock increases with new supplies or decreases with sales, the actual inventory number automatically changes on every POS.</p>\n<h2>Payment Processors</h2>\n<p>Many eCommerce platforms offer a small selection of payment gateways. 3dcart does not limit itself to PayPal, Square, Stripe, and the like. Its list of compatible processors extends to over 100 options, blowing every other platform out of the water. The line-up includes gateways that only work in certain parts of the world.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64963\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"796\" height=\"561\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image3.png 796w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image3-320x226.png 320w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image3-768x541.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px\" /></p>\n<p>Store owners can accept many different credit card issuers and international currencies, potentially expanding their audience in the process. They can also look for smaller companies that take small percentages from each transaction than the bigger ones. The enormous selection is just one more way that 3dcart enables businesses to customize their shopping experience.</p>\n<h2>Automation Rules</h2>\n<p>3dcart customers can create automation rules — programs that perform specific actions on certain conditions. Of course, software can only do so much without human minds at the helm. With that said, this feature is tailored to accomplishing repetitive tasks that may otherwise consume a great deal of time. Good examples include completed order emails and inventory management. Store owners save time and effort on tedious activities, and they can expend their energy on more creative roles.</p>\n<h2>24/7 Customer Support Hotline</h2>\n<p>3dcart gives users multiple sources of customer support, including online forums and an in-depth Knowledgebase. Their live chat and phone line are notable for being available at any time of the day. On top of that, the schedule is not limited to Monday through Friday. Unlike many platforms, 3dcart users can reach an expert on weekends and even holidays. Any time a business owner encounters an error or has a question, someone at 3dcart can listen, guide, and resolve.</p>\n<h2>Pricing Plans</h2>\n<p>Among 3dcart’s most admirable qualities is their commitment to helping companies of any size find eCommerce success. The smallest businesses can start at the cheapest payment plan if they want. Even then, they would still have access to many of the most important features that online stores need to survive and thrive. Better still, 3dcart runs frequent campaigns that offer significant discounts to new users for months at a time.</p>\n<p>Outside of these campaigns, the costs for the five pricing tiers are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Startup Store: $19/mo for monthly plans, $17.10/mo for yearly plans</li>\n<li>Basic Store: $29/mo for monthly plans, $26.10/mo for yearly plans</li>\n<li>Plus Store: $79/mo for monthly plans, $76.10/mo for yearly plans</li>\n<li>Power Store: $129/mo for monthly plans, $116.10/mo for yearly plans</li>\n<li>Pro Store: $229/mo for monthly plans, $206.10/mo for yearly plans</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-65063\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pricing.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pricing.png 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pricing-320x118.png 320w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pricing-917x337.png 917w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pricing-768x283.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Naturally, the number of features and benefits a user receives ramps up with each ascending tier. Regardless, every plan offers unlimited products, categories, bandwidth, and orders. Not one requires transaction fees.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in 3dcart’s software, you can test it before making any choices. The company offers a 15-day <a href=\"https://www.3dcart.com/freetrial.htm\">free trial</a>, which people can use to check out all their features and create their own online store. They do not even ask for your credit card information. At the end of the run, you can decide for yourself if 3dcart is the ideal platform for your eCommerce business.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?a=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:TzevzKxY174\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?d=TzevzKxY174\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LearnWebdesign/~4/7MoM1Xaqk_s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:04:36 +0000","feedId":12963,"bgimg":"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4.png","linkMd5":"3a0d93bf0e3dbc4549a2e29fe4c62ed3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-43-24-674_1449a32f0241a821.webp","destWidth":480,"destHeight":360,"sourceBytes":38075,"destBytes":15634,"author":"Web Design","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-43-24-674_1449a32f0241a821.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn79@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-43-26-053_034a166634bcd675.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn35@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-43-26-691_e62736485beb1ce1.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn40@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-43-26-187_c5f9dbf040fb3c8f.webp","https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pricing.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn91@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-43-26-748_d00df62f4ecd3058.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-43-26-032_7ac685392b9dd41a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn22@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-43-26-921_a0ea922bcd879e15.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn76@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-43-25-835_b59cdc2d6b9d75b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?i=7MoM1Xaqk_s:2diWZO09aac:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn28@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-43-26-007_5f62da49e8af9419.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/LearnWebdesign?d=TzevzKxY174":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-43-25-936_7ee2b9e424836896.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LearnWebdesign/~4/7MoM1Xaqk_s":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn2@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-43-26-732_5e74e8cea6c30b12.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295403566},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:43:23","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:43:23","title":"15 Impressive Login Forms for Design Inspiration","link":"https://www.webdesigndev.com/?p=64968","description":"<p>Login forms have been around since the concept of the website came into existence. And it is a crucial section of any website. The human interaction with login pages has changed with time. Initially, we used to enter the email address or ID and password to log in to the system. Now, we have a Touch ID on the phone, face scan, and other ways to log in to the system. With the design point of view, the <a href=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/design-trends-you-should-not-be-using/\">login forms had very dull and flat-looking designs</a>. But nowadays, the designers have come up with impressive and out-of-the-box designs full of vibrant colors.</p>\n<p>This blog focuses on the impressive login forms that you can explore or draw inspiration from to create a designer login form, as a designer. Let us examine the websites that have some vibrant and stunning login forms at their disposal.</p>\n<h2>1. <a href=\"https://sweet.io/login\">Sweet:</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://sweet.io/login\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-64969\" src=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sweet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sweet.jpg 1000w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sweet-320x147.jpg 320w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sweet-917x422.jpg 917w, https://www.webdesigndev.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sweet-768x353.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sweet is a website that deals with influencers and artists. You can be either an <a href=\"https://www.webdesigndev.com/20-beautiful-portfolio-website-templates-artists/\">artist or an influencer if you are using the site</a>. The website has a color theme that looks similar to an ice cream candy. Moreover, the logo of the website also has an ice cream candy in its formation. The login form of this website is stunning, with the color theme of blue switching gradually towards different shades of purple.
