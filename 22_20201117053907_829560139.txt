stories</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>\n</ul><p>From K-Pop to K-Drama and even an Oscar win for Best Film, Korea is doing an impressive job in terms of global soft power. And there is one other area where Korea is beginning to emerge globally against its Asian peers: the startup scene. Alongside the likes of Singapore, Shenzhen, Jakarta, and others, Seoul has established itself as a key startup hub in the region, nurturing numerous tech unicorns along the way.&#160;</p><p>This is not too surprising when set against the country's global reputation for technological innovation, thanks to the likes of Samsung, Hyundai, LG, and more. Indeed, the international success of these more established Korean conglomerates is a major factor driving the growth of Korea's startup economy, according to Jimmy Kim, cofounder of Korean accelerator Spark Labs.</p><p>\"The reason Korea has been so successful is because the mindset has been that we have to go global,\" he says. \"If you are doing well in Japan or in China, going global is not a priority, whereas in Korea the only way you are going to survive in any company right now is that you have to look overseas, because the population is not enough alone to support a unicorn or decacorn valuation.\"</p><h2><strong>Helping Korean firms succeed overseas</strong></h2><p>Spark Labs was founded in 2012 by Kim and cofounders Bernard Moon and John Hanjoo Lee. All three came from a startup background – reflecting one of the company's mantras of 'founded by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs.' For Kim, this meant time spent as a founding investor in online gaming firm Studio Ex and as a co-founder of N3N, an IoT enterprise software company.</p><p>\"The key thing we found was that although Korean companies are very innovative and leaders in their field, startups have a hard time going abroad, seeking overseas markets,\" says Kim. \"The problem we found was that entrepreneurs in the early stage really have a hard time trying to scale up so Spark Labs was founded on this premise to help entrepreneurs go global.\"</p><p>Kim says the company looked at Y Combinator as its benchmark. \"There are three components to Y Combinator that we really liked. First of all, it was giving startups the cash that they need. Second was giving them mentorship and helping them reach the next milestone, to achieve follow-on funding. Thirdly was a demo day where people can showcase what they've done over the past three four months. Exposure was very important.\"</p><p>Spark Labs Global Accelerator Program has two batches a year, amounting to 20 companies a year, whittled down from an original 600 applicants. Kim and his fellow founders and company partners take a hands-on approach, steering the chosen startups through a 14-week process, ending in a Demo Day in front of potential new investors.</p><p>For Kim, the mentorship element during this process is crucial. \"We tell people that we can't show you how to succeed, but we can definitely tell you how to fail,\" he says. \"Mentorship is first of all being a soundboard. Helping entrepreneurs crystalize what that essence of the business is. Each company we attach them to on average five mentors who can give them insight. The whole essence of the mentorship is having someone to talk to and someone to bounce your ideas off.\"</p><p>Spark Labs has to-date completed 15 batches as part of the accelerator program. Kim says the company has invested in over 170 plus companies. Success for him though is linked less with immediate business success and more with raising additional funds, noting that 70% of companies going through the process received between $1 million and $2 million in follow-on funding after the demo day.</p><p>\"We're very happy with the fact that our companies have raised over $600 million in follow-on funding,\" he adds. \"The market cap of all the companies we have invested in is over $2 billion.\"&#160;</p><h2><strong>The will to go global</strong></h2><p>Kim says the company is not looking at specific startup categories when choosing entrepreneurs to back. \"A lot of people say are you e-commerce? Are you gaming? But we believe that the future is data, and when we look at companies we look if they are either generating data, accumulating data or analyzing data. Those are the lens we use right now, the pillars of Spark Labs.\"</p><p>In terms of companies with the potential to break global markets, Kim points to Spark Labs-funded beauty platform MBX (Memebox) who launched their Kaja brand in the US with Sephora.&#160; \"MBX is a Korean data-driven cosmetics company, they've raised about $190 million to date,\" says Kim.&#160; \"Kaja is going global right now. The whole thing of K-culture right now, K-Beauty is definitely a part of this. I think you'll see a stream of companies that will extend that boundary.\"&#160;</p><p>However, Kim sees the most transformational investment potential lying in B2B software and cloud services. \"COVID-19 has really brought the need for automation, not just factory automation but intra-company automation and solutions that make it easier to communicate and collaborate and contribute. It's not just about the big e-commerce B2C companies, the real investment is going to be in the software services space.\"</p><p>Ultimately though, Spark Labs are investing in people and in entrepreneurs.&#160; \"It's the will and desire and vision to go global,\" he says.</p><h2><strong>Government lending a hand</strong></h2><p>Spark Labs, of course, is not alone in supporting startup culture in Korea, and Kim points to the progress being made in the public sphere. \"The government is conscious [of the need to go global] and has been trying to support and spark entrepreneurship.\"</p><p>One example is TIPS (Accelerator Investment-Driven Tech Incubator Program for Startups). Startups under three years old can apply for the government program with selected companies eligible to receive up to more than $800,000 USD in funding, to be used as seed capital, research and development expenses or marketing fees. The program is benchmarked against a similar initiative in Israel.&#160;</p><p>\"Korea has realized that Series A funding is very high risk and they have to be able to provide a sandbox that allows people to fail. That's where I think Korea has been very aggressive and very successful.</p><p>Kim argues that this mix of VC and government funding combined with the growing entrepreneurial spirit in Korea is what is paying dividends. \"Korea is not as big as Japan or China or even Indonesia,\" he says. \"But because of that our export economy is strong and we are very fortunate to have companies like Samsung or LG or Hyundai. These companies, our precursors, were also startups a long time ago, so we have it in our DNA.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Their itinerary requires them to spend 27 hours inside the capsule, which they named named \"Resilience,\" before reaching the space station.</p><p>So on Monday, the crew took a few minutes to show the world their spaceship.</p><p>\"Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and welcome onboard Crew Dragon Resilience,\" Mission Commander Mike Hopkins says in the video, which NASA <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg\">streamed live</a>. \"Victor, Shannon, Soichi, and I are very pleased to welcome you on board as we journey to the International Space Station.\"&#160;</p><p>You can watch their video tour below.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TT6BC68UzeY?start=256\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2>'It's actually quite nice'</h2><p>The launch of Crew-1, as the mission is called, marked the beginning of one of SpaceX's most important flights yet: the company's first full-length crewed mission for NASA. It's the company's second time launching people into space, but the longest-duration human spaceflight ever launched from the US. The current record, 84 days, has held since the longest Skylab mission more than 45 years ago.</p><p>Once the Crew Dragon docks to the ISS on Monday night, the astronauts are expected to live and work on the orbiting laboratory for about half a year.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fac65cf98669500182b5866?format=jpeg\" alt=\"crew 1 kennedy\" height=\"604\" width=\"1041\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>NASA astronauts (from left) Shannon Walker, Victor Glover and Mike Hopkins, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Soichi Noguchi, right, speak to press at NASA&#39;s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, Sunday, November 8, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Hopkins began the video tour of the Crew Dragon by showing off its cockpit, where astronauts sit for launch and landing. He described the three touch display screens from which they can monitor and control the spacecraft.</p><p>\"We can bring up maps that show where we are over the Earth, and it's actually quite nice,\" he said.</p><p>Hopkins then passed the mic to Glover, the crew's rookie crew member. Glover, the mission's pilot, had logged more than 3,000 hours of flight experience on Earth but had never been to space before.&#160;With him in the video is the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-nasa-astronauts-launched-baby-yoda-doll-crew-dragon-spaceship-2020-11\">Baby Yoda stuffed toy</a> that the crew brought up to serve as an indicator that the spaceship had entered microgravity.</p><p>\"Hello everyone, Victor here,\" Glover said in the video. \"Baby Yoda and I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the hatches.\"</p><p>Floating near an entryway, he continued,&#160;\"just about 24 hours ago, we entered Resilience through this side hatch.\"</p><p>The crew won't open that hatch again until after they've safely splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean at the end of the mission. When they dock to the ISS, they will enter via the forward hatch at the top of the capsule.&#160;</p><p>During his turn with the mic, Noguchi described the capsule's storage area, and Walker then explained where the crew keeps emergency supplies and clothes. She also demonstrated how to drink from a water bottle in microgravity.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb30361402d49001924f480?format=jpeg\" alt=\"crew 1 baby yoda shannon walker crew dragon resilience tour astronauts orbit spacex nasa mike hopkins victor glover soichi noguchi jaxa\" height=\"1619\" width=\"2160\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Baby Yoda lurks over NASA astronaut Shannon Walker&#39;s shoulder as she gives a tour of the Resilience capsule, November 16, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA TV</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The tour culminated in a heartfelt moment as the team lined up for an in-flight ceremony. Once an astronaut completes two years of basic training, Hopkins explained, they get a silver pin – the sign of an \"unflown\" astronaut. But once they've traveled 100 kilometers above the Earth, the astronaut receives a golden pin.</p><p>\"We have one member of our crew who does not have the appropriate, uh, accoutrements for his uniform,\" he said,&#160; turning to Glover.</p><p>Hopkins then passed a gold pin to Glover, who held it up to the camera.</p><p>\"Congratulations,\" he said, as Noguchi and Glover fist-bumped.&#160;</p><p>\"All for one, Crew-1 for all,\" the team said before signing off.</p><p><em>Morgan McFall-Johnsen contributed reporting.&#160;</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the

The matching JamTees, which are what the brand calls the matching tops, have a touch of stretch, too, so you don't feel constricted while you snooze.</p><p>It's the details that make Jambys so great. The tee has a small, two-inch slit on both side seams, so you can sit without the shirt feeling constricting. And the shorts are swingy and breathable, so they won't get tangled between your legs.&#160;</p><p>Sleeping in Jambys is a totally comfortable experience. I was shocked by how soft they were. And as someone who not only sleeps warm but sleeps <em>next&#160;</em>to a warm snoozer, I tend to overheat in the night. In Jambys, I woke up feeling well-rested and cool.

She says:</p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><section class=\"blockquote-wrapper\">These are the most comfortable pajamas I've ever worn, point blank. The ultrasoft material is pretty thin, which is especially great people like me who overheat easily at night. And while \"stretchy\" probably isn't the first word you're looking for in a review of snuggly, soft, comfy pajamas, I find that the stretchier the waistband and material are, the cozier the jammies. That's because stretchy pairs like this move with you as you sleep, never feeling restrictive or pulling against your sheets while you're tossing and turning.

I used to think spending money on a pajama set (let alone one that costs over $100) when I have a closet full of old T-shirts and sweats was silly, but Eberjey has converted me.</p><p>Eberjey's pajamas make bedtime feel special. Not only are they super-soft, stretchy, and lightweight, but they drape over your body in a way that's equal parts flattering and comfortable. I know that a chic fit isn't what most of us look for in pajamas, but it sure doesn't hurt. You can go for a simple monochromatic look or a fun pattern,&#160;Eberjey has it all.&#160;</p><p>Truly, the best thing about these pajamas is the fabric. It's part modal and part spandex, so you get a bit of stretch and a whole lot of lightweight, swingy, softness. I've washed these many times and they still always come out feeling good as new.&#160;</p><p>I find the shorts and long sleeve top to be a great combination, but Eberjey has plenty of options for whatever you need. You can find long sleeve tops, short sleeve tops, long pants, and shorts &#8212; Eberjey has multiple combinations to choose from.

An infectious disease doctor, a cleaning expert, and hotel reps all share what you should know before you check-in</a>.</li></ul><p>Winter is right around the corner and snow is already falling on mountains across the country. Although ski season hasn't been canceled this year, things are going to look different than they have in the past as resorts work to create a safe environment for all their guests amidst the ongoing pandemic.</p><p>Redesigned lift lines will spread out across the snow to allow for social distancing and drinking a beer with those in your travel pod by an outdoor firepit will replace standing boot to boot in packed après ski bars. Many mountains will also require advance reservations. And if you've never been one to wear a balaclava, well, this is your year.</p><p>Still, getting into the mountains can be an appealing pandemic-friendly activity. Aside from the joy delivered by schussing down a snowy trail, ski resorts — and the hotels that serve them — offer an abundance of cold-weather outdoor adventures beyond the slopes from cross-country skiing and snowshoeing to dog sledding.&#160;</p><p>Before planning a snowy getaway, it's important to keep in mind that the pandemic continues to sweep across the US and that many states are experiencing serious spikes in cases right now. If you're wondering if it's<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-travel-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> safe to travel at all</a>, we talked to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-hotels-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">experts about the risks, as well as the best precautions to take</a>. Additionally, each hotel on this list is committed to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hotel-precautions-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rigorous new cleaning protocols</a> in an effort to mitigate the risks associated with contracting COVID-19. We outlined these measures below.</p><p>It's also vital to note that there is never a guarantee of safety when it comes to travel right now, even if you plan to spend much of your time outdoors. We recommend following CDC guidelines, and always advise travelers to wear a mask, wash hands frequently, and maintain social distancing. Additionally, consider your own level of risk, and whether you're traveling from or to a hotspot, so as not to increase the rate of infection.</p><p>You should also research individual state's travel restrictions before you book. Since the situation is constantly evolving, it's wise to read up on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-hotel-airbnb-cancellation-change-policies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hotel cancellation policies</a> in case your plans may need to change.

Right in the heart of Teton Village just steps from the mountain, the boutique Hotel Terra is Wyoming's first LEED Silver-certified property and features cowboy-chic decor with a sleek, eco-friendly twist. Guestrooms have heated floors, organic mattresses and linens, aluminum bath dispensers, and energy-efficient lighting.</p><p>Hotel Terra's 132 stylish guestrooms range from traditional rooms and studio-style abodes to spacious two and three-bedroom suites. All rooms have sweeping valley and mountain views, jetted tubs, and rain showers and many also feature full kitchens, gas fireplaces, and private terraces. Furnishings are sleek and contemporary with deep woods and inviting seating.</p><p>Grab your gear from the on-site ski valet and hit the slopes. Jackson Hole sees almost 500-inches of champagne powder every year and conditions border on sublime. Hop on the mountain's Aerial Tram (or, as locals call it \"the red heli,\" \"the box,\" or \"big red\") to Rendezvous Peak. Look down as you near the summit for a bird's-eye view of Corbet's Couloir, one of the toughest runs out there. From the tram, dip into Rendezvous Bowl, a massive, open field that spills into the smaller Cheyenne Bowl below.</p><p>Reward a day on the mountain with one of the many nature-inspired treatments offered at the rooftop Chill Spa where the signature Herbal Poultice Massage uses a steamed infusion of ginger, turmeric, and lemongrass works tired bodies into a puddle of bliss. Afterward, have a glass of wine and snack on small plate goodies at the hip Bar Enoteca.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60562-d775368-Reviews-Hotel_Terra_Jackson_Hole_A_Noble_House_Resort-Teton_Village_Jackson_Hole_Wyoming.html?from_tpa=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Trip Advisor</a> Rating:</strong> 3 out of 8 hotels in Teton Village</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6776&#38;awinaffid=257137&#38;clickref=&#38;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fhotel%2Fus%2Fterra-jackson-hole.en-gb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Booking.com</a> Rating:</strong> 8.4 out of 10</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Hotel Terra truly walks the walk when it comes to sustainability and it's easy to feel good about participating in its green initiatives.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Jackson Hole's epic conditions and terrain are no secret and the mountain gets crowded on powder days.

With 3,460 feet of vertical, Whiteface boasts the steepest drop this side of the Rockies. Expert skiers will love The Slides, a series of narrow, double black diamond chutes that plunge into the wilderness. But you don't have to be an Olympian to enjoy the rest of the mountain's terrain and there are plenty of blue square trails to enjoy too. Don't miss the 2.1-mile Wilmington Trail, which treats skiers and riders to the longest intermediate run in the northeast and gorgeous views of the surrounding Adirondack Mountains.</p><p>Back at the Lodge, guests will delight in architectural details reminiscent of the Great Camps of a bygone era thanks to warm paneling covering the walls, rustic handcrafted furniture, and huge fieldstone fireplaces that invite lingering. Guest accommodations include five Main Lodge rooms, 17 shoreline cabins, six stunning Lakeside Building suites, and two private cottages. Every room has its own unique, Adirondack charm and features plush bedding, a wood-burning fireplace, and gorgeous views of the lake and snowy woodlands through diamond-pane windows.</p><p>The landscape surrounding the Lodge is truly a winter wonderland with trails for snowshoeing and Nordic skiing right outside the door and a host of activities nearby, including dogsledding, ice skating, and toboggan rides on Mirror Lake. In the evenings, hot chocolate and s'mores are served at lakeside snow bonfires, and games of checkers are played by the fire at Maggie's Pub alongside pints of local brews.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g48023-d121715-Reviews-Lake_Placid_Lodge-Lake_Placid_New_York.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>Trip Advisor</strong></a> <strong>Ranking: </strong>6 of 33 hotels in Lake Placid</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The Lake Placid Lodge has some of the most uniquely appointed rooms I've ever seen and the entire Lodge feels like a handcrafted piece of Adirondack art.

Most experts had hoped for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-interpreting-phase-3-coronavirus-vaccine-results-2020-9\">70% efficacy or higher</a>.</p><p>Not all vaccines are equally effective. Some, like the seasonal flu vaccine, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectiveness-studies.htm\">hover below 60%</a>. Others, like the polio vaccine, are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/effectiveness-duration-protection.html\">almost 100% effective</a>.</p><p>Here's how Moderna and Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine candidates compare to four existing vaccines.</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><iframe title=\"How Moderna and Pfizer coronavirus vaccines compare to vaccines for other viruses\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-1WDMo\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1WDMo/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% ; border: none;\" height=\"511\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();</script></div><p>&#160;</p><h2>How experts measure vaccine effectiveness&#160;</h2><p>The polio vaccine has been distributed for 65 years — plenty of time for scientists to build a thorough understanding of its effectiveness. That's a measure of how much it reduces the incidence of cases among people who get vaccinated relative to those who do not.&#160;</p><p>The greater that reduction, the higher the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html\">vaccine's effectiveness</a>.</p><p>Because Moderna and Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine candidates have only been tested in clinical trials however, their reports center on a measure known as vaccine efficacy. It's a calculation of how effective the vaccine could be given ideal circumstances in which everyone is given the shot.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb1d6641c741f0019ac9e48?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Moderna vaccine\" height=\"683\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A nurse prepares a coronavirus vaccine shot developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., July 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hans Pennink/AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Moderna's announcement was based on 95 cases of COVID-19 observed among the 30,000 participants in its phase 3 clinical trial. Among that larger group, some people were given the company's experimental vaccine while others just got a placebo injection.</p><p>Out of those 95 cases, 90 of them were people who'd gotten a placebo shot. Just five people who got COVID-19 had received Moderna's vaccine. The results showed that the vaccine not only prevented mild COVID-19 among participants, it also also appeared to prevent serious illness too. Researchers found 11 cases of severe COVID-19 among the placebo group and zero among those who got the vaccine.</p><p>Pfizer's vaccine, meanwhile was also found to prevent mild illness, but the company didn't reveal whether its shot prevented serious coronavirus infections, too.</p><p>It's also still unclear whether either vaccine <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/unanswered-questions-about-pfizers-coronavirus-vaccine-what-we-dont-know-2020-11\">prevents asymptomatic coronavirus infections</a>, because trial participants were only tested for COVID-19 if they experienced symptoms.</p><h2>A 2-dose regimen</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f552d7fe6ff30001d4e7564?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Moderna coronavirus vaccine trial participant\" height=\"3693\" width=\"4924\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nurse Kath Olmstead, right, gives volunteer Melissa Harting an injection of Moderna&#39;s experimental coronavirus vaccine, July 27, 2020, in Binghamton, New York.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hans Pennink/AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Both Moderna and Pfizer's vaccines require two shots. Moderna's two doses are administered <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-requires-2-shots-month-apart-2020-11\">a month apart</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-2-shots-2020-11\">Pfizer's</a> are given three weeks apart.&#160;</p><p>Many other vaccines — including the one that protects against measles — also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-compares-other-vaccines-2020-11\">require back-to-back doses to be most effective</a>. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are 97% effective at protecting someone from measles, whereas a single dose is 93% effective.</p><p>Other coronavirus vaccine candidates still in trials may require two shots as well, including AstraZeneca's; the company's phase 3 trial is testing <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/phase-3-clinical-testing-us-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-begins\">two shots given four weeks apart</a>. Johnson &#38; Johnson, meanwhile, is testing both <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/health/johnson--johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-begins/index.html\">a single-dose</a> and a two-dose vaccine in simultaneous <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-initiates-second-global-phase-3-clinical-trial-of-its-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate\">phase 3 trials</a>.</p><h2>Why the coronavirus vaccine will likely be more effective than a flu shot</h2><p>Viruses mutate over time: As they replicate, minute errors are introduced into the virus' genetic code, and those can then spread through a virus' population. While most mutations are inconsequential, occasionally one can appear that undermines people's immunity. But the new coronavirus mutates slowly, which means a vaccine would most likely be effective long-term against any existing viral strains.</p><p>The flu, by contrast, mutates quickly, which is why a new vaccine is needed each year.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89e783d260780019341ea0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"how does the flu shot work\" height=\"1414\" width=\"2121\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A doctor gives a flu shot.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Marko Geber/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Both Pfizer and Moderna <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-works-to-prevent-covid-19-company-says-2020-11\">plan to request emergency approval</a> for their coronavirus vaccines from the FDA in the new few weeks.</p><p>But neither company's clinical trial is complete yet, and neither <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-pfizer-vaccine-will-not-save-the-holidays-experts-2020-11\">has published their data</a> or submitted findings to a peer-reviewed medical journal or regulators. So <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-first-effective-coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-2020-11\">many questions remain</a>.</p><p>Still, according to Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel, the company plans to produce <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-ceo-coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-when-will-i-get-a-shot-2020-11\">100 million doses</a> — enough to vaccinate 50 million people — by the end of March 2021. Pfizer has said the bulk of its doses — up to 1.3 billion — will be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/timeline-of-when-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-available-2020-11\">ready sometime in

We break down the most important of those potential issues below:</p> \n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n  1. The coronavirus pandemic has hurt Airbnb, and could continue to hurt the company. \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f46d7becd2fec00296a46c4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Airbnb Open Homes  Photo\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption>\n    A member of the Airbnb Open Homes program. \n    <p class=\"copyright\">Airbnb</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <p>With millions of people around the world staying home throughout 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic spread from country to country, Airbnb rentals dropped off a cliff.</p>\n <p>The company took drastic measures to stem the bleeding: It cut its full-time workforce by a quarter (about 1,800 employees), cut marketing spend, and reduced costs overall.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>\"The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have materially adversely impacted and will continue to materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition,\" the company said in the first of many risk factors listed in the S-1.</p> 2. Revenue growth is slowing, and the company expects it to continue to slow going forward. \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e6fcfcbc485400f446d4847?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Brian Chesky, CEO and Co-founder of Airbnb, speaks to the Economic Club of New York at a luncheon at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S. March 13, 2017.\" height=\"2110\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption>\n    Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky in 2017. \n    <p class=\"copyright\">Mike Segar/Reuters</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <p>Airbnb enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity, and it's unlikely to return to those levels of growth anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>\"We have experienced significant revenue growth in the past,\" the company said. \"However, our revenue growth has slowed in recent periods and there is no assurance that historic growth rates will return.\"</p>\n <p>For the last three years, revenue growth has declined steadily, and it fell sharply in the first nine months of 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>&nbsp;</p> 3. Laws and regulations regarding temporary home rental vary from region to region, and are always in flux, and that could hurt Airbnb's business. \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/53d81dfb6da811ff6da608a2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Airbnb Stickers Protest\" height=\"1520\" width=\"2688\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption>\n    Stickers on a building protesting Airbnb rentals. \n    <p class=\"copyright\">Joey Cosco/Business Insider</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <p>Like Uber and other app-based startups that have exploded in popularity across the last decade, Airbnb has tangled with legislators and locals over how it does business.</p>\n <p>\"Since we began our operations in 2008, there have been and continue to be legal and regulatory developments that affect the short-term rental and home sharing business,\" the filing says. \"While we seek to work with governments, we have in the past, and are likely in the future to, become involved in disputes with government agencies regarding such laws and regulations.\"</p>\n <p>In some cases, like New York City, Airbnb says those regulations could result in a loss of revenue. In many cases, though, the laws simply do not exist yet to regulate short-term home rentals, and that means unknown risks.</p> 4. Airbnb is deeply in debt, to the tune of nearly $2 billion. \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5dc32d653afd372ad02f57a3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Brian Chesky Airbnb\" height=\"1961\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <p class=\"copyright\">Eric Risberg/AP</p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <p>With a revenue of $2.52 billion and a net loss of $696.9 million for the first nine months of 2020, Airbnb isn't exactly stacking up a war chest. In fact, it's got just shy of $2 billion of principal on debts, and it's not totally certain it'll be able to pay interest and principal in the future.</p>\n <p>\"If we experience a decline in cash flow due to any of the factors described in these 'Risk Factors' or otherwise, we could have difficulty paying interest and the principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness,\" the filing says. \"If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments under our Credit Agreements, or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness, we could default under our Credit Agreements.\"</p> 5. The company has never earned a profit, and it lost more money during the first 9 months of the pandemic than it did in each of the previous 3 years. \n <figure> \n  <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3eaeba42f43f001ddfe11a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Airbnb Logo+ Stocks\" height=\"683\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-photo-illustration-an-airbnb-logo-seen-displayed-on-news-photo/1207431290?adppopup=true\" target=\"_blank\">Filip Radwanski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</a></p> \n   </figcaption> </img>\n </figure> \n <p>For Airbnb, the focus has always been on user acquisition and growth.

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>President Donald Trump last week consulted top advisors on potential options for a military strike on Iran's main nuclear site, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur=cur\">The New York Times</a> reported on Monday.</p><p>Senior advisors ultimately discouraged Trump from pursuing the strike, arguing that such a move could spiral into a larger conflict with a short time remaining in the president's tenure, four current and former officials told The Times. Though Trump has refused to accept the results and concede, President-elect Joe Biden defeated him in the 2020 election.</p><p>Among those who persuaded Trump against moving forward with the strike were Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark A. Milley.</p><p>\"Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed,\" Nader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver, told Insider. \"A military strike on Iran would deeply destabilize an already unstable Middle East, with ripple effects across the region, especially in Iraq and Lebanon.\"</p><p>Furthermore, \"Iran is far away from having enough enriched uranium to build a bomb,\" Hashemi said. \"There is no imminent threat that would warrant a military strike.\"</p><p>The White House did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.</p><p>The reported Oval Office meeting took place just days after Trump <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-has-terminated-his-secretary-of-defense-after-losing-election-2020-11\">fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper</a>, and a day after international inspectors reported a major increase in Iran's uranium stockpile.</p><p>Iran's low-grade uranium stockpile is now <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-54912402\">more than 12 times the limit</a> set under <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/iran-nuclear-deal-explained\">the 2015 nuclear deal</a>, which Trump controversially withdrew the US from in May 2018.</p><p>Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Obama-era nuclear accord rapidly raised tensions between Washington and Tehran, catalyzing a series of skirmishes in the Persian Gulf. The contentious dynamic was exacerbated in early 2020 after Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, while he was in Iraq.</p><p>The Soleimani strike pushed the US and Iran to the ,brink of war. Iran retaliated with a missile attack on US forces in Iraq that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-tbi-exclusive/more-than-100-u-s-troops-diagnosed-with-brain-injuries-from-iran-attack-idUSKBN2041ZK\">left dozens with serious injuries. </a>The US and Iran avoided a broader conflict in the aftermath of the Soleimani strike, but tensions remained high. The strike also led Iran to effectively abandon the 2015 nuclear deal altogether.</p><p>\"The only reason Iran didn't want to escalate beyond symbolic attacks at the time was precisely because it feared the US would escalate even further by striking inside the country,\" Hassan Hassan, program director of non-state actors and geopolitics at the Center for Global Policy, told Insider. \"If the US strikes inside Iran, and against nuclear facilities, then the gloves are off.\"</p><p><em>This story is breaking.

While graduate degrees can provide chances to pivot to new careers, they also can take a few years to complete and charge high tuition, depending on the school and program.</p><p>While not the same as a master's degree, graduate certificates can sometimes be a more affordable option that requires less of a time commitment. Depending on the intended profession, they can help you learn new skills to transition into a different field — with official certification to show employers on LinkedIn or your resume — and some even have built-in portfolio assignments so you can exit the course with new samples of your work.</p><p>On some occasions, graduate certificates can double as college credits towards a related master's degree, since you technically completed graduate coursework. However, certificate credits are not automatically accepted by all schools — it varies on the university and program.</p><h3><strong>Here's everything you need to know about graduate certificates, how they compare to master's degrees, and some of the most popular graduate degree programs:</strong></h3><h2><strong>What's the difference between a graduate certificate and a degree?</strong></h2><p>Unlike finishing a full master's degree program, certificate program students take a few master's courses around a subject — like <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fmastertrack%2Fsustainability-development-umichnt-umich\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Sustainability and Development</a> or <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fmicromasters%2Fuc-san-diegox-data-science-science\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Data Science</a> — and receive a certificate of completion upon passing the program.&#160;</p><p>Because certificates involve taking fewer classes (and don't usually have an admissions process), they're not considered the same as having a master's degree or PhD. However, they can help you stand out to prospective employers, especially if you're looking to transition into a different field and want to demonstrate that you learned the required skills.&#160;</p><h2><strong>How do I apply to a graduate certificate program?</strong></h2><p>Most certificate programs, such as the ones offered through <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/edx-affordable-online-micro-masters-programs-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">edX's MicroMasters</a>, don't require a formal application process. If the course requires prerequisite knowledge, that information will usually be in the course description.</p><p>That being said, graduate certificate programs, such as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coursera-mastertrack-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coursera's MasterTracks</a>, can cap off after a certain number of applicants, so it's good to bookmark the enrollment date and sign up as soon as you can.</p><h2><strong>How much do they cost?</strong></h2><p>Graduate certificate programs can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000, depending on the school, program, and length. The price of a graduate certificate can be a fraction of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-college-tuition#annual-average-tuition-at-public-4-year-colleges-and-universities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the cost of traditional college degrees</a> (including online ones).</p><h2><strong>How long do certificate programs typically take?</strong></h2><p>Graduate certificate programs vary in length. Some, like <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fmicromasters%2Fmitx-supply-chain-managementnagement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">MIT's Supply Chain Management MicroMasters</a>, can take a little over a year. Others, like the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fmastertrack%2Fux-design-minnesotainnesota\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">University of Minnesota's UX Design MasterTrack</a>, only take four months to complete.</p><h2><strong>Can I pick some of the classes in the certificate?</strong></h2><p>Usually, no. Coursera and edX's graduate certificate offerings pick the classes for you and you have to pass all of them to get the certification.</p><p>There are exceptions, though. <a href=\"https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/graduate-certificates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard's extension school</a>, for instance, lets you choose a few electives as part of your certificate.&#160;</p><h2><strong>How does grading work?</strong></h2><p>While graduate degree programs operate via GPAs, graduate certificates are often Pass/Fail. Coursera, for example, gives you a percentage grade on each assignment and then a final combined score.&#160;</p><p>Depending on the program and size of your class, your written feedback on assignments might also be shorter and more brief than it would be in a graduate degree program.</p><h2><strong>What if I want to get a master's degree after finishing a certificate program?</strong></h2><p>Specific programs in the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fmicromastersomasters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">edX MicroMasters</a> and <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fmastertracktertrack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Coursera MasterTrack</a> series have different guidelines regarding college credits. Some might only accept the certificate classes as college credits if you pursue a degree in the same school and program you completed the certificate in; others provide a list of schools that will take the credits.</p><p>One upside to completing a certificate before continuing a degree in the same field is that the certificate credits are typically cheaper and can save you some money down the line.</p><h2><strong>Can I get financial aid for a certificate program?</strong></h2><p>It depends. Coursera MasterTracks don't currently offer financial assistance. And while <a href=\"https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/articles/215167877-What-courses-offer-financial-assistance-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">edX lets you apply for financial aid</a> for most of its programs, for MicroMasters, you'll have to audit each course first and apply for financial aid every time.&#160;</p><h2>Bottom line:</h2><p>If you're looking to save time and money, graduate certificates can be a great alternative to graduate degrees, especially if you're just looking to pick up some new skills, such as accounting or coding. Online certificate programs can also offer some flexibility in terms of scheduling and can help you decide if you want to pursue a full degree later. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coursera-mastertrack-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here's a review of one of Coursera's MasterTrack programs</a>.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5fb2e6731b1c030846245a9b\" style=\"position:relative;

the video.</em></p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, more and more cities are escalating their tactics to keep the virus at bay, asking people to socially distance, and, in some cases, to shelter in place. But some are not so lucky to have the ability to work from home. Dr. Eric Cioe-Pena, an emergency physician and the director of global health for Northwell Health, gave us some tips for staying safe at work.</p><p><strong>Eric Cioe-Pena:</strong> The No. 1 thing to do is wash your hands. Either 20 seconds with soap and water or with a hand sanitizer that's greater than 60% alcohol, because the main mode of transmission is gonna be touching surfaces that someone has coughed or sneezed on and then touching your face. So, that's your first line of defense, is handwashing.</p><p>So, comparing hand sanitizer to soap and water, if you have the ability to use soap and water, that's your best bet. So, hand sanitizer is a quick way to disinfect your hands in between soap-and-water washes, but soap and water really does have a greater efficacy in washing away droplets, washing away viral particles, and removing any soil or contaminants on your hands where virus could be hidden underneath. Hand sanitizer essentially is a superficial clean, so if you've got no dirt and no grime on your hands and you use hand sanitizer, it is effective at killing most things that are on your hands, but anytime you have any type of dirt or anything else where something could be hiding underneath that layer of dirt, hand sanitizer isn't gonna get it, but water and soap will. I also recommend, at the beginning of the day, wiping down areas that you're gonna touch often in your work area. So, keyboards, phones, mouse I would disinfect with any household or business disinfectant would work.</p><p>One of the other ways to catch the virus is to be in close contact with other people. Being next to another human being for greater than two minutes within six feet who is sick and showing symptoms definitely is a risk. The idea right now is you wanna practice some social distancing between people so that if someone is sick, we're not within six feet of them as much as possible. The other thing is avoiding gatherings of, you know, greater than five people that aren't absolutely essential to business is probably a good temporary measure at this point.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> But social distancing is not always feasible, especially when your work involves person-to-person contact.</p><p><strong>Cioe-Pena:</strong> So, the service industry is a tough area. They're especially tough because they also don't have any sick time off, and if they don't work they're not making money, so that's something that society, in general, we have to take a look at, because they really do have kind of a financial imperative to work even while sick. So, the worst thing someone in the service industry could do is work while sick. But the things that they can do to protect themselves: disinfect their hands, make sure that every time they're touching someone else's credit card, touching a check, touching something that another human being has touched in the course of their job, that before they do anything like, certainly, eat or touch their face, that they're disinfecting with soap and water or hand sanitizer.</p><p>The handshake is a tough thing 'cause it's really ingrained in our culture, right. I mean, you know, even now when I'm meeting people, part of me is, like, resisting the urge to extend my hand out and shake people's hands. So I think having something that's a gesture, the elbow is certainly, I think, the safer thing than the fist bump, just having that momentary contact with an area that's not gonna go anywhere near your face. You know, even just kind of a slight nod or a bow oftentimes will get kind of the job done.</p><p>We need to keep calm. We have to kind of take this with the appropriate level of seriousness, protect the people that are at risk of having worse outcomes, but the rest of us need to just kind of take the anxiety down one notch, realize that we're gonna get through this, it's gonna be here, it's gonna pass through our communities, and so we really just need to kind of do things that are smart, but try to avoid panic.</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published in March 2020.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-stay-safe-covid-19-outbreak-2020-3'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/zOrpIRFAqOU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 21:30:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5e73f04dc48540143e2a4b32?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"89edde374c0f766ee23100ce2205e350","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-39-03-582_ba48b68c22c3386c.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":247554,"destBytes":247554,"author":"jgmoser@businessinsider.com (Justin Gmoser)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn44@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-39-00-474_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn95@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-39-01-969_9a6ebd5527648210.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn68@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-51-551_f959ef6d767e6c27.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn83@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-53-238_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zOrpIRFAqOU:i1nM-oW7UlI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn35@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-48-752_9f85abd786dd3f26.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/zOrpIRFAqOU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn83@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-58-331_9626638e604f5554.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591522112},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:42","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:42","title":"Job diary: I'm a 32-year-old porn star making five figures a month from home during the pandemic.

During the pandemic, she says she's making at least five figures a month.</li>\n<li>This is her story, as told to freelance writer Jenny Powers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>The porn industry isn't regulated, so there was no official shutdown when COVID-19 hit. Filming stopped here in California the third week in March but it was more like a polite suggestion — it's not like we're part of the Screen Actor's Guild or anything. Still, when businesses and restaurants are forced to close their doors, it's probably not the best time to shoot a gang bang.&#160;</p><h2><strong>The average lifespan in the adult film industry for a woman is two to five years.</strong></h2><p>Anything beyond that and you're considered a veteran, like me. I was 25 when I started doing hardcore porn, which is considered old to first get started, and I'm 32 now.</p><p>When I was 19 years old I did some doing freelance nude modeling for a site called Model Mayhem. I loved modeling and dancing so much that I literally woke up one day and went to an audition at a nude club called 4Play in Los Angeles and became an exotic dancer. I credit my early strip club days with learning how important a conversation and setting a mood can be. Personally, I never sat on laps. I always sat next to someone and started a genuine conversation. Then if we wound up in the VIP room, boundaries and respect had long been established.&#160;&#160;</p><p>I was still modeling and dancing when I got hit up to do skits and games for \"The Playboy Morning Show,\" which led to being on the cam site Playboy Live when I was 23, which was so much fun. From there, I did work for Playboy TV, which was technically my first soft porn experience. I started doing solos for a couple of websites and shot a centerfold for Hustler magazine that was released in 2013. By then I was 25, and I contacted a well-known industry agency to start repping me. That's when I began working in adult film, and the rest is history.</p><h2><strong>I'm very vocal about what I will and won't do at my job.</strong></h2><p>Some of my nos include being suspended in air or allowing anyone to repeatedly slap me in the face. I also have a list of the only 20-30 guys I'm willing to work with. I'm known as a diva in the industry, but at the end of the day, I'm just protecting myself. The #MeToo movement and social media has given us the ability to say no more often and helped make the industry safer by outing people for their bad behavior.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3eb222cdf25a001e84e7dc?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Adult actress Romi Rain posing with her poster for Cam4, an adult website.\" height=\"1680\" width=\"2240\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rain posing with her poster modeling for Cam4, an adult website.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Romi Rain</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I have no regrets getting into the business; it's led me to a better life than I ever expected. I hosted the 2019 AVN Awards, known as the \"Oscars of Porn,\" I have products sold in stores (Fleshlight developed an encased sleeve male sex toy molded directly from my own lady bits, and I get monthly residuals from it), I feature-danced in Italy, and now I have the ability to talk and shake my boobs for profit from home.</p><h2><strong>Since porn isn't a forever career, content-creation is our safety net.</strong></h2><p>There's no residual revenue from films unless you've got a stake in the movie, and 95% of us don't. I have to say, cam girls were really ahead of the curve, because content truly is king.</p><p>More than anything, this pandemic has proved our worth as content-creators. I run my own 18+ website and I'm a brand ambassador for Cam4. I'm also on Pornhub, OnlyFans, MiniVids, Clips for Sale, and even play video games over live-stream on Twitch. I'm a one-woman show when it comes to content creation: I do my own filming, editing, and uploading. It's an amazing time to interact with people directly, and it's helped humanize us more as performers. My secret weapon as an adult entertainer is my gift of gab. I love chatting and long-winded dirty talk definitely takes a degree of skill and creativity.&#160;</p><h2><strong>People are often surprised to learn that porn is a day job. It's pretty much 9-to-5 work.</strong></h2><p>Like any other job, what you put in is what you get out, and if you're enjoying yourself too much, you're probably not doing your job to the best of your ability.&#160;&#160;</p><p>As actors, we are responsible to get and pay for a full panel of urine and blood tests every 14 days to ensure we're healthy. It costs $165 each time and insurance doesn't cover it. In most instances, we're also responsible to pay for our wardrobe. A guy can wear the exact same shirt in a dozen scenes, but women need head to toe new everything every scene, so we've got a lot more overhead expenses.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3eb546cdf25a001e84e7fd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Romi Rain 1\" height=\"1650\" width=\"2200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rain says that female performers have a lot more expenses than males — like nails, hair, makeup, and buying new outfits.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Romi Rain</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Before COVID-19, an average workday involved waking up early to shower, shave, and groom. Upon arrival at the shoot house, there's paperwork to complete, then I usually get my makeup done. After, we do still shots known as 'pretty girls' and sex stills with other performers. The sex scenes themselves are highly technical and each position takes between two to five minutes. Afterward, there might be more photos, and then to sign out you hold up your ID verifying your age and legal name on camera, and give verbal consent that you performed at your own free will and were treated fairly.&#160;</p><h2><strong>My longest shoot was eight days for a feature, and a few of those days went into double-digit hours.&#160;</strong></h2><p>Performers are paid a flat rate per scene. Often, though, you're just hired for one scene at a time on a 9-to-5 schedule.</p><p>Women are paid a bit more per scene ($700 to $3,000 depending on what the scene requires) but men can work more because there are more females to choose from. It's a tough job physically for a man, but if he can show up on time and control his member, his career could last years longer than the average female, unless he develops a terrible reputation.&#160;</p><p>I haven't shot any hard-core scene with another person in over six months and honestly don't know when I plan to be on someone else's set again. Plus, I've made more money in the past six months shooting content using OnlyFans and webcamming than I did my entire first year shooting set porn nearly five days straight a week.&#160;</p><p>These days, the hours of the week I work really depends on if I have a project or a financial goal in mind. I could work every day all day, or take several days off. Sometimes it's as easy as just taking a picture on my phone or turning on my webcam. More elaborate, detailed home shoots can take hours to set-up, break down, upload, and edit.</p><p>It's good and bad being able to work as much or as little as I want to because some days I feel like I could be doing more, but it's incredibly important to take breaks.&#160;</p><p>My monthly income is five figures — how high those five figures go really depends on me. I feel like the pandemic makes customers even more eager for content at all hours of the day and night, because they're anxious and bored and want to get their mind off the state of the world.</p><p>I'm not sure when, but I have no doubt the porn industry will bounce back.

It wasn't because of train delays or because I lost my watch. It was just so much harder getting out of bed since I'd started sleeping on <a href=\"https://tuftandneedle.attfm2.net/Rd6zg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Tuft &#38; Needle's Mint Mattress</a>.&#160;</p><p>It's the second mattress from Tuft &#38; Needle, which has three mattresses in total. It'll quickly wrap you up in its soft and comfortable embrace. If you want to try to get work done while sitting in this bed, here's my recommendation: don't. My experience with the mattress is that you'll simply end up horizontal, slumped into an impromptu nap.</p><h2>Specs</h2><p><a href=\"https://tuftandneedle.attfm2.net/Rd6zg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d139d08e3ecba044b5d38d7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"tuft and needle mint mattress 2\" height=\"1960\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Connie Chen/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>The Mint mattress is an upgrade from the company's <a href=\"https://tuftandneedle.attfm2.net/MdNPK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">best-selling original mattress</a>, a 10-inch, medium-firm mattress with almost 6,000 five-star reviews on Amazon and more than 100,000 total reviews on the <a href=\"https://tuftandneedle.attfm2.net/70JEy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Tuft &#38; Needle website</a>.&#160;</p><p>Comparatively, the <a href=\"https://tuftandneedle.attfm2.net/Rd6zg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Mint Mattress</a> is a little thicker at 12 inches tall, but also softer, cooler, and better for pressure relief. The company recommends the Mint if you're a side sleeper or you run hot while sleeping. With more support on its sides, the Mint is also good if you often sit on the edge of your bed.&#160;</p><h2>Set-up process</h2><p>The mattress comes rolled up and packed tightly in a box. I tested the Full size, which weighed 66 pounds and admittedly wasn't fun to carry up the stairs of my fourth-floor walk-up (another set of hands will definitely help if you live in a similar situation). However, once I got the mattress up to my room, the rest of the set-up process was much easier.&#160;</p><p>After I cut through the plastic wrap, the mattress unfurled and rose to its full size. Though the company says there may be a new mattress smell, I personally didn't notice one. Regardless, this potential smell is a result of the packaging process, not chemicals. The mattress is CertiPUR-US and Greenguard Gold certified, so it's free from harmful chemicals and gases.&#160;</p><h2>Review of the Tuft &#38; Needle Mint mattress</h2><p>I positioned the mattress on my new <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zinus-shawn-bed-frame-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zinus bed frame</a>, threw on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/primary-goods-percale-sheets-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one of my favorite sheet sets</a>, and slept on it that same night. Tuft &#38; Needle gives you 100 nights to test out its mattresses risk-free. If you don't end up liking it, you'll get a free refund and the company will also coordinate free pickup and send it to a donation location of your choice.&#160;</p><p>I, for one, never returned my <a href=\"https://tuftandneedle.attfm2.net/Rd6zg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Mint Mattress</a>. It's incredibly comfortable, supportive, and adaptive to both the way my body moves and the changing temperatures of my room.&#160;</p><p>The mattress features Tuft &#38; Needle's signature Adaptive Foam, which contours to your body and provides pressure relief like memory foam but is also breathable and bouncy like latex. This top-layer construction combines all the features many sleepers look for and is what also makes the original mattress and its <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tuft-and-needle-pouch-bean-bag-review-2018-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pouch bean bag chair</a> (no longer available) so invitingly comfortable.</p><p><a href=\"https://tuftandneedle.attfm2.net/Rd6zg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d13a3e9e3ecba0f2241e1d7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"tuft and needle mint mattress 3\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tuft &#38; Needle</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>In the <a href=\"https://tuftandneedle.attfm2.net/Rd6zg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Mint Mattress</a>, the Adaptive Foam is further enhanced by 30% more graphite, which maximizes its cooling abilities. Meanwhile, \"open-cell foam technology\" allows air to flow freely through the mattress and improves breathability, so you won't overheat like you would on a memory foam mattress.</p><p>Even as the weather got exponentially hotter during the summer, my body hasn't while sleeping on this mattress. It has a soft and thick knit cover with a bit of texture you can feel through your sheets — cozy and comforting, and something that sounds perfect for colder temperatures. But surprisingly, this cover doesn't get overwhelming or hot in the summer, and that's because of the rest of the mattress' cooling and breathable design.</p><p>Between the Adaptive Foam layer and base layer, there's a transition layer filled with gel beads that add more support. The base layer is the most firm and gives better edge support. Instead of sinking downwards every time I roll too close to the edge or I perch on my bed putting on my shoes, the mattress seems unaffected by the shift in weight.</p><p>The core of the mattress is of course also supportive. I sleep in all sorts of positions (side, stomach, back), and each feels comfortable. I've found that I'm also able to rest on my side for long periods of time than on my previous mattress. If you sleep with a partner, the mattress is firm and adaptive enough that you won't disturb the entire bed when you reposition yourself or get out of bed early in the morning. Overall, the mattress simply feels stable yet comforting, which is exactly what you want to collapse into at the end of a long day.&#160;</p><h2>The bottom line&#160;</h2><p>My first introduction to Tuft &#38; Needle was its Pouch bean bag chair, which remains one of my favorite products I've ever tested. I shouldn't have been surprised that its flagship mattress would be a hit too. From the very first night, it proved to be supportive, breathable, and comfortable, and it's been consistently so in the year months I've been testing it.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5e060ab8855cc211337b3352\" style=\"position:relative;

The usual methods include issuing common stock — part-ownership in a company that often rewards buyers with regular payments, called <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-dividend\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dividends</a> — and selling <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-corporate-bond\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">corporate bonds</a>, loans that come with contractual interest payments, and the full repayment when the bond finally matures.&#160;</p><p>And then there's a third option: preferred stock, which somewhat confusingly mashes up features of both common stock and bonds. The name's kind of a misnomer — preferred stock shares aren't \"preferred\" because they're extra-fancy. Nor are they \"better\" than common stock, except under limited circumstances and for certain types of investors.&#160;</p><p>If you're wondering whether preferred stocks are right for your portfolio, here's what you need to know.&#160;</p><h2><strong>What is preferred stock?</strong></h2><p>As with common stock, when you buy a share of preferred stock, you are buying a (small) part of the company. And also like common stock, you usually get a certain percentage of money on a regular basis — that's the dividend. The dividend comes from a portion of the company's profits, assuming there are any.&#160;</p><p>Unlike common stock, preferred stock comes with limited or no voting rights — you can't use your share to vote for the board of directors, or for or against other policies.&#160;</p><p>Because preferreds don't come with those voting rights, companies sometimes issue them instead of common stock to avoid diluting ownership. Preferred shares can be sold to qualified investors and employees by privately held companies as well as public ones; if the company goes public, any preferreds can then be bought and sold on a stock exchange.</p><p>The price of a preferred share goes up and down based on demand, like common stock. But that share price doesn't wander away too far from its par value — that is, its initial offering price. It generally moves in response to general interest rates, much like bond prices do.</p><p>That's because preferred stocks resemble bonds in a key way: The dividend they pay every quarter is fixed — similar to a bond's interest payment — unlike a common share dividend, which often fluctuates each quarter.&#160;</p><p>Although that flow isn't contractually guaranteed the way it is with bonds, companies generally feel obligated to give precedence to paying preferred dividends over common dividends.</p><h2><strong>How preferred stocks work</strong></h2><p>Getting to be ahead of common stockholders in the dividend line is only one of preferred shares' unique features.</p><p>Here are the basics of how preffered stocks work:</p><ul><li><strong>Preferred stock dividends are usually a lot higher than common-stock dividends</strong>, and their jumbo size is essentially the whole reason people buy them. The dividends, which are paid quarterly, are expressed as a percentage of their issued value (called \"par\"); this percentage is often called their coupon rate. For instance, a preferred stock issued at a par of $50 with a coupon of 6.75% will pay out about $0.84 a quarter, or $3.35 annually.</li><li><strong>Most preferreds are callable</strong>, meaning that a company may decide to force investors to sell their shares back to them at the prevailing market price, plus some sort of premium.&#160;</li><li><strong>Many preferreds are also convertible</strong>, meaning that a share can be changed into common stock. For instance, a stock's prospectus may say that one share of preferred can be changed into five shares of common stock once a certain date has passed. (In some cases, a company can even force preferred owners to make that conversion.)</li></ul><h2><strong>What the \"preferred\" in preferred stock means</strong></h2><p>The price of a preferred share can fluctuate in daily trading, just like its common share counterpart. It can, and does, reflect what's happening to the company. But because most preferreds are callable, the upside is more limited, and their share price stays pretty close to par value, as noted earlier. The par value is usually akin to what a preferred share would buy in common stock.</p><p>So what's the preferred thing worth? It really only comes into play when the company's in trouble: Preferred shareholders always get their dividends before common shareholders if a company has serious financial problems <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-liquidity\">affecting cash flow</a>, or otherwise decides to suspend dividends. Creditors, employees, bondholders, and a few other groups are still ahead of them in the getting-paid line, though.&#160;</p><p>Of course, most companies make a strong effort to pay dividends through hell and high water. Suspending preferred share dividends is a pretty drastic step. One nice thing, though: when companies are able and willing to begin paying dividends again, they are obliged to start paying them on preferred shares before they can start paying them on common stock.</p><h2><strong>Who buys preferred stock?</strong></h2><p>Loading up on common stock <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/why-invest-in-stocks\">makes sense</a> for lots of different kinds of investors, but the market for preferreds is more limited.&#160;</p><p>Most preferred stock is bought by institutions and pension funds. They love the higher dividends and are better equipped to assess the risks, including the fact that preferreds are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-liquid-assets\">less liquid </a>(easily sold) than common stock. Institutions also get special tax advantages from preferreds in some cases.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Because the dividends are taxed as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-much-is-capital-gains-tax%20asset%20and%20your%20income%20level\">capital gains</a> if they are held longer, they may also make sense for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investment-income-assets\">income-oriented individual investors </a>who'd otherwise buy bonds. That's because bond payments are interest, which is always taxed as normal income. In contrast, stock dividends qualify for a lower tax rate if you own them as a longer-term investment (longer than a year, usually).&#160;</p><p>Still, for most investors, preferreds' downsides outweigh their potential. They may pay out more than bonds do, but those dividends aren't guaranteed. And if they won't ever appreciate much in value the way common stock does, since a company would simply call them before that happens.&#160;</p><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>Preferreds aren't called that because they're so classy. They're preferred because their dividends have to be paid before those that would go to the common stockholders.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Preferred stock pays higher dividends than common stock, but its share price will never appreciate the way common stock might. So, the upside's more limited.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Preferreds are best for institutional investors or for more sophisticated individuals, who want them in their portfolio for tax reasons or for some other particular goal. Despite their advantages, they have several aspects to keep track of.

and slated for deportation.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Bello's lawyers will argue before a US federal court that he was targeted for his activism and that his detention violates the right to free speech.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Bello attended a meeting of the Kern County Board of Supervisors, where during a public comment session he read a poem, \"Dear America,\" defending the rights of immigrants and condemning the federal government's crackdown on the foreign-born.</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYIt-euHKuY\" frameborder=\"0\"

Civil Liberties Union. ICE set bail at $50,000 — more than twice Bello's income as a farm worker.</p>\n<p>In court, ICE has argued that it has a right to detain Bello, regardless of what actually sparked his arrest, because the then-22-year-old had a prior conviction for driving under the influence. And that argument has, thus far, prevailed in the US justice system, where agents of the state have been granted de facto immunity for suspected retaliatory arrests provided there is \"probable cause\" for the detention.</p>\n<p>Tuesday's hearing will be before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In a <a href=\"https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/brf.9cir.18_opening_brief.pdf\">brief filed with the court</a>, attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union say the court should reverse an earlier judgment upholding the arrest and reject \"ICE's dangerous position as anathema to the First Amendment protection against retaliation for speech.\"</p>\n<p>ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

November 14, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-results\">the final puzzle piece</a> of the 2020 presidential map was set.</p><p>Once President-elect Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-wins-georgia-democratic-party-south-presidential-election-2020-11\">was declared the winner in Georgia</a>, based on a projection by Decision Desk HQ and Insider, the final Electoral College tally in the presidential election stood at 306 electoral votes for Biden and 232 electoral votes for President Donald Trump. Biden is well over the 270 electoral vote threshold needed to secure the presidency.</p><p>As of November 17, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-results\">Biden leads in the national popular vote</a> by a 51% to 47% margin, or by 4 percentage points. So far, Biden has earned 78,729,579 votes, compared to Trump's 73,126,938 votes, with outstanding ballots still being counted in several states, including California and New York.&#160;</p><p>Biden's raw vote lead is currently just under 6 million votes.</p><p>While the 2016 presidential map reflects Democratic dominance on the East and West coasts and Republican strength across the interior of the country, the 2020 map shows how Biden made significant inroads in every region of the country.</p><p>Here are some key differences between the 2016 presidential race between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and this year's election between Trump and Biden:</p><h3>The 2020 Electoral College total is the inverse of the 2016 results</h3><p>Biden's 306 electoral votes and Trump's 232 electoral votes are the exact inverse of the 2016 presidential election, when Trump received 306 electoral votes to 232 electoral votes for Clinton.</p><p>The final 2016 presidential map reflects 304 electoral votes for Trump and 227 electoral votes for Clinton because both candidates lost two and five electoral votes, respectively, due to faithless electors.</p><p>Faithless electors are members of the Electoral College <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/electoral-college-donald-trump-president-official-2016-12\">who vote against the state or district's popular vote winner</a>. For Clinton, there were four faithless electors in Washington State and one faithless elector in Hawaii, while Trump had two faithless electors in Texas. Before 2016, the last time that there were any faithless electors was the 2004 presidential election between then-President George W. Bush and Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.</p><p>This year, members of the Electoral College, who have already been picked by the states and Washington DC, will meet on December 14 to cast their votes for the winner of each state or district.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb2fa641c741f0019aca246?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2016 vs 2020 pres maps\" height=\"1280\" width=\"890\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shayanne Gal/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h3>Biden flipped 5 states that Trump won in 2016</h3><p>Throughout the presidential campaign, Biden focused on restoring the \"blue wall,\" the collection of states that had voted for every Democratic presidential nominee from 1992 to 2012, while also competing in the Sun Belt, which included the key states of Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Texas.</p><p>Biden was successful in not only <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-sweeps-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin-battleground-states-election-2020-11\">flipping Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin</a>, but he also carried Arizona (49.4%-49.1%) and Georgia (49.5%-49.2%). However, he came up short in Florida (48%-51%) and Texas (46%-52%).</p><p>Pennsylvania, with its 20 electoral votes, was a critical battleground for both Biden and Trump. The president narrowly won Pennsylvania in 2016, but Biden carried the state this year by performing strongly in Philadelphia and its suburbs, along with Pittsburgh and the northeastern region of the state.</p><p>Michigan (16 electoral votes) and Wisconsin (10 electoral votes) were key Midwestern prizes that were part of Biden's calculus for winning the White House.&#160;</p><p>The wins in Arizona (11 electoral votes) and Georgia (16 electoral votes) reflected the party's growing strength in fast-growing areas of the country that are rapidly diversifying and are home to large numbers of suburban voters, who were a critical part of the Democratic coalition in 2020.</p><p>Lastly, Biden won the 2nd congressional district of Nebraska, anchored by Omaha, the state's largest city. Since the state allocates its electoral votes by Congressional districts, the president-elect earned one electoral vote, while Trump won the remaining four electoral votes.</p><p>The key difference from 2016? Clinton didn't win any of these states — had she just won Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, then she would have headed to the White House instead of Trump.</p><h3>Biden and Trump each won 25 states</h3><p>In the 2020 presidential election, Biden won 25 states, along with Washington DC and Nebraska's 2nd congressional district. Trump also won 25 states, along with Maine's 2nd congressional district.</p><p>In 2016, Trump won 30 states and Maine's 2nd congressional district, while Clinton only won 20 states and Washington, DC.</p><p>Despite Trump winning the same number of states as Biden this year, he still fell well short in the Electoral College.

The roughly $8 billion program led SpaceX to develop Crew Dragon, and Boeing to develop its CST-100 Starliner (which may fly its first crew in late 2021).</p><p>NASA funded the Crew Dragon's creation with about $3 billion, and engineers at SpaceX designed, built, and tested it to exacting government requirements.

The ISS offers an unparalleled zero-gravity environment in which to perform research that can't be conducted on Earth. However, science is hard to get done when only a few crew members are on the ISS, since they're often preoccupied with regular cleaning and maintenance.

It confidentially filed to go public in September, but in its <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm\">S-1</a> filed Monday, Airbnb officially unveiled the 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-files-s1-public-ipo-paperwork-revenue-losses-covid-19-2020-11\">company's IPO documents.</a></p><p>\"When borders closed and travel stopped, our business declined by nearly 80%,\" Airbnb founders Brian Chesky, Nate Blecharczyk, and Joe Gabbia wrote in a letter that accompanied the S-1. \"We had to put our IPO on hold, and I don't think many people expected us to go public this year. I know some people questioned if we'd make it at all. What has transpired since then has been our most defining period since we started Airbnb.\"</p><p>The founders closed the letter, saying: \"In the depths of this crisis, some people asked, 'Is this the end of Airbnb?' It was not the end of Airbnb. In fact, it was just the beginning. It's still early.

An effort to do so would require legal action in court, and for a judge to rule that the ballots were illegally cast or fraudulent.&#160;</p><p>Talking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Graham disputed Raffensperger's account of the conversation, telling The National Journal's Zach Cohen that Raffensperger \"did a good job\" explaining the signature verification process and called the notion that he pressured Raffensperger to get ballots disqualified \"ridiculous.\"&#160;</p><p>\"It seems to me that Georgia has some protections that maybe other states don't have, where you go into the portal to get your ballot. But I thought it was a good conversation. I'm surprised to hear he characterized it that way,\" Graham said, according to Cohen.</p><p>Georgia is one of around 30 states that uses signature matching to verify the authenticity of mail ballots. In that process, election officials compare the signature on the outer envelope with the voters' most recent signature on file. A mismatched signature is not necessarily indicative of fraud, as peoples' signatures sometimes change over time, and Georgia <a href=\"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/elections/2020-election-cure-absentee-ballot-georgia/85-c7e1858e-4a44-4c41-9a82-694a21c39e13\">has an established cure process for voters to fix problems with their signature.&#160;</a></p><p>The intra-party battle began heating up shortly after Election Day when Republicans Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who are now advancing to January runoffs, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/09/loeffler-perdue-georgia-secretary-state-resign-435484\">called on Raffensperger to resign from office,</a> claiming without presenting any evidence that he \"failed to deliver honest and transparent elections.\"</p><p>There is no evidence of any widespread fraud or irregularities in Georgia.

I recommend that Senators Loeffler and Perdue start focusing on that,\" he wrote.</p><p>Rep. Doug Collins, who challenged Loeffler in the special jungle election to replace Sen.

homepage for more stories</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>\n</ul><p>While much of the retail sector in Southeast Asia was hit hard due to lockdowns and other restrictions in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce continues to grow at speed, with consumers and merchants alike increasingly turning to online platforms.&#160;</p><p>According to Google Trends, Thailand saw a 63% increase in e-commerce search interest in May compared to the same time in 2019. Malaysia and Vietnam also experienced positive levels of interest, with increases of 32% and 13% respectively.</p><p>This growth is nothing new for the region – the pandemic is merely accelerating an existing trend. A joint report from Google, Temasek and Bain and Company estimated that the eCommerce sector in SEA was worth over $38 billion in 2019, up from $5.5 billion in 2015. The report forecasts that e-commerce value in the region will surpass $100 billion by 2025.&#160;</p><p>Riding this boom is Shopee, the leading e-commerce site in the region measured by average monthly active users. Headed by CEO Chris Feng alongside COO Terence Pang, Shopee launched in Singapore in 2015 as a social-first, mobile-centric marketplace. Here are four key strategic factors driving Shopee's journey from ambitious startup to a regional retail powerhouse.</p><h2><strong>Mobile first. Always.</strong></h2><p>Southeast Asians are the most engaged mobile Internet users in the world. According to the Google, Temasek, and Bain and Company report, there are 360 million Internet users in the region and 90% of them connect to the Internet primarily through their mobile phones.&#160;</p><p>From the beginning, Shopee saw mobile as an emerging trend and the way forward for e-commerce in the region. It immediately focused on optimizing user experience and engagement through mobile. The company says online shopping must evolve to fit the needs of younger users in particular who grew up communicating, collaborating, and entertaining themselves on mobile devices. Shopee's mobile-first approach allows it to take advantage of the expected continued growth in mobile subscriber penetration.</p><p>Shopee says that over 95% of orders on the platform are now made on mobile. Responding to this demand, Shopee offers an end-to-end online shopping experience directly on the mobile app. Buyers are able to browse products, order, make payment, and track the status of deliveries. At the same time, sellers are able to use the app to take a photo, create listings, monitor shop performance, receive payments and track deliveries through integrated logistics and payment tools.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Taking a hyper-local approach</strong></h2><p>Southeast Asia is a region and not a single market. Each country has different e-commerce characteristics and challenges, and the demographics of consumers also differ from market to market. With this in mind, Shopee takes a hyper-localized approach in each market to bring the most relevant online shopping experience for brands, sellers, and shoppers.&#160;</p><p>By understanding each market and its user behaviors means Shopee is able to respond to their needs. As well as having local offices and teams in each of the markets it operates, each market is highly localized in its product categories and marketing campaigns. For example, in Indonesia Shopee launched Shopee Barokah to meet the needs of Muslim users for a variety of Shariah-compliant products and services<strong>, </strong>particularly during the fasting month.&#160;</p><p>Shopee also runs&#160; localized initiatives around festivals such as Chinese New Year or Tet, and at the operational level it offers seven different versions of the app and has a variety of payment options to match specific country-level needs.</p><h2><strong>For customers: more than just shopping</strong></h2><p>One important area of innovation for Shopee is its ability to provide a personalized and social experience for its users.&#160;</p><p>In terms of personalization, Shopee leverages data and AI to identify patterns and insights from users' browsing and purchase data and uses new technologies like AI and AR-powered tools to help brands give their audiences distinct shopping experiences. Instead of focusing solely on driving transactions and competing on price, brands and sellers can win by engaging customers and creating brand affinity through these experiences.&#160;</p><p>Shopee has from the beginning integrated shopping and social. The platform creates immersive experiences by building a strong community that enables users to connect and interact with one another.&#160;</p><p>Features include: Shopee Live (a live streaming feature); Shopee Games (an in-app gaming function); Shopee Feed (an in-app social feed allows users to share content on what they are listing, buying, and selling with the larger Shopee community); and Shopee Live Chat (a chat function that allows buyers to speak with sellers directly and find out more information before and after making a purchase).&#160;</p><p>The company is also using data and AI to make online shopping more secure. For example, scripted machine learning is used to detect potential fraud cases and counterfeit products on the platform, offering users greater peace of mind. At the same time, its integrated mobile wallets ShopeePay and AirPay offer users a convenient and secure option, and in turn helps businesses capture new opportunities.</p><h2><strong>Support for merchants and digital inclusion</strong></h2><p>Shopee is committed to strengthening its partner merchant ecosystem. At the most basic level, the Shopee Seller Centre is continually updated with new functions that make it easier for sellers to track and manage their sales performance, payments, inventories, and deliveries on Shopee:&#160;</p><p>On top of that, in terms of marketing Shopee provides a range of data and visualisation tools to track and obtain shopping insights, as well as a one-stop portal where merchants can create vouchers and other promotional tools. Shopee recently teamed up with Google to launch Google Ads with Shopee, a first-of-its-kind marketing solution for brands to drive sales online. Brands on Shopee will get access to specialized marketing tools to boost their online presence, create deeper engagements with customers, and flexibly manage and measure their marketing campaigns.&#160;</p><p>Shopee is also aiming to power the next wave of digital growth in the region and ensure that more businesses can digitize and tap into the growing opportunity in the region, particularly following the COVID-19 downturn. Support offered includes the Seller Support Package launched in April to help businesses digitize and recover from the pandemic, and&#160; Shopee University, which equips sellers with the knowledge to start their online business. Shopee also offers Seller Masterclasses, which drive sellers to adopt new tools and leverage new trends. One of the specific objectives of the Masterclass is to help sellers better leverage the benefits of live streaming.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a
