There are two schemes of multiphoton catalysis in the current literature:\r\none uses a beam splitter, while the other uses an optical parametric amplifier. We derive the\r\ncatalysis operator in the Fock basis for each scheme and find a close relationship between them. We\r\npropose to enhance quantum entanglement of the two-mode squeezed vacuum state by performing two-mode\r\nmultiphoton catalysis independently using two beam splitters. We calculate the optimal entanglement,\r\nwhich is maximized over two independent transmissivities, for the catalyzed states with various\r\npairs of catalysis photon numbers, and find that in each case entanglement is enhanced only when the\r\nsqueezing parameter is below a certain threshold. We also find that the optimal entanglement is\r\nnonzero in the limit of low squeezing, and deduce the analytical forms of the limiting catalyzed\r\nstate and it...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":20447,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7fd74025482166bd8d57d7e5be737bc3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yang Yang","publishedOrCreatedDate":1607006634641}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-12-03 22:43:54","updatedTime":"2020-12-03 22:43:54","feedId":20447,"fetchDate":"Thu, 03 Dec 2020 14:43:54 +0000","fetchMs":87280,"handleMs":8,"totalMs":87291,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"7be5a6429a423a68cef7abf798e66509","hostName":"us-016*","requestId":"3dfb3859f8de4cb88d2c6c2b0ff8bbbd_20447","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:22:27","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:10:10","id":20447,"name":"Laser Physics Letters - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1612-202X/?rss=1","subscriber":162,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn9@2020_5/2020/09/06/20-10-09-521_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Laser Physics Letters","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1607006547352,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":87281,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":8,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
