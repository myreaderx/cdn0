It starts off with a national celebration, always has nice weather, and my birthday is smack dab in the middle of it. I have a habit of taking summer vacation for the month and this year was no exception.</p>\n<p>We kicked things off with a journey to Chelan, Washington for the 4th of July. My sister-in-law, Mya, helps run <a href=\"https://www.tildio.com/\">Tildio Winery</a> and we figured it was about time we did some wine tasting there. My parents joined us and we had a blast! \n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mraible/51427936751/in/album-72157719832602065/\" title=\"Happy Ladies\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51427936751_381746f3be_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Happy Ladies\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\"></a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<p>From there, we returned to Colorado and I journeyed to golf with my buddy Cletus in Nebraska. We played 36 holes in 24 hours and enjoyed each other's company thoroughly. I polished up Hefe for a birthday cruise on the 16th.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mraible/51427179387/in/album-72157719832602065/\" title=\"Hefe the Bus, chillin&#x27;\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51427179387_ac51ac87c9_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Hefe the Bus, chillin&#x27;\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\"></a>\n</p>\n<p>The 2nd half of July was spent in Montana and Cape Cod. In Montana, we witnessed KeAnna and Cole's wedding and celebrated with old and new friends.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mraible/51428192248/in/album-72157719832602065/\" title=\"Congratulations!\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51428192248_39b177da11_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Congratulations!\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\"></a>\n</p>\n<p>In Cape Cod, we had lots of smiles and water time with Trish's fabulous family.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mraible/51428705969/in/album-72157719832602065/\" title=\"Awesome Family\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51428705969_e3457143e6_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Awesome Family\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\"></a>\n</p>\n<p>These photos are just a sampling of the 150+ that I polished and published. I think photos are a great way to tell a story, so I added captions to all of them in my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mraible/albums/72157719832602065\">Summer 2021 Album</a>. I've also embedded it below.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mraible/albums/72157719832602065\" title=\"Summer 2021: Washington, Montana, and Cape Cod\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51428888930_3b1671a830_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Summer 2021: Washington, Montana, and Cape Cod\" style=\"border: 1px solid black\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>You might notice the album doesn't end with Cape Cod photos. That's because August was full of adventures too! I had to return to Montana to get our van, raft, and dogs. My dad joined me for the return road trip and his brother, Jimmy, joined us for a week at the ranch.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mraible/51427927491/in/album-72157719832602065/\" title=\"It&#x27;s time for Raible Road Trip 2021!\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51427927491_38eacc66d5_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"It&#x27;s time for Raible Road Trip 2021!\"></a>\n</p>\n<p>Then, I spent a week at the Summer Tech Forum in Crested Butte, complete with a 24-hour trip to Boulder to help Abbie move into CU. After a weekend in Telluride, I returned home, worked on my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1433495423319216131\">SpringOne presentation</a>, and got ready for <a href=\"https://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/happy_birthday_jack10\">Jack's 17th birthday</a> party. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe party was a success, Abbie joined a sorority today, and we're looking forward to a colorful fall.
