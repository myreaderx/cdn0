This first demonstration of triple junction‐based MIM shows record efficiency of 35.1% under close to 800‐sun illumination. The use of microfabrication methods enables flexible design and versatility to adapt the MIM design to the system optics.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>A core issue in concentrator photovoltaic technology (CPV) is the resistive losses in cells that usually limits the maximum photoconversion efficiency under high concentration. We propose the use of three‐junction monolithic interconnected modules (MIM) to mitigate resistive losses by providing high‐voltage low‐current power. First, we present the fabrication of InGaP/InGaAs/Ge front‐contacted microcells with various designs and dimensions. Front‐contacted cells are the key enabler for the MIM fabrication and demonstrate good electrical characteristics under one sun, similar to standard‐contacted cells. The base front contact size is minimized to limit the unutilized area on the wafer. Second, fabrication techniques for interconnecting cells in MIM are described. Finally, electrical measurements show a record conversion efficiency of 35.1% under 798 suns for the first three‐junction MIM reported (17.8% when considering the entire device area). Versatility and further optimization of the devices are discussed to enlarge their field of application.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 14:27:31 +0000","feedId":12296,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/31623536-38b6-4363-a074-9581e1e61e6a/pip3404-toc-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"864d7a6795505b6e41ab966dc33d1719","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_6/2021/04/07/18-01-14-648_2ade3f68f4ef11f8.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":290,"sourceBytes":63670,"destBytes":63670,"author":"\nPierre Albert, \nAbdelatif Jaouad, \nGwenaëlle Hamon, \nMaïté Volatier, \nYannick Deshayes, \nLaurent Béchou, \nVincent Aimez, \nMaxime Darnon\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/31623536-38b6-4363-a074-9581e1e61e6a/pip3404-toc-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_6/2021/04/07/18-01-14-648_2ade3f68f4ef11f8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617818413181}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 02:00:13","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 02:00:13","feedId":12296,"fetchDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 18:00:13 +0000","fetchMs":576,"handleMs":25,"totalMs":62433,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":43,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"ed7c8493918bbf46e240d1f3d92aa67c","hostName":"us-037*","requestId":"c6cb1cf367c240d2863453f6cfdd99bb_12296","contentType":"application/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":63670,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx11":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:37:30","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:34:01","id":12296,"name":"Wiley: Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications: Table of Contents","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/rss/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1099-159X","subscriber":252,"website":null,"icon":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/journal-banners/1099159x.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn10@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-33-59-783_6b49cd3897674363.jpg","description":"Table of Contents for Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications.
