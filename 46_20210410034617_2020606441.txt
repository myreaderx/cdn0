I love a good map, me, and at school I was one of those freaky kids who actually liked studying geography. Not only do I love looking at maps and trying to memorise the locations of places I've never heard of, but I'm consistently fascinated by the way contour lines on ordnance survey maps can turn a flat image of the world around you into a three dimensional one. When I get to spend time poring over video game maps as well, it's a little slice of heaven.</p>\n<p>By this measure, I should absolutely adore indie puzzler <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/carto\">Carto</a>, which is all about rearranging squares on your map to forge new paths and discover lost lands so you can make your way back to your gran. It's a lovely chill game that's very relaxing and gentle to play, but I have big beef with it, too. </p>\n <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-carto\">Read more</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=oUq6ksqnVkM:rTj8GKqSQhU:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=oUq6ksqnVkM:rTj8GKqSQhU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/oUq6ksqnVkM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 07:30:00 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/carto_UUafd3n.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/carto_UUafd3n.jpg","linkMd5":"b89d22263bfce11c28b303c2d5be5f54","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn95@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-52-500_64d435df5c86653f.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":510268,"destBytes":257060,"author":"Katharine Castle","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/carto_UUafd3n.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/carto_UUafd3n.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn95@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-45-52-500_64d435df5c86653f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/10/03-46-16-301_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn95@2020_4/2021/04/10/03-46-16-477_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/oUq6ksqnVkM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn44@2020_6/2021/04/10/03-46-16-426_7ce1352cb8af855a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1618026332535},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:32","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 11:45:32","title":"Do we still need E3?","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/do-we-still-need-e3","description":"<img src=\"https://assets2.rockpapershotgun.com/e3-2019-queue_VfxT7dN.jpg/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/e3-2019-queue_VfxT7dN.jpg\" /> <p>\nE3 is coming back.
