Specifically, Google is making Chrome&#8217;s tabs and its newer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/google-chrome-will-finally-help-you-organize-your-tabs/\">tab groups</a> easier and quicker to use. Under the hood, it promises improvements that will deliver up to 10% faster page loads and will reduce the impact of having idle background tabs.</p>\n<p>Together, the full set of new features address concerns of Chrome power users who tend to have many tabs open at once and work in their browser on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Google this May <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/google-chrome-will-finally-help-you-organize-your-tabs/\">introduced tab groups</a>, initially in beta. The feature allows users to add their open tabs to a group that they can then name and label, to keep their various projects, tasks, applications and other online research organized. In this release, tab groups will roll out to all users.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Based on beta user feedback, Google is tweaking how tab groups work, as well.</p>\n<p>Chrome will now allow users to collapse and expand their tab groups, so you can focus on the ones you need to access right now. Google says this was the most popular request it heard from those who were using tab groups during tests. Also, Google is introducing a new touchscreen interface for tabs designed for laptops being used in tablet mode, coming to Chromebooks first. This will make it easier for users to flip through tabs.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2035878\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2035878\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2035878 size-large\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tab-Groups-Expand_Collapse.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2035878\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>\n<p>On Android&#8217;s version of Chrome, if you start typing a page in the address bar, you&#8217;ll see a suggestion to switch to that tab if it&#8217;s already open.

You&#8217;ll even be able to reopen these files again and pick up where you left off. This feature, however, will slowly roll out over the next few weeks, Google says.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Meanwhile, the beta version of the Chrome browser will introduce a feature that lets you hover over a tab to see a thumbnail preview of the page. This could be useful particularly for those times when you have many open tabs from the same domain, like Google Docs. </span></p>\n<p>To improve the overall experience of using many tabs in Chrome, this release (version M85) will deliver two improvements. The first is Profile Guided Optimization, which is a compiler optimization technique where the most performance-critical parts of the code can run faster, Google explains. It says this will bring up to 10% faster page loads by prioritizing the most common tasks. The improvement will roll out across Mac and Windows with Chrome M85. (The technique was actually first introduced in M53 using Microsoft Visual C++ [MSVC], Chrome&#8217;s previous build environment. Now <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/chrome-on-windows-ditches-microsofts-compiler-now-uses-clang/\">it uses Clang</a> and will reach both Mac and Windows).</p>\n<p>In the Chrome Beta channel, Google is also introducing tab throttling which gives more resources to the tabs you’re currently using by taking the resources back from tabs that have been in the background for a long time. This change should bring improvements across loading speed, battery and memory saving.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2035879\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2035879\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2035879 size-large\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png 6001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png?resize=768,320 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png?resize=680,283 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png?resize=1536,640 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png?resize=2048,853 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2035879\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>\n<p>Chrome has often been <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/718108/make-older-mac-feel-new-ditch-chrome/\">criticized</a> for <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chrome-has-gotten-extremely-slow-is-it-just-me.2232543/\">being</a> <a href=\"https://www.macbookproslow.com/speed-up-chrome/\">slow</a> and a resource hog on Mac. While user complaints can be attributed to a variety of problems, ultimately users will blame the software, not the OS it runs upon. That means Google has to make an effort to address the areas it&#8217;s able to fix by rolling out optimizations such as these. To what extent the improvements deliver the results Google promises, however, will have to be confirmed by third-party testing after they arrive.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/jEkxsNK-SMQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:59:01 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tab-Groups-Expand_Collapse.gif?w=680","linkMd5":"4d14dbb5934ee8d38b1f808948650da4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn38@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-07-59-352_33ee138d0e03eac0.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":680,"sourceBytes":2499721,"destBytes":982006,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tab-Groups-Expand_Collapse.gif?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn38@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-07-59-352_33ee138d0e03eac0.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Switch-to-Tab-on-Android.png?w=619":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn79@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-09-19-648_767f580d4d9783ed.png","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Copy-of-QR_Code_Dino.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-09-19-453_ecaa476199a23cbd.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Chrome_BlogHeader_Productivity.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-09-18-771_537992875e30068d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-588_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-18-730_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn8@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-18-864_7310fd99bfe482f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=jEkxsNK-SMQ:tzptpfGE_dA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-632_11a1b1bdcb4c38f2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-756_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/jEkxsNK-SMQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-24-537_f53c1f59f9376585.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598378872856},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","title":"Facebook News to expand internationally to the U.K., Germany, France, India, and Brazil","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2035749","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Facebook News, the social network&#8217;s dedicated news section <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/facebook-news-launches-to-all-in-u-s-with-addition-of-local-news-and-video/\">launched</a> to U.S. audiences in June, is soon expanding to international markets. The company announced today it plans to accelerate its plans to bring the product to non-U.S. markets, including the U.K., Germany, France, India, and Brazil, within the timeframe of six months to a year.</p>\n<p>As in the U.S., Facebook says it&#8217;s committed to paying news publishers in the new markets for the content made available in the Facebook News product. However, it notes that the experience may not be exactly the same as it is in the U.S., in other ways.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Consumer habits and news inventory vary by country, so we’ll work closely with news partners in each country to tailor the experience and test ways to deliver a valuable experience for people while also honoring publishers’ business models,&#8221; explained Campbell Brown, Facebook VP of Global News Partnerships, in an <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/bringing-facebook-news-to-more-countries/\">announcement</a> detailing Facebook&#8217;s plans.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>As the product expands in these international markets and beyond, the company will face various new laws and regulations that require tech firms like Facebook to pay for news.

Similar laws are being enacted in the E.U, as well.

But when it <a href=\"http://qz.com/768122/facebook-fires-human-editors-moves-to-algorithm-for-trending-topics/\">fired</a> the editors who curated that section, Facebook&#8217;s algorithms <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/08/facebook-fires-human-editors-algorithm-immediately-posts-fake-news/\">began posting fake news</a> to the list. Facebook finally <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/06/removing-trending/\">removed</a> the feature in June 2018.</p>\n<p>The company also tried to serve publishers over the years with mixed results. It once pitched the concept of &#8220;Instant Articles&#8221; that loaded quickly in Facebook, but restricted advertising, subscriptions and the recirculation modules publishers relied on, leading <a href=\"https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/are-facebook-instant-articles-worth-it.php\">many to abandon the feature</a>. And it once <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/what-the-shift-to-video-means-for-creators\">pushed</a> the &#8220;shift to video,&#8221; but had <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/facebook-pay-40-million-under-proposed-settlement-video-metrics-suit-1245807\">inflated</a> its video metrics. When Facebook pulled back on paying publishers, some news businesses <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/was-the-medias-big-pivot-to-video-all-based-on-a-lie\">were wiped out</a>. Also in 2018, Facebook <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/facebook-time-spent/\">announced</a> it would deprioritize the distribution of news posts in its News Feed in favor of personal updates from friends and family, shrinking referrals to news outlets.</p>\n<p>In more recent years, Facebook&#8217;s role in the spread of fake news, propaganda, disinformation, and other un-fact checked content has been brought to light. Unfortunately, any changes Facebook makes at this point may be too late to address the underlying issues. For example, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/facebook-bans-qanon-groups-accounts-72474326\">by the time Facebook decided to ban</a> some QAnon groups and accounts earlier this month, the conspiracy movement had become a part of the mainstream consciousness. Last May, the FBI had even flagged that conspiracy theory-driven extremists, including those who believe in QAnon, were now a domestic terrorism threat.</p>\n<p>Facebook News, then, has a big battle ahead. It&#8217;s not just the company&#8217;s latest effort to woo publishers who have burned repeatedly by Facebook&#8217;s efforts, it also serves as the company&#8217;s latest solution to the growing misinformation problem.</p>\n<p>The news section, programmed by journalists, today requires that publishers <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/news/howitworks\">qualify</a> for inclusion by having a significantly large audience and abiding by integrity standards. Facebook claims to look for negative <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/news/howitworks\">signals</a> like if the content gets flagged by fact-checkers or if it includes clickbait, engagement bait or use of scraped content. But elsewhere on the social network, Facebook takes a different approach to misinformation. It had been at <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1236182?__twitter_impression=true\">the same time relaxing its rules</a> around misinformation for several high-profile conservative pages, leading to questions about its overall news judgement.</p>\n<p>At launch, Facebook News had over 200 general news publishers and thousands of local and regional publications in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Today, the company says its plans are to also grow Facebook News in the U.S., in addition to bringing the product to new markets. It will focus more specifically on growing engagement with Facebook News in the U.S.</p>\n<p>Facebook also claims that over 95% of the traffic Facebook News delivers to publishers is incremental to the traffic they already get from News Feed.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/1LDx07OVvqI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:24:33 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NRP-Facebook_News_International_Expansion_inline.png?w=680","linkMd5":"fef685ea1ff59fc906751465c39078f9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn70@2020_6/2020/08/25/18-07-52-970_bf823c2760184140.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":623,"sourceBytes":49086,"destBytes":49086,"author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NRP-Facebook_News_International_Expansion_inline.png?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn70@2020_6/2020/08/25/18-07-52-970_bf823c2760184140.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-588_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-18-730_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-09-18-735_f707c928dd87c83d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=1LDx07OVvqI:jcWKpR0zGRw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-09-18-745_c87588af841ac241.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-756_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/1LDx07OVvqI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-09-18-698_b3f7de76d4f218c7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598378872857},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","title":"New Zendesk dashboard delivers customer service data in real time","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2035813","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"http://zendesk.com\">Zendesk</a> has been offering customers the ability to track customer service statistics for some time, but it has always been a look back. Today, the company announced a new product called Explore Enterprise that lets customers capture that valuable info in real time, and share it with anyone in the organization, whether they have a <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/zendesk\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"zendesk\">Zendesk <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> license or not.</p>\n<p>While it has had Explore in place for a couple of years now, Jon Aniano, senior VP of product at Zendesk says the new enterprise product is in response to growing customer data requirements. &#8220;We now have a way to deliver what we call Live Team Dashboards, which delivers real-time analytics directly to Zendesk users,&#8221; Aniano told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>In the days before COVID that meant displaying these on big monitors throughout the customer service center. Today, as we deal with the pandemic, and customer service reps are just as likely to be working from home, it means giving management the tools they need to understand what&#8217;s happening in real time, a growing requirement for Zendesk customers as they scale, regardless of the pandemic.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve found over the last few years is that our customers&#8217; appetite for operational analytics is insatiable, and as customers grow, as customer service needs get more complex, the demands on a contact center operator or customer service team are higher and higher, and teams really need new sets of tools and new types of capabilities to meet what they&#8217;re trying to do in delivering customer service at scale in the world,&#8221; Aniano told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons for this is the shift from phone and email as the primary ways of accessing customer service to messaging tools like WhatsApp. &#8220;With the shift to messaging, there are new demands on contact centers to be able to handle real-time interactions at scale with their customers,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In order to meet that kind of demand, it requires real-time analytics that Zendesk is providing with this announcement. This arms managers with the data they need to put their customer service resources where they are needed most in the moment in real time.</p>\n<p>But Zendesk is also giving customers the ability to share these statistics with anyone in the company. &#8220;Users can share a dashboard or historical report with anybody in the company regardless of whether they have access to Zendesk. They can share it in Slack, or they can embed a dashboard anywhere where other people in the company would like to have access to those metrics,&#8221; Aniano explained.</p>\n<p>The new service will be available starting on August 31 for $29 per user per month.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9J3PoFxzKs8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 16:00:41 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"bcc01657c94aa80e2bd3210f64cd7942","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Ron Miller","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-588_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-18-730_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn55@2020_6/2020/08/25/18-09-18-731_f20f1d1e180e5b30.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=9J3PoFxzKs8:gY7g8f8OOVg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn100@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-09-18-742_d2c185df4c815719.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-756_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/9J3PoFxzKs8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn59@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-09-19-549_c6370afbbf8d4d3c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598378872856},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","title":"Turing raises $14M to help source, vet, place and manage remote developers in tech jobs","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2035800","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The emergence, and now seemingly extended presence, of the novel coronavirus health pandemic has made remote working into a pretty standard part of office life for so-called knowledge workers. Today, a startup that has built a labor marketplace to help companies source and develop teams of remote developers is announcing some funding as to looks to double down on the opportunity and new demand resulting from that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://turing.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turing</a>, which helps source, vet and ultimately connect developers with tech companies that need them for either short- or long-term engagements, is today announcing that it has picked up $14 million in seed funding.</p>\n<p>The gap in the market that Turing is addressing is two-fold: companies need to hire more developers but are facing tight competition (and high rates) for finding qualified people in their immediate vicinity; and on the other side, there are talented developers living in many more places than just the world&#8217;s biggest tech centers who may not want to or cannot (especially right now) relocate to live elsewhere and are unable to connect with the right opportunities.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;Talent is universal, but opportunities are not,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Jonathan Siddharth said in an interview. He and his co-founder Vijay Krishnan (CTO) are both from India and relocated to the Valley for school (both have post-graduate degrees at Stanford) and eventually work, but know all too well that there are plenty more talented people who don&#8217;t. &#8220;We love that we can take Silicon Valley outside of the area and to have all of them participate in it while still helping local communities grow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The funding is notable for a couple of reasons. One is the calibre of the investors. It&#8217;s being led by Foundation Capital, with individuals participating including Adam D&#8217;Angelo (the first CTO at Facebook and also the co-founder of Quora); Cyan Banister of Banister Capital; Ashu Gard of Foundation; and Beerud Sheth, the founder of another labor marketplace, Upwork (formerly known as Elance). Other backers include executives from <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Google, Facebook and Amazon that are preferring not to be named right now.</span></p>\n<p>Two is that it&#8217;s coming on the back of some significant growth for the company. Since coming out in general availability a year ago, Turing has gone from $17,000 to $10 million in annualised revenue, CEO Johnathan Siddharth said in an interview. The company now has some 150,000 developers spanning 140 countries on its books, who are taking on roles at a range of seniority levels at startups that include Lambda School, VillageMD, Ohi Technologies, Nexxus Events and others.</p>\n<h2>Everything is distributed</h2>\n<p>Siddharth and his co-founder and Vijay Krishnan (CTO) were most recently entrepreneurs in residence at Foundation Capital, a stopping-over point after their previous startup, content discovery app Rover, was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/revcontent-acquires-rover/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">acquired by Revcontent</a> (a recommendation platform that competes against the likes of Taboola and Outbrain). But Siddharth said that they got the idea for the startup before then, when they were still building Rover.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our last company was essentially built on a remote team, and we ran it like that for eight years,&#8221; he said, describing the distributed workforce they had developed. &#8220;All our competitors in Palo Alto and the wider area were burning through tons of cash, and it&#8217;s only worse now. Salaries have skyrocketed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As with other areas like e-commerce and the shift to cloud-based architectures, the idea of building a company around a distributed workforce has also drastically accelerated since the arrival and stubborn persistence of the coronavirus pandemic, Siddharth said. &#8220;We knew where the world was headed, but in the last six months there&#8217;s been an even more dramatic shift,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I looked at Facebook and Google working from home, I would have thought I was dreaming. I knew startups would make the shift but didn&#8217;t think larger companies would.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other talent recruitment platforms have identified the disparity between the global distribution of the talent pool of engineers, and the fact that the companies that want to employ them are relatively concentrated in specific geographical areas. They include the likes of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/andela-which-builds-remote-engineering-teams-tapping-african-talent-goes-fully-remote-and-opens-to-the-wider-continent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andela</a> sourcing developers specifically in African markets; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/terminal-raises-17m-led-by-8vc-to-source-and-build-remote-teams-of-engineers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terminal</a> for helping build remote teams (not just individual developers); <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/triplebyte-raises-35m-for-its-online-coding-test-and-credentialing-service-for-hiring-engineers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Triplebyte</a> for building innovative ways of evaluating developers and then connecting them with jobs that fit their expertise; and more established platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.</p>\n<p>And then there are companies like LinkedIn, which has built an impressively large &#8220;work graph&#8221; comprised of hundreds of millions of people around the world, but is still trying to figure out how best to focus that for specific verticals and job opportunities. It has launched its own learning hub, and a number of tools to improve how people identify and improve their skills to match them better with employment opportunities (critical because LinkedIn&#8217;s business model is heavily built around recruitment services). You could see how it might also potentially dabble in more structured evaluations to better match people up &#8212; or potentially try to integrate with or simply acquire companies like Turing that have already built them.</p>\n<p>For now, Turing is building what Siddharth describes as a &#8220;talent cloud&#8221; and he believes that it&#8217;s distinct from others tackling the same market in a couple of ways.</p>\n<p>The first is around how it vets developers and matches them with opportunities, by way of a platform that Turing has built that includes not just tests of a person&#8217;s skills but practical applications similar to those the engineer would be expected to work on in an actual gig.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We use data science to evaluate developers at scale,&#8221; Siddharth said, noting that it&#8217;s not just about individuals but how they work in clusters and teams. He said that those that are particularly good at solving specific issues in their groups will often be deployed en masse across different businesses.</p>\n<p>Another is around how they help companies feel secure around their infrastructure. Employees are contractors for Turing, which pays them after Turing gets paid by the vendor. But given that sometimes engagements are short and companies will be keen to protect their IP, Turing has built a &#8220;sandbox&#8221;, a secure environment on a virtual machine where its contractors work on code that cannot be removed as soon as the engagement ends. The sandbox also means Turing and the company can oversee and manage how work is progressing.</p>\n<p>A third difference is in how Turing sees its longer-term role as a middle-man. While engineers and developers that it works with are essentially working for clients via Turing as an agency, Siddharth noted that it&#8217;s already been the case that several people have crossed over from being &#8220;temps&#8221; and contractors into taking full-time roles with the vendors, cutting Turing out of the equation altogether. (It gets a fee in that case, it seems.)</p>\n<p>Given how big the talent pool is, this doesn&#8217;t seem to be an issue for the company, and if anything, fits Turing&#8217;s wider ambitions to help bridge that gap between talented people, wherever they live, and interesting job opportunities. &#8220;We encourage that,&#8221; Siddharth said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just more Turing evangelists. We want alums everywhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You&#8217;d imagine that, as companies become even more decentralised and accustomed to the idea of even their previously in-office employees working from anywhere, the likelihood of crossing over from remote contractor to remote full-timer might become even more common.</p>\n<p>And in any case, it&#8217;s to the benefit of the company that it continues to bring more people into its marketplace, since the engine that it has built continues to get more sophisticated as more engineers go through it.</p>\n<p>“<span class=\"il\">Turing</span>’s Machine Learning system for developer vetting and matching helps accurately predict the probability of a collaboration succeeding, which helps <span class=\"il\">Turing</span> make high-quality match recommendations,&#8221; said Krishnan. &#8220;Recent fast growth has resulted in more performance data, which has in turn led to rapid improvements in <span class=\"il\">Turing</span>’s vetting and matching accuracy. The result has been even faster growth in both the number of developers on the platform and the number of customers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The current state of the market has really turned the idea of &#8220;technology hub&#8221; on its head, and it&#8217;s about time that we see more startups emerging that also push the concept of how to extend that to talent hubs, which now live in the cloud, not in a specific location.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When the Indian outsourcing and IT revolution was in its infancy, I predicted that the market would grow 100X over the next decade.

The already hot categories are proving to be even more appealing as companies look to technology amid the spread of a deadly and highly contagious virus.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Warehouses and fulfillment centers are, naturally, a big category for funding. Amazon, which has continued to operate as an essential service throughout the pandemic, has helped demonstrate the roles robots can play. It has also, unfortunately, provided some <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/an-eighth-amazon-warehouse-employee-has-died-from-covid-19/\">cautionary stories around transmission to human workers</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://www.foxrobotics.com/home/\">Fox Robotics</a> is the latest startup to reap the benefits of the accelerated interest in the category. The Austin-based startup told TechCrunch this week that it has raised a $9 million Series A, led by Menlo Ventures. The latest round brings its total funding to date up to $13 million, with support from previous investors Eniac, Famiglia, SignalFire, Congruent, AME and Joe.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company’s value proposition is pretty clear. Fox builds self-driving forklifts it says are capable of increasing workplace productivity up to two to three times. Fox joins a glut of companies currently looking to automate the workplace, but the company’s value proposition is in the manner of flexibility it&#8217;s able to provide over more fixed systems. Equally important, it’s much easier to integrate into existing warehouses.</p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><div id=\"attachment_2035526\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2035526\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2035526\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/forklift_with_pickles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"958\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/forklift_with_pickles.jpg 1424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/forklift_with_pickles.jpg?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/forklift_with_pickles.jpg?resize=300,281 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/forklift_with_pickles.jpg?resize=768,718 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/forklift_with_pickles.jpg?resize=680,636 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/forklift_with_pickles.jpg?resize=50,47 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2035526\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fox Robotics</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;The market demand for warehouse automation is huge and growing. The future of warehouse automation isn’t fixed conveyor systems that cost several hundred million dollars. It’s mobile robots that are low-cost, flexible and can be deployed incrementally and quickly,” CEO Charles DuHadway said in the announcement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At the very least, I think there’s a value in a system that lets companies ease into automation, versus more complex systems like the ones offered by companies like Berkshire Grey. Those can be far pricier and resource intensive, making them intimidating for smaller companies and those only beginning to test the waters of automation for their back channels. Unlike some other solutions, it requires direct human supervision, though one employee is able to monitor multiple systems at once.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2035528\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2035528\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2035528\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sizzle_tech-optimized.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2035528\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fox Robotics</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fox says it has been working with some unnamed “large logistics companies” in pilot mode since last October.

The startup deferred presenting on Demo Day, Y Combinator’s biannual showcase of all startups within the batch, probably because it raised.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The business, less than a year old, is raising a $16 million round with a $75 million post-money valuation, according to individuals familiar with the deal. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"andreessen-horowitz\">Andreessen Horowitz <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is leading the round.</p>\n<p>The startup continues to fundraise as it closes out its round.</p>\n<p>Simply put, Trove helps employers compensate their employees. In startups, stock options are a thorny but big part of compensation packages. Trove is a platform that helps managers visualize earnings amid different valuation scenarios, and then communicate those numbers to employees.</p>\n<p>The startup is also breaking into the market during a time where startup employees are indefinitely working from home. Compensation gets trickier as perks disappear. What do you pay your San Francisco employee who now lives in Denver and acquires far less costs of living? If the perks disappear, does that turn into cash for an employee? Companies need new benchmarks, and a suite of startups is popping up to help bring clarity.</p>\n<p>The company is founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewschulman\">Matthew Schulman</a>, a former software engineer at Facebook and graduate of University of Pennsylvania Engineering and Wharton school. The company raised a $850,000 pre-seed round in March.</p>\n<p>Since Trove did not present on Demo Day, we don’t have a clear understanding of the company’s growth. Trove is one of many startups in the space that are trying to make it easier to understand how to pay employees through cash and equity within a startup. Just last week, Welcome <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/welcome-raises-1-4m-to-streamline-the-hiring-process/\">raised $1.4 million </a>with the goal of providing a clear picture of how total compensation works to job candidates. It describes itself as a “first offer management and closing platform.”</p>\n<p>Across startupland, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/25/a-quick-look-at-how-fast-series-a-and-seed-rounds-have-ballooned-in-recent-years-fueled-by-top-investors/\">the size of seed rounds has been growing</a>. In 2018, the average seed round was $5.6 million. Yet Y Combinator serves as sort of an anecdote for how big the rounds could actually get. Over time, the incubator graduates startups with competitively priced rounds on high valuations.</p>\n<p>It hasn’t always been this way. For a sense of how things changed, consider that Trove raised at a $75 million post-money valuation, while Airbnb, which was once a Y combinator company, raised its first check at <a href=\"https://craft.co/airbnb/funding-rounds\">around a $2.5 million valuation</a> in 2009.</p>\n<p>So while high valuations are somewhat expected of Y Combinator graduates, Trove’s raise comes with a pandemic-sized footnote. Startups are closing big rounds even in a remote investment world, showing that the fundraising scene for seed stage startups definitely isn’t as bleak as we thought it would be in early March.</p>\n<p>According to California filings, Trove is selling 8 million shares as of August 20th. Given that due diligence takes 30 days, it’s reasonable to believe that the startup was only part of Y Combinator’s cohort for a few weeks before it raised a Series A round.</p>\n<p>It’s clear that A16z isn’t shy about placing big valuations on months old companies.</p>\n<p>Last summer, the firm landed a lead <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/tandem/\">investor spot with Tandem</a>, another breakout star from the Y Combinator cohort. This year, A16z beat out other investors to lead a financing in Clubhouse, a buzzy app loved by VC and Silicon Valley elite, at a $100 million valuation.</p>\n<p>Other investors in Trove include the Graduate Fund, Backend Capital, and Village Global, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trove-7750/company_financials\">according to Trove’s website.</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/DHxkxyyIhK4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:42:15 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"c7c0083b066abbf51c93925fbb6e4bd3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Natasha Mascarenhas","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-588_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-18-730_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn56@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-19-994_5ca0b398349a6fce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=DHxkxyyIhK4:EOKX9Dby99A:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn44@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-19-515_3b3a8ef16edf6adf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-756_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/DHxkxyyIhK4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/25/18-09-18-711_43eb9c60263d5bc9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598378872856},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","title":"Facebook changes name of its annual VR event and its overall AR/VR organization","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2035589","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is moving further away from the Oculus brand.</p>\n<p>The company says it is changing the name of their augmented reality and virtual reality division to &#8220;Facebook Reality Labs,&#8221; a division which will encompass the company&#8217;s AR/VR products under the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/oculus-vr\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oculus-vr\">Oculus, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Spark and Portal brands.</p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s AR/VR research division had its title changed from Oculus Research to Facebook Reality Labs back in 2018.

Facebook&#8217;s reputation problems anecdotally seem to have a particularly strong hold among PC gamers leaving some Oculus fans generally unhappy with any news that showcases the Oculus brand coming further beneath the core Facebook org. Last week, the company shared that new Oculus headset users will need to sign into the platform with their Facebook account and that they would be phasing out Oculus accounts over time, a change that was met with hostility from insiders who believed that Facebook would keep more distance between the core social app and its virtual reality platform.</p>\n<p>At this point, Oculus is still the brand name of the VR headsets Facebook sells and the company maintains that the brand isn&#8217;t going anywhere, but directionally it seems that Facebook is aiming to bring the brand closer beneath its wing.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/wVGU4xuVHrI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 17:01:16 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_4348.jpg","linkMd5":"459b38763ec711860c7733df275e16a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-07-53-060_910fedd7c80e724e.webp","destWidth":1390,"destHeight":926,"sourceBytes":218579,"destBytes":54512,"author":"Lucas Matney","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/img_4348.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-07-53-060_910fedd7c80e724e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-588_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-18-730_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-09-18-744_66989281e497e88d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wVGU4xuVHrI:JZvsRNN9-1I:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-19-656_244255b6384f281d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-756_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/wVGU4xuVHrI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-09-19-558_8727fc749cb517f9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598378872855},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","title":"Grab your student discount pass for TC Sessions: Mobility 2020","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2034223","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">This ain’t your average back-to-school sale but then again, there’s nothing average about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2020?utm_medium=marketingpost&#38;utm_campaign=mobility2020&#38;utm_content=studenttickets&#38;utm_source=tc&#38;promo=studenttickets&#38;display=\">TC Sessions: Mobility 2020</a>.

The company, which offers a marketplace for office managers to procure services like office cleaning, repairs, etc., is looking to offer a more comprehensive platform.</p>\n<p>The software features include a COVID team safety tool that tracks who is coming into the office, and lets them reserve a specific desk to help ensure social distancing precautions are being taken.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For us, the pandemic really accelerated our plans around enterprise tools,&#8221; said Joe du Bey. &#8220;We realized by talking to our clients that what they need right now isn&#8217;t services. Services are important, but what they really want in this moment is to have software so they can get back into the office.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Eden is also introducing a service desk ticketing tool to allow workers to make requests or file a ticket for a broken piece of equipment from their own desktop, as well as a visitor management tool and a room booking tool.</p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2035754,2035755,2035756\"]</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/confirmed-managed-by-q-sells-to-rival-eden-for-just-11-of-what-wework-paid-for-it-last-year/\">company&#8217;s acquisition of Managed By Q</a>, its biggest competitor in the services space, also greatly accelerated its ability to deliver software. Managed By Q, which was acquired by WeWork in 2019 for $220 million, was already on the trajectory of building out software well before its acquisition by Eden, and had itself acquired companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/managed-by-q-the-office-management-system-acquires-hivy/\">Hivy</a> to offer SaaS-based tools to customers.</p>\n<p>As Eden grows its product portfolio, competition still abounds. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/envoy-raises-43-million/\">Envoy (with just under $60 million in funding)</a> has been in the visitor management space since its inception and is looking to broaden its product portfolio beyond office visitors. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/upkeep-raises-36-million-series-b-to-help-facilities-and-maintenance-teams-go-mobile/\">UpKeep is charging into the service ticket space</a> with a mobile app to make it easier for service workers within an office to do their job and move seamlessly from task to task. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/robin-makes-the-office-smarter-with-7-million-in-new-funding/\">Robin is in the mix</a> with its own room booking platform.</p>\n<p>The point? There is clearly a rush to build out a platform that helps folks manage the physical space of an office and the people within it. Eden, with $40 million in total funding, is well positioned to duke it out for the top spot among a variety of competitors who are angling to &#8216;do it all.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a board meeting question: are we fighting too many battles or is comprehensiveness our most important asset?&#8221; said du Bey. &#8220;We have a completeness to our vision. A lot of our customers are saying they want a few tools from one place versus the very fragmented experience they have today. But there are trade offs in comprehensiveness. It means that someone can can spend all day building a hundred integrations for their app that for us might not be possible. So, there are some really interesting trade offs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not without hardship, however. Eden had to layoff about 40 percent of its workforce amid the coronavirus pandemic. And though COVID has slowed growth, du Bey says that revenue in April 2020 was still higher than it was the year prior.</p>\n<p>Alongside trying to support marketplace partners and customers through the pandemic, Eden has also introduced new ways to search for service providers, including a way to solicit a bid from black-owned businesses in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n<p>The Eden team is 52 percent female.

We&#8217;ve covered some ground already, including looking at Palantir&#8217;s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/leaked-s-1-screenshots-show-palantir-losing-579m-in-2019/\">financials</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/leaked-palantir-s-1-shows-company-has-125-customers-after-17-years/\">its customers</a>, and some of the company&#8217;s self-identified <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/palantir-s1-ice-contract-public-criticism/\">risk factors</a>.</p>\n<p>But despite close relationships with law enforcement and government customers — including the U.S. government — Palantir indicated where it would draw the line if it was served a legal demand for its data.</p>\n<p>From the leaked S-1 filing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>From time to time, government entities may seek our assistance with obtaining information about our customers or could request that we modify our platforms in a manner to permit access or monitoring. In light of our confidentiality and privacy commitments, we may legally challenge law enforcement or other government requests to provide information, to obtain encryption keys, or to modify or weaken encryption.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The S-1 touches on a particularly thorny issue in the U.S., given repeated efforts by the Trump administration to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/william-barr-consumers-security-risks-backdoors/\">undermine and weaken encryption</a> at the request of law enforcement, who say that encryption used by U.S. tech and internet giants makes it harder to investigate crimes.</p>\n<p>But despite the close ties <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/16/peter-thiel-will-donate-1-25m-to-the-trump-campaign-despite-the-latest-controversies/\">between Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and the administration</a>, Palantir&#8217;s position on encryption aligns closer with that of other Silicon Valley tech companies, which say strong encryption protects their users and customers from hackers and data theft.</p>\n<p>In June, the government doubled down on its anti-encryption position with the introduction of two bills which, if passed, would force tech giants to build encryption backdoors into their systems.</p>\n<p>Tech companies — including <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter — <a href=\"https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/rgs-statement-on-lawful-access-to-encrypted-data-act/\">strongly opposed</a> the bills, arguing that backdoors &#8220;would leave all Americans, businesses, and government agencies dangerously exposed to cyber threats from criminals and foreign adversaries.&#8221; (Verizon Media, which owns TechCrunch, is also a member of the coalition.)</p>\n<p>Orders demanding a company&#8217;s encryption keys are rare but not unheard of.</p>\n<p>In 2013 the government ordered Lavabit, an encrypted email provider, to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/13/why-ladar-levison-shuttered-encrypted-email-service-lavabit-in-the-face-of-government-pressure/\">turn over</a> the site&#8217;s encryption keys.

Yesterday <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/unity-jfrog-asana-snowflake-and-sumo-logic-file-for-ipos-in-rapid-fire-fashion/\">a host of tech companies filed to go public</a>, so we&#8217;ll get Lawson&#8217;s take on their decision to pull the trigger today, during a pandemic, recession and election year.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll also riff on taking a big company remote and find out what he thinks about heading back to the office.

It&#8217;s now available in the online version of Word, with other platforms launching later. In addition, Word is also getting new dictation features, which now allow you to use your voice to format and edit your text, for example.</p>\n<p>As the name implies, this new feature lets you transcribe conversations, both live and pre-recorded, and then edit those transcripts right inside of Word. With this, the company goes head-to-head with startups like Otter and Google&#8217;s Recorder app, though they all have their own pros and cons.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2035587\" style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF_Transcribe_Audio-upload.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2035587\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2035587\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GIF_Transcribe_Audio-upload.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"622\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2035587\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>To get started with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/transcribe\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"transcribe\">Transcribe <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> in Word, you simply head for the dictate button in the menu bar and click on &#8216;transcribe.&#8217; From there, you can record a conversation as it happens &#8212; by recording it directly through a speakerphone and your laptop&#8217;s microphone, for example &#8212; or by recording it in some other way and then uploading that file. The service accepts .mp3, .wav, .m4a and .mp4 files.</p>\n<p>As Microsoft Principal Group PM Manager for Natural User Interface &#38; Incubation, Dan Parish, noted in a press briefing ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, when you record a call live, the transcription actually runs in the background while you conduct your interview, for example. The team purposely decided not to show you the live transcript, though, because its user research showed that it was distracting. I admit that I like to see the live transcript in Otter and Recorder, but maybe I&#8217;m alone in that.</p>\n<p>Like with other services, Transcribe in Word lets you click on individual paragraphs in the transcript and then listen to that at a variety of speeds. Since the automated transcript will inevitably have errors in it, that&#8217;s a must-have feature. Sadly, though, Transcribe doesn&#8217;t let you click on individual words.</p>\n<p>One major limitation of the service right now is that if you like to record offline and then upload your files, you&#8217;ll be limited to 300 minutes, without the ability to extend this for an extra fee, for example. I know I often transcribe far more than 5 hours of interviews in any given month, so that limit seems low, especially given that Otter provides me with 6,000 minutes on its cheapest <a href=\"https://otter.ai/pricing\">paid plan</a>. The max length for a transcript on Otter is 4 hours while Microsoft&#8217;s only limit for is a 200MB file upload limit, with no limits on live recordings.</p>\n<p>Another issue I noticed here is that if you mistakenly exit the tab with Word in it, the transcription process will stop and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to restart it.</p>\n<p>It also takes quite a while for the uploaded files to be transcribed. It takes roughly as long as the conversations I&#8217;ve tried to transcribe), but the results are very good &#8212; and often better than those of competing services. Transcribe for Word also does a nice job separating out the different speakers in a conversation. For privacy reasons, you must assign your own names to those &#8212; even when you regularly record the same people.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;d be nice to get the same feature in something like OneNote, for example, and my guess is Microsoft may expand this to its note-taking app over time.

The new funding was led by Beijing Financial Street Capital Operation Center, CICC Alpha, Taizhonghe Capital and includes participation from existing shareholders.</p>\n<p>The funding will primarily go towards development of iSpace&#8217;s planned &#8216;Hyperbola&#8217; space launch vehicle. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/ispace-becomes-the-first-private-chinese-company-to-launch-satellites-to-orbit/\">first of these sent satellites into space last July</a>, making iSpace the first private Chinese launch company to mark that achievement. A larger rocket, called Hyperbola-2, is currently in development, and iSpace intends for the first-stage booster of that vehicle to be fully reusable, with vertical landing capabilities similar to those of SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9.</p>\n<p>iSpace is developing reusable rocket engine technology to match, which is another use of the new injection of funding – as well as technical talent hiring to support all of the above. The goal is to perform a first test flight just to the Kalman line that defines the edge of space sometime early next year, using the first-stage booster of the Hyperbola-2 and including a powered landing. After that, it hopes to fly its first fully orbital mission before the end of next year.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Founded in 2016, iSpace previously raised $104.5 million, bringing its total funding to date to $276.5 million.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/wj78d4cdMkc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 13:55:47 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"1884df4e4b53502bca690b3c74c43c48","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-588_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-18-730_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn23@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-09-19-682_95b387b11cef8f85.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=wj78d4cdMkc:64K8e0t6e2M:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-18-742_0096a1984f05630d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-756_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/wj78d4cdMkc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn52@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-09-19-923_e2cfb63c3c866856.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598378872858},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","title":"Facebook is bringing a Shop section to its app, while Instagram expands Live Shopping","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2035794","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/making-it-easier-to-shop-and-sell-on-our-apps/\">announcing</a> a number of new e-commerce features both within the main Facebook app and on Instagram.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has forced many businesses to shift online, and Facebook<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/\"> made a big announcement in May</a> around the ability of merchants to create Facebook Shops that are viewable on both Facebook and Instagram.

Instagram will waive its selling fee for checkout through the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>The company has also been testing a live shopping experience, where businesses can show off products in a live video, while consumers can browse the highlighted products and make purchases.

Stranger things have happened. And hey, most people were fairly skeptical in the early days of smartwatches. And while I’m not saying that it will definitely take Apple launching its own pair to accelerate mainstream acceptance à la the Apple Watch, I would be short sighted to rule out the possibility.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The category is a strange holding pattern, as Vue announces the launch of its $179 Lite glasses. The original Google Glass are far enough in the rearview to make references feel outdated, but the arrival of a truly revolutionary model still feels a long ways off. Intel abandoned its Vaunt project and North killed its second-generation Focals before getting scooped up by Google. Bose’s own project appears in jeopardy after it shuttered its AR division this June.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xSS90Iq7bf\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/vue/\">A passive take on smartglasses</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;A passive take on smartglasses&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/vue/embed/#?secret=xSS90Iq7bf\" data-secret=\"xSS90Iq7bf\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">When I first had some hands-on time with Vue’s original glasses back in October 2016 (a very different time to be sure), I was intrigued. The company was, notably, plagued by delays — certainly not an anomaly in the world of crowdfunding. “We apologize for the delays and wish we could be more timely. We don&#8217;t enjoy being late, but it can happen when developing a new product,” the company wrote in a recent post.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2034764\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2034764\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2034764\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2034764\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At the very least, it’s worth noting that the first project is almost always the most difficult for hardware startups, for obvious reasons. I can also tell you now that I’ve had a pair of the Vue Lite for about a week now, which I’ve been using off and on. So on that front, at least, they’re a real thing. They’re also simpler than their predecessors, which could help on that front.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s worth tempering your exceptions a bit, in terms of what to expect from a pair of smart glasses. The main features are music playback, through a pair of low-power speakers that fire directly at the air. Those replace the Vue Pro’s more advanced bone-conduction system. They are, be warned, pretty quiet, but the design does go a ways toward keeping you in tune with your environment, as they don’t cover the ear.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Each side features a simple touch control, used to control music playback, pick up phone calls and trigger voice assistant. Like the speaker, the microphone’s…not the best, but it gets the job done. I definitely wouldn’t use the Vue Lite as my primary music device, and probably not for too many important calls, either. But it’s nice enough when you’re on the move.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2034763\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2034763\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2034763\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2034763\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company’s swapped out the cool charging glasses case for simple conduction pads on either arm — each with their own battery that needs to be charged independently. You should be able to get around three-and-a-half hours of playback on a charge — an hour less than the Pros. They also drop some key features, including fitness tracking and Find My Glasses.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As for their look, they’re a bit boxy for my taste (though there are three styles available), though reasonably lightweight. You also can get them to ship with your prescription.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/RXCqsMtSuOU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 15:00:41 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg","linkMd5":"10815c6ac41f0685278742a407e35655","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn57@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-07-54-554_39fb0d51ba50905c.webp","destWidth":4000,"destHeight":3000,"sourceBytes":3190659,"destBytes":294080,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143021.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn57@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-07-54-554_39fb0d51ba50905c.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200821_143005.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-21-275_bee560c5a29b323b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/18-07-52-906_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-588_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/18-09-18-730_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-09-18-933_be0b734c479092e0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=RXCqsMtSuOU:PuPpgMcJds4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-786_5443547135d5ef7d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/25/18-09-19-756_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/RXCqsMtSuOU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_5/2020/08/25/18-09-19-724_c09c1b75ca191611.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598378872857},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:07:52","title":"Decrypted: Uber’s former security chief charged, FBI’s ‘vishing’ warning","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2035274","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A lot happened in cybersecurity over the past week.</p>\n<p>The University of Utah paid <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/university-of-utah-pays-457000-to-ransomware-gang/\">almost half a million dollars</a> to stop hackers from leaking sensitive student data after a ransomware attack.

Bali&#8217;s Carbon Health is a startup focused on creating a new standard for primary and urgent care, using modern clinics equipped with smart technology, as well as remote healthcare devices to enable a high standard of distanced clinical practice. Laraki&#8217;s Color, meanwhile, has adapted its population genomics platform and added COVID-19 testing as a core capability, with an eye to establishing and sharing best practices for high-volume diagnostics.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll talk about how healthcare has changed since the advent of the pandemic, and what it means for people looking to ensure that their primary care continues to be offered at a high level – without other problems falling through the cracks. We&#8217;ll also discuss Color&#8217;s experience working with the city of San Francisco to roll out its in-person testing capabilities, including providing crucial testing resources for primary care workers. We&#8217;ll also look ahead to what kind of challenges we&#8217;re still likely to face before the pandemic is over, and how it will change how we approach community and individual care for decades to come.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Both Carbon Health and Color are at the frontlines of COVID-19 testing during an unparalleled national and global emergency, and their insight will be invaluable for getting a sense of what&#8217;s going right and what&#8217;s going wrong with testing in the U.S., and where we go from here.
