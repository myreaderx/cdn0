Its blockchain derives from another altcoin – Litecoin. Dogecoin is most notable because it uses a scrypt algorithm. So, unlike Bitcoin, which has a maximum ceiling of 21 million mineable coins, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply. Thus, inflation in numbers drives down the price.</p><p>Dogecoin has been adopted primarily as part of a tipping system on Reddit to reward the creation or sharing of quality content within communities that use the currency. In addition to mining it yourself, you can also purchase coins or get them from a Dogecoin faucet. A faucet is a website that gives away a few coins at a time in \"drops” for free.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://bitpay.com/blog/content/images/2021/03/Dogecoin-Price-Chart.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Your Monthly Newsletter for All Things BitPay and Crypto\" srcset=\"https://bitpay.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Dogecoin-Price-Chart.png 600w, https://bitpay.com/blog/content/images/2021/03/Dogecoin-Price-Chart.png 624w\"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id=\"WProduct Spotlight: BlinkSky Gift Cards\"><span><br><br>Product Spotlight: BlinkSky Gift Cards</span></h2><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Looking for ways to integrate your business with BitPay?
