At 37 meters (121 feet) long, the cat is among the smaller geoglyphs in the desert; some of the largest shapes, down on the flat valley floor, span more than 500 meters (1,600 feet). Like other geoglyphs in the Nazca Desert, the cat’s ancient designers etched it into the ground by clearing away the dark surface sediment to form pale lines.</p>\n<p>Geoglyph finds usually take months of trekking through the desert or poring over aerial photos, but the latest one was a happy accident. Workers were making improvements to a path leading up to a hilltop vantage point when they noticed the cat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715622#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715622&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=-4t1iZIo5pE:Yut-AQQ4oT0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=-4t1iZIo5pE:Yut-AQQ4oT0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=-4t1iZIo5pE:Yut-AQQ4oT0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=-4t1iZIo5pE:Yut-AQQ4oT0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=-4t1iZIo5pE:Yut-AQQ4oT0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=-4t1iZIo5pE:Yut-AQQ4oT0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:51:31 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/catwhole-800x480.jpg","linkMd5":"d6f524c0d703e3b44daf4c0a5e6a0299","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn4@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-06-339_4b08f0e6d0dcc25b.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":480,"sourceBytes":74086,"destBytes":77320,"author":"Kiona N.

But there's a deeper reality here: SpaceX has made launching rockets almost seem routine. The company's vice president of reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, once told me that one of his goals was to take the \"magic\" out of rocket launches. And the company seems to be succeeding.</p>\n\n<p>SpaceX is also succeeding at reuse. Sunday morning's launch used a Falcon 9 first stage that has already flown into space five times. This is the second time SpaceX has used a first stage a total of six times, and next year it is likely to reach ten uses of its rocket. And then there is the payload fairing. For the first time, SpaceX was able use each of these fairing halves for a third time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715634#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1715634&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:21:07 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/50501515611_a29e04cb2e_k-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"f818c08a126b9632604ee1453e5bddc8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn6@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-06-324_07f9d54c2e7bb498.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":48733,"destBytes":33078,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/50501515611_a29e04cb2e_k-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn6@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-06-324_07f9d54c2e7bb498.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn13@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-07-523_d40dce3443ecda03.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=D5nVjoTFDH8:40KSC9Aeib4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn24@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-13-626_a5438fe8b3307ef4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-15-974_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn28@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-07-495_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123146118}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:06","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:06","feedId":45,"fetchDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:59:06 +0000","fetchMs":111,"handleMs":757,"totalMs":26785,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"3b520398b65f82a2a83818c2716ca970","hostName":"us-040*","requestId":"d06123c229c34c35952cac8772249d1c_45","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":112720,"bgimgsTotal":2,"bgimgsGithubTotal":2,"articlesImgsTotal":8,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":8,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx11":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx12":1,"myreaderx24":1,"myreaderx30":1,"myreaderx31":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:41","id":45,"name":"Science – Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/science","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn40@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-23-39-453_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
