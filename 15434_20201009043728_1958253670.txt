The system provides unrivaled upper body protection uniquely covering the rider’s shoulders, critical in motorcycling accidents, in addition to the chest, ribs and full back. The Tech-Air 5 Airbag System offers the most comprehensive coverage of any motorcycling airbag available today.</span></p> \n   <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/products/best-motorcycle-airbag-jackets\"><b>Best Motorcycle Airbag Jackets</b></a></p> \n   <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The state-of-the-art Tech-Air 5 System features six integrated sensors (3 gyroscopes and 3 accelerometers) to continuously monitor the rider’s position. An algorithm developed closely with MotoGP race data and data from over 2,000 lab-simulated crash scenarios determine when and how the system deploys. The airbag has a maximum inflation time of up to 40ms (or less, depending on vest size). The impact absorption while wearing the airbag results in a decrease of impact force by up to 95% compared to a passive chest or back protector. Inflation time is quick enough to deploy the airbag before the rider’s first impact with an obstacle. In addition, the vest will protect stationary riders in the event of a rear-end collision.</span></p> \n   <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The airbag has a battery life good for 30 hours of riding time on a single charge, and an LED display conveniently shows system status directly on the garment. The system features Bluetooth connectivity to pair with the Tech-Air App, which uses the rider’s phone to display the system’s operational status, battery status and provide detailed analysis of a ride. Over-the-air firmware updates are also handled through the app. Alpinestars includes a micro USB charger for quick recharging.</span></p> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"vs-product-cta\"> \n   <a class=\"vs-product-url\" href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8442785/type/dlg/sid/vs-motorcycle-Best-Motorcycle-Jacket/https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/alpinestars-tech-air-5-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shop Now</a> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"vs-product-card\"> \n  <a class=\"vs-product-title-wrap\" href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8442785/type/dlg/sid/vs-motorcycle-Best-Motorcycle-Jacket/https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/schott-118-perfecto-jacket?sku_id=956726\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <h2 class=\"vs-product-title\" id=\"leather-jackets-schott-perfecto-825\">Leather Jackets – Schott Perfecto $825</h2> </a> \n  <a class=\"vs-product-image-url\" href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8442785/type/dlg/sid/vs-motorcycle-Best-Motorcycle-Jacket/https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/schott-118-perfecto-jacket?sku_id=956726\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"vs-product-image\" src=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/032019-best-Leather-motorcycle-jackets-schott-perfecto-633x388.jpg\"> </img></a> \n  <div class=\"vs-product-description\">\n   <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember the jacket Marlon Brando wore in “The Wild One”? This is it. The Original. The Perfecto, by Schott. The grandaddy of them all, Schott and Brando defined the leather motorcycle genre with this jacket. Constructed from U. S. sourced, drum dyed, hand cut, heavyweight 3-3.5 oz. steerhide leather, the Perfecto is the standard to which others have followed. For example, take the offset zipper and slash cut front zip pocket. The Roland Sands jacket above has the same design, as do many other jackets from nearly every manufacturer. Another signature Schott design is the huge back panel design, but other signature touches include the snap-down lapels and attached belt with nickel plated buckle. There’s not actually any armor or padding inside, but for many people, we imagine this is a non-issue.</span></p> \n   <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.motorcycle.com/products/best-leather-motorcycle-jackets\"><b>Best Leather Motorcycle Jackets</b></a></p> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"vs-product-cta\"> \n   <a class=\"vs-product-url\" href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8442785/type/dlg/sid/vs-motorcycle-Best-Motorcycle-Jacket/https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/schott-118-perfecto-jacket?sku_id=956726\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shop Now</a> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"vs-product-card\"> \n  <a class=\"vs-product-title-wrap\" href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8442785/type/dlg/sid/vs-motorcycle-Best-Motorcycle-Jacket/https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/revit-sand-3-jacket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <h2 class=\"vs-product-title\" id=\"textile-jackets-revit-sand-3-500\">Textile Jackets – REV’IT!

Seeflex CE Level 2 protection is included at the shoulders and elbows, while the jacket can accept the optional Seesoft Back Protector-Type RV.
