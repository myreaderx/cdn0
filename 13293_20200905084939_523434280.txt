It&#8217;s the Internet&#8217;s fundamental &#8220;control system&#8221; and it&#8217;s really two systems in one. In the computer world, a &#8220;protocol&#8221; is simply a standard way of doing things—a tried and trusted method that everybody follows to ensure things get done properly. So what do TCP and IP actually do? </span></i><b><i>Internet Protocol (IP)</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is simply the Internet&#8217;s addressing system. All the machines on the Internet [&#8230;] are identified by an Internet Protocol (IP) address that takes the form of a series of digits separated by dots or colons. If all the machines have numeric addresses, every machine knows exactly how (and where) to contact every other machine. When it comes to websites, we usually refer to them by easy-to-remember names (like www.explainthatstuff.com) rather than their actual IP addresses—and there&#8217;s a relatively simple system called </span></i><b><i>DNS (Domain Name System)</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that enables a computer to look up the IP address for any given website. In the original version of IP, known as IPv4, addresses consisted of four pairs of digits, such as 12.34.56.78 or 123.255.212.55, but the rapid growth in Internet use meant that all possible addresses were used up by January 2011. That has prompted the introduction of a new IP system with more addresses, which is known as IPv6, where each address is much longer and looks something like this: 123a:b716:7291:0da2:912c:0321:0ffe:1da2. The other part of the control system, </span></i><b><i>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</i></b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sorts out how packets of data move back and forth between one computer (in other words, one IP address) and another. It&#8217;s TCP that figures out how to get the data from the source to the destination, arranging for it to be broken into packets, transmitted, resent if they get lost, and reassembled into the correct order at the other end.</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we have seen, DNS is a hierarchical system that helps translate the human language into a computer comprehensible one, by taking 5 main steps: request, root server query, Top Level Domain (TLD) Query, Domain’s Name Server Query. A detailed explanation about these steps can be found in Kaleb Fornero’s paper, </span><a href=\"https://www.giac.org/paper/gcia/11579/there-monitoring-dns-misuse/135372#__utma=247151638.827624767.1594037241.1597044907.1598360146.7&#38;__utmb=247151638.2.9.1598360169750&#38;__utmc=247151638&#38;__utmx=-&#38;__utmz=247151638.1594037241.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)%7Cutmccn=(direct)%7Cutmcmd=(none)&#38;__utmv=-&#38;__utmk=178526119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is Anyone Out There?

Monitoring DNS for Misuse</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you must remember, though, is the fact that up to 91.3% of the threats are located at the DNS level, since </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cybercriminals need to communicate with their malware in order to make a profit</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ergo, DNS is a very important component of your network in terms of cybersecurity and should not be trifled with. You can also find more information about its significance in other articles on our blog &#8211; </span><a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/secure-dns-and-dnssec/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/dns-spoofing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/dns-security-for-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DNS content filtering refers to the process in which an Internet filter allows or blocks access to a specific website’s content according to its IP address and not to the domain name. Some filters use default operations, others are administrator-controlled. Among the DNS content filtering methods we mention: </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Category filters </span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Category filters allow administrators to block access according to the nature of the websites’ content (for example racial hatred, pornography etc.)</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword filters </span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword filters allow blocking access to certain websites or web applications by specific words found in the websites’ content (here we mention “chat” or “Netflix, for example). </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Administrator-controlled Blacklists and Whitelists </span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blacklists and Whitelists offer personalized DNS content filtering, since the access to specific websites is entirely determined by the administrator. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can DNS content filtering benefit your business? </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well&#8230;I would start with the obvious: it can help you prevent malware, ransomware and phishing attacks (you remember that part with the 91.3% of the threats being located at DNS level, correct?). Moreover, DNS content filtering can help increase productivity, reduce HR issues and ensure a safer browser experience. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What type of DNS attacks can you expect if you’re not using DNS content filtering? </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to the types of attack your company can become the target of,  you should know that there are dozens of possible threats that can get into your organisation in the blink of an eye, anytime and anywhere, causing you to lose money, data, time. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subdomain attacks </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attackers could try to overload authoritative name servers with queries for unexistent subdomains (111aaa.example.com instead of example.com, for instance), consuming its resources and causing disruption to legitimate queries. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cache poisoning</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cache poisoning attacks aim to corrupt the recursive servers, more specifically the answers stored in the cache. If they succeed, any subsequent query will get the corrupted answer. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phantom Domain </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phantom Domain attacks also involve authoritative servers and imply asking for non-existent recursive name servers, which wastes the server’s time and fills up the cache with useless answers. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Malware</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hackers need to maintain communication in order to make a profit, and one certain way of obtaining it is through DNS. Malware uses DNS to communicate with the command-and-control server, but also to update itself, like the famous </span><a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/wannacry-ransomware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WannaCry ransomware</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hijacking and redirection </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this type of attack, users are sent to a different destination than they intended. Similarly, the target client machine could be infected with malware that would allow all DNS requests to be sent to the DNS server under the attacker’s control. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data exfiltration / tunnelling </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tunnelling involves encoding messages in DNS queries and answers in order to avoid detection. Tunnelling can be used for legitimate purposes, but also to exfiltrate sensitive data, in which case the ever-changing domain names make it very hard to detect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have caught a glimpse of how dangerous DNS attacks can be, you might be asking yourself what you can do to protect your business. Well&#8230;you have two options. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Use free DNS content filtering for business to achieve a basic level of protection</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dansguardian </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dansguardian can run on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS, HP-UX, Solaris and is highly configurable, allowing you to filter ads and block images or files from being downloaded. Different filters can be deployed for different computers according to the domain, user and source IP. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">K9</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">K9, a solution generally used in schools, divides the filtered content into 60+ categories. It is a desktop solution which, after installation, checks all the requests you make against the specified filters. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open DNS </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenDNS is a DNS content filtering tool suitable for those who do not have the time or expertise to set up and administer a full-out content-filtering server. It requires you to change the DNS settings at the router level, customizing white lists and black lists sites and the range of filters they provide for you. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Squid Gard </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like Dansguard, Squid Gard is a stand-alone DNS content filtering tool that can be connected into a </span><a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/glossary#P\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proxy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a go-between a computer and the Internet, used to enhance cyber safety because they prevent attackers from invading a computer/a private network directly). It is a UNIX-environment tool and a very flexible solution, which allows you to make up various combinations of filtering parameters.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clean Browsing DNS  </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re also wondering how you can filter adult content through DNS, Clean Browsing would be a pretty good free tool. Its basic security filter blocks malicious content, while the adult filter blocks pornographic and explicit websites. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SafeSurfer </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same context, you can try SafeSurfer, a New Zealand service that seems to be supported by voluntary donations. SafeSurfer offers desktop applications for Windows, Mac and Linux, but also mobile applications for Android and iOS. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.

However, it is more than clear that the Coronavirus pandemic refuses to die down (for now), which means that remote learning is still very much on the table in 2020-2021.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-16796\"></span></p>\n<p>While some schools are attempting a fulltime return to their teaching spaces, others are adopting a hybrid model that will see students come to class on certain days and learn from home on others. In terms of cybersecurity, <strong>this poses new issues for institutions and students alike</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the following lines, I will first and foremost discuss how the educational sector is affected by cyberattacks. Then, I aim to provide both educational staff and their students with the information they need to handle these matters more proactively in the school year to come.</p>\n<h2>Cyberattacks in the Educational Sector: An Overview</h2>\n<p>The K-12 Cybersecurity Resource Center has been monitoring cyberattacks that target American schools, kindergarten through 12<sup>th</sup> grade, since January 2016. At the moment of my writing of this article, <a href=\"https://k12cybersecure.com/map/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">958 incidents</a> of this sort have been registered. To put the situation into perspective even more, the total rose by 6 over the weekend.</p>\n<p>What is more, the total number of operations aimed at K-12 schools alone tripled in 2019. When we take universities into account as well, the statistics are even more desolate. In 2019, several high-profile universities in Europe and the United States alike fell prey to vicious malware and ransomware strains like <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/emotet-malware-history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emotet</a> or <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/netwalker-ransomware-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Netwalker</a>. The Columbia College of Chicago and the Humboldt University of Berlin are just a few of the affected institutions of this kind.</p>\n<p>What goes on behind these online threats? Why are our schools and universities so vulnerable online? In the sections below, I will talk about the most prevalent types of cyberattacks schools are faced with, as well as their palpable consequences and the reasons why hackers target such institutions.</p>\n<h3><strong>Prevalent Types of Cyberattacks on Schools</strong></h3>\n<p>For our readers with experience in the educational sector, it might come as no surprise that unauthorized disclosure breaches are the most widely encountered type of cyberattack plaguing the world’s schools. More often than not, hackers are after your data and money, and do you know which institutions have plenty of that on record? If you shouted ‘schools’ at the screen, you were spot on.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, attackers have a few more threats under their malicious tool belt, and they’re always waiting for an opportunity to throw them at our schools. According to the K-12 Cybersecurity Resource Center’s <a href=\"https://k12cybersecure.com/year-in-review/2019-incidents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2019 Year in Review</a>, the number for the previous year go as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>60.06%</strong> consisted of <strong>data breaches</strong>,</li>\n<li><strong>17.82%</strong> consisted of <strong>ransomware attacks</strong>,</li>\n<li><strong>8.05%</strong> consisted of <strong>phishing campaigns</strong>,</li>\n<li>and<strong> 1.15%</strong> consisted of <strong>denial of service</strong>,</li>\n<li>while <strong>other incidents</strong> made up <strong>12.93%.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16798 aligncenter\" src=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/k12-stats-piechart-2.png\" alt=\"K-12 Cybersecurity Stats for 2019\" width=\"658\" height=\"427\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://k12cybersecure.com/2018-year-in-review/2018-incidents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The K-12 Cybersecurity Research Center</a></em></p>\n<p>This differed slightly from the statistics gathered by the center in its <a href=\"https://k12cybersecure.com/2018-year-in-review/2018-incidents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2018 Year in Review</a>, when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>46,72%</strong> consisted of <strong>data breaches</strong>,</li>\n<li><strong>15.57%</strong> consisted of <strong>phishing campaigns</strong>,</li>\n<li><strong>9.84%</strong> consisted of <strong>denial of service</strong>,</li>\n<li>and<strong> 9.02%</strong> consisted of <strong>ransomware attacks</strong>,</li>\n<li>while <strong>other incidents</strong> made up <strong>18.85%.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16797 aligncenter\" src=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/k12-stats-piechart-1.png\" alt=\"K-12 Cybersecurity Stats for 2018\" width=\"650\" height=\"435\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image Source: <a href=\"https://k12cybersecure.com/2018-year-in-review/2018-incidents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The K-12 Cybersecurity Research Center</a></em></p>\n<p>As you can conclude from the statistics above, data breaches held the majority in 2018 and 2019 alike. However, the notable difference stands in the fact that ransomware attacks surpassed phishing in frequency in 2019, <strong>outlining a trend</strong> in the industry.</p>\n<h3><strong>Common Effects of Cyberattacks on Schools </strong></h3>\n<p>The social and financial damages a cyberattack can inflict on an educational institution can be quite extensive if the threat is not mitigated on time. Here are a few significant ways in which a hacking operation can affect such an establishment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>corruption of school property,</strong></li>\n<li><strong>misuse of credentials, </strong></li>\n<li><strong>student record theft,</strong></li>\n<li><strong>interruption of operations,</strong></li>\n<li>and<strong> financial extortion. </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Why Do Cybercriminals Target Schools? </strong></h3>\n<p>As per Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Security Intelligence Report</a> displaying monthly data, around 60% of malware attacks were directed towards the educational sector, making it by far the most affected field. For reference, second place is held by business and professional services, with a mere 10%. Let that sink in for a while.</p>\n<p>So, what makes schools such attractive targets for hackers? Well, a few things. In terms of gains, there are three main reasons why malicious groups pursue educational facilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Financial benefits, </strong>which remain the main driving force behind more than 70% of the world’s total cyberattacks, according to <a href=\"https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/2019/summary-of-findings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Verizon’s yearly Data Breach Investigations Report</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Personally-identifiable information (PII), </strong>which abounds in the databases of schools and universities and comes from a variety of sources (students, alumni, or staff).</li>\n<li><strong>Confidential research data, </strong>which contains secret martial or governmental information that both state-affiliated and independent malicious actors want to get their hands on. For example, in 2019 Chinese hackers attacked <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-hackers-target-university-of-hawaii-mit-and-other-schools-in-pursuit-of-military-secrets-2019-03-05\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several high-profile universities in the US</a> looking for classified maritime military research.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for the main reasons for which school networks are so accessible to cybercrime operations, here are a few notable ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lack of cybereducation. </strong>While it is expected of companies to train their employees in terms of online safety, this is impractical for schools that see hundreds of new students each year.</li>\n<li><strong>Improper on-site protection. </strong>Large campuses make it especially easy for ill-intentioned strangers to infiltrate, then hack the perimeter or plant infected devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Precarious cybersecurity. </strong>In SecurityScorecard’s <a href=\"https://explore.securityscorecard.com/rs/797-BFK-857/images/SSC-EducationReport-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2018 Education Cybersecurity Report</a>, the educational sector ranked the lowest among all other industries that were analyzed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Essential Institution-Level Cybersecurity Priorities</h2>\n<p>Whether you want your students to return to class five days a week or are a fan of the hybrid model, you should always remember that having a proper cybersecurity policy is essential in these times. Below, I will discuss five concrete priorities in this field you should set for your institution in 2020-2021.</p>\n<h3><strong>Threat Awareness Training</strong></h3>\n<p>As previously mentioned, security awareness is not too prevalent in schools and universities around the globe. Most educational facilities do not consider this field one worth investing time, money, and other resources in. However, the state of the current online landscape says they should.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2020/03/fake-phishing-emails-expose-need-cybersecurity-training\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kim Griffin</a>, the technical director for Mississippi’s Clinton Public School District performed an experiment in March of 2020 after noticing an alarming increase in phishing-related incidents. Together with her team, she set up a fake Gmail account riddled with red flags such as spelling errors. From it, they sent out emails that contained a link to a survey that required login with Google credentials.</p>\n<p>What they found indicated a clear lack of cybereducation among staff in the educational sector. Out of a total of <strong>572 fake phishing emails</strong> that were sent out, <strong>474 were opened</strong> by recipients. The most concerning part is yet to come, as <strong>272 members of staff clicked</strong> <strong>the link</strong> in the email and <strong>113 provided their login credentials</strong>. As a bonus, <strong>45 people disclosed personal information</strong> on a public Google sheet.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, while Kim Griffin’s awareness campaign was a faux-threat, actual security breaches occurred over the years due to poorly trained staff and naïve students. For this reason, investing in cybersecurity seminars for staff and students alike should be an essential priority for your institution. Something as simple as teaching people to identify a fake Gmail account can prevent a large-scale malware attack that can have dire consequences in the long run.</p>\n<h3><strong>Privileged Access Management </strong></h3>\n<p>Hackers commonly employ the escalation of network privileges to reach multiple machines within the same organization. This is why insider threats are more than dangerous than ever, and also why you should always practice the <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/what-is-the-principle-of-least-privilege/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">principle of least privilege (POLP)</a> among personnel. This won’t allow them more resources than strictly necessary to perform their daily duties.</p>\n<p>Of course, you should apply POLP to the student body as well, especially now that remote learning is more widespread than ever. While the risk of this is lower in K-12 education, it is higher in the case of universities (for obvious reasons). To prevent hacking attempts among undergraduates, you should also enforce network segmentation. This prevents lateral and horizontal privilege escalation.</p>\n<p>For a more holistic approach to <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/privileged-access-management/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">privileged access management</a>, I recommend our very own <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/products/thor-adminprivilege-pam-solution?partner=Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thor AdminPrivilege<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>. Being the only PAM solution on the market that also de-escalates privileges upon threat detection or infection, it will ensure that this matter is properly mitigated within any institution.</p>\n<p><em><div class=\"blog-action shortcode\"><div class=\"shortcode-background-image\"><img src=\"\" /></div>    <div class=\"new-cta ap-e blog-action shortcode\">\n        <div class=\"new-cta-main-container shortcode-main-container\">\n            <div class=\"logo-area\">\n                <a target=\"__blank\" href=\"https://www.heimdalsecurity.com\"><img src=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/heimdal-blog-cro/img/heimdal_blue_logo.svg\"\n                        alt=\"Heimdal Official Logo\"></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"cta-separator\"></div>\n            <div class=\"upper-title\">\n                <p>System admins waste 30% of their time manually managing user rights or installations.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"product-title\">\n                <h2>Thor AdminPrivilege&#8482;</h2>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"sub-title\">\n               is the automatic Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution <br />\n                    which frees up huge chunks of sys-admin time.\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"list\">\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Automate the elevation of admin rights on request;</li>\n                    <li>Approve or reject escalations with one click;</li>\n                    <li>Provide a full audit trail into user behavior;</li>\n                    <li>Automatically de-escalate on infection;</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"button\">\n                <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/products/thor-adminprivilege?partner=blog\">Try it for\n                    FREE today</a>\n                <span>Offer valid only for companies.</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"footer-bg\"></div>\n        </div>\n    </div></div></em></p>\n<h3><strong>Remote Account Security</strong></h3>\n<p>While essential staff members are returning to their posts, students also re-enter classrooms for the first time since this spring. Nevertheless, this doesn’t mean that you should neglect remote access security matters in the school year to come. Remote learning will probably remain a big part of the educational landscape in 2021, especially since everyone must still be sent home within minutes of the first COVID-19 case.</p>\n<p>For this reason, securing the remote access points to the school network is essential. Fortunately, this can easily be achieved through a <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/online-privacy-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</a>. This will offer users a safe passage to the documents that they need to access, and it will encrypt the information they share in the system as well.</p>\n<h3><strong>Multiple Layers of Cybersecurity </strong></h3>\n<p>Phishing emails containing malware are just one of the many threats a school can face online. As shown by the data I presented at the beginning of this article, data breaches, ransomware infections, and DNS-level attacks are just the most widely encountered concerns you should have in this field.</p>\n<p>For this reason, having multiple layers of cybersecurity within your organization is essential, which is where we here at Heimdal come in to help. Combining the next-generation antivirus properties of <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/products/thor-vigilance-enterprise-antivirus-software?partner=Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thor Vigilance</a> and the advanced threat prevention features offered by <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/products/thor-foresight-enterprise-cybersecurity-solution?partner=Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thor Foresight</a>, our <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/products/thor-premium-enterprise-endpoint-security-software?partner=Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thor Premium Enterprise</a> can cover all bases for your school’s needs.</p>\n<p>Its inbuilt firewall protects against potential brute force attacks, while local and real-time cloud scanning detects any malicious visitors to your network.

This is why outlining a Doomsday Plan for the school will make a difference between a small crisis and an enormous catastrophe. Does your institution have one?</p>\n<p>If not, here are a few things you should consider doing proactively as part of it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>backup essential data offline,</strong></li>\n<li><strong>monitor network traffic, </strong></li>\n<li>and <strong>activate two-factor authentication. </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for what you can do reactively, consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>shut down the network,</strong></li>\n<li><strong>identify the infection point, </strong></li>\n<li><strong>reset infected machines,</strong></li>\n<li><strong>change passwords,</strong></li>\n<li>and <strong>notify the authorities. </strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Having an immediate response is essential for the proper mitigation of any cyberattack. As little as a couple of minutes can completely change the outcome of the situation.</p>\n<h2>How to Mitigate Remote Learning Risks at Home</h2>\n<p>Not an educator? Students (and their parents) also play a crucial role in the mitigation of the cybersecurity risks associated with remote learning. Here is how you can play your part in strengthening your school’s online safety with five easy-to-follow steps.</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Learn How to Recognize Malicious URLs</strong></h3>\n<p>Although phishing has decreased in popularity over the years, hackers still love themselves a bit of <strong>malspam</strong>. For this reason, every student should be able to recognize a malicious link or a malware attachment in an email.</p>\n<p>While it is true that hackers are becoming more and more refined in their spam campaigns, more often than not corrupt URLs will have at least one giveaway. A <strong>different domain</strong> (dotnet instead of dotcom, for example) is the first sign of bad news. Other, less perceptible clues are <strong>slight variations</strong> in spelling, as well as <strong>extra or missing hyphens</strong>.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Never Disclose Any Personal Information</strong></h3>\n<p>If you ever receive an email asking you to reveal personal or financial information, move it straight to the Trash folder. <strong>Organizations seldom ask for such data</strong> over the Internet. You most likely already know this if you’ve reached college age, but younger students might be easier prey to this ruse.</p>\n<p>To verify the legitimacy of a request sent over email, you can always contact the institution or company that sent it. This will drag the process (if any) on for a little while more, but your information security should be a higher priority in this day and age.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Activate Your Webcam Sparingly (or Not at All)</strong></h3>\n<p>Did you know that <strong>your computer’s camera might be your biggest vulnerability</strong> during the pandemic? As more and more of us are moving our daily activities (i.e. school) to Zoom or other video streaming platforms, attackers are not indifferent. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.wizcase.com/blog/webcam-security-research/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 15,000 webcams worldwide</a> are exposed to hackers to exploit. And those are just the ones that don’t require too much hard work to crack.</p>\n<p>For this reason, I always recommend turning your webcam on only when it’s absolutely mandatory. But even so, you might be targeted, as skilled cybercriminals can still access it remotely. When in doubt, <strong>covering it is the best option</strong>. Even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/22/mark-zuckerberg-tape-webcam-microphone-facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> does it, and he tapes over his microphone too. Take a page out of the richest millennial’s book on this one, even if your friends laugh and call you paranoid.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Always Keep Your Software Up to Date </strong></h3>\n<p>Updates are deployed to <strong>fix flaws in design</strong> and <strong>patch software vulnerabilities</strong>. Constantly postponing them opens gateways for malware, ransomware, and other malicious operations that can steal your data and inflict financial damage as well.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you should always install updates on all your Internet-connected devices (laptop, smartphone, tablet) as soon as they are sent out by the developers. This doesn’t have to be a disruptive affair either, as you can easily schedule them outside of school hours.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Install an Antivirus Optimized for Home Use</strong></h3>\n<p>The final and arguably most effective step to achieve at-home cybersecurity is to install <strong>antivirus software</strong> if you don’t have one already. Fortunately, this doesn’t have to be a costly affair, as there are quite a few free ones available online. For example, our <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/products/thor-free-software-updater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thor Free</a> automatically updates vulnerable applications, a necessity in this day and age (that I’ve covered at point 4).</p>\n<p>Still, if you want to be completely safe out there and close all potential gateways, you will need more than a basic piece of software. As cyber-threats are becoming increasingly robust, so should your home security. My recommendation here is <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/products/thor-premium-home?partner=Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thor Premium Home</a>, an all-in-one suite of cybersecurity tools that combines the functionalities of <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/products/thor-vigilance-home?partner=Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vigilance</a> and <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/products/thor-foresight-home?partner=Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foresight</a> (home edition). Try out for 30 days (on us) and see how you like it.</p>\n<h2>To Sum It Up…</h2>\n<p>This new school year will see the world’s youth learning from school and home alike, which comes with its own set of challenges. Nevertheless, having the proper training and tools on hand will greatly enhance your online safety regardless of the location. In 2020-2021, protecting essential institutional data will fall in the hands of students and staff alike.</p>\n<p><em><div class=\"blog-action shortcode\"><div class=\"shortcode-background-image\"><img src=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/subscribe-newsletter.jpg\" /></div><img class=\"shortcode-logo\" src=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/heimdal-simple-logo.png\" alt=\"Heimdal Official logo\" />\n<div class=\"shortcode-main-container newsletter\">\n<div class=\"shortcode-title text-center oversized\">If you liked this post, you will enjoy our newsletter.</div>\n<div class=\"shortcode-subtitle text-center oversized\">Receive new articles directly in your inbox</div>\n<div class=\"shortcode-content\">\n<div class=\"col-md-12 nopadding\"><form id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" class=\"validate\" action=\"https://heimdalsecurity.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9588e79f21453dd8e52df4d68&#38;id=31fbbb3dbf\" method=\"post\" name=\"mc-embedded-subscribe-form\" novalidate=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><input id=\"mce-EMAIL\" name=\"EMAIL\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Enter your email address\" />\n<input id=\"mc-embedded-subscribe\" class=\"button\" name=\"subscribe\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Email me with updates\" /></form></div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</div></div></em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/cybersecurity-essentials-for-schools/\">Schools Are Moving to Remote Lessons: Cybersecurity Essentials for Schools</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog\">Heimdal Security Blog</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 14:46:07 +0000","feedId":13293,"bgimg":"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/k12-stats-piechart-2.png","linkMd5":"df9b7664f3a229eb3cb2f92985e580fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn68@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-48-55-620_827225fe2194cdb1.webp","destWidth":658,"destHeight":427,"sourceBytes":10163,"destBytes":15310,"author":"Alina Georgiana Petcu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/k12-stats-piechart-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn68@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-48-55-620_827225fe2194cdb1.webp","https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/k12-stats-piechart-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn91@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-48-57-643_148110252c324fa1.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-48-55-103_4c588b7010642f04.webp","https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/heimdal-blog-cro/img/heimdal_blue_logo.svg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn7@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-48-57-177_6220064c8868a53b.svg","https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/subscribe-newsletter.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn3@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-48-57-199_c22ede6755261bd6.webp","https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/heimdal-simple-logo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn100@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-49-38-468_a9356155e05390c7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295734960},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:48:54","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:48:54","title":"Your Blood Work Results May Contain Too Much Sensitive Information","link":"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/?p=16769","description":"<p>A few days ago, we found a scrap of paper outside our office in Copenhagen. It was highly visible from a distance that there were blood work results. Looking at it, it just hit us that there is simply too much personally identifiable information on those results to just leave them lying around.</p>\n<p>But this doesn’t mean that it’s the individual’s fault for not taking care of their papers better. Anyone can make a mistake and lose or misplace a paper scrap. The system that delivers blood test results in this manner should be better.</p>\n<h2>How Much Personal Data Is Contained in Blood Work Results and Why Is It Dangerous?</h2>\n<p>To give you a clue, this is how the blood work results we found in front of our office in Copenhagen looked like. We edited the image to remove personally identifiable data, of course:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_16771\" style=\"width: 615px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\" wp-image-16771\" src=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unavngivet.png\" alt=\"blood work results Danish\" width=\"605\" height=\"420\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Redacted photo of blood test results we found next to our office in Copenhagen.</em></p></div>\n<p>As you can see, there were plenty of fields here that contained pretty much everything there is to know about a person. This is not only a potential GDPR breach considering that all of this info is written on paper in the same place (instead of being stored separately, on a need to know basis), but also highly dangerous in the wrong hands.</p>\n<p>A malicious hacker can use all that personal data for a wide variety of purposes, none of them in your favor, of course. From contracting bank credit in your name to issuing false papers via <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/how-to-prevent-identity-theft-20-steps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">identity theft</a>, from <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/deep-web-vs-dark-web-what-is-each/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">selling your personal data on the dark web</a> to downright <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/doxxing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doxing</a> or simply <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/hacked-email-why-cyber-criminals-want-inbox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">using your email address</a> to initiate further online attacks, including <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/credential-stuffing-attack-protection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">credential stuffing attacks</a> for getting into some of your more valuable accounts, there are plenty of dangerous things to be done with your personal information should it fall into the wrong hands.</p>\n<h2>How Should Authorities Handle Data from Blood Work Results Better?</h2>\n<p>It’s true that the regular individual isn’t probably aware of all the trouble a malicious hacker can make for them if they gain access to such a treasure trove of personal information. Perhaps that is also why some people can be slightly careless with their test results. That’s normal and to be expected to some degree.</p>\n<p>But the real responsibility towards protecting your data lies with the authorities who make the rules and design the system. Data protection is something taken way more seriously since <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GDPR</a>, of course, but it needs to happen for offline data as well, not just for online data.</p>\n<p>For example, the test results could only contain the medical conclusions and the last four letters of your patient code and not everything about you written down explicitly. That personal data could be stored only in the lab’s digital data banks and accessible with the patient number.</p>\n<p>Of course, that’s just one idea. There are plenty of other ways in which the current system can be improved towards better data protection. There is even an official <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">collection of HIPAA guidelines for the anonymization of blood work results</a> and patient data. But until all that is properly applied to offline documents as well, stay safe and be careful what you do with your blood work results.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/blood-work-results-sensitive-information/\">Your Blood Work Results May Contain Too Much Sensitive Information</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog\">Heimdal Security Blog</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 10:00:49 +0000","feedId":13293,"bgimg":"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unavngivet.png","linkMd5":"20868cc2bd3a6dcfc893beecaa0b0970","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-48-55-999_011f1e617b6084e5.webp","destWidth":1134,"destHeight":787,"sourceBytes":239245,"destBytes":51648,"author":"Miriam Cihodariu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unavngivet.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-48-55-999_011f1e617b6084e5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295734959},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:48:54","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:48:54","title":"Heimdal™ Security in 2021: Outlying the Continued Growth Strategy and Market Predictions","link":"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/?p=16856","description":"<p>Copenhagen – September 4<sup>th,</sup> 2020 – Heimdal<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Security (HEIMDAL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />) announced today its vision for the company’s strategy for 2021, some major developments they are working on, and an outline of the cybersecurity market.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-16856\"></span></p>\n<p>Hand in hand with their fervent growth in revenue and number of customers, HEIMDAL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> has expanded its research and development teams quite a lot, especially since the company focused heavily on innovation since its founding.

This will improve the already top-of-the-line technology and elevate it to new heights. As malicious actors are refining their tactics, so must the intelligence of defensive systems.</p>\n<h2>Greater Focus on More Complex Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>\n<p>Already since the beginning of 2020, a greater focus is being driven within the company’s efforts for improving the AI and ML power behind their smart detection technologies. Heimdal<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> is targeting to launch a perfected AI algorithm for the uniquely intelligent E-PDR (Endpoint Prevention, Detection, and Response), the company’s improved EDR suite.</p>\n<p>The next product to benefit from the discernable difference made by more complex neural networks trained on a huge variety of intelligence vectors will be the MailSentry Email Security solution. Following in the footsteps of the tremendous success of the Predictive DNS recently launched, Heimdal<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> will continue to put clearly defined and well-trained AI systems to good use in their uniquely proactive suite of cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions.</p>\n<h2>Automated Software Patching and Asset Management Continues to Play a Central Role</h2>\n<p>Within HEIMDAL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />’s unique offering, automated software patching will continue to be of the utmost importance. Sadly, companies who are not automating updates are still likely to become targets for vulnerability exploits, especially as the organization grows.</p>\n<p>HEIMDAL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> is already very strong in the niche of automated software patching and asset management, due to the flawless speed and ease of operation of all installs and updates, regardless of endpoint location. Nevertheless, the automated software patching and inventory management solutions will continue to be improved. HEIMDAL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> is expanding the product engine to incorporate even more seamless integrations with new apps and platforms, IPXE support and other key partnerships that will make any patching and installation issues a thing of the past.</p>\n<h2>Privileged Access Management Will Continue to Benefit from a Strong Focus as Well</h2>\n<p>The same can be said of Privileged Access Management (PAM), a relatively new addition to the company’s strong product lineup but a field in which HEIMDAL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> is already making a tremendous difference for companies who adopted the solution.

This effectively makes it not just the easiest to deploy and use, but also the PAM solution which offers the highest degree of security against the insider threat, data leaks, and so on.</p>\n<p>With the continued focus of HEIMDAL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> experts and developers into improving the product even further, HEIMDAL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />’s PAM solution will acquire even more capabilities and unique advantages until the end of 2021.</p>\n<h2>Threat Analytics and Forensics Ready to Go to Market in 2021</h2>\n<p>HEIMDAL<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> is already making headlines as having the most varied product offering, all neatly tucked into a unified dashboard that provides a unique level of flexibility, visibility, and scalability. In 2021, this will get even better as the company is committed to bringing an even higher degree of advanced threat analytics to customers, within its new and improved dashboard to be launched soon.

Outdated and unpatched apps are not only useless (i.e. good luck firing up a pdf reader if it’s outdated), but, as I pointed out, they’re like big “Welcome” mats for hackers who would like nothing more than to steal your company’s data.</p>\n<p>But you already know that and, if you’ve been in business (whatever business) longer than you care to recall, you probably know better than to incur the wrath of your sysadmin.</p>\n<p>So, for all sysadmins there, burning the midnight oil just to keep your endpoints in tip-top shape, and making sure that none of your precious data leaks out, here’s some open-source patch management software to make your life easier. Sit back, take five, and enjoy. Hope it’s your cup of tea.</p>\n<h2>Why do you need patch management software?</h2>\n<p>Short answer: “because it’s the norm and you can’t do without”. Not the answer you were looking for? Allow me then to be more explicit. According to <a href=\"https://threatpost.com/how-to-handle-patch-management/147909/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ThreatPost</a>, more than 80% of enterprises have at least one outdated or unpatched application.</p>\n<p>How much is that in numbers? Well, the same article mentions that last year alone, more than 16,000 patch-related vulnerabilities have been identified. By now, they would have had multiplied exponentially. So, what happens when someone finally decides to deal with this ‘unpatchiness’? Truth be told, it does happen – eventually.</p>\n<p>The same article suggests that the patching process can take two or even three months. It’s not very hard to imagine what could happen during this time. That would be one of the reasons why you need patch management in your life.</p>\n<p>The second most important reason is automation; true automation that spells out speed, quality, and scalability. If you’re the type that likes to keep a small family business (i.e. two-three devices), using patch management apps doesn’t make sense. However, the same thing cannot be said about an SMB or an enterprise.</p>\n<p>We already covered this aspect, so there’s no point in repeating it. To sum everything up, you need patch management software for security reasons, true automation, and because you’re only human. Personally, the real question at hand is: “is it worth it?” It is, but you’ll probably need some convincing.</p>\n<p>Now, if your company doesn’t have the necessary liquidities to invest in full-fledged patch management software, you can try out one or more of the solutions listed here. As the title suggests, all of them are open-source and can be modified based on your needs and number of endpoints. So, without further ado-ado, here are 7 open-source patch management software you should try out.</p>\n<h2>7 Best Open-Source Patch Management Software</h2>\n<p>Let’s get started.</p>\n<h3>1) <a href=\"https://one.comodo.com/new/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Comodo ONE Windows Patch Management</a></h3>\n<p>The first item’s on today’s menu is Comodo’s ONE Windows Patch Management, an open-source and free-for-all management tool that allows you to deploy Microsoft Windows updates and patches. Despite its free availability, Comodo’s ONE offers some powerful features.</p>\n<p>For instance, the tool allows admins to<strong> deploy both third-party and Windows updates or patches</strong>. Another advantage would be the endpoint discovery tool that helps you identify all the hosts in your network and determine software versions running on those machines.</p>\n<h4>Other features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Remote patch and update deployment.</em></li>\n<li><em>Fully compatible with WSUS and SCCM.</em></li>\n<li><em>Powerful reporting features. Sysadmins can figure out versioning, number of endpoints, number of servers, gather OS and machine data, workstations running obsolete software, and more.</em></li>\n<li><em>Secure testing environment. Comodo’s ONE allows you to run simulations before the actual deployment of patches or updates. That way, you can evaluate the impact of those updates and/or patches.</em></li>\n<li><em>Scheduling options.</em></li>\n<li><em>Policy enforcement.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2) <a href=\"https://www.pulseway.com/?rfid=aw_pulseway&#38;utm_source=Adwords&#38;utm_medium=Pulseway&#38;gclid=Cj0KCQjws536BRDTARIsANeUZ59tP0jx4Iw9kJk5Gpx297cABAr7ii7-XtmVViU9cuRiP-jYUxjxj3AaAroHEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pulseway</a></h3>\n<p>Pulseway is a <strong>hybrid patch management – DNS protection solutio</strong>n. The basic tier is free of charge and can accommodate a small business with a dozen endpoints or so. However, if you want to unlock the full functionality of Pulseway (i.e. deploy it on even more endpoints), you will need to pay. Still, if you’re somewhat unfamiliar with this kind of software, the free version is the way to go. On the patch management side, Pulseway covers both Microsoft Windows and third-party updates and patches, versioning, advanced scheduling, network discovery, collaborative environments, and more.</p>\n<h4>Some other features you should look forward to</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Remote patch and update deployment.</em></li>\n<li><em>No web-based dashboard. Commands are issued from the terminal. Has a steep learning curve.</em></li>\n<li><em>Network discovery features. Helps you identify all endpoints (and devices) connect to the network. Besides, it will show you the software versions and which apps need updating or patching.</em></li>\n<li><em>Easy Active Directory. Effortlessly add or remove devices from your network, without having to make modifications to your firewall or policies.</em></li>\n<li><em>Disaster recovery and endpoint protection. Pulseway has DNS filtering features, which help you drop malicious packets. File backup can also be automatized.</em></li>\n<li><em>Online collaboration. Remote mouse and keystrokes control, navigate between multiple screens, and more.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3) <a href=\"https://www.gfi.com/products-and-solutions/network-security-solutions/gfi-languard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GFI LanGuard</a></h3>\n<p>GFI LanGuard is not exactly open-source, but I chose to include it in the list since its 30-day trial gives you access to all of its features. On top of that, it’s very easy to use, compatible with all major operating systems (i.e. Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X) and has some pretty impressive vulnerability mitigation features.</p>\n<h4>Other stuff that recommends GFI LanGuard</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>On-demand and automatic network scanning.</em></li>\n<li><em>Deployment and installation of Microsoft Windows and third-party updates or patches.</em></li>\n<li><em>MDM features. Can help you set up Android and iOS devices. On top of that, GFI LanGuard can aid you in discovering vulnerabilities endemic to mobile devices.</em></li>\n<li><em>UX-oriented design. The web-based dashboard simplifies logging and reporting. It also offers granular control over what goes on in your endpoints.</em></li>\n<li><em>Identify and auto-downloads missing patches and updates. All updates are downloaded over an SSL connection.</em></li>\n<li><em>Fully compatible with all vulnerability assessment standards includes SANS Top 20 and OVAL.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4) <a href=\"https://www.manageengine.com/products/desktop-central/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ManageEngine’s Desktop Central</a></h3>\n<p>ManageEngine’s Desktop Central is an open-source patch and vulnerability management tool that allows you to deploy Windows updates on the fly, configure firewall &#38; wireless devices, remote-wipe company data, and <strong>control USB policies</strong>. Desktop Central’s uniqueness is its ability to conduct pre-testing on patches and updates before deploying them in bulk.</p>\n<h4>Even more features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Advanced reporting features. The solution periodically generates patching reports. Very helpful for that monthly vulnerability assessment meeting (if you have one, of course).</em></li>\n<li><em>Supports both Windows updates/patches and third-party.</em></li>\n<li><em>Can help you get rid of unwanted data.</em></li>\n<li><em>Thumb drive device management. Desktop Central can help you secure unsigned thumb drives and enforce removable media policies.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5) <a href=\"http://www.localupdatepublisher.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Local Update Publisher</a></h3>\n<p>The Local Update Publisher works as an extension to Windows’ Software Update Services, allowing system admins to create custom software packages and publish them (after approval) to WSUS. Since this is an extension, Local Update Publisher is free to use. One of the tool’s most useful features is the installation tracker, a widget that lets you keep tabs of the installation process (duh!).</p>\n<h4>Other features that recommend Local Update Publisher</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Rules generator. The tool allows the system administrator to create patch/update installation rules.</em></li>\n<li><em>WSUS and SCCM compatible. Can use a pre-existent WSUS architecture.</em></li>\n<li><em>Microsoft and 3<sup>rd</sup> party updates and patches.</em></li>\n<li><em>Update catalogs. You can export and import standardized update catalogs.</em></li>\n<li><em>Scanning and testing before approval and deployment. Fully automatic patching flow. First, the package is scanned for malware. The next step involves testing the package in a secure environment. Upon approval, the patch or update is deployed and installed.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>6) <a href=\"https://www.action1.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Action1</a></h3>\n<p>It’s not exactly a patch management solution, but it does have some good patching and patching abilities. Action1 is ‘marketed’ as an <strong>SMB-oriented endpoint management tool</strong>, covering hardware and software inventory, cloud-directed patch deployment &#38; management, MDM, and endpoint security. On top of that, it’s open-source and highly customizable.</p>\n<h4>Even more features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Auto and remote boot on patch\\update installation.</em></li>\n<li><em>Open-source patch management software designed for corporate.</em></li>\n<li><em>Software and hardware inventory.</em></li>\n<li><em>Advanced reporting. Generate detailed reports regarding network vulnerabilities, updates required, failed installations, and more.</em></li>\n<li><em>Force-installation of patches and updates.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>7) <a href=\"https://chocolatey.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chocolatey</a></h3>\n<p>Yeah, I know that it sounds like an app for chocolate enthusiasts, it’s actually a very powerful patch management tool, capable of supporting more than 7,000 packages. A word of caution &#8211; Chocolatey is not for the weak-hearted, since it uses <strong>a SSH command line.</strong></p>\n<p>So, a very steep learning curve, but, once you get a hang of it, you’ll be able to do some very cool stuff like force-install or uninstall applications, create custom packages and scripts. Even more awesome is the fact that Chocolatey is free of charge.</p>\n<h4>More features</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Task scheduler.</em></li>\n<li><em>Construct automation flows with simple scripts.</em></li>\n<li><em>Upgrade or downgrade apps on the fly.</em></li>\n<li><em>Commercial plan available.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"blog-action shortcode\"><div class=\"shortcode-background-image\"><img src=\"\" /></div>    <div class=\"new-cta tp-e blog-action shortcode\">\n        <div class=\"new-cta-main-container shortcode-main-container\">\n            <div class=\"logo-area\">\n                <a target=\"__blank\" href=\"https://www.heimdalsecurity.com\"><img src=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/heimdal-blog-cro/img/heimdal_blue_logo.svg\"\n                        alt=\"Heimdal Official Logo\"></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"cta-separator\"></div>\n            <div class=\"upper-title\">\n                <p>Simple Antivirus protection is no longer enough.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"product-title\">\n                <h2>Thor Premium Enterprise</h2>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"sub-title\">\n                is the multi-layered Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) approach <br />\n                    to organizational defense.\n                \n            </div>\n            <div class=\"list\">\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Next-gen Antivirus which stops known threats;</li>\n                    <li>DNS traffic filter which stops unknown threats;</li>\n                    <li>Automatic patches for your software and apps with no interruptions;</li>\n                    <li>Protection against data leakage, APTs, ransomware and exploits;</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"button\">\n                <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/products/thor-premium-enterprise?partner=blog\">Try it for\n                    FREE today</a>\n                <span>Offer valid only for companies.</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"footer-bg\"></div>\n        </div>\n    </div></div>\n<h2>Patch Management Tips, Tricks, and Hacks</h2>\n<p>Want to improve your ‘patching’ hygiene? Here are some tips and tricks that will sure to be of some use.</p>\n<p>a) <strong>Every device should be patched</strong>. This includes servers, printers, wearables, smartphones, tablets, and everything connected to the company’s network.</p>\n<p>b) <strong>Smoke-test your patches before all-out deployment</strong>. Smoke testing is a type of building verification testing, aimed at making sure that the build’s vital features are up and running. There are plenty of open-source smoke tools, some of them being free to use.</p>\n<p>c) <strong>Patching goes hand in hand with endpoint security</strong>. Patching is important. However, keeping your endpoints safe against malware that could be hiding update packages is equally important.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/products/thor-premium-enterprise-endpoint-security-software?partner=Blog l\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heimdal<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Security’s Thor Premium Enterprise</a> will keep all your apps and software up to date while ensuring that not malware sets foot in your endpoints. All the packages are downloaded over a secure communication. On top of that, <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/xploit-resilience-patch-management-software?partner=Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X-Ploit Resilience</a>, Thor Premium Enterprise&#8217;s automatic patching engine, will allow you to deploy custom .msi packages; very useful when you need to update/patch proprietary software.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Patch management software is bound to take the heat off your sysadmins, free up some of their time spent hounding outdated apps.

In every agency or SaaS company, she worked on as a senior executive within sales and senior marketing consultant with big knowledge within SMB/Enterprise segments across different industries. She rose rapidly through the ranks and provided customers immediate value and actionable insight for business growth. Throughout the years she has developed high skills within process sales, especially related to technology and SaaS solutions, and has also been focusing on building important relationships to executive people within the Norwegian business circles.</p>\n<p>Her expertise and business acumen culminated in the co-founding of Woke Agency in 2018, her own business within a media-group where she served as the Chief Sales and Marketing Manager as well as providing a massive growth before it was bought. Moving on to greater sights, Ivana Marisol joins the executive team at Heimdal<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Security at the height of their staggering growth in the recently opened Oslo office.

A cliché indeed, but nonetheless true. Unsupervised accounts, unnecessarily elevated rights, subpar SAML implementation, and the lack of powerful access (and authentication) policies are what inspired a whole new chapter in the book of cybersecurity. PAM is founded on a very simple principle: no one’s to be trusted and everyone’s a suspect.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Simple, indeed, but the statement above is more akin to paranoia than to a living- and thriving – corporate environment. In an article I wrote a while back, I’ve talked about the <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/access-governance-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fundamentals of identity and access governance</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Role assignation is, if you will, the powerhouse of PAM – accounting should only have access to financial documents, marketing should only access relevant materials, without the possibility of peeking at, for instance, finance-related documents and so on.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, in stepping up to the plate, PAM has become just as vital as patching, DNS traffic filtering, antivirus, and antimalware tools.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Privileged Access Management is the first step in the right direction, but it’s lacking something; some sort of padding. Since the subject of PAM security has yet to be broached, today’s article is dedicated to what you can do (or can be done) to reinforce your identity and access governance policies.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Putting the “S” in Privileged Access Management</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, is it SPAM, PAMS, or S-PAM? Can’t say which one sounds better and wrapping our heads around this would be beside the point. In a broader context, PAM Security refers to a set of policies, rules, permissions, and the scripting framework required to create a sustainable role-based (not play!) ecosystem.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Where do we begin? What’s the best way to talk the talk about PAM Security? Well, to shape what will very well be then next big paradigm leap in identity and access management, we need to have a little chat about a quaint little thing called SAML.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those of you who have yet to rub elbows with markup languages, SAML, which is short for Security Assertion Markup Language, is an open standard used for mediating the information exchange (authorization &#38; authentication) between various parties.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, if the suffix (ML) sounds familiar, then you’re right – SAML is based on the Extensible Markup Language. One of the fundamental differences between SAML and XML is that the first is used for security assertations, while the latter is mostly used for encoding documents.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SAML provides the security padding PAM (desperately) needs. Remember when we said that role assignation is the powerhouse of IAM? Even SAML has a penchant for thespianism. So, what are the roles in SAML?</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tinseltown SAML</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The SAML vernacular defines <strong>three roles</strong>:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1) <strong>Principal</strong> (not the headmaster though).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2) <strong>idP</strong> (Identity Provider).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3) <strong>SP</strong> (Service Provider).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, how does it work? The <strong>principal,</strong> which, in most cases, is considered the human user (although not mandatory), requests a service from the <strong>SP</strong> (Service Provider). To ascertain if the principal is really, well, the principal and not someone (or something) else, the <strong>SP</strong> queries one or more identity providers <strong>(idP)</strong> to make a security assertion – requesting authentication details.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, based on the security assertion received from the <strong>idP,</strong> the <strong>SP</strong> makes an access control decision &#8211; determines if the service requested by the principal should be provided or not.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For validation purposes, the <strong>idP</strong> can (and will) request some additional information from the principal, aka the solicitor, that so feverishly seeks the service from the <strong>SP.</strong> The entire <strong>P – idP-SP cycle</strong> is summed up in the diagram below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sd.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16825\" src=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sd.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Image courtesy</strong> of <a href=\"https://docs.jboss.org/picketlink/2/2.5.0.CR1/reference/html/ch09.html\">JBoss</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This depiction of the<strong> P – idP-SP cycle</strong> is not exhaustive. Many things make this system tick, but there’s no point in going further. The only thing you should know is that a single <strong>idP</strong> can make security assertions for many SPs.  More than that, a single <strong>SP</strong> can query as many <strong>idPs</strong> to make the right access control decision.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I seemed to have mentioned that <strong>idPs</strong> make their security assertions based on credentials such as username-password pairs. In practice, these identity providers can take advantage of all authentication forms, including MFA, to make the best decision. Directory Services (e.g. LDAP, AD, or RADIUS) can also be employed in the authentication process.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All these things sound amazing, but how do they fit into place? And, more importantly, what do they have to do with PAM security?</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">SAML in motion. TLS, XML Signature, and XML Encryption</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One thing to consider before I add more beef to this article – SAML plays an important role in <strong>SSO</strong> (<strong>Single Sign-On</strong>) authentication schemes, but it’s not limited to them. That’s where SAML profiling comes into play.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a nutshell, SAML profiles are very much like brain scans. Whereas the latter shows how the various brain parts operate, SAML profiles showcase how all the bindings, protocols, and assertions work together within a case. Depending on the nature of the user case, there are various profiles</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><em>SSO Profiles (e.g. Web Browser SSO Profile, Enhanced Client or Proxy Profile, Identity Provider Discovery Profile, Single Logout Profile, Name Identifier Management Profile).</em></li>\n<li><em>Artifact Resolution Profile.</em></li>\n<li><em>Assertion Query Profile.</em></li>\n<li><em>Name Identifier Mapping Profile.</em></li>\n<li><em>Security Assertion Markup Language Attribute Profiles.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back to SAML &#8211; let’s see what happens during such an exchange.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">SAML in Web Browser SSO</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this case, the service is requested from an <strong>SP</strong> by a human user through a user agent. The <strong>UA</strong> is a web browser.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Step 1</strong>. <em>Resource querying at the Service Provider.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Usually done via HTTP.  The query looks like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"html\">https://sp.noname.com/resource</code></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Note:</strong> <em>If the same principal made the same query to the service provider, the process will be approved without going through the usual…formalities.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Step 2</strong>. <em>The service provider redirects the request to Identity Provider’s SSO Service</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SP sees the principal’s service request and redirects it to the preferred <strong>idP</strong> for a security assertion. The secondary query looks like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"html\">https://idp.noname.org/SAML2/SSO/Redirect?Request=request</code></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Note:</strong> <em>the web browser will usually request the SSO service by URL parametrization using a <strong>GET</strong> type request.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Step 3</strong>.  <em>XHTML response from <strong>idP’s</strong> SSO service.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The SSO service attached to the <strong>idP</strong> will validate the request and send the response in an XHTML form. This form will look something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"xml\" data-enlighter-linenumbers=\"false\">&#60;form method=” post” action=https://sp.noname.com/SAML2/SSO/POST …&#62;\n\n&#60;input type= “hidden” name=” SAMLResponse” value=” response” /&#62;\n\n…\n\n&#60;input type=” submit” value=” Submit” /&#62;\n\n&#60;/form&#62;</pre>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Step 4.</strong> <em>The user-agent requests the result of the assertion consumer service at the <strong>Service Provider</strong>.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principal’s user-agent (i.e. web browser) will request the result of the assertion consumer service at the <strong>SP</strong> using a POST-type request.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The Assertion Consumer Service or ACS denotes a location hosted at the SP that accepts SAML artifacts (&#60;samlp: Response&#62; messages) in order to establish an info exchange based on an active assertion).</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Step 5.</strong> <em>Target resource redirect</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the<strong> assertion consumer service</strong> evaluates the results, it will ‘inform’ the <strong>SP</strong> that a security context can be safely created. Subsequently, the <strong>SP</strong> will redirect the principal’s user agent to the resource requested in the first place.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Step 6</strong>. <em>User Agent to <strong>SP</strong> (again)</em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principal’s user agent will once again request the resource at the <strong>SP.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Step 7.</strong> <em><strong>SP</strong> fetches the resource of the user agent.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the security context created, the <strong>SP</strong> can safely provide access to the requested resource.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&#8217;s an example of a <a href=\"https://www.samltool.com/generic_sso_res.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SAML, idP to SP (encrypted) response</a>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Security mechanisms in SAML</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SAML utilizes two types of security countermeasures: transportation-level (usually TLS 1.0 or above) and message-level (XML Encryption and XML Signature). I’ve already covered the ins and outs of <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/what-is-transport-layer-security/\">Transport-level Security</a> in an article I wrote a while back. Let’s talk about XML Encryption and XML Signature.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. XML Signature</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Without getting into too many technical details, in the context of SAML, an XML Signature is a type of digital signature akin to PKCS#7 used to sign various XML documents.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A typical XML signature contains the following elements:</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong><code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"java\">SignedInfo</code></strong> &#8211; information about signed data and the signature algorithms utilized.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"ini\">SignatureMethod</code></strong> <strong>&#38; <code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"raw\">CanonicalizationMethod</code></strong> – anti-tampering elements.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"raw\">Transforms</code></strong> – describes the transformation applied to a resource before it is signed.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"raw\">DigestMethod</code></strong> – describes the used hashing algorithm before its application.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"raw\">DigestValue</code></strong> – result after the hash algorithm is applied. Encoded in Base64.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"raw\">Signature Value</code></strong> – the signature’s result. Also encoded in Base64.</li>\n<li><strong><code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"raw\">KeyInfo</code></strong> &#8211; signer can provide the recipient with the key attached to the signature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For additional information on digital signatures, cryptographic algorithms used in XML digital signing, or deployment options, please refer to W3C’s paper on <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">XML Signature Syntax and Processing Version 1.1</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. XML Encryption</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">XML Encryption refers to how the contents of XML element are encryption. Both XML Signature and XML Encryption draw data from the <code class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"raw\">SignedInfo</code> element.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There’s not much to say about XML documents encryption algorithms – most take advantage of symmetric cryptography since they are less resource-consuming compared to the asymmetric approach. Although most use AES-128, other symmetric ciphers can be employed. It’s all up to the developer.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Actionable Identity and Access Governance Tips</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adding SAML padding increases your PAM security factor and that’s a fact. Still, this isn’t the kind of thing that can be deployed just like an application. It’s much more than that. Your entire Identity and Access Management infrastructure will have to be reevaluated to determine the best course of action. Have a nice (friendly) chat with your sysadmin and CTO to see how your PAM solution can be improved through SAML.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Naturally, with prevention being the best cure, up next, I will share with you some of my favorites IAM and PAM tips that are sure to improve your user access management game. Enjoy!</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Requests for additional access.</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your sysadmin’s dashboard may become flooded with requests for additional access to various applications. For instance, a manager may need access to financial documents in order to determine who’s next in line for a raise.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anywho, the takeaway here is that there’s no clear dividing line between roles. Keep that in mind the next time someone hits you with an access request. Don’t be so eager to hit that “deny” button.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Reporting proficiency.</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the answers to your PAM related questions are in those auto-generated reports. If you know how to read them right, you can quickly map out vulnerabilities. From your PAM solution’s dashboard, you can gather info status, account activity, account holder’s name &#38; unique ID, job title, role attributions, identities, and much more. So, get comfortable with those reports because they can help you solve a lot of issues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><div class=\"blog-action shortcode\"><div class=\"shortcode-background-image\"><img src=\"\" /></div>    <div class=\"new-cta ap-e blog-action shortcode\">\n        <div class=\"new-cta-main-container shortcode-main-container\">\n            <div class=\"logo-area\">\n                <a target=\"__blank\" href=\"https://www.heimdalsecurity.com\"><img src=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/heimdal-blog-cro/img/heimdal_blue_logo.svg\"\n                        alt=\"Heimdal Official Logo\"></a>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"cta-separator\"></div>\n            <div class=\"upper-title\">\n                <p>System admins waste 30% of their time manually managing user rights or installations.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"product-title\">\n                <h2>Thor AdminPrivilege&#8482;</h2>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"sub-title\">\n               is the automatic Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution <br />\n                    which frees up huge chunks of sys-admin time.\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"list\">\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Automate the elevation of admin rights on request;</li>\n                    <li>Approve or reject escalations with one click;</li>\n                    <li>Provide a full audit trail into user behavior;</li>\n                    <li>Automatically de-escalate on infection;</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"button\">\n                <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/products/thor-adminprivilege?partner=blog\">Try it for\n                    FREE today</a>\n                <span>Offer valid only for companies.</span>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"footer-bg\"></div>\n        </div>\n    </div></div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Choose an all-inclusive PAM solution.</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you’re not sure about the next step, let me give you a little hint. The PAM solution you choose must maintain a balance between security and ease-of-access.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heimdal<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Security’s <a href=\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/en/enterprise-security/products/thor-adminprivilege-pam-solution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thor AdminPrivilege<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a> is your go-to solution for all your PAM and IAM needs.
