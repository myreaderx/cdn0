The most common analogy you’ll come across for cross-selling is: “Would you like fries with that?”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, cross-selling gets lumped together with upselling, but they’re actually two distinct strategies.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Here’s how they play out within email.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cross-sell email, like the one below from </span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/confirming-your-executive-razors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dollar Shave Club</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, presents inexpensive items that customers can use alongside their main purchase. For a razor, a cross-sell is a shave butter. Cross-sells are portrayed as a smaller commitment, as signaled by the headline “toss more in?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cross-sell for a SaaS company could be adding a standalone feature to complement your current suite, or integrating with a third-party tool. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dsc.jpg\" alt=\"dollar shave club cross sell emails\" width=\"691\" height=\"1421\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upsell emails, on the other hand, present an item that’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> expensive than the main purchase. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dollar Shave Club attempts to </span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/upgrade-to-a-first-class-travel-bag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">upsell</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a customer with a $25 “first-class travel bag,” instead of the $6 shave butter.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> An upsell for a SaaS company would be upgrading your plan to a higher tier with more features. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2-8.jpg\" alt=\"dollar shave club upsell email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"1389\" /></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Why you should add cross-selling emails to your lineup</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any scalable marketing tactic that leads to higher sales is an obvious win, so here are three cross-selling email benefits we think you’ll be happy with. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Increase average order value</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding a single $6 shave butter to a Dollar Shave Club order isn’t going to change the price that a customer pays drastically. However, you need to think about cross-selling at scale. Even a small lift in average order value multiplied by your customer base could represent serious cash flow. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"728\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forrester Research found a </span><a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/infographics/the-importance-of-cross-selling-and-product-recommendations-for-e-commerce-website-02181883#:~:text=Cross%2Dselling%20and%20product%20recommendation%20is%20becoming%20very%20popular%20and,that%20product%20to%20their%20carts.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10% higher AOV</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on purchases where a recommendation was clicked on. While these cross-sell tactics sometimes play out on a company’s website, the potential for a higher AOV is reason to explore it in email, too. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Boost customer lifetime value</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cross-sell isn’t just good for the average order value, but it also increases </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/glossary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer lifetime value</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over the long run. </span><a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/infographics/the-importance-of-cross-selling-and-product-recommendations-for-e-commerce-website-02181883#:~:text=Cross%2Dselling%20and%20product%20recommendation%20is%20becoming%20very%20popular%20and,that%20product%20to%20their%20carts.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">49% of customers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> say they have purchased an item they didn’t intend to initially, because of a personalized recommendation.</span></p>\n<p>If that happens a few times over the customer lifetime, you’re bound to see the boost in revenue and engagement.

These are four cross-sell email templates to use as guiding lights. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Shopify</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software companies, like Shopify, can cross-sell opportunities that mirror a customer’s growth. For example, a Shopify customer may start selling their goods online, and then grow to fulfill their dream of having a storefront. As the customer progresses on their journey, Shopify helps with their point of sale hardware and app. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-6-9.jpg\" alt=\"Shopify cross sell email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"725\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shopify’s </span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/everything-you-need-to-sell-in-person/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cross-sell email</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is short and to the point. They catch the target audience&#8217;s attention with the subject line “Everything you need to sell in-person.” The body copy then explores why they should care (accept payments on any device) and what to do next (download the app). </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Casper</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we’ve mentioned already and will explore below, cross-sells should be less expensive than what a customer has already purchased. In </span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/introducing-our-fluffiest-pillow-yet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Casper’s case</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the perfect cross-sell to their mattress is their “fluffiest pillow yet.”</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-7-6.jpg\" alt=\"Casper cross sell email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"2209\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The email begins with a simple description of the pillow, and then explores details further down, such as sourcing and materials.</span></p>\n<p>Since Casper already positions itself on comfort and high environmental standards, the three key points listed for the pillow will resonate with customers.</p>\n<h3><strong>Mailchimp</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While</span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/get-your-free-com-time-to-get-online/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Mailchimp’s cross-selling</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is technically free, it’s still a great way to make users more “sticky.” As customers use more and more of your services and build a deeper involvement with your company, they are more likely to stick around.</span></p>\n<p>Therefore, this cross-sell promotion may still boost retention in the long run. In the future, they may run this campaign as a standard cross-sell and offer the custom domain at a price.</p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-8-15.png\" alt=\"Mailchimp cross sell email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"843\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Mailchimp email is also a bit of a two-for-one, since they ask readers to tell their friends “how they can get online quickly and easily with a free custom domain.” By giving existing customers something for free, they entice them to refer their friends to Mailchimp. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P.S. Want to learn more about referral emails? We’ve got a complete guide </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/referral-emails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Chewy</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have past orders and behavioral data from customers, you can send personalized emails like</span><a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/running-low/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Chewy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Based on previous order frequency, Chewy can predict when a customer might be ready for another purchase.</span></p>\n<p>The email acts as a useful reminder, but also as a cross-sell for related products.</p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-9-3.jpg\" alt=\"Chewy cross sell email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"1551\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using data about user preferences or past purchases lets you suggest products they’re more likely to be interested in. A suggestion for a product that the customer will actually use, is more likely to convert than a random selection from your lineup. </span></p>\n<h2><strong>How to create a cross-sell email strategy</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve seen the best cross-sell email examples and templates to spark ideas, and now it’s time to create a strategy of your own. There are four steps to planning your cross-sell promotions. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Identify cross-sell opportunities</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you need to map all of your products and features to find opportunities. To be a strong candidate for cross-selling, an item should be:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less expensive than the original item</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be in a similar category or use case</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well-reviewed and useful (after all, you want someone to be happy with the purchase)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of a cross-sell item comes from </span><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/cross-selling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WooCommerce</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and stroller company, </span><a href=\"https://www.goveer.com/cruisers/cruiser-accessories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Veer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The company’s primary product is a $599 stroller, so a perfect cross-sell is a $49 retractable canopy.</span></p>\n<p>The add-on is less expensive but adds value to the customer’s experience.</p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-10-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"633\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Choose target personas</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you’ve established some product links that are cross-sell opportunities, you need to decide which customers to target. To do this, familiarize yourself with your buyer personas and any </span><a href=\"https://www.getvero.com/resources/what-you-need-to-know-about-psychographic-segmentation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">psychographic segmentation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> data you have. Are there any segments that will benefit the most from a cross-sell?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also look at which items are typically purchased together, and by whom. Selling a complimentary product will be easier when you have data to show that segments are already making those decisions. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Establish the customer journey</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first two steps, you determined the “what” and the “who.” Now, let’s decide when to introduce a cross-sell. Using the analytics on purchase behavior you referenced in the previous step, is there a particular time that your two items are often purchased together?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some points in the customer journey that could be ideal for cross-selling include after a customer has:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Made a purchase and left a positive review</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchased something in a new category, indicating a shift in interest</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Passed their typical buying frequency period</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The customer journey map below shows how cross-selling and upselling are </span><a href=\"https://www.bluebusiness.com/customer-journey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ongoing efforts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you use to expand your customer relationship. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-11-9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"828\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Determine your messaging and positioning</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final piece of the puzzle focuses on how you’ll present the cross-sell. Ask yourself what the benefit of the add-on product is on its own, and also in combination with the main item. Why are these a good match?</span></p>\n<p>Are there use cases or benefits of the products that are particularly intriguing to specific customer personas?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to boost the positioning of your cross-sell is with social proof. For example, </span><a href=\"https://sleeknote.com/blog/social-proof-email-examples#:~:text=ii.&#38;text=Knowing%20this%2C%20Brandless%20curates%20customer,and%20endorse%20the%20company's%20authority.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brandless</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> includes a customer quote about a cross-sell product.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"\" src=\"https://www.getvero.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-12-3.jpg\" alt=\"Brandless cross sell email example\" width=\"700\" height=\"689\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>How to set up a cross-sell email automation in Vero</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After creating your strategy, it’s time to get to work setting up your cross-sell marketing automation and you can do it easily in Vero.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Vero, you’ll be able to: </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Design your cross-sell email with the Drag and Drop editor</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your email will fall flat without the right copy, your offer may never get the attention it deserves without an eye-catching design.

Liquid is an open-source language, made by Shopify, that allows dynamic content to be displayed on websites, emails, and mobile push notifications.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br
