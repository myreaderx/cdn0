In a thriller that seems at least partially inspired by the true story of Dee Dee and Gypsy Rose Blanchard, Paulson plays Diane, a smothery mom from hell – a woman who will stop at nothing to keep her daughter from the outside world. That daughter is Chloe (<strong>Kiera Allen</strong>), a 17-year-old wheelchair user who suffers from a dictionary&#8217;s worth of ailments. Or so she&#8217;s been told. But Chloe has grown restless in her teen years, and she longs to finally leave home for college. Surely dear old mom can understand that, right?</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645876\"></span></p>\n<p>Chaganty, who took what could&#8217;ve been easily dismissed as a gimmick with <em>Searching</em> (it was another screen movie, where all the action was confined to computer screens and iPhones) and worked it into something magical, gets a lot of mileage here from building up tension. Because make no mistake: whatever its flaws, <em>Run</em> is tense as hell. It&#8217;s relentless in the way it cranks up the anxiety as the truth of the situation becomes more clear. It&#8217;s an old cliche to say a film will have you on the edge of your seat these days, but don&#8217;t be surprised if you find yourself nervously leaning towards the screen as all of this goes down.</p>\n<p>The relationship between Chloe and Diane seems warm at first, but Chloe is growing more and more suspicious of mom&#8217;s actions the older she gets. Why, exactly? This is one of the things that <em>Run</em> never fully articulates. Chloe is suddenly suspicious of her mom because the script requires her to be, and not much more is said about the matter. But it&#8217;s clear that Diane is hiding something, and Chloe grows more and more brazen each day, ready to call her mom&#8217;s bluff. And Diane is sure acting mighty suspicious.</p>\n<p>Chloe is waiting for a potential college acceptance letter, yet every time the mail comes, Diane swoops in to grab what&#8217;s there before Chloe can even take a look. Diane forbids Chloe from having a cellphone, so she doesn&#8217;t exactly have access to the outside world. And when Chloe finally decides to look something up on a computer, the WiFi network is conveniently down. Then there are the pills Diane insists Chloe take – surely they&#8217;re on the level, right? Well&#8230;when Chloe manages to sneak away to the pharmacy at one point she makes a rather shocking discovery about that, too. Nothing is as it seems, and the more truth Chloe uncovers the more unhinged Diane becomes.</p>\n<p>Paulson and Allen – the latter in her feature debut – are equally great here. Paulson can play this type of cold, unhinged woman in her sleep at this point, but that doesn&#8217;t make her any less captivating. The actress does a great job of making us <em>sort of</em> understand where Diane is coming from, at least at first. Then, when the second half of the story requires Paulson to go full-blown Kathy Bates in <em>Misery</em>, she <em>really</em> gets to have some fun. Allen, who uses a wheelchair in real life, is the real revelation here. It&#8217;s a star-making performance – believable, compelling, and engrossing.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re immediately sympathetic to Chloe&#8217;s plight, and the fact that Chaganty thought to cast a real wheelchair user as his heroine is a masterstroke. The physicality that Allen brings to the role is essential to making this all work and results in some nail-biting moments – like one where Chloe has to figure out how to get down a flight of stairs, or another where she crawls across a rooftop in order to get out of a locked room. Moments like these are expertly staged and go a long way toward making <em>Run</em> a fun, if unsettling, ride.</p>\n<p>But <em>Run</em> eventually runs out of momentum. The third act is more than a bit messy, and it starts to feel like co-writers Chaganty and <strong>Sev Ohanian</strong> never quite broke their ending when they were outlining this thing. After plowing full-speed ahead for its first two-thirds <em>Run</em> abruptly grinds to a halt, resulting in an unfortunately hollow climax that robs the flick of some of its strength. And a finale that&#8217;s meant to pack a punch is severely lacking.</p>\n<p>Still, with <em>Searching</em> and now <em>Run</em>, director Chaganty has carved out a neat little niche for himself as a filmmaker who excels with low-budget, high-concept thrillers. Chaganty knows how to conjure big excitement from small scale scenarios, and that&#8217;s a lot harder than it looks. While <i>Run</i> trips over its own feet in the end, it once again signals Chaganty as a filmmaker who makes films worth seeking out.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film rating: 7 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/run-movie-review/\">&#8216;Run&#8217; Review: Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen Are Equally Strong in Aneesh Chaganty&#8217;s Relentless Thriller</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ivcHwUAz6oU:L3TffxxVspQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ivcHwUAz6oU:L3TffxxVspQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ivcHwUAz6oU:L3TffxxVspQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ivcHwUAz6oU:L3TffxxVspQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ivcHwUAz6oU:L3TffxxVspQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ivcHwUAz6oU:L3TffxxVspQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ivcHwUAz6oU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 18:00:37 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/run-movie-review-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"64da5c40258c18cdf65a334d4b01d7d0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn16@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-38-071_ef20592d74730882.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":53465,"destBytes":37786,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/run-movie-review-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn16@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-38-071_ef20592d74730882.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ivcHwUAz6oU:L3TffxxVspQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn7@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-39-03-890_e4b36b0185cadcaa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ivcHwUAz6oU:L3TffxxVspQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn45@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-02-820_b7e22073e257cf8d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ivcHwUAz6oU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn91@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-39-02-490_3c339fd904b958c3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501154},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"Zack Snyder’s Ideal ‘Justice League’ is an IMAX Release in Black & White, Considered Splitting It Into Two Movies","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645930","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-431098 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Zack-Snyder-DC-Films-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"justice league two parts\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Zack-Snyder-DC-Films.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Zack-Snyder-DC-Films-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The phrase &#8220;<strong>Zack Snyder</strong>&#8216;s <em><strong>Justice League</strong></em>&#8221; was once a simple description of a muddled theatrical release from several years ago.

That plan seemed to be <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/two-part-justice-league-now-one-movie/\">scaled back</a> to just one movie by the time production on the theatrical cut began. However, in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLVz95Bwifk&#38;t=1441s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Film Junkee</a> (via <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/justice-league-snyder-cut-release-original-plan/\">ScreenRant</a>), Snyder seems to complicate things a tiny bit by seemingly talking about a <em>different</em> plan that could have resulted in two <em>Justice League</em> movies. This plan would have taken his long cut of the first <em>Justice League</em> and split it into two two-hour movies:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The studio had seen the director&#8217;s cut, but even the director&#8217;s cut of the movie was shorter than my cut. Yes, this is my cut of the movie, but there was a cut of the movie that I created that I said, &#8216;This is too much for the studio.&#8217; The mandate was, &#8216;Make the movie two hours long.&#8217; I cannot show them a four-hour version of the movie. I did have this idea where, &#8216;Oh, maybe we could just split it in half and make it two two-hour movies.&#8217; My first idea was you show two hours, and then there&#8217;s like a month [break], and then the next two hours come out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That obviously did not end up happening, but we&#8217;ve been saying for months now that in a world in which Snyder gets tens of millions of dollars to make this HBO Max version of the story, it doesn&#8217;t seem too far-fetched to think that we could see even more DC content from him later on.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-618662 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Snyder-Cut-Justice-League-700x394.jpg\" alt=\"Snyder Cut Justice League\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Snyder-Cut-Justice-League.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Snyder-Cut-Justice-League-360x203.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League is Four Parts, But Six Chapters</h2>\n<p>We know that the four-hour version of <em>Justice League</em> will be broken up into four parts on HBO Max and will debut sometime in <strong>2021</strong>. But Snyder says that structurally, the film is broken into not four, but six different chapters:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The thing about the movie that I think is interesting is the way I constructed the cut was, it&#8217;s six chapters, right? It was always this chaptered concept, where the first section says &#8216;Part 1&#8217; and you have this little section, &#8216;Part 2&#8217; and you have another section, [etc.] And then an epilogue. So the structure of the movie always lent itself to this&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s news to me, and now I&#8217;m curious to see how the flow of the story progresses in this manner. I remember watching Jane Campion&#8217;s <em>Top of the Lake</em> on Netflix, which was divided into different chunks on that streaming service than when it originally aired on the Sundance Channel, and that editing resulted in some awkward moments which felt as if episodes should have ended either a few minutes before or a few minutes after those seemingly random division points. Fingers crossed we don&#8217;t get a repeat of that experience.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-359167 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/joker-burnt-tuxedo-700x350.jpg\" alt=\"Jared Leto Joker Movies\" width=\"700\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/joker-burnt-tuxedo-700x350.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/joker-burnt-tuxedo-360x180.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/joker-burnt-tuxedo.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Jared Leto&#8217;s Joker</h2>\n<p>Not long ago, Snyder <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/snyder-cut-joker/\">confirmed</a> that Jared Leto&#8217;s Joker would be appearing in this version of <em>Justice League</em>. It turns out Snyder cold-called Leto to ask if he&#8217;d be interested in participating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For me, though, in my world, if Joker was going to make an appearance, it would be the Jared Leto Joker&#8230;I had this idea for a scene. I had a version of this scene that I had written maybe three years ago. Slightly different, but very similar. But then, for whatever reason, for a multitude of reasons, I didn&#8217;t do it. [Presumably alluding to when he left the film] Then I was talking to [his wife and producing partner] Debbie, and I was like, &#8220;I have this&#8230;do you think it would possible? Am I crazy? Should I just cold call him?&#8221; So I called him&#8230;it was a cool conversation. When I pitched him the idea, I feel like he hooked onto the &#8216;why&#8217; of it, because there&#8217;s a big &#8216;why.&#8217; And literally, he said to me, &#8216;We&#8217;ll talk more.&#8217; I kept calling him, we talked over a while, and he agreed to do it. It was a great experience working with him.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-645969 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-and-White-Justice-League-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Black and White Justice League\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-and-White-Justice-League.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-and-White-Justice-League-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Snyder&#8217;s Ideal Presentation</h2>\n<p>Whether or not IMAX theaters are safe to visit when the Snyder Cut debuts remains to be seen, but according to the director, his ideal version of the film is not only in an immersive IMAX theater, but also in black and white:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My ideal version of the movie is the black and white IMAX version of the movie. That, to me, is the most fan-centric, most pure, most <em>Justice League</em> experience. Because that&#8217;s how I lived with the movie for two years, in black and white&#8230;when I do the live-stream of the trailer, Steph and I colored a black and white version of the trailer. So the first version that I&#8217;m going to put out, and probably what I&#8217;m going to talk about on Tuesday, will be the black and white version of the trailer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That certainly makes it sound like we&#8217;re going to be getting a new trailer for his cut of the film tomorrow, so stay tuned to /Film to check that out as soon as it&#8217;s released.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/justice-league-two-parts-zack-snyder/\">Zack Snyder&#8217;s Ideal ‘Justice League’ is an IMAX Release in Black &#038;

A potential film adaptation of the Stephen King novel has been knocking around for a while now, and for a long time, legendary horror filmmaker George A. Romero was attached to write and direct the movie. But Romero died before the project ever got off the ground. However, Romero&#8217;s former wife Christine Romero is still attached as a producer on this latest incarnation of the adaptation. Other producers include <em>It</em> producer Roy Lee of Vertigo Films, Ryan Silbert of Origin Story, and Jon Berg through Stampede Ventures.</p>\n<p>One of King&#8217;s slimmer books – it&#8217;s only 224 pages, which is the equivalent of a short story for King – the story follows nine-year-old Trisha McFarland, who gets lost in the Maine woods and begins to believe she&#8217;s being stalked by some sort of supernatural monster. Or maybe it&#8217;s just a bear. Here&#8217;s a synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On a six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, nine-year-old Trisha McFarland quickly tires of the constant bickering between her older brother, Pete, and her recently divorced mother. But when she wanders off by herself, and then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror. As night falls, Trisha has only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, and only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fears. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero, relief pitcher Tom Gordon. And when her radio’s reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her – protecting her from an all-too-real enemy who has left a trail of slaughtered animals and mangled trees in the dense, dark woods…</p></blockquote>\n<p>The book is <em>very</em> internalized – Trisha is pretty much the only character and the majority of the book is inside her racing, increasingly incoherent thoughts as she becomes more and more lost. That may not sound inherently cinematic, but Ramsay is quite skilled at taking that sort of material and working it into something incredible. <em>You Were Never Really Here</em> was a very internalized type of story and ended up being one of the best films of 2018. The idea of someone like Ramsay lending her talents to this material is exciting and could make for one of the better King adaptations.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-girl-who-loved-tom-gordon-director/\">&#8216;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&#8217;: &#8216;You Were Never Really Here&#8217; Director Lynne Ramsay Helming Stephen King Adaptation</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Hci50JFBImE:4D1bf-wUM8A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Hci50JFBImE:4D1bf-wUM8A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Hci50JFBImE:4D1bf-wUM8A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Hci50JFBImE:4D1bf-wUM8A:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Hci50JFBImE:4D1bf-wUM8A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Hci50JFBImE:4D1bf-wUM8A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Hci50JFBImE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 19:30:41 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-girl-who-loved-tom-gordon-director-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"9f5f09e86d320a817d547f8790d981e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn29@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-38-35-941_39eb32eaf2109d6f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":45168,"destBytes":28932,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-girl-who-loved-tom-gordon-director-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn29@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-38-35-941_39eb32eaf2109d6f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Hci50JFBImE:4D1bf-wUM8A:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn44@2020_4/2020/11/17/05-39-03-580_7f9b91da87d087cf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Hci50JFBImE:4D1bf-wUM8A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn84@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-39-02-891_1c6e5df5d09ed9b7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Hci50JFBImE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn40@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-39-04-459_44d55646934b1d42.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501153},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"‘The Orange Years’ Clip: Nickelodeon Doc Looks Back at the Weirdness of Artie, The Strongest Man in the World","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645994","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-646017 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adventuresofpeteandpete-artie-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Orange Years Clip - Artie from The Adventure of Pete &#38; Pete\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adventuresofpeteandpete-artie.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adventuresofpeteandpete-artie-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Tomorrow brings the release of <strong><em>The Orange Years</em></strong>, a documentary looking at the influential and strange history of Nickelodeon, dubbed &#8220;the cable network for kids.&#8221; During the 1990s, some of the weirdest and wildest content arrived on Nickelodeon, and not only would it shape the minds of generations of creators to come, but it changed the landscape of what entertainment for children could be.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve got an exclusive clip from <em>The Orange Years</em> that hones in one of the more odd offerings: <strong><em>The Adventures of Pete &#38; Pete</em></strong>. In the clip, series writer <strong>Will McRobb</strong> talks about the character Artie, the strongest man&#8230;in the world.

He&#8217;s also appeared in many TV shows over the years, including <em>The League</em>, <em>Shameless</em>, <em>Colony</em>, <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>, <em>GLOW</em>, <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em>, and <em>Dickinson</em>. But even if you don&#8217;t recognize Huss, you definitely know his voice, because he was the voice of Cotton Hill and several other characters on <em>King of the Hill</em>.</p>\n<p>This is just one example of the kind of oddball humor that Nickelodeon brought to kids, for better or worse. And there are plenty more to be seen in <em>The Orange Years</em> documentary. Read the official synopsis below, and be sure to check out the movie on iTunes starting tomorrow.

Wolfe</strong>&#8216;s adaptation of the classic August Wilson play which stars <strong>Viola Davis</strong> and, most notably, <strong>Chadwick Boseman</strong> in his final film role. And what a swan song for Boseman the movie is, according to early buzz for the highly anticipated Netflix film.</p>\n<p>Critics are calling Boseman&#8217;s turn in <em>Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom</em> as &#8220;magical&#8221; and &#8220;the best he&#8217;s ever been on-screen.&#8221; The raves come after weeks of growing awards buzz for both Boseman and Davis, both of whom Netflix are preparing big Oscar campaigns around. It sounds like it&#8217;s well-deserved for both acting titans, who will appear in <em>Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom</em> on Netflix in December.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645968\"></span></p>\n<p>Boseman stars in <em>Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black</em> <em>Bottom</em> as an ambitious trumpet player named Levee who gets caught in the escalating drama between legendary Blues singer Ma Rainey (Viola Davis) and her white managers in 1920s Chicago. And while Davis is the star of the picture, it&#8217;s Boseman who is getting the most raves, with many critics commenting on the bittersweet nature of seeing the <em>Black Panther</em> and <em>Da 5 Bloods</em> actor in the best performance of his career in the aftermath of his <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-panther-star-chadwick-boseman-dead/\">passing in August</a> from colon cancer.</p>\n<p>Boseman&#8217;s death was a major blow to the Black community, for whom Boseman served as an indelible screen idol. But Netflix appears to be taking seriously Boseman&#8217;s importance to the Black community, not to mention the standing of August Wilson&#8217;s work, allowing even more access to Black critics to <em>Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom</em> than for its previous films (for which the streamer has been rightly criticized in the past). The majority of the <em>Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom</em> early buzz comes from Black critics, who rave about Boseman and Davis&#8217; performances and the important context that this Black-led, Black-created film has in the larger scheme of things.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The whole thing really is bittersweet.

But in the age of remakes, reboots, and re-imaginings, nothing is ever truly over, so the Warner brothers Yakko and Wakko and the Warner sister Dot are back with new adventures and shenanigans from the Warner Bros. water tower, studio lot, and beyond.</p>\n<p>Hulu has brought back <em>Animaniacs</em> for at least two seasons of new episodes, and the entire first season arrives in their streaming library this week. It is my great pleasure to tell you that this revival of <em>Animaniacs</em> hasn&#8217;t missed a beat. The animation style, the meta comedy, the pop culture references, the political satire, the complete zaniness, and of course<em> <strong>Pinky &#38; The Brain</strong></em>, are all back exactly as you remember them. It feels like they never left, and they waste no time getting back in the swing of things by mocking modern pop culture, politics, and society.<span id=\"more-645889\"></span></p>\n<p>A selection of five episodes were made available to press, starting with the premiere episode, and followed by Episode 4, Episode 6, Episode 8, and Episode 10. Just like the original animated series, there&#8217;s no serialization or character arcs, so you can watch any episode at any given time without any worry of getting lost. Each episode is comprised of a few segments totaling around 25 minutes, starting with an adventure for the Warners, followed by a world domination attempt by <em>Pinky &#38; The Brain</em>, and closing with either another Warners cartoon or some kind shorter bit featuring the Warners.</p>\n<p>Out of the batch of episodes provides for review, the season premiere is undoubtedly the strongest. It features everything you love about the <em>Animaniacs</em>. After opening with a hilarious <em>Jurassic Park</em> sequence, we head right into the familiar <em>Animaniacs</em> theme, which has been updated just enough to be clever and self-referential for the reboot. Dot has wit instead of just being cute while Yakko still yaks and Wakko packs away the snacks. It&#8217;s like being welcomed back home after studying abroad for over two decades and your parents have made some lovely changes around the house. And yes, every single episode features that one fun variation in the lyrics just before the end of the song.</p>\n<p>In the season premiere, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot return to the Warner Bros. lot. Weirdly enough, there&#8217;s no real explanation as to where the Animaniacs have been, so we&#8217;re really left to assume that they were just gone, but Steven Spielberg brought them back to life, just like the dinosaurs in <em>Jurassic Park</em>. But now that they&#8217;re back, there&#8217;s a lot that they have to catch up on. Ralph the security guard is still around to round them up, but now he&#8217;s got a drone, and it&#8217;s one of the many things the Warners are introduced to, including a new female executive for them to frustrate.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no better way for the Animaniacs to find out about what has happened across the last 22 years than a song from Yakko himself after he swallows a tablet and inadvertently learns everything from the internet. The brilliance of these songs from the Animaniacs cannot be understated. They&#8217;re full of lyrical genius and feel like full fledged Broadway numbers. There are pop culture and political references galore (the latter was more abundant than you might remember in the original series, but more on that later), and it&#8217;s fascinating to see which moments they chose to highlight in a song meant to cover such a long period of time.</p>\n<p>But this is <em>Animaniacs</em>, and a recap of 22 years just isn&#8217;t zany enough. Since the script for this episode and the rest of the first season was written back in 2018, they have to take plenty of off-the-wall, wild guesses about what has happened in the last two years. It&#8217;s superb satire, and it&#8217;s only the first great song of this episode. A second one dives into the culture of reboots and remakes, and, I shit you not, those weirdos behind the scenes somehow figured out a way to make a reference to <em>Oldboy</em>. Yes, that&#8217;s <em>Oldboy</em>, the super violent <span class=\"aCOpRe\">South Korean neo-noir action thriller</span> from 2003 that was remade by Spike Lee. This show is great!</p>\n<p><em>Pinky &#38; The Brain</em> gets in on the catch-up fun in the season premiere too, but it&#8217;s much more enjoyable to see exactly how the mouse duo is brought into modern day when you see it for yourself. Let me just say that in the last 22 years, Brain has been much more ingrained in the happenings of modern culture, and his latest plan to take over the world may have been literally under our noses the whole time. And their further plans for world domination are as wacky as they&#8217;ve ever been, with plenty of classic sci-fi references to go around. All their best recurring gags are intact too, though unlike the overall <em>Animaniacs</em> series, their segment&#8217;s opening theme sequence has been updated, even as the theme song hasn&#8217;t been changed one bit.</p>\n<p>The rest of the episodes don&#8217;t quite match the greatness of the premiere, but they fall right in line with the spirit and style of the original <em>Animaniacs</em>. There are many musical moments, tons of self-aware writing that is full of relevant satire and parody, and a classic kind of comedy that feels in line with the original <em>Looney Tunes</em>. In fact, I think this revival of <em>Animaniacs</em> may pull off a return to the small screen better than the new <em>Looney Tunes Cartoons</em>, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hbo-max-new-looney-tunes-cartoons-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which also had a lot to love</a>.</p>\n<p>There are few cartoons around today that have the kind of innocent slapstick silliness and wild weirdness that make kids double over in laughter along with the double <span class=\"aCOpRe\">entendres and suggestive lines that give adults a hearty chuckle. And of all that have existed over the years, from <em>Rocko&#8217;s Modern Life</em> to <em>Adventure Time</em>, I think <em>Animaniacs</em> is among the best. The original series contained references to movies and TV shows that were made decades before many of its fans were born, so it&#8217;s always been a show that was made for adults to enjoy as much as kids. And it&#8217;s never been shy about poking fun at anyone and everyone.</span></p>\n<p>For some who only have vague nostalgia for the original <em>Animaniacs</em>, you might feel surprised (and maybe shocked or annoyed) at the level of political mockery in the series, especially when it comes to President Donald Trump, a not-so-thinly-veiled metaphor for gun control, and several shots taken at Fox News and their bounty of boneheads. There are also plenty of expected shots taken during an episode where the Warners learn there&#8217;s a Russian knock-off version of <em>Animaniacs</em>. But if you look back at the original Animaniacs, you&#8217;ll find plenty of jabs at the Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and more. Not all political gags are one-sided in the reboot either, as several jokes are cracked at the expense of Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, and the political machine at large. Even late night talk show host Seth Meyers gets sent up with a handful of insults, including illustrating him holding a coffee mug that says &#8220;Smug.&#8221; Basically, no one is safe from the buffoonery and mockery of <em>Animaniacs</em>.</p>\n<p>Though there are plenty of complimentary things to say about the revival of <em>Animaniacs</em>, fans may be disappointed in some areas. Other than <em>Pinky &#38; The Brain</em>, none of the other supporting characters from the original series return in any of the episodes provided for review. Furthermore, descriptions of the rest of the season would seem to indicate that they&#8217;re not in any of those episodes either. But at the very least, Dr. Scratchansniff is mentioned in the description for the first season finale, and there&#8217;s a &#8220;Hello, Nurse&#8221; reference in the Russian ripoff episode. But the lack of prominent involvement of other characters like Slappy Squirrel, The Goodfeathers, Rita and Runt, Mindy and Buttons, Minerva Mink, and more seems to be confirmed by the opening theme sequence. Though the original opening has been meticulously recreated in widescreen format, with the exception of a few minor changes, the part where the camera usually rises above the roster of characters as the theme song says, &#8220;We&#8217;re animany, totally insany,&#8221; instead features the Warners rejoicing among a bunch of neon lights.</p>\n<p>However, there is one single short included in the episodes for review that introduces two new characters. It&#8217;s called <strong><em>Starbox and Cindy</em></strong>, and it features an animation style unlike the rest of <em>Animaniacs</em>, and that includes any of the other supporting characters from the original series. It seems to only appear once throughout the first season, and it follows an action figure-sized, sludgy alien named Starbox who was meant to lead an invasion of Earth. But when he landed, he was picked up and turned into a toy by a little girl named Cindy. He keeps trying to escape, but Cindy keeps innocently holding him hostage while his entire alien army waits in the space around Earth for their signal to attack. I can see this being a recurring bit like some of the other characters, but I hope some of the other characters end up coming back in the second season now that it&#8217;s been established that <em>Animaniacs</em> and<em> Pinky &#38; The Brain</em> have been revived so effectively.</p>\n<p>Overall, the <em>Animaniacs</em> revival is a true triumph. Bringing back shows like this can be tricky, but thanks to some outstanding writing, classic animation style, and the return of original voice actors <strong>Rob Paulsen</strong>, <strong>Jess Harnell</strong>, <strong>Tress MacNeille</strong>, and <strong>Maurice LaMarche</strong>, <em>Animaniacs</em> feels like it never left our televisions. Hopefully this series will get renewed beyond the initial two season order from Hulu, because I feel like they can keep this show going forever and it would never get old.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 9 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>Animaniacs</em> brings new episodes to Hulu starting on <strong>November 20, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hulu-animaniacs-reboot-review/\">&#8216;Animaniacs&#8217; Reboot Review: The Warners Don&#8217;t Miss a Step in This Sharp, Hilarious &#038; Zany Comeback</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=e_ea1NlL2mY:mgsJQCAsk3k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=e_ea1NlL2mY:mgsJQCAsk3k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=e_ea1NlL2mY:mgsJQCAsk3k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=e_ea1NlL2mY:mgsJQCAsk3k:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=e_ea1NlL2mY:mgsJQCAsk3k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=e_ea1NlL2mY:mgsJQCAsk3k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/e_ea1NlL2mY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 19:00:46 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/animaniacs-reboot-credits-graves-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"ab1c7a0fb95dffaa4515587351e58714","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn32@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-43-930_f87e6f3c7820afd6.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":43341,"destBytes":32036,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/animaniacs-reboot-credits-graves-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn32@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-43-930_f87e6f3c7820afd6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=e_ea1NlL2mY:mgsJQCAsk3k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-39-03-893_84d5a8ccc06a3e52.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=e_ea1NlL2mY:mgsJQCAsk3k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn8@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-39-03-365_a8ba99948c7c559e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/e_ea1NlL2mY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn71@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-39-03-627_2c1fc1580ae362b1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501152},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"‘Small Axe: Lovers Rock’ Trailer: Steve McQueen Invites You to a Party","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645954","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Small-Axe-Lovers-Rock-Trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645993\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Small-Axe-Lovers-Rock-Trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Small Axe Lovers Rock Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Small-Axe-Lovers-Rock-Trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Small-Axe-Lovers-Rock-Trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Small-Axe-Lovers-Rock-Trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Small-Axe-Lovers-Rock-Trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Steve McQueen</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Small Axe</em></strong> anthology consists of five original films set from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s that &#8220;tell personal stories from London&#8217;s West Indian community.&#8221; The first trailer for one of those films – <strong><em>Lovers Rock</em></strong> – is here. <em>Small Axe</em> films played at the New York Film Festival this year, and <em>Lovers Rock</em> seemed to be the title that drummed-up the most buzz, telling the tale of a house party in the 1980s.

The title is derived from the African proverb, &#8216;If you are the big tree, we are the small axe.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first trailer for one of the films – <em>Lovers Rock</em> – is here, and while it&#8217;s brief and not exactly overflowing with details, it looks stylish enough to get your attention. Here&#8217;s the synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lovers Rock tells a fictional story of young love at a Blues party in 1980. The film is an ode to the romantic reggae genre called &#8220;Lovers Rock” and to the Black youth who found freedom and love in its sound in London house parties, when they were unwelcome in white nightclubs. Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn makes her screen debut opposite the BAFTAs 2020 Rising Star award recipient Micheal Ward (<em>Top Boy</em>). <strong>Shaniqua Okwok</strong> (<em>Boys</em>),<strong> Kedar Williams-Stirling</strong> (<em>Sex Education</em>), Ellis George (<em>Dr Who</em>), <strong>Alexander James-Blake</strong> (<em>Top Boy</em>), and <strong>Kadeem Ramsay</strong> (<em>Blue Story</em>) also star, as well as <strong>Francis Lovehall</strong> and <strong>Daniel Francis-Swaby</strong> who make their screen debuts. Lovers Rock was co-written by Courttia Newland and Steve McQueen.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Lovers Rock</em>, which is streaming on<strong> November 27</strong>, won&#8217;t be the first entry to drop on Amazon – that would be <em>Mangrove</em>, which debuts a week before on November 20. But <em>Lovers Rock</em> is the title in the anthology that&#8217;s generated the most positive buzz. Reviewing for /Film, Hoai-Tran Bui <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lovers-rock-review/\">wrote</a>: &#8220;Taking place entirely over the course of one night, this first film in Steve McQueen&#8217;s <em>Small Axe</em> anthology, which charts the lives and London’s West Indian community between 1968 and 1985, is a swooning mood piece that seduces and disarms you until you’re happy to let it lap over you, floating in the warm exuberance of a one-night reggae house party.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the other films in the series, along with when they&#8217;ll premiere:</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>MANGROVE (Premieres Friday, November 20)</strong><br />\nMangrove centers on Frank Crichlow (Shaun Parkes), the owner of Notting Hill’s Caribbean restaurant, Mangrove, a lively community base for locals, intellectuals and activists. In a reign of racist terror, the local police raid Mangrove time after time, making Frank and the local community take to the streets in peaceful protest in 1970. When nine men and women, including Frank and leader of the British Black Panther Movement Altheia Jones-LeCointe (Letitia Wright), and activist Darcus Howe (Malachi Kirby), are wrongly arrested and charged with incitement to riot, a highly publicized trial ensues, leading to hard-fought win for those fighting against discrimination. Letitia Wright (<em>Black Panther</em>), Shaun Parkes (<em>Lost in Space</em>), and Malachi Kirby (<em>Curfew</em>) star alongside Rochenda Sandall (<em>Line of Duty</em>), Jack Lowden (<em>The Long Song</em>), Sam Spruell (<em>Snow White and the Huntsmen</em>), Gershwyn Eustache (<em>The Gentleman</em>), Nathaniel Martello-White (C<em>ollateral</em>), Richie Campbell (<em>Liar</em>), Jumayn Hunter (Les Miserables), and Gary Beadle (<em>Summer of Rockets</em>). Mangrove was co-written by Alastair Siddons and Steve McQueen.</p>\n<p><strong>RED, WHITE AND BLUE (Premieres Friday, December 4)</strong><br />\nRed, White and Blue tells the true story of Leroy Logan, a young forensic scientist with a yearning to do more than his solitary laboratory work. When he sees his father assaulted by two policemen, he finds himself driven to revisiting a childhood ambition to become a police officer; an ambition borne from the naïve hope of wanting to change racist attitudes from within. First, Leroy has to face the consequences of his father’s disapproval, never mind the blatant racism he finds in his new role as a despised yet exemplary Constable in the Metropolitan Police Force. John Boyega (<em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>) and Steve Toussaint (<em>Prince of Persia</em>) star with talented newcomers Tyrone Huntley, Nathan Vidal and Jaden Oshenye. Red, White and Blue was co-written by Courttia Newland and Steve McQueen.</p>\n<p><strong>ALEX WHEATLE (Premieres Friday, December 11)</strong><br />\nAlex Wheatle follows the true story of award-winning writer, Alex Wheatle (Sheyi Cole), from a young boy through his early adult years. Having spent his childhood in a mostly white institutional care home with no love or family, he finally finds not only a sense of community for the first time in Brixton, but his identity and ability to grow his passion for music and DJing. When he is thrown in prison during the Brixton Uprising of 1981, he confronts his past and sees a path to healing. Sheyi Cole stars opposite Jonathan Jules. Alex Wheatle was co-written by Alastair Siddons and Steve McQueen.</p>\n<p><strong>EDUCATION (Premieres Friday, December 18)</strong><br />\nEducation is the coming of age story of 12-year-old Kingsley, a boy with a fascination for astronauts and rockets. When Kingsley is called to the Headmaster’s office for disruptive behaviour in class, he is shocked to discover his transfer to a school for those with “special needs.” Distracted by working two jobs, his parents are unaware of what was an unofficial segregation policy at play, preventing many Black children from having the education they deserve until a group of West Indian women take matters into their own hands. Newcomer Kenyah Sandy stars opposite Sharlene Whyte (We Hunt Together, Casualty), Daniel Francis (<em>Once Upon A Time, Homefront</em>), Tamara Lawrance (<em>The Long Song, Kindred</em>) and Josette Simon (<em>Wonder Woman, Silent Witness, Law &#38; Order: UK</em>). Education was co-written by Alastair Siddons and Steve McQueen.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/small-axe-lovers-rock-trailer/\">&#8216;Small Axe: Lovers Rock&#8217; Trailer: Steve McQueen Invites You to a Party</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=094rKAv8Dac:oR3kcwVcfjQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=094rKAv8Dac:oR3kcwVcfjQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=094rKAv8Dac:oR3kcwVcfjQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=094rKAv8Dac:oR3kcwVcfjQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=094rKAv8Dac:oR3kcwVcfjQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=094rKAv8Dac:oR3kcwVcfjQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/094rKAv8Dac\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 00:00:56 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Small-Axe-Lovers-Rock-Trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"edfd23d0d3a20a094ac557dc10ef98ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn9@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-42-432_5f1c19e52390e2b2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":25027,"destBytes":15430,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Small-Axe-Lovers-Rock-Trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn9@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-42-432_5f1c19e52390e2b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=094rKAv8Dac:oR3kcwVcfjQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn51@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-477_2b73efbc02b7bf3e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=094rKAv8Dac:oR3kcwVcfjQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-39-02-495_27e56a4d777ccffa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/094rKAv8Dac":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn99@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-39-03-328_0d8c16be25157033.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501151},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"Universal and Cinemark Strike a Deal for Shortened Theatrical Window – Here’s What You Need to Know","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646077","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-646079 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Universal-Cinemark-deal-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Universal Cinemark deal\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Universal-Cinemark-deal.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Universal-Cinemark-deal-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Several months after Universal Filmed Entertainment Group signed a deal with AMC Theatres, the company has now signed a separate deal with Cinemark Theatres with a different set of details giving movies a shortened theatrical window. Here&#8217;s what you need to know.<span id=\"more-646077\"></span></p>\n<p>According to Deadline, Universal has signed a multi-year deal with Cinemark, the third most popular movie theater chain in the United States (behind AMC and Regal). The new deal provides a 17 day theatrical window for every theatrical release from Universal and Focus Features, and if the movie opens to more than $50 million at the domestic box office, the theatrical window gets extended to 31 days. After those windows, Universal will be able to choose whether to take either type of movie to Premium Video on Demand, with Cinemark receiving a percentage of the money made through that revenue stream.</p>\n<p>Deadline also points out that just because a movie is made available on PVOD, that doesn&#8217;t mean it therefore must be pulled from theaters: the deal allows for bigger hits to remain in theaters for as long as possible and for both parties to try to make money on those titles in theaters and PVOD simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The specifics of the financial split are not being made public, but Deadline evidently got an inside look at how the money is being divided up:</p>\n<blockquote><p>About 10% of PVOD revenues on a title have been set aside for exhibition. Of that share, AMC and Cinemark respectively get 15%-17% of that (which translates to between 1%-2% of the entire PVOD pot of which a major studio typically realizes 80% in monies).</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;We are extremely pleased to further enhance our strong partnership with Universal as we evolve the exclusive theatrical window,&#8221; said Cinemark CEO <strong>Mark Zoradi</strong>. &#8220;We believe a more dynamic theatrical window, whereby movie theaters continue to provide an event-sized launching platform for films that maximize box office and bolsters the success of subsequent distribution channels, is in the shared best interests of studios, exhibitors and, most importantly, moviegoers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The terms of this deal sound very similar to the historic Universal AMC deal that was signed <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/universal-and-amc-deal/\">back in July</a>. The biggest difference, as far as I can tell, is that in this instance, they&#8217;re specifying $50 million domestic as a benchmark for &#8220;success&#8221; for new releases. The AMC deal operates the same way, but neither of the parties publicly released a number that a title needed to hit in order to cross that metaphorical threshold.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/universal-cinemark-deal/\">Universal and Cinemark Strike a Deal for Shortened Theatrical Window – Here&#8217;s What You Need to Know</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7eqbQ4YXQ2M:nUR0gtj0R3M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7eqbQ4YXQ2M:nUR0gtj0R3M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7eqbQ4YXQ2M:nUR0gtj0R3M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7eqbQ4YXQ2M:nUR0gtj0R3M:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7eqbQ4YXQ2M:nUR0gtj0R3M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7eqbQ4YXQ2M:nUR0gtj0R3M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7eqbQ4YXQ2M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 23:00:58 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Universal-Cinemark-deal-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"3a0ce2a001dd227ca625f61f3ad1a9a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn25@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-37-850_150da70229105da2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":35923,"destBytes":21960,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Universal-Cinemark-deal-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn25@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-37-850_150da70229105da2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7eqbQ4YXQ2M:nUR0gtj0R3M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn42@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-39-02-477_59ed45600e4659b9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7eqbQ4YXQ2M:nUR0gtj0R3M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn11@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-39-03-880_c1794c1b1ee0eb20.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7eqbQ4YXQ2M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn91@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-39-03-734_af58a53f8adf798c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501153},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"‘Dial M For Murder’ TV Show Being Developed as Anthology Series, May Star Alicia Vikander","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646031","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-646049 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Dial-M-For-Murder-TV-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Dial M For Murder TV\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Dial-M-For-Murder-TV.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Dial-M-For-Murder-TV-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>I once <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/answers-movies-that-actually-should-be-remade/\">suggested</a> that Hollywood should remake <strong><em>Dial M For Murder</em></strong>, playwright Frederick Knott&#8217;s dynamite stage play which was famously adapted into a movie by Alfred Hitchcock in 1954. Three years later, my suggestion is finally being heeded: a remake is being developed for television, with Academy Award winner <strong>Alicia Vikander</strong> executive producing and potentially starring in the project.<span id=\"more-646031\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Vikander, who won an Oscar for her performance in 2016&#8217;s <em>The Danish Girl</em>, is set to executive produce a <em>Dial M For Murder</em> limited series through her Vikarious Film production company. She&#8217;s eyeing a starring role in the show (though that has not been finalized yet), and this iteration reportedly &#8220;reimagines the classic suspense thriller story from the female perspective.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Michael Mitnick</strong> (<em>The Giver</em>) is creating the series and will serve as a writer with <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> and <em>The Sopranos</em> veteran <strong>Terence Winter</strong> overseeing the project as an executive producer. Mitnick and Winter previously worked together on <em>Vinyl</em>, Martin Scorsese&#8217;s short-lived HBO series. There is no director attached yet.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, this version of Dial M For Murder &#8220;is being developed as an anthology series with potential follow-up installments in the suspense thriller genre from a similarly female point of view.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The original play and Hitchcock&#8217;s 1954 movie told the story of a former tennis player (Ray Milland) who discovers that his wife (Grace Kelly) is having an affair with an American novelist (Robert Cummings), so he hires a small-time crook to murder her. As so often happens in crime stories like these, things don&#8217;t go according to plan and a series of unexpected events occurs, resulting in a thrilling conclusion. The story is expertly conceived and executed (Knotts wrote the film&#8217;s script based on his own play), and in stark contrast to a mystery like <em>The Big Sleep</em>, this one feels as if every single loose end is satisfactorily tied up.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JWP_hrNHSN4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>With the right material, Vikander can deliver a performance that goes toe to toe with anyone of her generation. I kind of love the idea of her stepping into a classic mystery environment like this, since she&#8217;s had some big misses in recent years. I&#8217;d love to see her have a bit of a resurgence, and in the meantime, allow me to take this opportunity to encourage you to seek out her work in Derek Cianfrance&#8217;s <em>The Light Between Oceans</em>, which is heartbreaking and profound and lovely and deeply, deeply human.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dial-m-for-murder-tv-show/\">&#8216;Dial M For Murder&#8217;

(I am not among those folks. It’s fine, but not as good as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Princess and the Frog</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or the original </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frozen</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) What the 2010 film doesn’t quite have in terms of its storytelling or character development, though, it does have in some often pastoral, vividly colorful animation. The film’s centerpiece moment is the song “I See The Light”, where Rapunzel and the raffish Flynn Rider share a duet as they let loose a couple of lanterns at a yearly event at the kingdom where Rapunzel is unknowingly the long-lost princess. The shot of the hundreds upon hundreds of lanterns flooding the night sky is a kind of shot that feels intentionally dazzling — we’re meant to be wowed by this image. This one, as nakedly pretty as it is, does the job right.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/jZDrwz.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>39. <i>Lady and the Tramp</i>: A nighttime shot of the city</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Bella Notte” is the most well-known part of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lady and the Tramp</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as two dogs culminate a romantic night out with a plate of spaghetti and meatballs behind the kitchen of Tony’s restaurant, with the owner and chef crooning the song to them. But it’s the shots </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the one we all know, of Lady and the Tramp meeting in the middle of a shared strand of spaghetti, that really stand out. With a chorus continuing “Bella Notte” to its conclusion, we get the hazy conclusion to the evening, with the camera panning up through the laundry lines and apartment buildings in the city. It’s a beautiful, intoxicating effect that only serves to heighten the love growing between our two heroes.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/vl5A7V.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>38. <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>: A kingdom asleep</strong></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sleeping Beauty</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the most beautiful film that Walt Disney Animation Studios has ever made. So it’s hard to choose just a couple of the film’s best shots, either for their beauty, their terror, or a mix of the two. One of the very best comes in the back half of the picture, after the fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merriweather have enacted their last-ditch plan to keep the kingdom unaware of Aurora’s coma after falling victim to Maleficent’s spell. So they put a spell of their own on the assembled, putting them to sleep until Aurora is hopefully revived. One of the shots capturing the result of that spell, as the entire kingdom seems to hover on the edge of dusk, is genuinely gorgeous, the kind of shot that feels like a Middle Ages work of art. The artistry of the film is unparalleled, as shots like this prove.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/ANoVRB.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>37. <i>Peter Pan</i>: Angry/jealous Tinker Bell</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putting it lightly, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peter Pan</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> does not have a great relationship with its female characters. Here’s a film in which, at one point, three mermaids attempt to drown and murder Wendy Darling for daring to be attracted to Peter Pan; Pan, who’s watching the whole thing go down, just laughing his head off. But the most memorable female character in the film, and arguably one of the most valuable symbols in the entirety of Disney’s history, is Tinker Bell. Her adoration of Peter, and concurrent envy at Wendy for striking his fancy, is a big part of her character development, but it’s first represented with a great bit that blends a visual gag with characterization. When Tink is inadvertently shoved into a drawer while trying to retrieve Peter’s shadow, and she realizes that Wendy’s getting close to Peter, she turns red with jealousy, literally. The character never speaks, but with moments like these, she never has to.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/BNpxx2.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>36.<i> Aladdin</i>: Group of Genies, led by the Ed Sullivan-style Genie</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone knows </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aladdin</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the film that introduced the world to the Genie. As voiced by Robin Williams, this animated character somehow embodies the irrepressible id of one of the most famous comedians of the 20th century. As much as Williams’ performance is a remarkable special effect of sorts, so too is the dexterous animation courtesy of supervising animator Eric Goldberg. One of many examples of how lively the animation of the Genie was comes courtesy of this shot, during the Genie’s introduction to Aladdin, in which he speeds through the steps of having a Genie with three wishes. Before he gets to the steps, he reveals that he’s a fabled character of myth, and naturally&#8230;turns into a caricature of Ed Sullivan, with a row of applauding Genies behind him. Try as it might, the live-action/CG remake from 2019 couldn’t help but come in second to singular animation like this.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/k8K1mx.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>35.<i> Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i>: Happily ever after</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disney animated features often end very quickly, especially those of the earlier eras. To wit: it doesn’t take much time after the dwarves fend off the evil Queen in her haggardly form for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to wrap up. Snow White is woken up by her handsome prince (someone who goes unnamed, please note), and he takes her upon his horse into the great unknown. That exciting post-happily-ever-after world is visualized only as a gleaming, impossibly bright sunrise (or sunset) in the film’s final shot. Just as the film set a template for the fairy-tale stories that Disney would tell for decades, so too is the last shot a sign of what would come in later films.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/1WqX1G.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>34. <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>: Rows of utensils dancing</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is now the established template for modern Disney animation was truly defined in this 1991 classic. One of the most memorable parts of the story is one of its musical numbers, “Be Our Guest”, in which the exuberant human-turned-candelabra Lumiere invites Belle to&#8230;well, be the guest of the many other humans-turned-inanimate objects in the Beast’s Castle, all of whom are so lonely because they haven’t had visitors in ages. Depressing setup aside, the song, written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, is a crowd-pleasing show-stopper. At one point, we see just how happy the kitchen staff is through a cascading shot of countless utensils dancing in rows, in rhythm. It’s a show-off moment for the animating team, and just delightful to watch.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/r8NXmw.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>33. <i>Fantasia 2000</i>: A destructive volcano</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1999 film </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fantasia 2000</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the finest, most underrated films in the Walt Disney Animation Studios canon. Its concluding segment, scored to Igor Stravinsky’s “Firebird Suite”, pays homage to the 1940 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fantasia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a number of ways: both films use Stravinsky pieces for key sequences about the natural world, and both films conclude with a sequence in which demonic forces attempt to destroy powers of good. In the end, evil fails where good triumphs, but in the “Firebird Suite” sequence, there’s a truly haunting image of the personification of the verdant forest being terrified and awestruck at the sight of the eponymous firebird decimating the forest surrounding a nearby volcano. Here is the power of hand-drawn animation at the period when it would begin to dwindle among Disney features. It’s a hell of a thing.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/xn5gJz.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>32.<i> Dumbo</i>: Pink elephants on parade</strong></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dumbo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was a famously low-budget affair, released merely months before the Disney Studios were brought into the WWII effort by the U.S. government and meant to recoup the lost costs sunk into </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinocchio</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fantasia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But a lower budget couldn’t stop the Disney animators from pushing themselves to bold new heights, as evinced in the “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. That scene occurs when Dumbo and his loquacious friend Timothy Q. Mouse get wildly drunk on champagne and have a shared hallucination in which a long line of wild elephants dance in front of them. (Because, as you know, this is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">children’s movie</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.) At one point, the pink elephants box themselves in, piling on top of each other in perfect framing with the shot itself, as if they’re aware of the camera filming them. Don’t ever let anyone tell you Disney Animation can’t get weird or wild. This scene is proof that they can.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/E87G0N.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>31. <i>Bambi</i>: Taking a fall on the ice</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Bambi grows up, both literally and metaphorically, he’s able to enjoy himself in the natural world. One of the most purely joyous moments, both in this 1942 classic and in all of Disney animation, comes when young Bambi and Thumper attempt to frolic and play on the snow and ice that have covered their home. The shot of them accidentally sailing across the ice is both very funny and genuinely quite pleasing — the older you get, the more enjoyable the scene becomes, if only because it arrives before either of these characters have to put away such childish jaunts. Add to that the fact that the dexterous animation of Bambi’s sticklike legs, each tripping over the other, is just very impressive to watch considering how much care had to go into each movement.

And it seems that the #SaveTheVentureBros. campaign has reached the ears of <strong>HBO Max</strong> head <strong>Andy Forssell</strong>, who teased that the streaming platform is &#8220;working on&#8221; ideas to revive the envelope-pushing animated series.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646047\"></span></p>\n<p>It came as quite a shock when Adult Swim <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-venture-bros-canceled/\">quietly canceled <em>The Venture Bros</em>.</a> earlier this fall, 17 years after the animated series made its debut on the network. The show — which followed the two adventure-craving Venture brothers Hank and Dean, their self-loathing father Dr. Rusty Venture, and their intrepid bodyguard Brock Samson as they squared off with a wide array of villains — had started off as a send-up of the classic cartoon <em>Jonny Quest,</em> but slowly <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-the-venture-bros-built-one-of-the-richest-funniest-and-most-detailed-fictional-universes-in-tv-history/\">evolved into a rich, complex animated series</a> with loyal fans that stuck by the series, even when its small team was only able to churn out 7 seasons over the course of nearly two decades.</p>\n<p>And as with all show&#8217;s with a small, but loyal following, a revival campaign went underway online, with fans imploring networks and streamers to #SaveTheVentureBros. And it seems like HBO Max general manager Andy Forssell heard the call, revealing in a tweet that the streaming service is &#8220;working on&#8221; ideas to revive the series.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Venture Bros fans are passionate, but incredibly civil.

Then it made headlines again with reports that the production was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/songbird-covid-protocols/\">not following COVID safety protocols</a>. And yet again, <em>Songbird</em> made headlines for the negative online buzz <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/songbird-trailer/\">around its trailer</a>, which showed the films — let&#8217;s say ill-advised — apocalyptic vision of the pandemic. But in perhaps the most positive piece of news, and for those nervous about going to see movies amid surging COVID-19 cases, <em>Songbird</em> has set its VOD release for this December.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646014\"></span></p>\n<p>Soon you too can see this irresponsible movie responsibly, with the coming premium video on-demand (PVOD) release of <em>Songbird</em>, which STX Entertainment has set for <strong>December 11, 2020</strong>. The film will be available for $19.99 for a 48-hour rental on all transactional platforms, according to an announcement by Adam Fogelson, chairman, STXfilms Motion Picture Group.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The pandemic has affected every aspect of our business, from production to release, but <i>Songbird</i> demonstrates that a nimble studio like STX can find effective and profitable ways to make their movies work, as we have similarly with <i>Greenland</i> and <i>My Spy</i> during these challenging times,&#8221; Fogelson said. &#8220;The show must go on. <i>Songbird</i> is a thrilling movie that will speak to audiences in this moment as it keeps them on the edge of their seats.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Directed by <strong>Adam Mason</strong> (<i>Into the Dark</i>), who also wrote the script with <strong>Simon Boyes</strong> (<i>Misconduct</i>), the movie stars <strong>KJ Apa</strong> (<em>Riverdale</em>) as a courier who is immune to the deadly COVID-23 virus, and attempts to save his girlfriend Sara (Sofia Carson) from being imprisoned in a quarantine camp. The movie also stars &#8220;<strong>Bradley Whitford</strong> and<strong> Demi Moore</strong> as a wealthy couple who may hold the key to Nico’s mission; <strong>Alexandra Daddario</strong> as a singer enmeshed in a messy and forbidden affair; <strong>Paul Walter Hauser</strong> as a disabled veteran whose best friend – a drone named Max – is his eyes and ears to a world that has left him behind; <strong>Craig Robinson</strong> as Nico’s boss; and <strong>Peter Stormare</strong> as the corrupt head of the city’s ‘sanitation’ department, which seizes those infected and transports them to the Q-Zone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here’s the synopsis for <em>Songbird</em>, which is produced by Bay:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the terrifying thriller <em>Songbird</em>, the COVID-23 virus has mutated and the world is in its fourth year of lockdown. Infected Americans are ripped from their homes and forced into quarantine camps known as Q-Zones, from which there is no escape, as a few brave souls fight back against the forces of oppression. Amid this dystopian landscape, a fearless courier, Nico (KJ Apa), who’s immune to the deadly pathogen, finds hope and love with Sara (Sofia Carson), though her lockdown prohibits them from physical contact. When Sara is believed to have become infected, Nico races desperately across the barren streets of Los Angeles in search of the only thing that can save her from imprisonment …or worse.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/songbird-vod-release/\">Michael Bay&#8217;s Pandemic Thriller &#8216;Songbird&#8217; Sets VOD Release for December</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=h1P1TLCJsPA:LhFdm1eJal4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=h1P1TLCJsPA:LhFdm1eJal4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=h1P1TLCJsPA:LhFdm1eJal4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=h1P1TLCJsPA:LhFdm1eJal4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=h1P1TLCJsPA:LhFdm1eJal4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=h1P1TLCJsPA:LhFdm1eJal4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/h1P1TLCJsPA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 21:00:27 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Songbird-1-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"be9f4b3eacddee3d95d1202771f7e9a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-38-067_36b35bc6cd6a069b.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":30104,"destBytes":18658,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Songbird-1-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn17@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-38-067_36b35bc6cd6a069b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=h1P1TLCJsPA:LhFdm1eJal4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn73@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-02-488_c6f66e4aec0dffcd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=h1P1TLCJsPA:LhFdm1eJal4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn68@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-39-03-608_a2f1bfd635354aad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/h1P1TLCJsPA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-39-02-460_ff4b498990d308d4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501153},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"Christopher Nolan is Fine With You Watching Christopher Nolan Movies On Your Phone, So We Can All Stop Talking About That Now","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646002","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christopher-nolan-iphone.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646032\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christopher-nolan-iphone-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"christopher nolan iphone\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christopher-nolan-iphone-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christopher-nolan-iphone-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christopher-nolan-iphone-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christopher-nolan-iphone.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s been a long running-joke/talking point that<strong> Christopher Nolan</strong> would rather you die in a house fire than watch one of his movies on an iPhone or an iPad or any other mobile device. It&#8217;s been blown out of proportion over the years due to Nolan&#8217;s strong embrace of the sacred theatrical experience, and it only got worse this year when many wondered why Nolan was so adamant about releasing <em>Tenet</em> in theaters rather than VOD. But now Nolan has weighed in on this himself and confirmed that really, it&#8217;s okay if you want to watch a Christopher Nolan movie on your phone. So maybe it&#8217;s time we all start talking about something else.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646002\"></span></p>\n<p>Christopher Nolan loves the theatrical experience. He&#8217;s talked about it many times, so much so that a narrative has taken hold suggesting Nolan would hate it if you watched one of his movies on a small iPhone screen. &#8220;Theatrical experience isn’t just about the size of the screen or the technology behind, although that’s a big part of it. It’s about an audience, the shared experience,&#8221; the filmmaker <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jake_coyle/associated-press-interview-with-christopher-nolan-on-dunkirk-424755737d29\">said</a> in the past. &#8220;What cinema gives you, unlike any other medium, is this fascinating and wonderful tension and dialogue between this intensely subjective experience you’re having from the imagery the filmmaker has put up there, and this extraordinarily empathetic sharing of that with audience around you. It’s a remarkable medium for that and that’s what defines it. What&#8217;s a movie? The only definition of a movie, really, is it’s shown in a movie theater.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And while Nolan himself never said the words &#8220;Don&#8217;t you <em>dare</em> watch one of my movies on a small screen!&#8221;, that&#8217;s how most people have decided to interpret statements like the one above. But in Tom Shone&#8217;s new book <em>The Nolan Variations </em>(via <a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link\" href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2020/11/christopher-nolan-watch-films-iphone-1234598710/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-ga=\"[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.indiewire.com/2020/11/christopher-nolan-watch-films-iphone-1234598710/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]\">Indiewire</a>), the <em>Tenet</em> director seems to set the record straight by flat-out stating that it&#8217;s okay to watch one of his big films on a smaller screen. But there&#8217;s a catch – he&#8217;s okay with people watching his stuff on a smaller screen as long as it&#8217;s first released in theaters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The reason I don’t [have a problem with watching a Nolan movie on a phone] is because it&#8217;s put into these big theaters as its primary form, or its initial distribution,&#8221; Nolan said. &#8220;And the experience trickles down, to the extent where, if you have an iPad and you’re watching a movie, you carry with you the knowledge and your understanding of what that cinematic experience would be, and you extrapolate that. So, when you watch a TV show on your iPad, your brain is in a completely different mindset.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In other words, if you need to watch a Nolan movie on an iPad, that&#8217;s fine – as long that movie had a chance to play on the biggest screen possible first. So we probably shouldn&#8217;t hold our breath for a Christopher Nolan Netflix movie anytime soon.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/christopher-nolan-iphone/\">Christopher Nolan is Fine With You Watching Christopher Nolan Movies On Your Phone, So We Can All Stop Talking About That Now</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jot7QRe0vJk:pf5fORUhTRQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jot7QRe0vJk:pf5fORUhTRQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jot7QRe0vJk:pf5fORUhTRQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jot7QRe0vJk:pf5fORUhTRQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jot7QRe0vJk:pf5fORUhTRQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jot7QRe0vJk:pf5fORUhTRQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jot7QRe0vJk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 22:30:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christopher-nolan-iphone-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"bf28b750620a71ada9c041797353b2de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn70@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-39-581_bb3356a76a7c7e04.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":44577,"destBytes":29996,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/christopher-nolan-iphone-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn70@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-39-581_bb3356a76a7c7e04.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jot7QRe0vJk:pf5fORUhTRQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-39-02-485_5abb2ffbe412a027.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jot7QRe0vJk:pf5fORUhTRQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn88@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-39-03-824_4b5017022f2397df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jot7QRe0vJk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-662_00e9005caaf2974d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501154},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"‘The Final Girl Support Group’: Upcoming Grady Hendrix Slasher Movie Homage Novel Being Turned Into a Series","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646034","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Final-Girl-Support-Group.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-646055\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Final-Girl-Support-Group-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"The Final Girl Support Group\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Final-Girl-Support-Group-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Final-Girl-Support-Group-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Final-Girl-Support-Group-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Final-Girl-Support-Group.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Annapurna has scooped up the rights to<strong> <em>The Final Girl Support Group</em></strong>, an upcoming novel from <strong>Grady Hendrix</strong>, and plan to turn it into a series. The book is an homage to slasher movies, following a group of &#8220;final girls&#8221; clearly inspired by the surviving female characters from titles like <em>Friday the 13th</em>, <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em>, <em>Halloween</em>, and <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. <strong>Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain</strong> are handling the script.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646034\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has the scoop on <em>The Final Girl Support Group</em>, a new series based on an upcoming book by Grady Hendrix. Here&#8217;s the synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The women in the Final Girl Support Group have been in therapy together for decades – ever since one was attacked by a cannibal family in Texas, by a machete wielding maniac at summer camp, by an older brother who returned to settle scores on Halloween, by a lunatic who allegedly entered their dreams. These are the middle-aged survivors of the real-life crimes the slasher movies are based on. Some of them are addicts, some are in denial, and some have become motivational speakers. And now the final girls are mysteriously dying, one by one.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Horror fans will immediately recognize that Hendrix is paying homage to titles <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em>, <em>Friday the 13th</em>, <em>Halloween</em>, and <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain, Co-creators of ABC’s <em>The</em> <em>Fix</em>, are writing the script while Hendrix will serve as executive producer. Hendrix is the author of books <i>Horrorstör</i>, <i>My Best Friend&#8217;s Exorcism</i>, <i>We Sold Our Souls</i>, <em>Paperbacks from Hell: The Twisted History of ’70s and ’80s Horror Fiction</em>, and the recently published <i>The Southern Book Club&#8217;s Guide to Slaying Vampires</i>. He also co-wrote scripts for films <em>Mohawk</em> and <em>Satanic Panic</em>.</p>\n<p>Having read most of Hendrix&#8217;s books, I&#8217;m now very excited about both this book and its TV adaptation. I&#8217;ll probably feel more confident about the TV adaptation once I learn who else is involved with it, and where it&#8217;s going to end up airing/streaming. But Hendrix is an incredibly clever writer who understands the horror genre front and back. Not only that, but he&#8217;s also quite good at crafting surprisingly emotional narratives around his horror scenarios. Both <em>My Best Friend&#8217;s Exorcism</em> and <em>The Southern Book Club&#8217;s Guide to Slaying Vampires</em> contained moments that ended up making me cry. Then again, everything makes me cry these days.</p>\n<p><em>The Final Girl Support Group</em> book will arrive on <strong>July 13, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-final-girl-support-group/\">&#8216;The Final Girl Support Group&#8217;: Upcoming Grady Hendrix Slasher Movie Homage Novel Being Turned Into a Series</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7SZaesQniQY:IlNcUCXTsYs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7SZaesQniQY:IlNcUCXTsYs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7SZaesQniQY:IlNcUCXTsYs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7SZaesQniQY:IlNcUCXTsYs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7SZaesQniQY:IlNcUCXTsYs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7SZaesQniQY:IlNcUCXTsYs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7SZaesQniQY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 23:30:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Final-Girl-Support-Group-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"8c136e88c2fa59ddc69ec65231ffc27a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-35-927_b3d9e62abe71c172.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":30615,"destBytes":16054,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Final-Girl-Support-Group-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-38-35-927_b3d9e62abe71c172.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7SZaesQniQY:IlNcUCXTsYs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn83@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-736_af2e1e74d072ed44.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7SZaesQniQY:IlNcUCXTsYs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-02-492_77e282db911ca202.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7SZaesQniQY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn67@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-39-02-457_c63524fb823df7ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501152},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"Judd Apatow Heads to Netflix for Comedy Set During the Pandemic","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=646051","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-646056 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Judd-Apatow-pandemic-comedy-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Judd Apatow pandemic comedy\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Judd-Apatow-pandemic-comedy.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Judd-Apatow-pandemic-comedy-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The United States is in the midst of a massive third wave of the coronavirus pandemic just as the holiday season begins to ramp up, and even with some promising recent developments about potential vaccines, one thing remains certain: COVID will be with us for a while longer yet. Not only in our day-to-day existence, but also in the movies we consume.</p>\n<p>Case in point: a new report says that <strong>Judd Apatow</strong> (<em>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</em>) has found his next directing project, and it will be a comedy film set during the pandemic. He&#8217;s making it at Netflix, which is the first time he&#8217;ll be directing a film for that streaming platform. Get some more details below.<br />\n<span id=\"more-646051\"></span></p>\n<p>According to Deadline, Apatow will produce and direct an untitled comedy set during the pandemic, which &#8220;follows a group of actors and actresses stuck inside a pandemic bubble at a hotel attempting to complete a film.&#8221; No casting decisions have been made yet, but the report states that meetings will be happening in the coming weeks and &#8220;insiders say the amount of juicy parts could lead to an all-star ensemble that could rival <em>Knives Out</em> and <em>The Disaster Artist</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to directing and producing, Apatow is also going to write the screenplay alongside <strong>Pam Brady</strong> (<em>South Park: Bigger, Longer &#38; Uncut</em>, <em>Team America: World Police</em>, <em>Hot Rod</em>). <strong>Barry Mendel</strong> will serve as an executive producer. He previously produced films like <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, <em>Rushmore</em>, and <em>Serenity</em>, and he&#8217;s produced every one of Apatow&#8217;s feature directorial efforts since 2009&#8217;s <em>Funny People</em>.</p>\n<p>Both Apatow and Brady have worked with Netflix in the past. Apatow co-created and executive produced the romantic drama series <em>Love</em>, while Brady created and executive produced the surreal Maria Bamford comedy series <em>Lady Dynamite</em>. But this is still yet another notable &#8220;get&#8221; for Netflix, which has been excellent at consistently luring top talent to create films for its streaming roster.</p>\n<p>Apatow has previously made his movies at Universal, including this year&#8217;s <em>The King of Staten Island</em>, which ended up being released directly to PVOD because of the pandemic. Apparently, Apatow&#8217;s move over to Netflix for this untitled pandemic comedy does not necessarily portend the destruction of his relationship with Universal; Deadline says it boiled down to Netflix having enough money and flexibility to be able to quickly finance the project whereas Universal is still trying to figure out its upcoming slate.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/apatow-pandemic-comedy/\">Judd Apatow Heads to Netflix for Comedy Set During the Pandemic</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HNTODi9mYeo:yFephMjFrkg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HNTODi9mYeo:yFephMjFrkg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HNTODi9mYeo:yFephMjFrkg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HNTODi9mYeo:yFephMjFrkg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HNTODi9mYeo:yFephMjFrkg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HNTODi9mYeo:yFephMjFrkg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HNTODi9mYeo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 20:30:46 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Judd-Apatow-pandemic-comedy-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c220920c0afb18cc64d5353b0e49147a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-21-788_b4b906171cdeac1e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":30964,"destBytes":18420,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Judd-Apatow-pandemic-comedy-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_6/2020/11/17/05-38-21-788_b4b906171cdeac1e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HNTODi9mYeo:yFephMjFrkg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn35@2020_3/2020/11/17/05-39-02-666_5a095a00b2024e9f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HNTODi9mYeo:yFephMjFrkg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn47@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-39-03-493_f7f995e4a689a036.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HNTODi9mYeo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn41@2020_4/2020/11/17/05-39-02-460_b30a0ff7e60b1d98.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501153},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"HBO Max is Finally Coming to Amazon Fire TV Devices","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645917","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-617398\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hbo-max-premiere-dates-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"hbo max premiere dates\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hbo-max-premiere-dates-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hbo-max-premiere-dates-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hbo-max-premiere-dates-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hbo-max-premiere-dates.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;Alexa, open HBO Max.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Roughly six months after its launch, WarnerMedia&#8217;s streaming platform <strong>HBO Max</strong> is finally making its debut on <strong>Amazon Fire TV</strong> devices starting this week. This rollout on a widely used streaming device will make HBO Max available to tens of millions of new customers. And it leaves HBO Max with one final major barrier: Roku.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645917\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>WarnerMedia</strong> announced Monday that HBO Max will begin rolling out on Amazon Fire TV streaming devices, Fire TV Edition smart TVs, and Fire tablets on <strong>Tuesday, November 17,</strong> bringing HBO Max to Amazon&#8217;s millions of customers about six months after the streaming platform first launched in May.</p>\n<p>Where before, Amazon customers only had access to HBO, they&#8217;ll now get to dive into HBO Max&#8217;s ridiculously stacked collection of titles, including those from Warner Bros., DC, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Turner Classic Movies, and Studio Ghibli. The HBO app on Fire TV and Fire tablets will automatically update to become the HBO Max app. HBO Max will also be compatible with the entire Fire TV line-up including the new Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite, and of course, Amazon Alexa.</p>\n<p>Under the new deal with Amazon, existing HBO subscribers who purchased the subscription through Amazon&#8217;s Prime Video Channels will have access to HBO Max at no additional cost. New customers can also subscribe to HBO Max directly in the app, and additionally, all existing HBO Max customers, regardless of whether they subscribe to Amazon, can now access all of HBO Max via supported Fire TV and Fire tablet devices using their existing provider credentials.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very excited that Amazon customers will now be able to enjoy the best-in-class content that lives within HBO Max,&#8221; said Tony Goncalves, Head of Sales and Distribution for WarnerMedia, in a statement. &#8220;Our continued goal is to make HBO Max and its unparalleled content available to customers across all the devices they love. Fire TV is a favorite among customers and we look forward to working with the Amazon team to engage and grow our existing subscriber base by showcasing all that HBO Max has to offer.</p>\n<p>Amazon Fire TV is the most used streaming media player family in the U.S., and its absence from the streaming devices were a major barrier for HBO Max&#8217;s reach — making it hard for the new streaming platform to compete with other competitors like fellow newcomer Disney+, let alone giants like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon&#8217;s own Prime Video. But HBO Max by far has the best library of all streaming services, including Netflix, which tens of millions of Fire TV and Roku users weren&#8217;t able to access due to WarnerMedia&#8217;s tangled distribution negotiations. Per <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hbo-max-amazon-finally-strike-deal-to-bring-app-to-fire-tv-devices?utm_medium=social&#38;utm_source=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the previously launched HBO Go and HBO Now apps were treated like channels by Amazon and sold through the company&#8217;s a la cart subscription offering. But the conflict arose when WarnerMedia wanted HBO Max to be treated like a standalone service like Netflix or Disney+, resulting in these long, drawn-out negotiations that led to HBO Max being unavailable on Fire TV for months. The confusing branding (HBO? HBO Go?) didn&#8217;t help.</p>\n<p>But this debut on Amazon Fire TV devices suggest that an HBO Max rollout on Roku, the last major streaming device, is on its way.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hbo-max-on-amazon-fire-tv-devices/\">HBO Max is Finally Coming to Amazon Fire TV Devices</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jLLpgGaprsc:Ulyps78z8-k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jLLpgGaprsc:Ulyps78z8-k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jLLpgGaprsc:Ulyps78z8-k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jLLpgGaprsc:Ulyps78z8-k:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jLLpgGaprsc:Ulyps78z8-k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jLLpgGaprsc:Ulyps78z8-k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jLLpgGaprsc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 17:30:08 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hbo-max-premiere-dates-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"faee3c1cb9786896966169d3d95d487f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-21-665_f5b51773edb5d93d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":65773,"destBytes":47300,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/hbo-max-premiere-dates-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-38-21-665_f5b51773edb5d93d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jLLpgGaprsc:Ulyps78z8-k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn56@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-39-02-550_d1ddf28e363cd7b5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jLLpgGaprsc:Ulyps78z8-k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn91@2020_1/2020/11/17/05-39-03-635_1a8b7fd0431466e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jLLpgGaprsc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn2@2020_4/2020/11/17/05-39-02-555_adb41a2c3356dd33.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501158},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","title":"‘Home Alone’ Director Chris Columbus is Not Happy About That Disney+ Reboot","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645938","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-596362 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-700x377.jpg\" alt=\"home alone reboot\" width=\"700\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-700x377.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-360x194.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-768x414.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Chris Columbus</strong>, who directed the Christmas classics <strong><em>Home Alone</em></strong> and<strong> <em>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</em></strong>, has some choice words for where Disney can leave the change, you filthy animal. The <em>Home Alone</em> director is not happy about the <em>Home Alone</em> reboot in the works at <strong>Disney+</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/home-alone-reboot-cast/\">which is set to star <em>Jojo Rabbit</em> scene-stealer <strong>Archie Yates</strong></a> and be directed by <strong>Dan Mazer</strong> (<em>Dirty Grandpa</em>). And while he didn&#8217;t go as far as to call the House of Mouse a filthy animal, the sentiment is the same.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645938\"></span></p>\n<p>While on the press circuit for his latest holiday movie, <em>The Christmas Chronicles 2</em>, the topic of Chris Columbus&#8217; 1990 Christmas classic <em>Home Alone</em> inevitably came up. But in his interview with <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/home-alone-30-anniversary-chris-columbus-trump-cameo-2020-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insider</a>, Columbus had less than sweet things to say about the upcoming Disney+ reboot of <em>Home Alone,</em> which he revealed he wasn&#8217;t even consulted on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Nobody got in touch with me about it, and it’s a waste of time as far as I’m concerned. What’s the point? I’m a firm believer that you don’t remake films that have had the longevity of <em>Home Alone</em>. You’re not going to create lightning in a bottle again. It’s just not going to happen. So why do it? It’s like doing a paint-by-numbers version of a Disney animated film — a live-action version of that. What’s the point? It’s been done. Do your own thing. Even if you fail miserably, at least you have come up with something original.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p data-pw-in-article=\"true\">Columbus&#8217; criticism of Disney is not without evidence: Disney&#8217;s abundant remakes of its animated classics have frequently been criticized for being pale imitations of the originals. And with <em>Home Alone</em> on frequent rotation on TV and cable every Christmas, it will be difficult for any remake to try to put its own spin on a beloved film that is still very fresh in people&#8217;s memories. But <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-plus-year-two/\">Disney+ needs original content</a>, and the <em>Home Alone</em> IP was fresh for the remaking.</p>\n<p data-pw-in-article=\"true\">The <em>Home Alone </em>reboot is currently in production, but on hold due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Details on the <em>Home Alone</em> reboot haven&#8217;t been readily available, but the story is said to focus on a young boy named Max who goes to war with a husband and wife after he takes a porcelain doll from them. The <em>Home Alone</em> reboot is set to be directed by Dan Mazer (<em>Dirty Grandpa</em>, <em>I Give It a Year</em>) and will star <em>Jojo Rabbit</em> supporting actor Archie Yates in the lead role. He&#8217;ll be joined by <em>Saturday Night Live</em> alums <strong>Kenan Thompson</strong> and <strong>Chris Parnell</strong>, <em>Toy Story 4</em> voice star <strong>Ally Maki</strong>, Irish actress <strong>Aisling Bea</strong>, comedian <strong>Pete Holmes</strong>, <em>Veep</em> star <strong>Timothy Simons</strong>, <strong>Rob Delaney</strong> and <strong>Ellie Kemper</strong> as the main character&#8217;s parents, and <em>SNL</em> writer <strong>Mikey Day</strong>, who is also co-writing the <em>Home Alone</em> reboot with <strong>Streeter Seidel</strong>. And while Columbus is not on board, there are rumors that original <em>Home Alone</em> star <strong>Macaulay Culkin</strong> might make a cameo, but that has yet to be confirmed.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/chris-columbus-disney-home-alone-reboot/\">&#8216;Home Alone&#8217; Director Chris Columbus is Not Happy About That Disney+ Reboot</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=clnt3qkpPe4:Oxh1_4eEwuk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=clnt3qkpPe4:Oxh1_4eEwuk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=clnt3qkpPe4:Oxh1_4eEwuk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=clnt3qkpPe4:Oxh1_4eEwuk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=clnt3qkpPe4:Oxh1_4eEwuk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=clnt3qkpPe4:Oxh1_4eEwuk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/clnt3qkpPe4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 21:30:55 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-700x377.jpg","linkMd5":"db505b194f06f5e1a95f55ef997979b6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn13@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-21-796_6fcc1e7656e204c0.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":377,"sourceBytes":28115,"destBytes":11782,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/home-alone-2-700x377.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn13@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-38-21-796_6fcc1e7656e204c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-03-413_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=clnt3qkpPe4:Oxh1_4eEwuk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn79@2020_2/2020/11/17/05-39-02-792_6a459f302dbb9efc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-410_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=clnt3qkpPe4:Oxh1_4eEwuk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn54@2020_4/2020/11/17/05-39-02-529_3d23fab11d4bcd1f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/clnt3qkpPe4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn47@2020_5/2020/11/17/05-39-04-317_c1f9020b361cd823.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605591501151}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 13:38:21","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 05:38:21 +0000","fetchMs":76,"handleMs":708,"totalMs":50744,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"89e37574a7fc667116f3f58af6d0b714","hostName":"us-035*","requestId":"ee1effaf07f14f4798c6ce9c562e7eb0_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":9984634,"bgimgsTotal":19,"bgimgsGithubTotal":19,"articlesImgsTotal":98,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":98,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":4,"myreaderx14":4,"myreaderx7":4,"myreaderx15":2,"myreaderx6":4,"myreaderx16":3,"myreaderx10":3,"myreaderx32":4,"myreaderx4":3,"myreaderx3":4,"myreaderx11":4,"myreaderx33":4,"myreaderx2":4,"myreaderx12":4,"myreaderx13":4,"myreaderx1":4,"myreaderx30":3,"myreaderx31":3,"myreaderx18":4,"myreaderx19":2,"myreaderx":4,"myreaderx25":4,"myreaderx27":3,"myreaderx21":2,"myreaderx22":3,"myreaderx23":3,"myreaderx24":2,"myreaderx5oss":2,"myreaderx29":4},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
