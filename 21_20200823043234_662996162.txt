But, via an impressive piece of art &#8220;drawn&#8221; by Herman, the cast and director Sandberg, who confirmed he was returning to direct the sequel, revealed that the <em>Shazam 2</em> title is officially <em><strong>Shazam: Fury of the Gods</strong></em><em>.</em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We have a title! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shazam?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Shazam</a>!

How mysterious! It sounds like the plot of the <em>Shazam</em> sequel is venturing into the divine. And Shazam certainly comes with lots of deific lore. The character derives his powers from the gods, with &#8220;Shazam&#8221; standing for the six immortal elders who grant him his superpowers: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. Could Shazam end up face to face with the gods who granted him his powers? We&#8217;ll have to see.</p>\n<p>But what else do we know about <em>Shazam: Fury of the Gods</em>? According to Asher, there may be a &#8220;secret cameo,&#8221; and according to Good, there are &#8220;new villains&#8221; — plural, as Levi emphasized. And according to panel crasher Sinbad, who appeared as a gag about the number of people who thought he starred in the first film, there will actually be an appearance from him (or probably not).</p>\n<p><em>Shazam!</em> flew into theaters in 2019 to <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/shazam-review/\">rave reviews</a> and a $364 million worldwide box office haul, with a sequel <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/shazam-sequel/\">greenlit shortly</a> after the Easter holiday opening exceeded expectations. The first film’s writer <strong>Henry Gayden</strong> is set to return alongside director <strong>David F.

Their efforts paid off: this summer, HBO Max <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/snyder-cut-on-hbo-max/\">announced</a> that it will be spending considerably more than $30 million for Snyder to deliver a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-snyder-cut-will-be-a-radical-rethinking-of-justicle-league/\">radical rethinking</a>&#8221; of the movie to the streaming service next year.</p>\n<p>Today, Snyder took the virtual stage at DC FanDome for a panel devoted to his upcoming iteration where he released <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/snyder-cut-trailer/\">a new trailer</a>, thanked fans for their enthusiasm, had a bizarre Q&#38;A session where he asked fans questions, and revealed that his vision is going to be split into four hours on HBO Max. Here are the highlights from the panel.<br />\n<span id=\"more-632970\"></span></p>\n<p>The whole thing kicked off with a little burst of behind-the-scenes footage of Snyder and his actors on the set from way back in 2016, but things got weird almost immediately when, instead of acknowledging that people like <strong>Ben Affleck</strong>, <strong>Gal Gadot</strong>, <strong>Ray Fisher</strong>, and <strong>Henry Cavill</strong> had sent over pre-recorded messages of them reading fan questions aloud, Snyder inexplicably tried to make it seem as if he was having a live conversation with them in the moment.</p>\n<p>Affleck asked who his favorite superhero is. Answer: <em>Watchmen</em>&#8216;s Dr. Manhattan, because &#8220;he&#8217;s a super cool quantum superhero who, time, space, reality, all those things are at his fingertips.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cavill asked what dynamic between the Justice League characters is important to preserve in his movie. &#8220;I think the important thing for me is that as the Justice League comes together, basically they&#8217;re loners, right?&#8221; Snyder said. &#8220;You have Batman, his only buddy is Alfred, really. You&#8217;ve got Wonder Woman, who after Steve [Trevor]&#8217;s demise, she&#8217;s kind of keeping quiet. You have Flash, who&#8217;s got these powers but is kind of alone in the world. You have Cyborg, who in a lot of ways is not really happy about what&#8217;s happened to him – this transformation, he&#8217;s coming to terms with it. And then you have Aquaman, who also is this loner. Thematically, them coming together, forming a family and finding in each other support, I think that&#8217;s really what, in the end, drove me to want to see this happen or see them come together&#8230;it&#8217;s a fun and awesome dynamic, but there&#8217;s a &#8216;why&#8217; of doing it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ray Fisher asked which character Snyder is most excited to fully flesh out in his cut of the movie. &#8220;Of course it&#8217;s Cyborg,&#8221; Snyder replied. &#8220;Cyborg is the heart of the movie. Cyborg is the thing that in the end, holds the team together in a lot of ways. I&#8217;m excited for fans to see just how that is realized on camera.&#8221; (Me too, because calling Cyborg the &#8220;heart of the movie&#8221; is a far cry from &#8220;barely a character,&#8221; which is how I&#8217;d refer to him in the theatrical version.)</p>\n<p>Next, Snyder talked about how he and writer Chris Terrio viewed this story through the Joseph Cambell-ian lens of a classic hero&#8217;s journey structure. &#8220;The notion that we would be creating a team and say they&#8217;re the knights of the round table joining together for an epic adventure, and this is the call to action film that brings them, as a story, that brings them all together.&#8221; That certainly makes it sound like he had much larger plans for this cast and these characters in future movies, but it remains to be seen if he&#8217;ll ever be able to get them all back together for more. (I guess anything can happen, as the very existence of this Snyder Cut proves.)</p>\n<p>Ezra Miller wondered if we&#8217;d be seeing more Flash in this cut, and Snyder responded that we would be seeing &#8220;tons more&#8221; of that character. &#8220;I have a huge love for The Flash&#8230;I think people are going to see a lot more of the Flash and going to get to see more of his emotional arc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Patty Jenkins sent in a video asking if Snyder could reveal something he&#8217;s never said about the movie before, and this was the morsel he teased: &#8220;You&#8217;re going to see something with Flash in this film I don&#8217;t think that you&#8217;ve ever been seen before. Something that has to do with his abilities. Because, you know, he&#8217;s a quantum character. He interacts with time and space, so you might see him do something that is timely.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After a lengthy (and occasionally uncomfortable-to-watch) conversation with a couple of fans who fawned all over him and his artistic vision, Snyder finally got to the real meat of the panel in its closing minutes. According to him, the movie is &#8220;going to be in four parts, one hour each. So four hours of <em>Justice League</em> is coming your way. We&#8217;re going to work on a way of bundling it together at the end, so you can watch it as a single film if that&#8217;s the way you want to experience it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Additionally, Snyder talked about how the movie might be available beyond the confines of HBO Max. &#8220;To my international fans and everyone watching all over the world, don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t have HBO Max because we&#8217;re working on a distribution plan, so I promise you that you&#8217;re going to get a chance to see it.&#8221; It&#8217;s unclear if it will only be available elsewhere in markets that don&#8217;t have HBO Max access, and we&#8217;re unsure of what the timing might be on that international release – the details of the HBO Max contract may have a period of exclusivity built in. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll hear more about that as the release gets closer.</p>\n<p>Zack Snyder&#8217;s <em>Justice League</em> is set to debut on HBO Max sometime in <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/snyder-cut-dc-fandome/\">Zack Snyder&#8217;s &#8216;Justice League&#8217; Will Be Four Hours Long [DC FanDome]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bdHA9uUT6mM:PchtK0C2490:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bdHA9uUT6mM:PchtK0C2490:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bdHA9uUT6mM:PchtK0C2490:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bdHA9uUT6mM:PchtK0C2490:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bdHA9uUT6mM:PchtK0C2490:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bdHA9uUT6mM:PchtK0C2490:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/bdHA9uUT6mM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 22:31:03 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Justice-League-Panel-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"bc5e20bf84ba363b83c0850af570d1bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/23/04-31-50-209_d27742558df185e9.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31652,"destBytes":18770,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Justice-League-Panel-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/23/04-31-50-209_d27742558df185e9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-15-417_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bdHA9uUT6mM:PchtK0C2490:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/23/04-32-15-311_22fa3edf750fccb8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-16-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bdHA9uUT6mM:PchtK0C2490:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/23/04-32-16-123_a286aa5fa0b938a0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/bdHA9uUT6mM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-15-377_c1755b1cf7864ced.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598157109902},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","title":"‘Zack Snyder’s Justice League’ Trailer: The Snyder Cut Rises","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632922","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633045 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Zack-Snyders-Justice-League-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Zack-Snyders-Justice-League.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Zack-Snyders-Justice-League-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Fan&#8217;s demanded it, and now it&#8217;s a reality. Well, almost. <strong><em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em></strong>, aka the Snyder Cut, will find its way onto HBO Max in 2021, giving fans a chance to see <strong>Zack Snyder</strong>&#8216;s uncompromised vision. While Snyder&#8217;s name is still on the theatrically-released <em>Justice League</em>, the filmmaker parted ways with the project due to personal matters, and Joss Whedon came in to handle reshoots.</p>\n<p>Ever since then, hardcore Snyder fans have been loudly decrying this as the greatest travesty in the history of cinema, demanding access to Snyder&#8217;s preferred version of the film. For a while, it seemed like it would never happen – but in the name of promoting HBO Max, Warner Bros. gave in, and Snyder has been working on piecing his cut together. And today, during DC Fandome, a trailer was released.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-632922\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z6512XKKNkU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Here it is, folks. The fruits of the &#8220;Release the Snyder Cut&#8221; movement&#8217;s labor. Warner Bros. will exclusively premiere <em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em> on HBO Max in 2021, and the first real trailer can be seen above. Behind-the-scenes stories about the Snyder Cut are all over the place, but here&#8217;s the gist of it: Snyder shot a lot of footage, but, following the death of his daughter, stepped away from the project. After he left, Joss Whedon came in and did extensive reshoot work, resulting in a film that received mixed reviews and so-so box office.</p>\n<p>Ever since there, fans have operated under the assumption that if Snyder had remained with the project the finished film would&#8217;ve been better. Soon, that theory will be put to the test.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to thank HBO Max and Warner Brothers for this brave gesture of supporting artists and allowing their true visions to be realized. Also a special thank you to all of those involved in the SnyderCut movement for making this a reality,&#8221; Snyder said when the project was officially announced.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks to the efforts of a lot people, we’re excited to bring fans this highly anticipated version of <em>Justice League</em>,&#8221; added Toby Emmerich, Chairman, Warner Bros. Pictures Group. &#8220;This feels like the right time to share Zack’s story, and HBO Max is the perfect platform for it. We’re glad the creative planets aligned, allowing us to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em>, fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes – Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash – it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.</p>\n<p>The<em> Justice League</em> screenplay is by Chris Terrio, story by Chris Terrio &#38; Zack Snyder, based on characters from DC, Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The film’s producers are Charles Roven, Deborah Snyder, with executive producers Christopher Nolan, Emma Thomas, Jim Rowe, Ben Affleck, Wesley Coller, Curtis Kanemoto, and Chris Terrio.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/snyder-cut-trailer/\">&#8216;Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League&#8217; Trailer: The Snyder Cut Rises</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0L3UVQ_ivyU:RqrN9ssfyao:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0L3UVQ_ivyU:RqrN9ssfyao:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0L3UVQ_ivyU:RqrN9ssfyao:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0L3UVQ_ivyU:RqrN9ssfyao:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0L3UVQ_ivyU:RqrN9ssfyao:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0L3UVQ_ivyU:RqrN9ssfyao:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/0L3UVQ_ivyU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 21:58:39 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Zack-Snyders-Justice-League-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"9ef2f6fb669b00ee8f8e4c44ebb0e592","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn10@2020_3/2020/08/23/04-31-50-209_4010899a65fc5632.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31243,"destBytes":20244,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Zack-Snyders-Justice-League-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn10@2020_3/2020/08/23/04-31-50-209_4010899a65fc5632.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-15-417_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0L3UVQ_ivyU:RqrN9ssfyao:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/23/04-32-15-339_497079ed835662b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-16-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0L3UVQ_ivyU:RqrN9ssfyao:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn76@2020_3/2020/08/23/04-32-15-341_18e9fc4b63ca5a45.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/0L3UVQ_ivyU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/23/04-32-15-233_a4780143d48a1d34.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598157109902},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","title":"‘The Flash’ Will Feature the Birth of the Cinematic Multiverse, and Batman Makes Barry Allen a New Suit [DC FanDome]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632965","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-633022 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Flash-DC-FanDome-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Flash DC FanDome\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Flash-DC-FanDome.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Flash-DC-FanDome-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The Flash has been the subject of two television shows, multiple video games, and several movie appearances over the years, but the Scarlet Speedster has not received a solo live-action film&#8230;yet. That&#8217;s about to change in 2022 with Warner Bros.&#8217; <strong><em>The Flash</em></strong>, which will see <em>It</em> and <em>It Chapter Two</em> director <strong>Andy Muschietti</strong> put the spotlight directly on <strong>Ezra Miller</strong>&#8216;s socially awkward iteration of Barry Allen.</p>\n<p>At DC FanDome today, Andy was joined by his sister and producer <strong>Barbara Muschietti</strong>, writer <strong>Christina Hodson</strong>, and Miller himself to talk about the future of this character, who we haven&#8217;t seen since his goofy appearance in 2017&#8217;s <em>Justice League</em>. Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about <em>The Flash</em> DC FanDome panel.<span id=\"more-632965\"></span></p>\n<p>Miller, who seemed very much like a younger, skinnier version of Jack Black on this panel, spent most of his screen time dropping random &#8220;Flash Facts&#8221; that oddly had very little to do with The Flash or this movie. But there was plenty of concrete information about the new film that has us curious about the possibilities of what it could mean within the larger DCEU.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Telling the story of one of the greatest superheroes of the DC world is a challenge, but the most important thing is that it gets to your heart,&#8221; Andy Muschietti said. Miller agreed: &#8220;You meet Andy, and you immediately can understand why he&#8217;s the perfect choice for this movie. It&#8217;s his compassion, his priority in this film in finding the heart of the story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But while the heart has to be there, it naturally needs to look amazing, too. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to see Andy&#8217;s version of the Speed Force,&#8221; Hodson said. &#8220;He happened to have done some doodles that I may or may not have taken and kept. They are literally unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen before.&#8221; That sounds like it could be a very cool thing indeed, since Hodson has steeped herself in Flash lore and has seen plenty of bonkers art in comic book runs like <em>Flashpoint</em>.</p>\n<p>Hodson pointed out that Flash&#8217;s abilities allow him to stand alone in the realm of DC. &#8220;Batman lost his parents, Superman lost his planet, Harley Quinn lost her egg sandwich, but Barry, because he&#8217;s got this ability to go back and manipulate time, he&#8217;s the only one who can actually go and change his own personal story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Muschietti, who referred to this as &#8220;a time travel story,&#8221; added on to that: &#8220;His mother was murdered, his father was trained and incarcerated, and all his journey from then was a man trying to make things right&#8230;the script really capture his loquacity, his personality&#8230;he&#8217;s someone who has the power of changing events of the past, but by doing so, can deteriorate the very fabric of the space-time continuum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Time travel isn&#8217;t simple,&#8221; Hodson warned. &#8220;It&#8217;s not always a straightforward case of, &#8216;go back and change one thing, and another thing changes in the future.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Miller once again confirmed that this movie is kicking down the door to the multiverse and ushering in a chaotic new energy for the DCEU. &#8220;This film is immensely important, because if you look around the DC Universe, obviously you have all of these characters that exist within their own bubbles. We even have now multiple iterations of the same story. This movie, by opening that door that <em>Flashpoint</em> did in the comics, all of these stories and characters can start to collide&#8230;it blows our minds, the levels of possibility that exist within the context of this character, this story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(Interestingly, the footage from DC properties that was shown over that last quote included some shots from HBO&#8217;s Watchmen, perhaps hinting that some of those characters could, maybe, potentially, be involved in some way.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cinematic multiverse is going to be born out of this movie,&#8221; Hodson said. &#8220;It&#8217;s born out of Barry&#8217;s story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Filming hasn&#8217;t begun yet, but Muschietti did unveil two pieces of concept art from the movie. In addition to the image at the top of this page of Miller&#8217;s Flash and <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/michael-keaton-batman/\">Michael Keaton&#8217;s Batman</a> fighting together, there&#8217;s also a closer look at The Flash&#8217;s new suit:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-633023 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Flash-Concept-Art-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Flash Concept Art\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Flash-Concept-Art.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Flash-Concept-Art-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;As you can see, it&#8217;s more organic,&#8221; Andy Muschietti explained. &#8220;You can see light embedded in it. It has been built by his friend Bruce Wayne, this time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The panel ended on a bit of a silly note, as all the talk about the multiverse took a turn toward the goofy with Muschietti saying he wants to see Flash cross over with <em>Game of Thrones</em> to decrease the amount of time it takes to get from Winterfell to King&#8217;s Landing. (He clearly didn&#8217;t watch the last few seasons, when that journey basically happened in a flash without Barry Allen&#8217;s help.) As for Miller, he jokingly said he wanted to see The Flash encounter Nicolas Cage – not the version of Superman that Cage never ended up playing for Tim Burton back in the day, but &#8220;Nicolas Cage the person, in this world, who I believe probably does have the ability to transcend spacetime.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>The Flash</em> speeds into theaters on <strong>June 3</strong>, <strong>2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-flash-will-feature-the-birth-of-the-cinematic-multiverse-and-batman-makes-barry-allen-a-new-suit-dc-fandome/\">&#8216;The Flash&#8217; Will Feature the Birth of the Cinematic Multiverse, and Batman Makes Barry Allen a New Suit [DC FanDome]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9CgvniQxgbE:hPeO5EYv4gA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9CgvniQxgbE:hPeO5EYv4gA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9CgvniQxgbE:hPeO5EYv4gA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9CgvniQxgbE:hPeO5EYv4gA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9CgvniQxgbE:hPeO5EYv4gA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9CgvniQxgbE:hPeO5EYv4gA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/9CgvniQxgbE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 19:39:01 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Flash-DC-FanDome-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"01d2b0d6aa8df53351e57592b24a0144","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn14@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-31-50-249_583a46f94e11fd21.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":35851,"destBytes":23318,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Flash-DC-FanDome-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn14@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-31-50-249_583a46f94e11fd21.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Flash-Concept-Art-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_5/2020/08/23/04-32-15-314_f103076d712b402f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-15-417_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9CgvniQxgbE:hPeO5EYv4gA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn39@2020_6/2020/08/23/04-32-15-539_63c6197b905f7165.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-16-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9CgvniQxgbE:hPeO5EYv4gA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/23/04-32-15-275_775ac5f339042c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/9CgvniQxgbE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/23/04-32-15-359_4d3a548b9a6059c4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598157109910},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","title":"‘Black Adam’ Gives a First Look at Dwayne Johnson’s Powerful Anti-Hero and the Justice Society of America [DC FanDome]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633049","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633073 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blackadam-flying-jsa-700x324.jpg\" alt=\"Black Adam First Look - DC FanDome\" width=\"700\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blackadam-flying-jsa-700x324.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blackadam-flying-jsa-360x167.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blackadam-flying-jsa-768x356.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/blackadam-flying-jsa.jpg 1052w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>Black Adam</em></strong> has been with <strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong> for over a decade.

As Johnson noted, this characer &#8220;one of the most powerful superheroes, anti-heroes, villains, or whatever you want to call him.&#8221; While superheroes tend to show some restraint when dealing with those who oppose them, Black Adam doesn&#8217;t know the meaning of the word. He&#8217;s explosive and dangerous, but that&#8217;s what makes him likable in the eyes of Dwayne Johnson.</p>\n<p>While answering fan questions about Black Adam, Johnson said, &#8220;One of the things I always loved and admired is that he&#8217;s an anti-hero. I love that the lie is a little blurred. He has his own sense of Black Adam justice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s something about Black Adam&#8217;s origins as a slave that resonates with Johnson as well. He added, &#8220;He&#8217;s felt the burdens and the pressures of a larger entity holding him down, until he can&#8217;t take it anymore. When you come from that place, it&#8217;s just a different energy and vibe, a different mana. That informs how he operates, sees justice and delivers justice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When it comes to which version of Black Adam we&#8217;ll see on the big screen, Johnson wasn&#8217;t quite as forthcoming.

runaway hit when it arrived in theaters back in 2016. But we can&#8217;t disregard it completely since it did give us the gifts of <strong>Margot Robbie</strong> as Harley Quinn,<strong> Jai Courtney</strong> as Captain Boomerang, and <strong>Viola Davis</strong> as Amanda Waller. They&#8217;re all back in <strong><em>The Suicide Squad</em></strong>, the latest iteration of the DC Comics villain ensemble, this time with <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> franchise director <strong>James Gunn</strong> behind the camera, and an insane new roster of cast members. If the <em>Suicide Squad</em> featurette that just debuted is any indicator, you&#8217;re gonna forget all about that other <em>Suicide Squad</em> movie.<span id=\"more-632996\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Suicide Squad Featurette</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VImYeXnr13Q?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a trailer, but this is an awesome look at the DC Comics movie. Every character looks pulled straight from the pages of the comics by John Ostrander, and it takes us out of that dull, dark, and dingy look of the first <em>Suicide Squad</em> movie, I think it&#8217;s safe to say we&#8217;re going to get something completely different from James Gunn here.</p>\n<p><em>The Suicide Squad</em> has a cast that&#8217;s even more stacked than the first movie. Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney, Viola Davis, and Joel Kinnaman all reprising their roles, but we have a huge roster of new cast members joining the fray. <strong>Idris Elba</strong>, <strong>John Cena</strong>, <strong>Storm Reid</strong>, <strong>Flula Borg</strong>, <strong>Nathan Fillion</strong>, <strong>Peter Capaldi</strong>, <strong>Pete Davidson</strong>, <strong>David Dastmalchian</strong>, <strong>Daniela Melchior</strong>, <strong>Steve Agee</strong>, <strong>Alice Braga</strong>, <strong>Sean Gunn</strong>, <strong>Michael Rooker</strong>, <strong>Taika Waititi</strong>, <strong>Joaquín Cosío</strong>, <strong>Mayling Ng</strong>, <strong>Juan Diego Botto</strong>, <strong>Tinashe Kajese</strong>, <strong>Julio Ruiz</strong>, and <strong>Jennifer Holland</strong> all have some part to play in this movie, and we&#8217;ll be learning more about them in the coming months.</p>\n<p>James Gunn has said that this movie is &#8220;<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">100%, zero interference, no-holds-barred&#8221; his vision and style. Unlike the first Suicide Squad movie, which had a lot of studio interference and chopped up director David Ayer&#8217;s original plans for the movie. Hopefully that means we&#8217;ll get a story that makes much more sense.</span></p>\n<p><em>The Suicide Squad </em>is currently slated to arrive in theaters on <strong>August 6, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-featurette/\">&#8216;The Suicide Squad&#8217; Featurette: James Gunn Reinvigorates the Villains of DC Comics</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=W-E-aZeRqKA:y-ZO8Xbudmc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=W-E-aZeRqKA:y-ZO8Xbudmc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=W-E-aZeRqKA:y-ZO8Xbudmc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=W-E-aZeRqKA:y-ZO8Xbudmc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=W-E-aZeRqKA:y-ZO8Xbudmc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=W-E-aZeRqKA:y-ZO8Xbudmc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/W-E-aZeRqKA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 19:34:33 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-featurette-silhouettes-700x305.jpg","linkMd5":"a07efe736e75a3876dcfaf46d048a4df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_4/2020/08/23/04-31-50-335_d0c4399073a4cc44.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":305,"sourceBytes":23823,"destBytes":17056,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-featurette-silhouettes-700x305.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_4/2020/08/23/04-31-50-335_d0c4399073a4cc44.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-15-417_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=W-E-aZeRqKA:y-ZO8Xbudmc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn20@2020_3/2020/08/23/04-32-15-303_81ed084e8de33f9e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-16-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=W-E-aZeRqKA:y-ZO8Xbudmc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn53@2020_2/2020/08/23/04-32-15-245_8f50ac9a2bbcba38.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/W-E-aZeRqKA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/23/04-32-15-214_754a7278fa15fb71.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598157109911},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","title":"‘The Batman’ Trailer: Robert Pattinson is the Dark Knight","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633033","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-new.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633104\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-new-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the batman trailer new\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-new-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-new-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-new-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-new.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The first trailer for <strong><em>The Batman</em></strong> arrived as part of DC FanDome, and folks – it&#8217;s fantastic. I&#8217;ll confess to being a little skeptical about yet another <em>Batman</em> movie, but everything here works, and works exceedingly well. I&#8217;m now even more excited to see what else <strong>Matt Reeves</strong> has in store for us, and how <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong> interprets the role of the Caped Crusader. Watch <em>The Batman</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633033\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Batman Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NLOp_6uPccQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>God <em>damn</em>. Look, I don&#8217;t want to overhype things or get too hyperbolic, but this trailer <em>owns</em>, as the kids say. Even though I like the talent involved with this project I&#8217;ll confess that a part of me was thinking, &#8220;Really? <em>Another</em> Batman movie?&#8221; But this trailer has sold me. While this appears to be keeping the same &#8220;real world&#8221; tone as the Christopher Nolan movies, it looks and feels different. Dirtier; grungier.</p>\n<p>In many ways, this looks like a serial killer movie that just happens to have Batman in it. Like <em>Seven</em>, with Batman instead of Brad Pitt. And that use of Nirvana&#8217;s &#8220;Something in the Way&#8221;? Perfection. Other things I really dug: Batman just calmly waltzing into a crime scene to talk with Gordon; Batman pummelling some goon while the camera never cuts away; Catwoman&#8217;s <em>very</em> cute little ears on her mask; the eyeshadow visible around Pattinson&#8217;s eyes when he takes his mask off.</p>\n<p>DC is having a bit of a moment right now. Their DCEU had some stumbling blocks, but they seem to have gotten back on track now. The solution? Try anything and everything. The DCEU world still exists, but now they have alternate, unconnected worlds. One of those worlds is the one inhabited by Joaquin Phoenix&#8217;s <em>Joker</em>. And now we have <em>The Batman</em>, a new take on the Dark Knight that has nothing to do with the DCEU, or any other Batman movie that came before it.</p>\n<p>Rather than a <em>Year One</em>-style reboot, <em>The Batman</em> is taking place in year two of Batman&#8217;s crusade against crime. Which is good, because we really don&#8217;t need another origin story at this point. Robert Pattinson is Bruce Wayne/Batman, leading a cast that includes <strong>Zoë Kravitz</strong> as Catwoman; <strong>Paul Dano</strong> as The Riddler; <strong>Jeffrey Wrigh</strong>t as Commissioner Gordon; <strong>John Turturro</strong> as Carmine Falcone; <strong>Peter Sarsgaard</strong> as Gil Colson, Gotham&#8217;s district attorney;<strong> Jayme Lawson</strong> as Bella Reál, a mayoral candidate in Gotham; <strong>Andy Serkis</strong> as Alfred; and <strong>Colin Farrell</strong> as the Penguin.</p>\n<p>Reeves co-wrote the script with Mattson Tomlin, with Reeves promising &#8220;an almost-noir driven, detective version of Batman,&#8221; something that does indeed sound fresh. Batman is often called &#8220;The World&#8217;s Greatest Detective&#8221; in the comics, but he&#8217;s never really done much detective work in the movies, save for some moments here and there in <em>The Dark Knight</em>. Production on <em>The Batman</em> had to halt due to the coronavirus, but Reeves and company are hoping to get back to work next month.</p>\n<p><em>The Batman</em> opens <strong>October 1, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-batman-trailer/\">&#8216;The Batman&#8217; Trailer: Robert Pattinson is the Dark Knight</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iOG3IenugSQ:cuyQkzNAZ-o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iOG3IenugSQ:cuyQkzNAZ-o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iOG3IenugSQ:cuyQkzNAZ-o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iOG3IenugSQ:cuyQkzNAZ-o:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iOG3IenugSQ:cuyQkzNAZ-o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iOG3IenugSQ:cuyQkzNAZ-o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iOG3IenugSQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 01:02:05 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-new-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"283d50bde1cd5446f56db2e2ab7ea882","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-31-50-325_557704980ac12bd4.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":11376,"destBytes":4150,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-trailer-new-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-31-50-325_557704980ac12bd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-15-417_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iOG3IenugSQ:cuyQkzNAZ-o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/23/04-32-25-699_09adb765cecd505c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-16-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iOG3IenugSQ:cuyQkzNAZ-o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/23/04-32-15-492_f2d06527a027f684.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iOG3IenugSQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn97@2020_2/2020/08/23/04-32-15-243_87cb162af3f52f13.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598157109901},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","title":"‘Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’ Will Let Gamers Hunt Down Their Favorite Superheroes [DC FanDome]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633088","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-633105 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Suicide-Squad-Kill-the-Justice-League-700x296.jpg\" alt=\"Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League\" width=\"700\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Suicide-Squad-Kill-the-Justice-League.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Suicide-Squad-Kill-the-Justice-League-360x152.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>After redefining the modern superhero video game with <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> and its two sequels, Rocksteady is returning to the DC Universe. <strong><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></strong> puts players in control of several members of &#8220;Task Force X,&#8221; the team of supervillains tasked with saving the day when traditional heroes can&#8217;t get the job done. And they may have their toughest job yet: some kind of alien menace has taken control of the world&#8217;s greatest superheroes and someone has to take them down. Watch the big reveal trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633088\"></span></p>\n<h2>Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1p7nWylfNs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The game is still a few years away, so the trailer is entirely cinematic, with no gameplay to be seen. However, the premise is certainly intriguing: Harley Quinn, Deadshot, King Shark, and Captain Boomerang are on assignment in Metropolis, where some kind of giant alien ship has landed, bringing with it all kinds of extraterrestrial cannon fodder. But the kicker comes when Superman himself shows up, his eyes glowing purple, his mind taken over by&#8230;something. So, how can a psychopath, a guy who is good with guns, a shark-man, and a weirdo armed with boomerangs take down the most powerful hero in the universe? I guess we&#8217;ll find out.</p>\n<p>Following the trailer, actor <strong>Will Arnett</strong> was joined by <strong>Sefton Hill</strong>, creative director and co-founder of Rocksteady to reveal new details. Hill confirmed that the game is set in the same world as the <em>Arkham</em> games and will build on the characters and tone established across that trilogy.</p>\n<p>But unlike those games, which emphasized the Dark Knight&#8217;s combo-driven hand-to-hand combat, <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> will be built around &#8220;powerful, awesome gunplay&#8221; and &#8220;supervillain empowerment.&#8221; Naturally, each member of the Squad will have their own abilities and powers, requiring players to learn how to make the most of their unique move sets. If you&#8217;re playing solo, the other members of Task Force X will be controlled by bots, but you&#8217;ll be able to switch characters on the fly. But if you have a few friends, you can play online co-op, with up to four players taking on each character.</p>\n<p>Also unlike the <em>Arkham</em> games, this one moves out of Gotham and into Superman&#8217;s home of Metropolis, a far sunnier and less gloomy city. Described as the &#8220;fifth character&#8221; of the game, <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> will allow players to traverse (and presumably blow up) an open world version of the iconic comic book city.</p>\n<p>No release date has been set yet, but the trailer promises a <strong>2022 </strong>release date. Hopefully, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-08-22-rocksteady-issues-new-statement-following-sexual-harassment-accusations\">Rocksteady will have its inner issues figured out by then</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/\">&#8216;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&#8217; Will Let Gamers Hunt Down Their Favorite Superheroes [DC FanDome]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=q7YqBzdSZ30:xeDHbrXNcTs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=q7YqBzdSZ30:xeDHbrXNcTs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=q7YqBzdSZ30:xeDHbrXNcTs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=q7YqBzdSZ30:xeDHbrXNcTs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=q7YqBzdSZ30:xeDHbrXNcTs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=q7YqBzdSZ30:xeDHbrXNcTs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/q7YqBzdSZ30\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 00:42:50 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Suicide-Squad-Kill-the-Justice-League-700x296.jpg","linkMd5":"da87268deff4fd3ee05309f5d2e2b7a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/23/04-31-50-241_d6557b9b6599e4e9.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":296,"sourceBytes":37287,"destBytes":27024,"author":"Jacob Hall","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Suicide-Squad-Kill-the-Justice-League-700x296.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/23/04-31-50-241_d6557b9b6599e4e9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-15-417_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=q7YqBzdSZ30:xeDHbrXNcTs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn71@2020_3/2020/08/23/04-32-15-468_7e37647dfad7197b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/23/04-32-16-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=q7YqBzdSZ30:xeDHbrXNcTs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/23/04-32-16-259_9574e0ab46e89888.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/q7YqBzdSZ30":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/23/04-32-15-200_89c3b38550a3a1dc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598157109901},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 12:31:49","title":"‘The Batman’ Deals With Corruption, Mystery, and Batman Learning to Become Batman [DC FanDome]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=632627","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-logo.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-632611\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-logo-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the batman logo\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-logo-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-logo-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-logo-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-batman-logo.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Matt Reeves</strong> flew the virtual Batwing out of the virtual Batcave into the virtual DC FanDome to tell us all about <strong><em>The Batman</em></strong>, and he did not disappoint. Director Reeves talked about the film and gave us a seriously great trailer to boot, and pretty much everything the director had to say was gold. Reeves&#8217; infectious attitude about the project goes a long way to shutting down any cynicism someone might have about yet another <em>Batman</em> movie.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-632627\"></span></p>\n<p>Look, I get it – you&#8217;re wondering, &#8220;Do we really <em>need</em> a new <em>Batman</em> movie?&#8221; I was more or less of the same opinion. But based on both the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-batman-trailer/\">trailer</a>, and what Matt Reeves had to say at DC FanDome, I&#8217;m now all-in on <em>The Batman</em>. Reeves spoke at great lengths about how this film is trying to be <em>different</em>. He mentioned that almost all versions of the characters we see here are different than on-screen versions we&#8217;ve seen before. The same goes for Gotham City, too.</p>\n<p>I loved Christopher Nolan&#8217;s <em>Dark Knight</em> series, but his Gotham always just looked like either Chicago or Pittsburgh. Reeves says that he and his team worked to avoid the same issue here, making sure this Gotham looked unlike any real American city. The director also fanboyed out about Batman as a character, specifically the way that Batman&#8217;s &#8220;superpower&#8221; is about his ability to endure.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, Reeves promised that this was <em>not</em> an origin story. This is Batman in his second year of crimefighting, as he&#8217;s taking part in a &#8220;criminological experiment&#8221; to figure out how to change Gotham.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when a murder mystery arises that blows the lid off of how deep the corruption in Gotham really goes – and how it connects to the Wayne family.</p>\n<p><em>The Batman</em> is many things: a detective story; a point-of-view story; a mystery; an action movie. Most of all, though, it&#8217;s a personal movie about how Batman becomes Batman. This isn&#8217;t Batman just starting out, nor is it Batman well-established. It&#8217;s Batman still trying to figure out what his real mission is. As a result, he&#8217;s an almost mythological figure in the city, with many Gothamites fearing him. But it&#8217;s also about Batman becoming the world&#8217;s greatest detective – something we <em>really</em> haven&#8217;t seen in previous <em>Bat</em>-films.</p>\n<p>As far as film inspirations go, Reeves cited <em>Chinatown</em>, <em>The French Connection</em>, and even <em>Taxi Driver</em>. And as for Batman comics, Reeves cited <em>Batman: Ego and Other Tails</em>, by the late, great Darwyn Cooke – specifically drawing on how Batman confronts &#8220;a shadow of himself.&#8221; And while this may not be a Batman origin story, Reeves said is an origin story of sorts for the infamous Batman rogues gallery – Catwoman isn&#8217;t quite Catwoman yet; Riddler isn&#8217;t quite Riddler; and even The Penguin is just starting out (and <em>hates</em> when people call him The Penguin).</p>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>Robert Pattinson</strong>&#8216;s Batman, Reeves said he cast the actor because he&#8217;s a big fan of Pattinson&#8217;s work. He also stated that Pattinson even helped design the bat suit a little, and how the bat suit in this film is a practical suit, with the whole idea being that Batman made it from scratch. It&#8217;s a suit that&#8217;s still evolving; the cowl even has battle-damage in it to show that Batman has been wearing it for a while. Pattinson also possesses &#8220;the soul of someone who can play Batman like you&#8217;ve never seen before,&#8221; as far as Reeves is concerned.</p>\n<p>Beyond <em>The Batman</em>, Reeves also talked a bit about the <em>Gotham PD </em>series that will spin-off from the film. The show will also deal with Gotham&#8217;s corruption – and its corrupt police force. It&#8217;s also a prequel, going back to the first year that Batman begins appearing in the city, and focusing on how these corrupt cops reckon with that.</p>\n<p>Only 25% of the movie has been shot so far, with the production shutting down due to the coronavirus.

The filmmaker behind Marvel&#8217;s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> franchise is shaking up the roster of DC Comics characters with a whole new line of weird and obscure bad guys, and the film&#8217;s panel during the virtual DC Comics convention finally confirmed who all of the new cast members are playing, not to mention giving us some wild first looks.</p>\n<p>Check out <em>The Suicide Squad</em> character roll call video and find out some other interesting details about the movie below.<span id=\"more-633020\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Suicide Squad Character Roll Call Video</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8tWKJwyG6Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a rundown of the cast and who they&#8217;re playing in The Suicide Squad:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Margot Robbie &#8211; Harley Quinn</li>\n<li>Jai Courtney &#8211; Captain Boomerang</li>\n<li><span class=\"st\">Joel Kinnaman &#8211; Colonel Rick Flag</span></li>\n<li>Viola Davis &#8211; Amanda Waller</li>\n<li>Idris Elba &#8211; Bloodsport</li>\n<li>John Cena &#8211; Peacemaker</li>\n<li>David Dastmalchian &#8211; Polka Dot Man</li>\n<li>Michael Rooker &#8211; Savant</li>\n<li>Flula Borg &#8211; Javelin</li>\n<li>Daniela Melchior &#8211; Ratcatcher 2</li>\n<li>Steve Agee  King Shark (on-set only)</li>\n<li>Mayling Ng &#8211; Mongal</li>\n<li>Peter Capaldi &#8211; Thinker</li>\n<li>Alica Braga &#8211; Solsoria</li>\n<li>Pete Davidson &#8211; Blackguard</li>\n<li>Nathan Fillion &#8211; TDK</li>\n<li>Sean Gunn &#8211; Weasel</li>\n<li><span class=\"st\">Juan Diego Botto – Presidente General Silvio Luna</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">Joaquín Cosío</span> &#8211; Major General Suarez (not in video, but revealed during the panel)</li>\n<li>Storm Reid &#8211; Tyla, Bloodsport&#8217;s daughter (not in the video, but revealed during the panel)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>James Gunn called the movie a superhero version of <em>The Dirty Dozen</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-featurette/\">the featurette revealed during the DC FanDome panel</a> certainly leaned into that. Though this film includes characters from the first <em>Suicide Squad</em> movie, it looks like this is very much meant to stand on its own. Gunn has taken cues from <strong>John Ostrander</strong>&#8216;s comic book run, and as he explained to famed comics creator, this isn&#8217;t so much of an adaptation of those issues, but rather imagining if there was a sequel to those comics in the same spirit.</p>\n<p>This is the first time we&#8217;ve gotten confirmation that Idris Elba is playing Bloodsport in the movie. It was previously said that he was going to step up to replace Will Smith as Deadshot, but Gunn opted to have him play a different character. We learned during the panel that the movie finds Bloodsport in prison for shooting Superman with a Kryptonite bullet. Sounds like a pretty badass guy.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Sudick</strong> is the special effects supervisor for <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, and like James Gunn, he&#8217;s making the leap from Marvel Studios movies. Sudick has been the special effects supervisor for 14 of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he&#8217;s also working on the upcoming Disney+ shows like <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, <em>Loki</em> and <em>WandaVision</em>, but Gunn says that Sudick told him that <em>The Suicide Squad</em> has more special effects shots than any of those movies.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for James Gunn, one character you likely won&#8217;t get to see in<em> The Suicide Squad</em> is Bat-Mite, <span class=\"st\">an imp similar to the Superman villain Mister Mxyzptlk who dresses up like a tiny Batman. Gunn was tempted to get him into the movie somehow, but it sounds like he wasn&#8217;t able to make it work.</span></p>\n<p>Gunn says Warner Bros. Pictures is &#8220;overwhelmingly happy&#8221; with the movie and that this is the &#8220;greatest cast he&#8217;s ever worked with by far.&#8221; Sorry, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. We&#8217;ll have to see if he&#8217;s right when <em>The Suicide Squad</em> arrives in theaters on <strong>August 6, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, here are two posters for the movie, one with alternate looks for Bloodsport and Harley Quinn:</p>\n\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-introduces-the-full-roster-of-bad-guys-james-gunn-is-bringing-to-theaters-dc-fandome/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-alternate/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-alternate-360x450.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"The Suicide Squad Poster (Alternate)\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-alternate-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-alternate-700x875.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-alternate-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-alternate.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-introduces-the-full-roster-of-bad-guys-james-gunn-is-bringing-to-theaters-dc-fandome/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-360x450.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"The Suicide Squad Poster\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-360x450.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-700x875.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/suicidesquad-dcfandome-poster.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-suicide-squad-introduces-the-full-roster-of-bad-guys-james-gunn-is-bringing-to-theaters-dc-fandome/\">&#8216;The Suicide Squad&#8217;
