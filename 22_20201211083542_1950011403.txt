Each strand holds 200 individual bulbs in the classic blue, red, yellow, green, and orange assortment.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073F8HTC7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_120417_best-christmas-lights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B073F8HTC7&#38;linkId=fd9a017b08773c0afdf0a15a0c354475\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Brizled LED Mini String&#160;Lights</a> are rated to last for 25,000 hours, so you probably won't have to replace the strand &#8212; possibly ever. Even if you leave your lights illuminated for a month straight every year, you can still expect about 35 years out of them.</p><p>The best thing about the Brizled LED Mini String Lights isn't their longevity, though, it's their looks. These bulbs approximate the same look as those beloved incandescent mini bulbs you'll remember from holiday seasons past, yet they use about 88% less power than traditional lights and never get hot enough to pose a risk of injury or fire. Plus, they're much brighter than incandescent bulbs, so you'll get much more pop from just one strand.</p><p>If colorful lights don't match the look you're going for, Brizled also makes them in both warm and cool white. And should you want to go full Griswold on your holiday decorations, you can safely connect up to 10 strands of these things.</p><p>These lights are perfect for indoor use thanks to their cool physical temperature and warm light quality. They are perfectly safe for outdoor use in all sorts of weather conditions.</p>\n\tThe best battery-powered lights\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a2034fbf914c329008b708a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"lights\" height=\"751\" width=\"1001\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">KooPower</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014STP6I4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_120417_best-christmas-lights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B014STP6I4&#38;linkId=5dd9fedfbdad7b24f4901706202be88e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KooPower Waterproof Battery Fairy Lights</a>&#160;are battery powered and operated via remote control, so once they're in place, you can look forward to weeks of effortless enjoyment.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Battery power lasts many days, controlled by remote, tiny but bright bulbs, great price</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>36-foot strand too short for some applications, only come in warm white, batteries must be changed after 60 hours of use</p><p>One of the worst things about holiday lights is the fact that you have to plug them in every time you want them to light up and unplug them when you want them to go dark &#8212; unless you have a timer. But even with a timer, you still need the lights to end up near an outlet, or at least be close enough to the outlet that an extension cord can connect the two. With the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014STP6I4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_120417_best-christmas-lights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B014STP6I4&#38;linkId=5dd9fedfbdad7b24f4901706202be88e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KooPower Waterproof Battery Fairy Lights with Remote and Timer</a>, both of those situations are things of the past.</p><p>The KooPower lights are powered by three AA batteries, and when only lit for a few hours each night, these three batteries will keep the lights aglow for days. With good quality batteries, the lights will shine for 60 hours before needing a change, so even if you left the lights on for four hours every night, that's more than two weeks per set, or likely only one battery change per holiday season. And what's more, you could set these lights up miles from the nearest power outlet if you really wanted to.</p><p>The remote control eliminates the need for ready access to the lights and for use of an external timer. With the remote, the lights can be programmed for an on/off cycle, set to twinkle, fade in and out, do a chasing flash pattern, and more. The lights stay cool, thus are safe for use on an indoor tree, and are water-resistant, thus suitable for outdoor hanging.</p>\n\tThe best large-bulb lights\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a203525f914c353018b7019?format=jpeg\" alt=\"classic lights\" height=\"1125\" width=\"1500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Good Tidings</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The large, softly glowing colorful bulbs of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00466IGCS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_120417_best-christmas-lights-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B00466IGCS&#38;linkId=97446270f510d3b6303d1e5626523c34\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Good Tidings Ceramic Multi-Colored Holiday Lights</a> look just like something out of a classic film.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Classic vintage charm, bright lights visible from a distance, easy bulb changes</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Short strand length, glow much warmer than LEDs</p><p>Sure, LED bulbs are bright, energy-efficient, cool to the touch, and last for years.

They will light up your&#160;tree, they look great framing a window or doorway, and they're hard to beat when strung across the roofline of the home, especially when a blanket of snow rests around them.</p><p>The strand measures 24 feet long, a great length for an indoor tree though a bit short for use outdoors unless you're willing to buy a few strands. They will last for years, though, albeit with an occasional bulb swap needed. Doing so is easy, though. It's just like changing a standard light bulb.</p><p>The Good Tidings Ceramic Multi-Colored Holiday Lights are UL listed for indoor and outdoor use and they connect to any standard socket or extension cord.

You can choose between a wide range of pre-made light effects so your tree will twinkle like stars, display a heart, look like a glittery candy cane, or show off a pulsing rainbow. There's even a dongle you can add to synchronize your lights to music.</p><p>You can also go simple and choose solid colors or make your own mix in the app. The options are basically endless with more than 16 million colors to choose from. The LED lights are bright and vibrant, too, making any color combination look gorgeous.</p><p>The lights were easy to set up in our tests. It's as easy as plugging the lights in, downloading the app, and following the on-screen directions to connect your lights via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.</p><p>I set the lights up with my home's Wi-Fi network so that I can control them remotely and with my voice. To enable voice control, I followed the instructions in the Alexa app to connect the lights to my Echo in just a few minutes. Now I can turn them on or off in the app or with my voice. Overall, the smart lights are easy to use, mainly because the app is so user friendly.&#160;</p><p>In terms of length, the 250-light strand perfectly covered my 7.5-foot tree, but depending on how densely packed you want the lights to be, you may need more lights. Twinkly sells several different smart light strands, so you can choose whichever ones are best for your needs.</p><p>The 100-light strand linked here is also on sale, making it a good deal. Under normal circumstances, and even when on sale, these lights are more expensive than ordinary lights, but if you want full customizability, voice control, and all the smart features included here, it'll be worth it.

The lights have a sensor that automatically turns them on once the ambient light is low enough and that will switch them back off once the sun is again filling the sky.</p><p>Though to be honest, they will probably have dimmed or switched off entirely before that happens, as they have an approximate eight-hour run-time per charge.

Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky outlined the reasoning behind 5 investors who turned down the opportunity to buy 10% of Airbnb for $150,000 in the summer of 2008.&#160;</p><p>That 10% stake would have been worth as much as $11.5 billion based on Airbnb's intra-day high of $165 in Thursday trades, representing a gain of 7,651,371% if the stake was held through Thursday's trading debut.</p><p>Here are five e-mail responses Chesky received from \"prominent\" investors who turned down the opportunity to invest in Airbnb in 2008.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong>&#160;<a

The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an attempt by Trump allies to overturn the results in Pennsylvania.&#160;</p><p>Meanwhile, all 50 states and Washington, DC, have certified their election results and the federal \"safe harbor\" deadline to do so has passed - cementing Biden's victory. The Electoral College is set to make Biden's win final when it votes on December 14.&#160;</p><p>\"Trump and his litigation boosters have lost every which way, and everywhere. In state courts and federal courts. In trial courts and appellate courts, intermediate and supreme. Before Democratic judges and Republican ones. In <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nevada-trump-lawsuit-dismissed/2020/12/04/844d420a-3682-11eb-a997-1f4c53d2a747_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_7\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada</a> - every state that could possibly matter. On substantive grounds and procedural ones, on the facts, and on the law,\" Conway wrote.&#160;</p><p>\"It's hard to imagine that any alliance of litigants and lawyers has ever lost more cases for more reasons - and in less time - than this sorry bunch has,\" he added. \"Their problem is they have nothing to sue about, and never did.\"</p><p>But Republicans across the country continue to challenge the results in concert with Trump. Ken Paxton, Texas' pro-Trump attorney general, on Tuesday filed a longshot lawsuit in the Supreme Court seeking to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Trump and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/us/politics/trump-texas-supreme-court-lawsuit.html\">17 other Republican attorneys general</a> are supporting the suit, which is essentially an effort to invalidate millions of votes.&#160;</p><p>Legal experts say the suit is likely to fail and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck/status/1336329901859688451?s=20\">doubt the nation's highest court</a> will take up the case. Conway shares this view, describing the Texas suit as \"a recycling of failed claims\" and an \"embarrassment to the legal profession.\"</p><p>\"There's no reason to believe the Supreme Court, which has jurisdiction to hear cases between states, will entertain this one,\" Conway said. \"For public officials such as Paxton and his fellow Republican attorneys general to call for the wholesale disenfranchisement of the people of four states is an affront to the rule of law, an insult to an independent judiciary and a contempt of democracy.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original

Bob Menendez, a Democrat and longtime advocate of establishing a Latino museum.</p><p>\"One Republican colleague from Utah stands in the way of the hopes and dreams and aspirations of seeing Americans of Latino descent having their dreams fulfilled in being recognized, just being recognized,\" he said during the session. \"It's pretty outrageous.\"</p><p>Smithsonian museums for African-American history and Native American history already exist, but Lee said those groups were exceptions because they were \"systematically excluded\" from the nation's history.</p><p>\"We have been systematically excluded,\" Menendez said of American Latinos. \"And the only righteous way to end that exclusion is to pass this bill.\"</p><p>GOP Sen. Susan Collins also expressed support for the American Latino museum.

But many Republicans are still demanding a slimmer aid package that focuses on small businesses and vaccine distribution and includes a liability shield to protect corporations from virus-related lawsuits. GOP lawmakers are also largely opposed to sending additional funding to strapped state and local governments.&#160;</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez called the liability shield proposal a \"corporate bailout.\" She argued that allowing Republicans to include the liability protections in the bill in exchange for stimulus checks or state and local government funding would be a bad deal for workers.&#160;</p><p>\"You may get a $1,200 check on one hand, but you may also get a multi-million hospital bill with no recourse and no ability to protect yourself from a negligent corporation or employer,\" she said. \"Why do we need to exchange people's well being and ability to survive for yet another corporate bailout?\"</p><p>Other progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders' have also demanded stimulus checks in the bill and decried the liability shield.</p><p>The freshman congresswoman also argued that Republicans haven't been \"in a rush\" to pass additional stimulus legislation because Wall Street was already <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/business/coronavirus-bailout-spending/\">given a massive bailout</a> last spring. About <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/business/coronavirus-bailout-spending/\">one-fifth</a> of the $4 trillion in stimulus that the federal government has spent since the pandemic hit has gone to workers and families. About $2.3 trillion went to businesses, many of which didn't have to show that they were hurt by the pandemic or they would use the money to prevent layoffs.</p><p>Democrats in the House passed the $2.2 trillion HEROES Act in May and then again in October. Ahead of the November election, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to negotiate a slightly smaller stimulus backed by the White House, while in October the Senate proposed a slimmed-down $500 stimulus package that was blocked by Democrats.</p><p>\"What keeps me up at night was that it was short-term relief that was really important and really necessary ... but what we gave away to Wall Street was so large and so structural that, frankly, that's why Republicans and Mitch McConnell has not been in a rush,\" she said.&#160;</p><p>President-elect Joe Biden has promised to pass an additional stimulus when he takes office in late January, but Americans are in desperate need of help before then.

It's one of the smallest heaters on this list at just about 10 inches tall, but pulls a powerful 1,500 watts of power to heat efficiently for its miniature size. There are three settings (low, high, and fan) and an adjustable temperature dial. The temperature dial uses dots instead of specific temperatures, so it took some time to figure out how to adjust the unit to my preferred temperature &#8212; I ended up watching a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b31HU-LYQOY&#38;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube</a> video to get the gist &#8212; but once I got it working, the heat cycling feature kept me comfortable for hours. It's relatively quiet and I didn't feel the need to shut it off during Zoom calls.&#160;</p><p>That said, it's definitely not a whole-room heater: the unit only increased the overall temperature in my office by about 3 degrees Fahrenheit in my testing. However, sitting close to the heater and feeling the warmth blowing directly at me, I felt much, much warmer. (It's also worth noting that how well any space heater will heat depends on the size of your room and the ambient temperature.)</p><p>The heater has cool-touch housing, which didn't heat up during use, but the front grille does get hot (though this is par for the course with most space heaters). It'll also shut off automatically if it detects overheating. The manual didn't specify at what temperature this function triggers, and I didn't encounter it during my testing, but it's a must-have safety feature for any space heater. There's no tip-over safety switch, but if you're only using it under supervision (as safety experts say you should with any space heater), I don't think it's a deal-breaker &#8212; especially since the unit is so stable. I really had to shove it off my desk for it to tip over.&#160;</p><p>I can see myself using this frequently when I'm unwilling to turn on the furnace. It's easy to store and tote around the house. I recommend this unit to anyone who works in a chilly office (home or otherwise).&#160;</p>\n\tThe best full-size space heater\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd254247b7e05001910731e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Lasko full sized space heater slide\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steph Coelho/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/196318/565706/9383?veh=aff&#38;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLasko-1500W-Cyclonic-Ceramic-Room-Space-Heater-CC24920-Black%2F376954169\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Lasko Cyclonic Digital Ceramic Heater</a> is a full-size space heater that takes up minimal space and delivers an effective dose of warmth.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Lightweight, accurate internal thermostat, overheat protection</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No fan-only option, no tip-over shutoff&#160;</p><p>When my grandfather was looking for a space heater to warm up his bedroom, which doesn't seem to heat as well as other areas of his apartment, this was the model I decided to recommend to him. At almost two feet tall, it's a full-size floor model but it is surprisingly lightweight, so it's easy to move around from room to room. The light-up control panel is legible from afar and allows you to choose your desired room temperature, select high or low heat settings, and set a timer. You can also adjust the angle of the airflow, which is helpful if you don't want hot air blowing directly on you.&#160;</p><p>By selecting the room temperature, the unit will automatically know to cycle off (and eventually back on) when it senses that it reaches the right temperature. This function was very accurate when I compared its temperature display to my reference thermometer. It's a lot quieter than I expected for such a large machine, and it does a great job of heating up a room quickly without blowing uncomfortably hot air. On a chilly morning, the heater was able to warm the air by 6 degrees Fahrenheit in under an hour.&#160;</p><p>Unfortunately, this unit doesn't have a fan-only option, and while there's a thermal overload detector to prevent overheating, there's no tip-over shutoff. Unlike other space heater models I tried, this model purports to be safe to place against a wall because of the way the air enters and exits the machine. Safety experts usually recommend keeping the backside of a space heater clear, but I did confirm that no hot air was blowing out the back of the machine and it never overheated during use.</p>\n\tThe best high-end space heater\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd25d6530f2740018b0f1d4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dyson space heater\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steph Coelho/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1725511746138880990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Dyson Pure Hot+Cool</a> boasts an impressive design; features like air purifying, app compatibility, and some cooling capability make it an expansive home appliance that does much more than heat.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros</strong>: Air-purifying feature, all parts stay cool to the touch, 360-degree oscillation, automatically shuts off after nine hours or if overheating is detected, beautiful design, app compatibility and controls, smart assistant compatibility, tip-over switch</p><p><strong>Cons</strong>: Display is difficult to read, replacement filters are expensive</p><p>This Dyson unit is the macdaddy of space heaters. It's a full-size heater with a unique oblong, donut-shaped design. Setup is super easy; just click in the filters and plug it in to get started. You can use the remote or an app (available on <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dyson-link/id993135524\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dyson.mobile.android&#38;hl=en_US&#38;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android</a>) to control and adjust the airflow speed, oscillation, temperature, airflow direction, and turn on the sleep timer or night mode &#8212; a feature that darkens the display and reduces the airflow speed to prevent night time disturbances. There's also a \"cooling\" mode, which is really just a fan. In testing, the cooling mode barely made a dent in room temperature, though the breeze did make me feel more comfortable.&#160;</p><p>The heating function on the Dyson works really well. The room starts warming almost immediately and the heat is effectively dispersed throughout the room. Within the first hour of testing, the temperature increased by 6 degrees Fahrenheit &#8212; a welcome bit of warmth on a particularly cold day. To run the heater, you select your desired room temperature in degrees. On auto, the heater will run at the ideal speed to quickly heat your room (and purify the air), but you can override that and select your own airflow settings.</p><p>The noise level depends on the selected airflow speed, which runs from settings one to 10. Setting 10 will require some volume adjustment on your TV while a one or two is barely noticeable and didn't disturb me at all while I was working. The heater has an auto-shutoff that prevents it from overheating and it will automatically turn off if falls over or detects that the heating mode has been active for more than 9 hours. It's also the only heater where no part of the exterior is hot to the touch, making it safe for use around kids.&#160;</p><p>In my opinion, the air purifier is the main advantage of this device over other heaters. I quickly became obsessed with tracking my home's air quality and love the detailed info I get from using the app. The machine reacts quickly and automatically to air contaminants I had never really thought about. For example, while I was preheating my oven for dinner, the unit automatically adjusted to its maximum air speed to help purify the \"contaminated\" air caused by my dirty hot oven. Other users report it ramping up air flow when you're using household cleaning products, to help dissipate the chemicals.</p><p>Unfortunately, this feature means that, unlike the other heaters on this list, the Dyson requires regular maintenance. In addition to the initial cost, you'll have to spend more on <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&#38;mid=36310&#38;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fsupport%2Fjourney%2Ftools%2F969048-01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">filter replacements</a>, which don't come cheap at almost $80 each. The rate at which you replace them depends on usage and air quality. For reference, I've been running the unit for a few weeks and the app says that the HEPA and carbon filters have 98% life remaining.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Another drawback is that the Dyson's onboard display is almost totally useless; it's so small that it's impossible to read from across a room. You really have to have your nose right up to the unit to peek at the tiny, round screen. However, you can access the same information in the app.&#160;</p><p>The Dyson is also, by far, the most expensive space heater we tested. It comes loaded with tons of extra features that might justify the price tag if you're concerned about air quality in your home or want a connected device that can be used with an app or virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Home. However, if you're just interested in warming a chilly space, you'll get similar heating power from the cheaper picks in this guide.</p>\n\tThe best space heater that's also a fan\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd257ac30f2740018b0f19c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Honeywell space heater\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steph Coelho/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/196318/565706/9383?veh=aff&#38;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHoneywell-VersaHeat-Digital-Two-Position-Heater-HHF260-White%2F215441994\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">HoneyWell Versa Two Position Heater</a> is a space-saving heater with a powerful fan and thoughtful safety features not usually found in most space heaters.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Powerful fan, cool-touch housing, overheat protection, unique safety features intended to prevent electrical fires&#160;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Noisy, no heat cycling, no tip-over switch</p><p>The \"two position\" feature of this heater means you can place the unit upright or on its side, so you can use it in a variety of spaces and situations. I primarily used it in the upright position and was impressed by how this little rectangular heater warmed my office by 3 degrees very quickly. It uses a fan to push heat around, and the warmth spread evenly throughout my office instead of being concentrated in one area. Since the heat disperses so well, it didn't leave me sweating while I was waiting for my office to warm, unlike some other models I tried.</p><p>In addition to being a good feature for dispersing heat, the fan can also be used to keep you cool. While the fan is powerful when used on its own, this feature does make a fair bit of noise, which I could hear from adjoining rooms.&#160;</p><p>I also appreciated the thoughtful safety features of this space heater. While it doesn't have a tip-over sensor, the unit stays cool to the touch and the wiring is thermally insulated to prevent the cord from overheating. It also has an overheat sensor and an ALCI plug like those found on many blow dryers, which reacts quickly to shorts like a surge protector does. Overall, it's a great space heater for those who are safety conscious and those who want a product they can also use in warmer weather.&#160;</p>\n\tWhat else we tested\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd259e77b7e050019107360?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What else we tested space heater\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steph Coelho/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>All the heaters I tested worked as intended, quickly raising the temperature in my office by several degrees. A few just missed the mark for inclusion in our top picks. Here are some heaters that might be worth considering depending on your needs:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K6UGW1Y/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=20&#38;imprToken=a8ba58eb-594b-7e6f-3fe&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;creativeASIN=B01K6UGW1Y&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=biipgf_081117_best-space-heaters-20&#38;linkId=3978820c799c0ed86d6ac17f145a543f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Honeywell Uberheat Ceramic Heater</strong></a> <strong>($34.99): </strong>This is a sleek little heater with an attractive aesthetic that looks more like a designer speaker than a space heater. It takes up minimal desk space and has several key safety features like a highly sensitive tip-over switch and an overheat detector. It has one control knob to select both the setting (high or low) and the temperature, which was pretty easy to use after a quick peek at the instruction manual. However, the cycling function didn't do a great job at maintaining a consistent temperature. More often than not, I felt uncomfortably hot. The unit would cycle on when the room temperature hadn't dipped at all. This leads me to believe that the internal temperature sensor isn't particularly accurate or the machine turns on and off at preset intervals. The front grille also gets <em>very</em> hot, so I had to be extra careful when handling the unit, though the rest of the housing does stay cool to the touch. Still, if you use the heater without the cycling function, it produces a fair bit of warmth and looks good doing it. It's a great little heater for the design-conscious individual.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089LWW1GP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081117_best-space-heaters-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B089LWW1GP&#38;linkId=58cf5c08217e28d79b03e30d3d4ab9a9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Taotronics Space Heater</strong></a> <strong>($64.99): </strong>The moderate size of this heater was surprising, especially since marketing photos on Amazon make it look much bigger than it actually is. In reality, it's a little under a foot-and-a-half tall: too small for a floor heater, but too tall for a tabletop heater. When I used it on the floor, I felt like only my lower legs were warmed, and when I used it on my desk, it was impossible to adjust and check the heat settings while seated, since the controls are at the top of the unit. It's likely why the unit comes with a remote, but if I'm using this in my home office, a remote is a silly extra thing to have on hand and only serves to clutter up my workspace. It heats fine, looks sleek, and swivels, but it's an awkward size and shape for a space heater.&#160;</p>\n\tWhat we don't recommend\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd25adc30f2740018b0f1c1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"What we don&#39;t recommend space heaters\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steph Coelho/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Some models didn't quite make the cut because of safety concerns, design flaws, or other limitations. Here are the heaters that we don't recommend buying:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WLCBH96/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&#38;slotNum=5&#38;imprToken=a8ba58eb-594b-7e6f-3fe&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;creativeASIN=B07WLCBH96&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=biipgf_081117_best-space-heaters-20&#38;linkId=759f0726020c19931d8a1388b9877ca3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Trustech Ceramic Space Heater</strong></a><strong> ($29.99): </strong>Straight out of the box, this unit intrigued me with its streamlined design, but as soon as I put it on my desk I changed my tune. The heater has an oscillation feature with a spinning disc on the bottom of the unit, but it makes the heater wobble and feel unsteady compared to other models I tested. While it does have a tip-over switch, I never quite felt comfortable using this heater because of how much it wobbles. It heats up just fine, but no better than other heaters I tried, and not enough to justify the design concerns.</p><p><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&#38;mid=3184&#38;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macys.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Fvornado-velocity-5-space-heater%3FID%3D11697799\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Vornado Velocity 5</strong></a><strong> ($99.99): </strong>This square-shaped heater looked rugged and powerful with its large fan placed prominently on display, but it was surprisingly underpowered. It didn't do a good job of dispersing heat, and I often felt chilly sitting right near it if it wasn't pointed directly at me. The crisp display is one of the most legible of all the heaters I tested, but the built-in thermostat is very inaccurate. Anytime I checked my reference thermometer, the reading on the heater's display was at least 3 to 4 degrees off the mark.</p>\n\tTesting methodology\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd25c577b7e050019107375?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Our methodology space heater\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steph Coelho/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>In addition to interviewing two safety experts about space heaters, I relied heavily on my own experience reviewing heating devices like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-patio-heater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">patio heaters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mr-heater-buddy-heater-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">portable outdoor heaters</a> for this guide. I put all eight space heaters through the same set of standard tests and used a reference thermometer to collect temperature data. Here's what I looked for with each test:</p><p><strong>Ability to heat: </strong>This is the most important function of a space heater. I tested every heater in my 100 square foot office. I used a reference thermometer that was always positioned on the corner of my desk, smack dab in the middle of the room. I placed the heaters diagonally from the thermometer &#8212; compact units sat on my desk while full-sized ones were placed in the far corner of my office. I tried each heater's various settings and took notes about the accuracy of internal thermostats. I was also looking for how well the heaters could hold the room at my desired temperature &#8212; usually around 70 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit &#8212; without surrounding me in a nauseating heat cloud. To the best of my ability, I made sure that I didn't turn on my thermostat throughout testing except when there was a risk of pipes freezing or danger to my parrot's health. Most of the time, testing began when the temperature in my office was hovering somewhere between 60 and 64 degrees Fahrenheit.&#160;</p><p><strong>Time to heat</strong>: I used an indoor thermometer and a timer to evaluate how long it took for the space heater to bring the room up to my ideal temperature. Some models operate by blasting heat higher than your target temperature to get the room hot faster, but I found these left me feeling hot and sweaty. Units that were too slow left me still feeling the shivers a few hours later. I was searching for the sweet spot in the middle. Units with an accurate cycling feature received bonus points for maintaining comfort levels in my office.&#160;</p><p><strong>Easy-to-use controls: </strong>It's a space heater, not a spaceship. While safety experts recommend reading the manual cover-to-cover before using a space heater, I put myself in the average consumer's shoes and tried to figure out the unit on my own before referencing any manuals. I looked for controls that were intuitive and easy to figure out.</p><p><strong>Size</strong>: In a small office, there's not a whole lot of extra room for a device like a space heater. Extra points went to units that were powerful, but still compact, lightweight, and easy to fit in a confined area. For those who have larger spaces to heat, we did include picks for full-size heaters.</p><p><strong>Noise: </strong>Every space heater made some noise, which is to be expected, but some were a bit quieter than others. I docked points from units that I felt needed to be turned off for Zoom meetings or phone calls.&#160;</p><p><strong>Safety features: </strong>I verified whether safety features were functional (except for overheat functions, since that would have presented a safety hazard), including tipping the units over to test for automatic shut offs.&#160;</p>\n\tWhat to look for in a space heater\n\t\n\t<p>Space heaters convert electricity into heat and contain a fan that helps propel and disperse the heat throughout the room. Most space heaters all share a few standard functions, like a power button and high or low temperature settings. However, we've found a few key features to consider when shopping for a space heater:</p><p><strong>Power: </strong>Most heaters in our guide have 1,500 watts of power, which is pretty standard for space heaters. More powerful heaters are usually marketed as \"garage heaters\" and either need to be hardwired into your electrical circuit or run on a special appliance circuit. Fortunately, a heater with 1,500 watts should be enough to heat a room of about 150 square feet.&#160;</p><p><strong>Heat cycling function: </strong>For comfort and energy efficiency, you'll want a space heater with a heat cycling function &#8212; this allows you to select a desired temperature that the unit then attempts to maintain by cycling on and off when the temperature dips above or below the threshold. This is similar to how a built-in thermostat works in your home and prevents you from having to manually turn the unit on and off to maintain comfort levels. Not all cycling features work well, however; our picks above outline models with cycling features that are accurate and easy to use.&#160;</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>You can also choose between compact models and larger full-size units. A small space heater is great for desktop use in a home office, dorm room, or office building. It'll usually heat just the area right around the heater comfortably, which is good enough if you're just looking for a small bubble of personal comfort. A space heater with a bigger footprint has a larger fan, which helps blow air around the room and is ideal for heating large spaces like garages or full rooms. Opt for a full-size heater if you have a lot of space to heat.</p><p><strong>Safety: </strong>We outline more safety features to look for in the section below, but overheat protection is a must.&#160;</p>\n\tSpace heater safety\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd25d307b7e05001910737a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Space heater safety\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steph Coelho/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Sure, space heaters are ultra-convenient, but the safety experts we spoke to said they can also be dangerous if not used properly. According to a 2018 report from the <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Publications-and-media/Press-Room/News-releases/2018/Space-heaters-account-for-43-percent-of-US-home-heating-fires-and-85-percent-of-associated-deaths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Fire Protection Association</a>, space heaters cause 43% of U.S. fires due to home heating &#8212; and 85% of related deaths.&#160;</p><p>Both Matthew Griffith, fire prevention section chief with the <a href=\"https://ville.montreal.qc.ca/sim/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Montreal Fire Department</a>, and Dan Mock, brand manager of <a href=\"https://www.mistersparky.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mr. Sparky</a>, an electrical services company, said the number one rule for using a space heater is to <em>never</em> leave it unattended.&#160;</p><p>Beyond that, experts said that space heater safety starts with buying and unboxing the unit. Griffith said customers should look for a space heater that's certified by the <a href=\"https://www.ul.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Underwriter's Laboratory</a> (UL, or ULC in Canada) and has safety features like an auto-shutoff and tip-over switch. Mock also recommends reading the instruction manual cover-to-cover and inspecting the device before running it. \"A lot of times things can get cracked or broken or the plug gets pulled loose or gets dirt in the heating element. You just want to make sure it's nice and clean,\" said Mock. The best way to dislodge trapped dust is to use a combination of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AE67M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081117_best-space-heaters-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B0000AE67M&#38;linkId=35d13a512f9f95b936530ff6b1181d51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">canned air</a> and a dry cloth. It's also a good idea to keep the packaging so you can store the heater and keep it dust-free during the warmer months.&#160;</p><p>Where you place the space heater matters, too. Griffith said not to put a space heater too close to walls or flammable materials, and keep the backside of the heater clear, as the unit can overheat if blocked.</p><p>Additionally, paying attention to what you're plugging into electrical outlets can help prevent fires, said Mock. The average circuit breaker is rated at about 15 amps, but a powerful space heater can take up the entire power load of the circuit. \"A circuit breaker is really only supposedly safe up to about 80% of its maximum capacity, which is about 12 amps,\" he said. \"So if you think about it, a 15 amp electric heater on a circuit is drawing everything it can out of one circuit breaker. So if you add a lamp, if you add anything else to that circuit, you're overloading the circuit and you're standing a good chance of causing an electrical fire.\" While circuit breakers provide some protection from electrical fires, it's important to be mindful of repeatedly overtaxing the circuit. Mock also warns against using extension cords with these types of appliances (as do most space heater instruction manuals) because they can heat up significantly, which increases your risk of starting a fire.</p><h3>The bottom line</h3><p>Keep an eye on your space heater. Think of it like a candle. You'd never leave the house or go to bed with one burning; treat your heater the same way.</p>\n\tCheck out our other winter guides to keep warm\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d9fa1274af9093a4d5255b6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"5bdb2e338c35ab5036124742\" height=\"525\" width=\"700\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">J.

from the National Weather Service.</p><p>The outburst sent plasma and magnetically charged particles, called a coronal mass ejection (CME), speeding towards Earth. If those particles had hit our atmosphere just right, the NWS <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NWSSWPC/posts/4863777813673409\">said</a>, they could have inundated the planet in a geomagnetic storm that would interfere with power grids, GPS, and radio communications, and even affect satellites' orbits around Earth.</p><p>These impacts could have extended into the northern US and brought the aurora borealis - a reaction between solar particles and Earth's atmosphere - creeping down into regions from Pennsylvania to Iowa to Oregon.</p><p>But when the CME arrived on Wednesday, there were no northern lights in these lower states.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f75f1fe0ab50d00184ad8db?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Aurora Borealis\" height=\"1500\" width=\"1999\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) is seen over the sky near Rovaniemi in Lapland, Finland, October 7, 2018.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alexander Kuznetsov/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The space-weather branch of the National Weather Service had initially issued a watch for a \"strong\" geomagnetic storm on Thursday, but it downgraded the watch to \"minor\" after the CME's arrival.</p><p>This was because the CME's magnetic field was pointing north, according to Mike Hapgood, a space-weather consultant at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK. It would need to face south in order to wash far enough through the North Pole opening in Earth's magnetic field to reach the US.</p><p>\"We're unlikely to see much activity, and the aurora will stay further north over Canada,\" Hapgood told Business Insider. The northern reaches of Maine and Michigan <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation\">may</a> still catch a glimpse of the green lights, though.</p><p>But Illinoisans and Iowans shouldn't despair. There may be better opportunities for them to see the aurora in the near future.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ed7098d988ee353a8208169?format=jpeg\" alt=\"aurora southern lights earth atmosphere international space station iss\" height=\"518\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Aurora Australis, or southern lights, as seen from the International Space Station, on June 25, 2017.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHwh3xkEa8\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>That's because this CME was just a preview of an upcoming period of intense solar activity that could bring more geomagnetic storms and far-reaching aurorae. The sun is entering a new 11-year solar cycle, which means its eruptions and flares will grow more frequent and violent, ramping up to a peak in 2025.</p><p>\"This is more a wake-up call that stronger storms could occur in the next few years - and we ought to make sure we are ready for them,\" Hapgood said.</p><p>Strong solar storms are fairly common - the NWS <a href=\"https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation\">estimates</a> that each solar cycle produces about 200 of them - but scientists can't always predict them like this. That often means that power grids and key radio connections are left vulnerable.</p><h2>NASA is working to better predict space weather</h2><p>Electric currents from solar storms can travel down Earth's pipelines and power lines, overpowering technologies that humans rely on.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f0f5f544dca68027d287db4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Solar Orbiter sun corona\" height=\"876\" width=\"1167\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Solar Orbiter took this picture of the sun as it approached closer than any previous spacecraft on May 30, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Solar Orbiter/EUI Team (ESA &#38; NASA); CSL, IAS, MPS, PMOD/WRC, ROB, UCL/MSSL</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In 1989, an inundation of particles from the sun <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-helps-power-grids-weather-geomagnetic-storms\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"33582a4c21859d56cd7046e1126d7a84\">knocked out Quebec's power</a> for about nine hours.

leaders that Republicans \"beat the hell\" out of downballot Democrats in the 2020 election by portraying them as supportive of \"defunding\" the police in a Tuesday meeting with civil rights leaders, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/12/10/biden-audio-meeting-civil-rights-leaders/\">according to audio of the meeting obtained by the Intercept.&#160;</a></p><p>The call included Vice-president elect Sen. Kamala Harris, prominent civil rights advocates including NAACP President Derrick Johnson, National Action Network founder Rev. Al Sharpton, NAACP Education &#38; Legal Defense Fund leader Sherrilyn Ifill, former Department of Justice Civil Rights Division leader Vanita Gupta, and Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, who is set to join the Biden administration.&#160;</p><p>\"I also don't think we should get too far ahead ourselves on dealing with police reform in that, because they've already labeled us as being 'defund the police' anything we put forward in terms of the organizational structure to change policing - which I promise you, will occur. Promise you,\" Biden said during the call.</p><p>Police and criminal justice reform became a Nationwide issue earlier this year after the police killings of George Floyd, Breona Taylor, and other Black Americans. Some activists have used the phrasing \"defund the police\" to describe how they wanted justice and policing reformed in their communities.</p><p>\"That's how they beat the living hell out of us across the country, saying that we're talking about defunding the police. We're not. We're talking about holding them accountable,\" Biden said. \"We're talking about giving them money to do the right things. We're talking about putting more psychologists and psychiatrists on the telephones when the 911 calls through. We're talking about spending money to enable them to do their jobs better, not with more force, with less force and more understanding.\"</p><p>Just beore making his remaks about police, Biden responded to a concern<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/09/black-farmers-tom-vilsack-agriculture-usda-biden-cabinet-444077\">&#160;from Johnson about nominating Tom Vilsack to serve as Agriculture Secretary</a>, a position Vilsack held for the entire duration of former President Barack Obama's administration from 2009 to 2017.&#160;</p><p>In 2010, Vilsack was criticized for<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-tom-vilsack-agriculture-secretary_n_5fd03658c5b61d81b33a0d17\"> firing Shirley Sherrod</a>, then the Director of Rural Development for the agency, over remarks she made that were deceptively edited by Breitbart News founder Andrew Breitbart. After an uproar over her ouster, Vilsack offered Sherrod a job back at the department, which she declined.&#160;</p><p>On January 5, there are two US Senate runoffs taking place in Georgia, which will determine which party controls the US Senate. If Democrats win both seats, control of the Senate will be evenly divided between 50 Democratic caucus members and 50 Republicans with Harris as the tie-breaking vote.&#160;</p><p>\"If you consider the victory that you appreciated in Georgia, it was around 12,000 votes,\" Johnson said. \"And so as you consider appointments, you also must consider what impact would that have on voters in the state of Georgia. And I will submit to you that former Secretary Vilsack could have a disastrous impact on voters in Georgia. Shirley Sherrod is a civil rights legend, a hero.\"</p><p>Biden told Johnson he'd \"learn more about Vilsack's record\" before he pivoted to warning the leaders not to go all-in on police reform or promote the \"defund the police\" slogan ahead of the Georgia runoffs.</p><p>While Biden won the presidency with 306 Electoral College votes, Democrats down the ballot didn't fare as well. Pending the outcome of the Georgia runoffs.

When closed, it's properly leak-proof, and it's got a switch at the base of the lid that locks it shut so you can confidently toss it in your bag.</p><p>The lid disassembles into two plastic pieces and two rubber gaskets, so you can get into all the nooks and crannies as you clean it. Unfortunately, you'll have to clean all the parts by hand as it's not dishwasher safe. It's a skinny mug too, so you'll want to invest in a good bottle brush. Because it's so skinny, you may have trouble fitting large ice cubes into it. It may also rattle around in your car's cupholder. But we're being nitpicky here.</p><p>If you want the mug that's going to keep your coffee hot the longest and provide the best drinking experience, this is your pick. Zojirushi also offers a five-year warranty on the vacuum insulation, so if your mug loses its ability to retain temperature, Zojirushi will replace it.</p>\n\tThe best with a carry loop\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8f8e6cb0526700185cc83b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"hydro flask coffee travel mug cap\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Les Shu/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hydroflask.com%2F16-oz-coffee-with-flex-sip-lid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Hydro Flask Coffee</a> is comfortable to drink from and easy to tote around on your next adventure thanks to its strong rubber carry loop.</h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Rubber carry loop, comfortable to drink from, lid disassembles easily, dishwasher safe, lifetime warranty</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Retained coffee smell, rubber loop may not be durable enough for attaching to packs</p><p>As much as I love the Zojirushi mug, it can get annoying to carry it around if you're roaming around bag-free or just don't have anywhere to stow it. The Hydro Flask Coffee helps mitigate this problem with the addition of a sturdy rubber carry loop. While walking around with it, I primarily held onto the loop with one or two fingers.</p><p>The Hydro Flask also provided one of the nicest drinking experiences of all the mugs we tested. The lid simply twists open, the liquid flows well, and there's no large lid mechanism to get in the way while you're drinking. When closed, the lid reveals a red square so you can quickly see that your mug is sealed. The lid disassembles into three plastic pieces and one rubber gasket, and all parts are dishwasher safe on the top rack.</p><p>In our temperature tests, it kept coffee hot for five hours and ice frozen for four and a half. We did find that the stainless steel retained some coffee smell after repeated use, so you may want to dedicate this mug to one type of beverage.</p><p>While the lid system does a good job of keeping it sealed, it's not as convenient to use as a trigger button if you primarily use your mug while driving. If you hit a bump and the lid is open, you might encounter a small spill. This was a rare occurrence, but drivers may want to keep this in mind.</p>\n\tThe best flip-top travel mug\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8f8e85b0526700185cc83d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"swell commuter travel mug cap\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Les Shu/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>With its one-piece flip-top lid, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WDRQ7Z6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_051517_best-travel-mugs-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07WDRQ7Z6&#38;linkId=3b8bfdcf7555c12e3c72af0d7b98344a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">S'well Commuter</a> is easy to clean and leak-proof, and it manages heat retention reasonably well.</h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple lid is easy to clean, stays leak-proof even after repeated use</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Too large for some cupholders, handwash only, won't keep ice frozen for very long</p><p>We disqualified more than one travel mug simply due to their exceedingly complicated lid mechanisms. A lid that's too hard to disassemble and clean will discourage you from washing it properly which can lead to mold growth. Flip-top lids are often one piece and the most simple, so mold has nowhere to hide.</p><p>The best flip-top travel mug we tried was the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WDRQ7Z6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_051517_best-travel-mugs-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07WDRQ7Z6&#38;linkId=3b8bfdcf7555c12e3c72af0d7b98344a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">S'well Commuter</a>. It kept coffee hot for five hours, though admittedly it performed the worst in our ice test, keeping ice frozen for a mere two and a half hours. But it made up for it in its ease of use. The flip-top protrudes slightly from the lid, giving your thumb something to push up against and open the lid. It also folds back and locks in place so it doesn't droop and hit you in the nose while you drink.</p><p>Its wide base does mean that it may not fit in some cupholders &#8212; it's just slightly too fat for my Toyota Corolla &#8212; so if you're a car commuter, you may need to look elsewhere.

To drink, you simply press and hold down the button on the lid which depresses the stopper in the spout and lets liquid flow. Upon releasing the button, the stopper raises back up to seal the spout.&#160;</p><p>The Stanley performed admirably in our temperature tests, keeping coffee hot for six hours and ice frozen for four &#8212; firmly middle of the pack. The lid mechanism is a bit complicated, with buttons and springs, so you'll want to regularly disassemble it and get into the nooks and crannies with a brush to ensure it doesn't harbor mold, especially around the metal spring. It disassembles into two pieces with a simple twist.</p><p>The main disadvantage to this mug is also its main draw &#8212; you have to press the button to drink. The button is positioned on the back of the lid, so you may find your own hand gets in the way of drinking, especially if your hand is larger. The button is also why this is one of Les Shu's favorites, who has been using it nonstop since early 2019.</p>\n\tThe best large-capacity travel mug\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f90894eabcd0c0018d68e33?format=jpeg\" alt=\"yeti rambler Travel Mug Cap\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Gushue/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>If a single cup of coffee simply won't cut it, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0842S56G8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_051517_best-travel-mugs-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B0842S56G8&#38;linkId=67763060b80d85d18994005887211e09\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Yeti Rambler 26-oz.

It was competitive in both temperature tests, and it fit nicely in cupholders which the S'well did not. But it lost out in the ease of use department. Its flip-top lies almost flush with the rest of the cap, so it's hard to get your thumb under it to open it, and it's so stiff that it requires quite a bit of force.</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NRCGYY6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_051517_best-travel-mugs-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07NRCGYY6&#38;linkId=f8a2a1bca55e4dda79e5e67d795f901c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Klean Kanteen Insulated TKWide</a>: </strong>This was another tough call in our best with a carry loop category. The Klean Kanteen actually beat out the Hydro Flask in both temperature tests, albeit by small margins, and we like the metal carry loop for durability. But the Klean Kanteen lid is difficult to disassemble for proper cleaning, and the metal carry loop is uncomfortable if you're carrying it by hand. The Hydro Flask just offered a nicer drinking experience.

But we encountered enough issues that stopped them from making our final list. Some didn't perform as well as our top picks, while others are a bit niche or too pricey for us to recommend to everyone. We plan to revisit these for our next update, to see if our opinion has changed since we last tested them.</p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PGGQFWS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_051517_best-travel-mugs-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07PGGQFWS&#38;linkId=e6b372206a2800cfc59dd1cda300fa6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Thermos Stainless King</a>: </strong>The Thermos name is synonymous with travel mugs, so we wanted to test one. It performed well in the heat test but rather poorly in the cold test. Senior Editor Les Shu liked how easy it was to lock and unlock the lid. I found it difficult to disassemble and reassemble, while he didn't. Ultimately, it was edged out by stronger performers.&#160;</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N3C5BM8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_051517_best-travel-mugs-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07N3C5BM8&#38;linkId=50c08db43ca33f788dc0fccc37c82e38\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Contigo Luxe Autoseal</a>: </strong>We had high hopes for the Contigo since its predecessor, the Autoseal West Loop was our previous best overall pick. But it was the only mug that grew mold during my testing period. Shu, who uses this often as an everyday mug, said extra attention is needed when cleaning the inner spring mechanism, which is difficult to reach, but this should keep mold away. <br />For me, the metal lid also got hot when full of coffee, which made the button on the lid uncomfortable to press to drink. Shu does not find this to be an issue, and he appreciates the easy button press to unlock. Despite our difference of opinion on the Contigo, we concurred that for most people, the difficulty in cleaning was a dealbreaker. Contigo mugs are popular and can be found in many retailers, so if you do pick one up, we recommend getting a good set of cleaning brushes, like <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;xcust=biipgf_051517_best-travel-mugs&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gocontigo.com%2Fcleaning-brushes-set-of-3.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">these from the company</a>,</li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&#38;mi=10248&#38;pw=184534&#38;ctc=&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F183023%2Fstanley-stay-hot-titanium-travel-mug-14-fl-oz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Stanley Stay-Hot Titanium Travel Mug</a>: </strong>I received this mug from Stanley in an unsolicited press mailer, so I decided to throw it on the testing pile.

It's more of a cup with a lid, but Otterbox has a good reputation, so we decided to give it a shot. It performed poorly in the heat test, but it surprised us by posting a mid-range score in the cold test. If you're an iced coffee lover, you might not want to discount this one. But be aware, it's not leak-proof. <strong>Editor's note:&#160;</strong>During our first round of testing, we didn't try the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_051517_best-travel-mugs/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/elevation/thermal-lid/otr57-tumbler-acc-thermos.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Thermal Lid</a> (shown above), an optional lid that turns the Elevation Tumbler into a proper travel mug.

Our three testers analyzed general ease of use, how they felt to drink from, and how easy they were to clean. We also tested for more technical aspects of each mug like temperature retention and how leak-proof each mug was. Our initial testing period lasted one month, but we are still testing long-term durability in case issues arise. Below are each of our tests.</p><p><strong>Temperature retention</strong>: To test heat retention, we filled each mug with water heated to 136 degrees Fahrenheit, the optimal temperature for hot beverages <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305417907002550?via%3Dihub#!\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to a study</a> by the University of Texas. We then tested the temperature hourly and noted change. Once the temperature dropped 25 degrees, we deemed the beverage too cold to drink and ended the test. To test cold retention, we filled each mug with 45-degree water straight from the refrigerator. We added three ice cubes and timed how long the ice remained frozen.</p><p><strong>Leak test: </strong>We filled each travel mug with water and turned it upside down and shook it for a total of 30 seconds. We performed this test once at the beginning of our testing period and again at the end to ensure each mug stayed leak-proof even after repeated use.</p><p><strong>Ease of use and cleaning</strong>: We wanted to test how easy each mug was to drink from while on the go. We noted how easy each mug was to operate with one hand. We also noted how well the liquid flowed out of each and whether or not they fit in standard car cupholders. We took into account how easy each mug was to clean. Many of these mugs have complex lids that can harbor mold if not properly sanitized. If lids were too complicated, difficult to disassemble or reassemble, or began to show signs of mold even after what we thought was a thorough cleaning, the mug lost major points.</p><p><strong>Long-term testing</strong>: Though our initial testing period lasted roughly five months, we acknowledge that other issues could crop up with long-term use. We are continuing to test each of our top picks and we will update this guide with any issues we encounter.</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Every day it offers a new sequence, delivered via illustrated asana by asana alongside an on-screen timer counting down how long to hold each pose for (one minute each). After five poses (and five minutes), your daily practice is finished.</p><p>For a fee, you can unlock more content and longer routines. But it's near impossible to find any yoga app for free (or rather, one that doesn't require you to start paying after a short trial period), so we'll take what we can get. What's more, if you're totally new to yoga and need help establishing a daily habit, five minutes is long enough to help you de-stress and be introduced to the practice in digestible chunks. <em>--Rachael Schultz</em></p>\n\tThe best free workout for older adults\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fc968e0b6a3a800199b67fa?format=jpeg\" alt=\"y360_cardio\" height=\"679\" width=\"905\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">ymca 360</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Stay moving and get familiar with a new routine using the <a href=\"https://ymca360.org/on-demand#/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">YMCA 360</a> health and fitness on-demand videos.</h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Short and long workout options across several exercise types, keeps time and rep counts for you</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited number of total workouts, doesn't offer much variety in fitness level&#160;</p><p>If you're older and looking to stay healthy, YMCA 360 offers a section of videos specifically for the active, older user.

These workouts moved at a steady pace and offered exercise modifications to make moves easier to manage. I personally like a bit more speed and energy in my workouts, but these get the job done.</p><p>For anyone who likes familiarity with their workouts, and wants to know exactly what they're getting into, YMCA's videos are perfect.

Each video states the length and optional equipment needed upfront, so you're never caught off-guard.&#160;</p><p>For light cardio classes, the Life Time Athletic courses are perfect.

This means that anyone who has a bag and gloves of their own, or who wants to shadowbox, can follow the free workouts.

Here are a few of our favorites that stood out, but ultimately didn't make the cut:</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.corepoweryoga.com/yoga-on-demand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CorePower Yoga</a>: </strong>The yoga franchise maintains their class approach through their app, offering everything from foundation-building, beginner-friendly courses to more challenging asanas to routines that focus more on a fitness flow, making this a great option if you want to grow or diversify your yoga practice. This was our top choice for a yoga app when they lifted their paywall at the beginning of the pandemic, but classes are back to being free for just the first seven days for new subscribers, and then require a monthly fee.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.boxandflow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Box + Flow</a>: </strong>Led by fitness expert, Olivia Young, Box + Flow takes the popular boxing class formula and adds the mindfulness of yoga for a well-rounded, yet intense, workout.

Since each app is entirely free, it was important to create a benchmark for how well they perform and to associate a different kind of value to them without factoring in price. Here's what we looked for in each category:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of use:&#160;</strong>An intuitive app experience is vital to not only enjoy using it but also to get the most out of it. If an app is cumbersome in its navigation, or makes finding and choosing workouts difficult, then it won't promote much in the way of motivation or desire to work out.&#160;</li><li><strong>Variety:&#160;</strong>Though we broke down the guide into specific sections on activities like yoga or boxing, we wanted to see that the apps that fell into the other categories were diverse enough in what they offered to keep the experience fresh and engaging. This means offering more than just one or two workout styles, as well as making available a library of classes.</li><li><strong>Effectiveness:&#160;</strong>This category doesn't necessarily mean results from a fitness standpoint. Though that is important, there's not a way to judge that reliably or to stand behind one person's interpretation of it, so this instead means how well it's able to motivate you to workout, if it's able to push you through to the end of a session, and if it offers enough variety to allow you the chance to learn new exercises.&#160;&#160;</li><li><strong>Entertainment value:&#160;</strong>If you enjoy working out, you'll do it more often &#8212; plain and simple. Even free apps can offer some form of entertainment which can serve as a huge reason to revisit it (and workout) often.&#160;&#160;</li></ul>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/best-free-virtual-workouts'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/zuNolsdcUBA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 22:30:58 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5e838cd10c2a622b7b182e48?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"e53317c1926f91c83828347e0ed8c3d5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn15@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-35-12-414_73d234becfd004cb.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":960,"sourceBytes":33894,"destBytes":33894,"author":"insider@insider.com (Amy Schlinger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fc96918b6a3a800199b67fc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn51@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-35-25-071_9485ad5397b500e9.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fc96c0d037cbd0018613bee?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn23@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-35-29-819_151bb0b21c78b025.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fc968e0b6a3a800199b67fa?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn52@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-35-31-492_ca52fe5cc145caa3.webp","https://i.insider.com/5e838cd10c2a622b7b182e48?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn15@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-35-12-414_73d234becfd004cb.webp","https://i.insider.com/5dfa3e2c71a5ca7b72555667?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn88@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-35-27-369_a960877d0c0dc165.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fc96b95b6a3a800199b6809?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn34@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-30-106_5ab90f77a8daf3aa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-32-215_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn85@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-35-25-989_e44c82c2b74e51af.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn92@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-35-30-979_a47841bfebad56b2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn10@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-35-26-907_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zuNolsdcUBA:7H3mTmgoxSo:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn34@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-35-30-500_97b67a3ed14defdc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/zuNolsdcUBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn70@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-33-822_211221fcb0bf008a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607675712078},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:35:12","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:35:12","title":"Back when travel was a thing, we tested about half of Lo & Sons' travel bags - if you're looking for a gift or a bag to use when it's safe to adventure again, here's what to buy","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-lo-and-sons-bags","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>When you buy through our links, we may earn money from our affiliate partners. <a href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><p><a href=\"http://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGR0dLRUJGSEhLR01CRk1OTklL?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loandsons.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd259ce30f2740018b0f1b6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Lo &#38;

Sons makes stylish, travel-friendly bags that are optimized for space and function.</p><p>Founder and CEO Helen Lo originally launched Lo &#38; Sons with the mission of creating a travel bag that alleviated the back pain she developed in her mid-60s. This sparked the idea that birthed <a href=\"https://www.pjtra.com/t/TUJGR0dLRUJGSEhLR01CRk1OTklL?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loandsons.com%2Fpages%2Fdiscover-og2-womens-travel-laptop-bag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">the O.G. overnight bag</a>, a smartly designed shoulder bag with a suitcase-handle sleeve for easy transportation.</p><p>From there, Lo &#38; Sons' success drove the team to develop over 15 other styles, including overnight bags, laptop bags, camera bags, clutches, backpacks, and more - for both men and women. Lo &#38; Sons prides itself on only using high-quality materials to make its bags, careful placement of pockets and compartments, and travel-friendly details, like the aforementioned suitcase-handle sleeve, so you spend less time fumbling with your belongings and more time exploring.</p><p>At first glance, some of the bags seem a bit pricey, but consider what you're getting for the money: Many of the bags convert to multiple styles (<a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/TUJGR0dLRUJGSEhLR01CRk1OTklL?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loandsons.com%2Fpages%2Fedgemont-mens-travel-laptop-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">the $128 Edgemont</a> goes from backpack to tote in just a few steps) and all of the bags feature thoughtfully designed pockets and compartments, for everything from your shoes to your laptop depending on their size. There's none of that, \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" business. It's obvious how much designing and testing Lo &#38; Sons has done before launching each travel bag.</p><p>The Insider Reviews team put eight different bags to the test (back when it was safe to do so), traversing New York City and even traveling across the country and overseas. Our travels and daily commutes were much improved as a result.

Overnight Bag quickly became my go-to personal item on flights back when it was safe to travel. Its suitcase-handle sleeve is a game-changer; I could rest assured that when I placed my personal item atop my carry-on it wouldn't fall off. Inside the bag are some even cooler features, like a padded laptop sleeve, a separate shoe compartment, and tons of pockets for organizing everything from my pens to my earbuds. The O.G. also comes with a messenger strap for easy and comfortable carrying across your body or over your shoulder, and it's made of durable and water-resistant nylon, so there's no need to worry about it being ruined by coffee spills or bad weather. <strong>&#8212; Ellen Hoffman, Insider Reviews executive editor</strong></p><p>With all of all the smart features, I've found I'm able to fit just about everything I need for a weekend away in this one bag, unless it's winter (because sweaters and coats are just too bulky). Even though the bag is so structured, it's really lightweight, making it really easy to carry, even when loaded with clothing and toiletries. While pricey, I think it's worth the $295 investment. <strong>&#8212; Remi Rosmarin, former Insider Reviews reporter</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/lo-and-sons-og-overnight-bag-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our full review of The O.G. here</a>.</strong></p>\n\tCatalina Deluxe Large Weekender Travel Bag\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5cae0b2919ed2901e068285c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019 04 10 at 11.26.14 AM\" height=\"673\" width=\"897\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lo &#38; Sons</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"http://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGR0dLRUJGSEhLR01CRk1OTklL?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loandsons.com%2Fproducts%2Fcatalina-deluxe-washed-canvas-midnight-ash&#38;sid=biip_041019_lo-and-sons-travel-bags-team-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Catalina Deluxe Weekender Large Travel Bag, from $86</a></h3><p>I took the <a href=\"http://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGR0dLRUJGSEhLR01CRk1OTklL?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loandsons.com%2Fproducts%2Fcatalina-deluxe-washed-canvas-midnight-ash&#38;sid=biip_041019_lo-and-sons-travel-bags-team-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Catalina Deluxe Weekender Large Travel Bag</a> on a couple of short road trips a while ago.

I have yet to max out the large bag on a weekend trip, even with packing sweaters and bulkier items. If I were traveling to a warm-weather destination, the bag could easily fit a week's worth of clothes. The bottom compartment comes in handy for separating out shoes and heavier pieces of clothing, but I did find the zipper hard to maneuver when the bag was empty, since the weight of the canvas bag weighs it down.

On top of that, the memory-foam shoulder straps are very comfortable, so much so that I almost forgot I was carrying 15-20 pounds on my back. I'm not sure I'll ever use another travel backpack if I'm being honest. <strong>&#8212; Francesca Rea, Insider Reviews senior story producer</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/lo-and-sons-hanover-deluxe-backpack-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read our full review of the Hanover Deluxe here</a>.</strong></p>\n\tRowledge Convertible Nylon Backpack Tote\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5cd9b2dc021b4c26d818b689?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Slider 2_Rowledge_Suitcase Handle Sleeve_750x\" height=\"562\" width=\"750\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lo &#38; Sons</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"http://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGR0dLRUJGSEhLR01CRk1OTklL?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loandsons.com%2Fproducts%2Frowledge-nylon-black-gold-grey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Rowledge Convertible Nylon Backpack Tote, from $170</a></h3><p>The newest Lo &#38; Sons bag, <a href=\"http://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGR0dLRUJGSEhLR01CRk1OTklL?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loandsons.com%2Fproducts%2Frowledge-nylon-black-gold-grey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">the Rowledge</a>, marries style and function for one of the company's most-wanted bags to date (there's currently a wait list for it). It does have a hefty price tag, but it has a lot going for it to justify the cost: It converts three ways so it can serve you whether you're in work mode, travel mode, or weekend mode. It has a laptop sleeve, key leash, and many other useful compartments, like exterior side pockets that can be unzipped to store your water bottle, or zipped up for a sleek, virtually invisible, look.

After all, 10 million of these pocket knives are produced annually. But how does one factory produce 45,000 each day, and in such a precise manner?</p><p>The Swiss Army knives has been around for nearly 130 years. It was originally delivered to the Swiss Army by Karl Elsener in 1891. The knives are now produced by Victorinox, Europe's largest knife manufacturer. The company was founded in 1884.&#160;</p><p>The main factory in Ibach, Switzerland, produces a variety of knives, designed to offer versatility and compactness. Here, it takes around 5minutes to produce a pocket knife depending on the model. There are 400 different models.</p><p>The basis of the knife is 85% iron, along with 13% chromium and a small trace of other metals.</p><p>2,400 metric tonnes of steel are imported to the factory each year. From these rolls, knife blades are stamped to 2 millimeters thick. This requires 50 metric tonnes of pressure. Each roll can make 16,000 blades.</p><p>Various tools require various alloys for hardness. Blades are made from hard steel, whereas screwdrivers are formed from softer steel. The blades are rounded off using triangular-shaped plastic wheels and water.</p><p>The knife blades are then extracted via a magnet and grinded down again to achieve an exact width. They are imprinted with a company stamp, then placed in an oven at 1,050 degrees Celsius.&#160;</p><p>The signature red outer casing is formed via injection molding. Other tools for the knives are produced on nearby machines via a process of milling and grinding.</p><p>The classic officer's knife is assembled by machine at the factory. Other editions are assembled by hand.&#160;</p><p>The blades are smoothed and given a final inspection. A small metal cross emblem - the Victorinox Cross &#38; Shield - is inspected via a microscope to ensure standard thickness. This was added the first time in 1909 and later to all Victorinox knives since 2006.</p><p>The knives are exported from the Ibach factory to over 120 countries.&#160;</p><p><em>Special thanks to the

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>A blistering investigation into Facebook's ad business published by <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ad-scams-revenue-china-tiktok-vietnam?ref=bfnsplash\">BuzzFeed News</a> on Thursday revealed in new detail how the company prioritizes making money over enforcing its own rules intended to protect users from scammers and hackers.</p><p>According to BuzzFeed News, Facebook continues to knowingly allow - and profit from - fraudulent advertisers, and the company's ad business is \"built with the same lax controls and outsourcing of critical moderation work\" that has allowed disinformation, hate speech, and harassment to proliferate on its platform.</p><p>Facebook employs thousands of third-party contractors, through companies like Accenture, BCforward, and Cognizant, to review both user-generated content and ads placed on its platform to ensure they comply with Facebook's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards\">extensive policies</a>.</p><p>But an Accenture employee who manages 45 reviewers for Facebook told them to ignore patterns of fraud and hacked accounts as long as \"Facebook gets paid\" with legitimate payment methods so that it isn't on the hook for issuing refunds, BuzzFeed News reported, adding that the manager justified allowing hackers to run ads via hacked accounts because it was a win-win - more revenue for Facebook and a larger audience for the hacker.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the company invests heavily in keeping bad ads off its platform, and disagreed with the idea that it has profited from bad ads, but declined to comment about how it handles the money it makes from ads that violate its rules.</p><p>\"We have every incentive - financial and otherwise - to prevent abuse and make the ads experience on Facebook a positive one. To suggest otherwise fundamentally misunderstands our business model and mission,\" the spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.</p><p>Facebook did not respond to a request from Business Insider for comment on this story, and Accenture did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.</p><p>Facebook's ad business brought in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-earnings-q3-2020-revenue-eps-profit-analysis-2020-10\">$21.2 billion in revenue</a> in the third quarter. But as BuzzFeed News and others have previously reported, some of that revenue has come from shady and at times dangerous advertisers, including <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-profit-boogaloo-ads\">pro-violence white supremacists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/ads-inc-crypto-scams-facebook\">scam artists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/facebook-running-anti-vax-ads-despite-ban-anti\">anti-vaxxers</a>, and hawkers of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/chiropractor-runnings-false-covid-ads\">COVID-19 disinformation</a>.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong><em> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apple-privacy-battle-ads-how-users-interact-with-tech-2020-12?r=ts-sub\">The battle between Facebook and Apple over privacy is about more than just ads - it's about the future of how we interact with tech</a></em></p><p>Facebook has repeatedly pledged to crack down on bad actors on its platforms, but dozens of reports in recent months have exposed instances where Facebook's inability to enforce its own policies <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ad-purge-hurting-small-business-owners-holiday-shopping-season-2020-11?r=ts-sub\">accurately</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-mislabeled-60-of-georgia-election-misinfo-posts-report-2020-12?r=ts-sub\">consistently</a>, efficiently, or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-trump-family-misinformation-rules-exemption-donald-trump-jr-2020-1?r=ts-sub\">even at all</a> have halted progress toward those goals.</p><p>Here are a few of the major revelations from the investigation:</p><ul><li>Facebook banned political advertisers from creating new ads in the week before the US elections in November to head off misinformation. But before that deadline, it told moderators to prioritize selling ads over looking for rule-breaking ones and to reactivate accounts that broke its rules whenever possible, according to the report. (Facebook told BuzzFeed News the shift in focus was meant to help advertisers get their message out ahead of the ban.)</li><li>TikTok precursor Musical.ly had placed ads featuring young girls dancing provocatively. But when Facebook employees raised concerns that Facebook's algorithm was targeting the ads primarily toward middle-aged men, the company restricted their access to data about the ads, implied that it dismissed their concerns because Musical.ly was a big spender, and let the ads run for a year and a half, the report said. (Facebook told BuzzFeed News it created a policy against suggesting sexualized interactions - though it was never announced anywhere public.)</li><li>An internal Facebook review found that, of thousands of ads placed by Chinese advertisers, 30% violated at least one of Facebook's policies, and employees said the company looks the other way even though issues with China-based advertisers are well-known. (Facebook told BuzzFeed News it has a dedicated \"business integrity\" team in Asia and doesn't ignore violations by China-based advertisers.)</li></ul><h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ad-scams-revenue-china-tiktok-vietnam?ref=bfnsplash\">Read the full BuzzFeed News story here »</a></strong></h2><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-allowed-fraud-hacked-accounts-ads-got-paid-2020-12'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/JlF0USMXivM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 07:15:22 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fd2cd7e9cf1420018d2eb06?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"0d4cac5abb46e5e42c0f2fb996b8cbd5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn45@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-20-546_3c19c829b61eda65.webp","destWidth":2291,"destHeight":1718,"sourceBytes":196244,"destBytes":196244,"author":"tsonnemaker@businessinsider.com (Tyler Sonnemaker)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f625ffa323fc4001e0d6ac9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn1@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-34-334_db2490752d7adaa0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-32-215_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-35-26-066_debe34c826e0ea59.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn46@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-35-35-252_6f48626dd21b77e4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn10@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-35-26-907_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=JlF0USMXivM:n3-0x05ZJl8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn71@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-35-26-127_a3f02da5d689c15c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/JlF0USMXivM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn52@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-35-22-093_c2de939297646908.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607675712033},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:35:12","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:35:12","title":"Airbnb Luxe is a collection of vetted luxury homes with standout amenities and a designated trip planner.

The New York-based drugmaker and its German partner, BioNTech, said in November that the 2-shot vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-well-pfizer-shot-works-against-covid-19-2020-12\">95% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19</a> in a massive clinical trial.&#160;</p><p>The FDA convened an independent expert panel Thursday to weigh in on Pfizer's application. The group included some of the top virologists and medical experts in the nation, including Dr. Eric Rubin, an infectious-disease specialist and editor-in-chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, and Dr. Paul Offit, a top vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania who co-invented the rotavirus vaccine.</p><h2><strong>There were 4 'no' votes, and some experts raised questions around the inclusion of 16- and 17-year-olds in the authorization&#160;</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8ede909e9fe4001900a481?format=jpeg\" alt=\"16-year-old participates in coronavirus vaccine trial for Pfizer at Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital, pediatric vaccine studies COVID-19\" height=\"1536\" width=\"2048\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A 16-year-old participates in Pfizer&#39;s clinical trial to test its coronavirus vaccine candidate.

One <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-trial-experience-side-effects-2020-12\">Pfizer vaccine trial participant spoke during the public comment period in the afternoon</a>, urging the FDA to authorize Pfizer's vaccine for emergency use Thursday night by saying \"let's roll.\"</p><p>Before the vote, there was some debate among experts about whether or not there was enough data to support OK'ing the vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds, who were included in the wording of the FDA's voting question. No one under the age of 18 got sick with COVID-19 during the trial. Some on the committee expressed a desire to increase the minimum vaccination age to 18, until more data is available.</p><p>On of the four \"no\" voters, David Kim, told Business Insider&#160;that including 16- and 17-year-olds in the mix was his reason for voting against the question of the day.</p><p>\"My 'no' vote was because of the inclusion of 16-17 year-olds,\" Kim said in an email. \"Unfortunately, I and other members who had also voted 'no' did not have an opportunity to explain our positions before the meeting was adjourned.\"</p><p>Another expert who voted no was Dr. Archana Chatterjee, a pediatrician who's dean of the Chicago Medical School. She told CNN she wasn't in favor of making the shot available for 16- and 17-year-olds.</p><p>\"I want to make it very clear that I am fully supportive of the emergency use authorization of this vaccine for adults 18 years and older,\" she told CNN.</p><p>The reasons the other two members voted \"no\" were unclear. The group adjourned promptly, leaving no time for members to explain why they voted the way they did. Business Insider has reached out to each of the \"no\" voters for comment.</p><h2><strong>The panel discussed long-term safety of the shot</strong></h2><p>Dr. Cody Meissner, chief of the pediatrics infectious disease division at Tufts University School of Medicine said during the meeting that he's \"comfortable\" with the available safety data, particularly given the urgency of this pandemic, which is killing thousands of Americans every day. Meissner was the lone abstention from the vote.&#160;</p><p>He added that issues typically occur within the first 40 days of a vaccine. There has only been one instance of vaccine injury more than 60 days after a shot being administered, and that was in an immunocompromised patient who received the live polio vaccine.</p><p>Oveta Fuller, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Michigan, said that we don't yet know enough about the long-term protective effect of this shot.</p><p>\"We've only been looking for two months,\" Fuller said.</p><p>Others cautioned that this is uncharted territory because Pfizer's vaccine is based on a brand-new technological platform called messenger RNA.&#160;</p><p>Over decades of vaccine trials, the overwhelming majority of issues pop up in the first few weeks, within about 40 days. That gave some members confidence that this vaccine is safe, even though it's using a new kind of virus-fighting platform.&#160;</p><p>Throughout the meeting, no panel member expressed substantive doubts about the overall merits of the vaccine, particularly in the benefits it could provide to the most vulnerable Americans who will be prioritized.</p><h2><strong>One committee member suggested a new study on allergies</strong></h2><p>Two vaccine recipients in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-ingredients-allergic-reactions-2020-12\">both with histories of severe allergies, have had allergic reactions shortly after receiving their first Pfizer shot</a>. Both fully recovered after a shot of epinephrine. Questions about what to do with people with severe allergies prompted some of the most lively discussions of the day.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Offit said Pfizer should now run a smaller trial focused on people with food allergies, vaccinating them and watching them closely.</p><p>\"This issue is not going to die until we have better data,\" Offit said. \"You're talking about tens of millions of people who are not going to get this vaccine.\"</p><h2><strong>The FDA is expected to approve the shot this weekend, kicking off the US' largest ever vaccine campaign</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f71dadb74fe5b0018a8db55?format=jpeg\" alt=\"vaccine\" height=\"1843\" width=\"2852\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A half-dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine initially could mean we have double the number doses available when it&#39;s approved by regulators.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Siphiwe Sibeko/Pool via AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>FDA officials signaled that vaccine authorization could come as soon as this Saturday or Sunday, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/virginiahughes/status/1337165842379927557\">the New York Times</a>. That authorization would kick off the largest vaccination campaign in the history of the US.&#160;</p><p>Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's vaccine initiative, plans to start shipping doses to states within 24 hours of authorization. Warp Speed officials said 2.9 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine will be sent out in an initial shipment.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/healthcare-workers-long-term-care-residents-recommended-to-get-vaccines-first-2020-12\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#160;has suggested</a> that healthcare workers and nursing home residents, both groups who've been hard-hit by the pandemic, should be first in line. That's just a recommendation, however, and states are free to decide how they want to allocate their vaccine supply.</p><p>The vaccine authorization couldn't come at a more critical time, as the number of COVID-19 deaths per day in the US just surpassed 3,000 for the first time.&#160;</p><p>\"We are pleased with the vote, and if the FDA issues an authorization, stand at the ready to bring this vaccine to people in the US in an effort to help combat this devastating pandemic,\" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement after the panel voted.</p><h2><strong>A panel will review Moderna's shot next week</strong></h2><p>Additional help is on the way.</p><p>The FDA is also reviewing another coronavirus vaccine developed by the Massachusetts biotech Moderna. The agency is planning to have another advisory committee meeting next Thursday to discuss that application. Moderna has said its two-dose vaccine was 94% effective at preventing COVID-19 in a late-stage clinical trial.</p><p>Warp Speed officials have estimated 20 million Americans could begin the vaccination process before the end of 2020, based on supply estimates for Pfizer's and Moderna's shots. Moncef Slaoui, the chief advisor for Warp Speed, has also projected 30 million more Americans will be immunized in January, and 50 million more in February.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-advisory-committee-endorses-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-2020-12'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/3XkyzF-8Dgw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 23:08:30 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fd2a3dce00bce00188baacd?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"fcef2917b74735f3970b2add60d6257f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn45@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-35-20-560_0705a05e63101874.webp","destWidth":3049,"destHeight":2286,"sourceBytes":388612,"destBytes":388612,"author":"adunn@businessinsider.com (Andrew Dunn,Hilary Brueck)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fc62052037cbd0018613088?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn79@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-35-25-329_e52686e71ed35f30.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fd2a2dfe00bce00188baac6?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn48@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-35-23-654_6a36d30e451ab01f.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f8ede909e9fe4001900a481?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-35-21-635_c4c86fe5ab29bd35.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f71dadb74fe5b0018a8db55?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn55@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-25-082_7eb8c440726c6a07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-32-215_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn87@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-35-31-117_ffe8c0c01ec59f79.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn23@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-35-33-428_cf2a2eed61750ef4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn10@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-35-26-907_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=3XkyzF-8Dgw:JjML6hsXhjU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn49@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-35-29-225_69d1b39499675a88.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/3XkyzF-8Dgw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn50@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-30-657_56b827d6d7280d00.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607675712041},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:35:12","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:35:12","title":"74 clever and thoughtful gifts for him - at every budget","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/gifts-for-men","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>When you buy through our links, we may earn money from our affiliate partners. <a href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/holiday-gift-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener  nofollow\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5dd56840fd9db214a90050b2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Insider Picks Holiday Gift Guide Gifts for Him\" height=\"3811\" width=\"5081\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hollis Johnson/Crystal Cox/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li>Whether he's your brother, partner, dad, or friend, chances are you probably have a man in your life who you're planning on getting a gift for.</li><li>To make shopping easy for you, we came up with a list of 74 great gifts for him.

She was on vacation at the time and told investigators that by the time she'd searched for the email, it had already been deleted.&#160;</p><p>Rep. James Clyburn, who leads the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, wrote in a letter to Redfield and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar that he has \"serious\" concerns about \"what may be deliberate efforts by the Trump Administration to conceal and destroy evidence that senior political appointees interfered with career officials' response to the coronavirus crisis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\"</p><p>The MMWR was not altered before it was published. But intentionally destroying federal records is a criminal offense that can be punished with prison time.&#160;</p><p>In the email, which Clyburn quotes in his letter, Alexander wrote that the CDC's report on the coronavirus' impact on children was \"very misleading\" and aimed to undermine President Donald Trump.&#160;</p><p>\"This is designed to hurt this President [sic] for their reasons which I am not interested in,\" Alexander, a top aide to Azar, wrote in the deleted message.&#160;</p><p>Clyburn also alleged in his letter that Trump administration officials improperly delayed the

Kent's allegations was \"irresponsible\" and denied her charges.&#160;</p><p>\"We urge the subcommittee to release the transcript in full, which will show that during her testimony Dr. Kent repeatedly said there was no political interference in the MMWR process,\" the spokesperson said.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Erdoğan.</p><p>That seeming affinity was in contrast to much of the US government's and Congress' frustration with Turkish moves that ran counter to US interests in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.</p><p>Now with just weeks left in office, and with lawmakers pressing for action, the Trump administration appears to be acting on one of the most serious disputes, sanctioning Ankara for its purchase of the Russian-made S-400 air-defense system, which is seen as a threat to the F-35 fighter-jet program and to NATO operations.</p><p>The sanctions would target Turkey's Presidency of Defence Industries, a government office that oversees military technology, and its president, Ismail Demir, according to Reuters, which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2IQ2AF\"

deter other countries from buying Russian arms.</p><p>The US has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-says-turkey-situation-complex-is-talking-to-turkish-officials-2019-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kicked Turkey out</a> of the F-35 program over the S-400, but Trump has avoided applying sanctions. However, this year's annual National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the military, includes a measure requiring them.</p><p>Its purchase \"constitutes a significant transaction as described\" in CAATSA, the bill states, adding that within 30 days of signing, the president \"shall impose\" sanctions. Trump has threatened to veto the NDAA over unrelated provisions.</p><p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, said it was \"about time\" to act on sanctions and that he was \"glad to see Congress do what the administration would not.\"</p><p>The S-400 is just one issue that has divided Turkey and its allies.</p><p>In Syria, Turkey has battled ISIS militants and US-backed fighters, both groups which Ankara considers terrorists. Turkey's involvement in Libya's civil war has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-france-turkey-analysis/france-turkey-tensions-mount-after-nato-naval-incident-idUSKBN2481K5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">strained</a> its relations with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-could-face-ultimate-test-in-growing-libya-proxy-war-2020-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NATO and other US allies</a>. More recently, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/turkey-greece-tensions-in-mediterranean-create-problems-for-us-nato-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkey and Greece clashed</a> over a longstanding maritime dispute in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Both are NATO members, and their worsening tensions added to the alliance's headaches.</p><p>Other US actions, like the Navy's <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/display-news/Article/2369540/uss-hershel-woody-williams-shifts-homeport-to-greece/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent decision</a> to make Greece's Souda Bay the homeport for a expeditionary ship, have also been viewed negatively by Turkey.</p><p>Congress is not alone in its frustration. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has criticized the S-400 deal, and at a NATO meeting this month, Pompeo <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-usa-nato-int/in-parting-shot-pompeo-rebukes-turkey-at-nato-meeting-idUSKBN28D1YJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reportedly inveighed</a> against Ankara, saying the purchase was \"a gift\" to Russia and that Turkey's dispute with Greece was undermining NATO.</p><p>Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu fired back at that meeting, and this week, the presidential spokesman and chief advisor to Erdoğan, Amb. Prof. Ibrahim Kalin, called the S-400 the \"result, not the cause of\" a number of disagreements.</p><p>\"Repeated requests\" to buy US-made Patriot air-defense systems were \"turned down because we were not able to agree on the terms,\" Kalin said a German Marshall Fund virtual event. Former US officials <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2019/07/the-tale-of-turkey-and-the-patriots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have attributed</a> the failure to Erdoğan's frustration with a 2016 coup attempt as well as differences over the conflict in Syria.</p><p>Kalin said the S-400 issue could still be addressed from \"a technical-military point of view, but we also know that it's no longer a technical-military issue.\"</p><p>\"It was conceived by the Congress as a political issue for [Turkey] having close defense-industrial relations with Russia,\" Kalin added.</p><h2>Interests and allies</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5faab66f1df1d50018219d7c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"GettyImages erdogan biden\" height=\"647\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Erdogan and Joe Biden, then the US vice president, at the presidential complex in Ankara, August 24, 2016.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kayhan Ozer/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>If Trump doesn't follow through with NDAA-mandated sanctions, President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on January 20, would be obligated to impose them.</p><p>Biden \"will probably go ahead with sanctions, but how harsh those will be will matter in determining the tone of the relationship,\" said Kadir Ustun, executive director of the SETA Foundation in Washington, DC. (SETA has links to Erdoğan's government, including through Kalin, who is a founder and former director of the think tank.)</p><p>Turkey \"will not bow to sanctions, and it would be counterproductive,\" which Biden is aware of, Ustun said.</p><p>Relations with Turkey are likely to be a concern for the Biden administration.

And it is definitely in our interest that Turkey remains a member of NATO,\" Ben Hodges, former commander of US Army Europe, said in an interview this fall.</p><p>Biden's team are \"very knowledgeable\" of the issues Ankara cares about and \"recognize[s] the critical importance of Turkey\" in the region, Ustun said.</p><p>\"We might see a change of tone overall, but the Biden promise to rebuild relationships with allies, I expect, would extend to Turkey as well,\" Ustun said, adding that \"if Turkey sees a harder line ... it would react in strong terms.\"</p><p>\"The security concerns of the US military or political establishment [over the S-400] can be addressed,\" Kalin said this week, \"but the longer this takes and the more pressure they put on Turkey ... the problem will be much more difficult to resolve.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Many investors are rushing to the new stocks, wanting to get in at any price, but such massive IPO bounces usually give way to similarly outsize losses, he added.&#160;</p><p>\"It's silly season,\" Rich Steinberg, the chief market strategist of the Colony Group, told Business Insider. \"Investors need to distinguish the difference between a great company and a great price or value.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/global-investing-strategy-stocks-and-bonds-in-2021-john-hancock-2020-12\" data-analytics-position=\"2\" data-analytics-module=\"\">2 investment chiefs at John Hancock's $692 billion investing arm say the post-COVID recovery might disappoint in 2021 - but investors can profit with these 3 strategies</a></em></p><p>Both strategists attributed some of that euphoria to the near-zero interest rates expected to stay put over the next three years. The Federal Reserve's plan to hold rates at record lows leaves investors with fewer places to put their money, as the policy suppressed Treasury yields early in the pandemic. The Fed's backstop of the corporate credit market placed similar pressure on bond yields.</p><p>The combination of near-zero interest rates, a \"tsunami of liquidity,\" and hundreds of billions in unallocated investor cash fueled the two buying sprees, Schatz said.</p><p>The week's booms might be only the start. Investors could face \"complete and utter mania\" across the IPO market in the first half of 2021 as more firms look to tap the market while demand remains strong, the Heritage Capital president said. Investors should avoid trying to time such volatile debuts and instead be patient until stock prices better reflect firms' fundamentals, he added.</p><p>\"Being the last guy buying the opening of a hot IPO, at the height of this speculative excess in some of these names, typically does not end well,\" Steinberg said.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and

But a clone of your <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-hard-drive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hard drive</a> - a duplicate of the drive in its entirety - has a lot of advantages as well. For example, if your primary hard drive fails or you are upgrading to a new <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/pc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PC</a>, having a cloned drive means you can get up and running just by swapping in the backup. In fact, a good strategy for some users is to maintain both an incremental backup using backup software and a frequently updated cloned drive.</p><p>One important caveat: While you can clone a system (\"C\") drive, it's only useful in the exact same computer. Because of the way Windows works, you can't clone a system drive and insert it in a new computer with different hardware components. You can clone and use a data drive (such as a \"D\" drive) in a new PC, though.&#160;</p><h2><strong>How to clone a hard drive</strong></h2><p>To begin, you will need a second drive that is at least as big as the content on the drive you want to copy. It can be mounted internally in your computer or an external drive connected via USB.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd25bf67b7e050019107371?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to clone a hard drive 1\" height=\"1079\" width=\"1600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You can clone any drive, including copying your laptop&#39;s system drive to an external hard drive.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>You will also need a program capable of cloning your hard drive because Windows does not have the ability to do this automatically. You can use a free program like <a href=\"https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Macrium Reflect</a>, which is reliable and easy to use, or a commercial program like <a href=\"https://www.fssdev.com/shop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Casper</a>, which you can license for $49.95. The specific process for cloning your drive varies depending on the program you use, but we'll use Macrium as an example.&#160;</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Start Macrium Reflect.

the State Department under the Obama administration.</p><p>After a segment on business restrictions related to the pandemic - which has been a heavy focus across the network this week - Harf asked why the death toll wasn't coming up more.</p><p>\"Yeah, I mean, we're 43 minutes into this show, and we haven't mentioned yet that 3,000 Americans died yesterday, more than on 9/11,\" Harf said. \"And every day for a while, we're gonna have that many American deaths.\"</p><p>She added: \"And so, I agree that regulations should be driven by science ... but as we debate these regulations, we cannot

One voting member abstained.</p><p>An FDA decision could come soon after the meeting.&#160;</p><p>Some members had brought up concerns about the wording of the voting question, which asked if the benefits outweigh the risks to OK the shot for people 16 years and older. Some members expressed a desire to increase the minimum age to 18.</p><p>If the FDA authorizes Pfizer's vaccine, that would kick off the largest vaccination campaign in the history of the US. Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's vaccine initiative, plans to start shipping doses to states within 24 hours of authorization.</p>\n\t5:30 PM - Committee members debate if two months of safety follow-up is enough, as voting begins\n\t\n\t<p>Over decades of vaccine trials, the overwhelming majority of issues pop up in the first few weeks, within about 40 days. That gave some members confidence that this vaccine is safe.&#160;</p><p>Dr. Cody Meissner, chief of the pediatrics infectious disease division at Tufts University School of Medicine, said he's \"comfortable\" with the available safety data, particularly given the urgency of the pandemic that is killing thousands of Americans daily.</p><p>Others, though, weren't sure, stressing that this is uncharted territory.&#160;</p><p>Pfizer's vaccine is based on a brand-new technological platform called messenger RNA. One committee member expressed concerns that there isn't any long-term data that spans many months available.&#160;</p><p>In particular, Oveta Fuller, a microbiology and immunology professor at the University of Michigan, raised the unknown about what could happen if vaccinated people are later exposed to COVID-19.&#160;</p><p>\"We've only been looking for two months,\" Fuller said, later adding that \"the uptake in the community is going to be fairly poor unless something better is done.\"</p>\n\t4:51 PM: Pfizer provided details on allergic reactions to its vaccine in the UK. One committee member pressed the drugmaker to address concerns by running an allergy-focused study.\n\t\n\t<p>Pfizer said that people with allergies weren't excluded from the vaccine trial. However, people with previous allergic reactions to vaccines were not allowed in.</p><p>Pfizer senior vice president William Gruber acknowledged he did not know if anyone enrolled in the study had a prior history of any anaphylaxis.</p><p>\"The nature of what was excluded from the trial was really restricted to those individuals who had a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine, any vaccine previously,\" Gruber said. \"During the course of the trial, we have not seen anything that alerted us to a safety signal associated with the vaccine or potential for anaphylaxis.\"&#160;</p><p>Patrick Caubel, the head of safety at Pfizer spoke about <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-ingredients-allergic-reactions-2020-12\">two vaccinated people who had adverse reactions to Pfizer's drug in the first days of the UK rollout</a>. He said:</p><ul><li>Both individuals were in their 40s (a 40-year-old, and a 49-year-old), and had medical histories of allergic reactions</li><li>One patient had a history of anaphylaxis, with severe allergies to foods including eggs, cheesecake, and lemon. She reacted a few minutes after getting the shot, and required an IV injection of epinephrine, then fully recovered.</li><li>The second patient had a history of allergies to drugs, though \"we don't know which drugs yet\" Caubel said. She also required an epinephrine injection. Her case was more minor, Caubel said, with some shortness of breath. She also fully recovered.</li></ul><p>Committee member and vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit said Pfizer should now run a smaller trial focused on people with food allergies, vaccinating them and watching them closely.</p><p>\"This issue is not going to die until we have better data,\" Offit said. \"You're talking about tens of millions of people who are not going to get this vaccine because of the comments that were made both by the UK, and by [Operation Warp Speed chief advisor] Moncef Slaoui here.\"</p><p>&#160;</p>\n\t3:55 PM: The committee will vote on just one question: Do the benefits of Pfizer's vaccine outweigh its risks for use in people 16 and up?\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd28b372dc42e0018f0e48f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FDA question\" height=\"292\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owveMJBTc2I\" target=\"_blank\">FDA VRBPAC / YouTube</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>All indications are pointing to a \"yes\" verdict, but we'll see what happens when the vote takes place. It's scheduled for around 5:15 p.m. Eastern time.</p>\n\t3:15 PM: How the FDA views the benefits and risks of Pfizer's vaccine\n\t\n\t<p>FDA scientist Dr. Susan Wollersheim discussed how the agency views the benefits and risks of issuing an emergency OK for Pfizer's vaccine.</p><p>These will likely be the key topics for an open-ended discussion the expert panel will start in about an hour, ultimately leading to a vote on whether or not to recommend the two-dose vaccination.</p><p>The key benefit is, unsurprisingly, protection from COVID-19. The trial showed the shot is 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 at least seven days after people finished the two-dose regimen. The FDA noted that it's not clear how long that protection will last.</p><p>The agency reviewers also said that benefit held true across different ages, races, ethnicities, and health conditions like obesity and diabetes.</p><p>The FDA didn't identify any major safety concerns, but noted there were high levels of expected, temporary side effects like pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. For most people, these side effects were mild or moderate in intensity and lasted a day or two.</p><p>Wollersheim also said it is possible that there were serious adverse events related to the vaccine, including shoulder injury and enlarged lymph nodes.</p><p>Data was also limited on 16- and 17-year-olds, Wollersheim noted, but the safety profile from young adults could be extrapolated for these older teenagers. The study was also limited by excluding pregnant women and by having limited follow-up time.</p>\n\t12:30 PM: \"Let's roll:\" Pfizer trial participant argues an emergency OK should be granted right now\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd261e130f2740018b0f1f8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Evan Fein FDA Pfizer trial participant\" height=\"400\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Evan Fein said he&#39;s had the vaccine for about five months now, and is enjoying exercising, and helping out his older parents.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owveMJBTc2I\" target=\"_blank\">FDA VRBPAC / YouTube</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Evan Fein, a participant in Pfizer's vaccine trial, said he believes the vaccine should receive emergency use authorization (EUA) immediately to help save lives.&#160;</p><p>\"An EUA must be granted and must be granted tonight,\" Fein said during an hour-long session for public comment Thursday afternoon. \"Most Americans will take the vaccine voluntarily, as long as we're honest, don't talk down to them, and treat them like autonomous adults.\"</p><p>Fein said he received his first shot in a Pfizer study more than five months ago, on July 1.</p><p>\"I think I got a real vaccine, and not a placebo,\" Fein said, noting he felt \"mild\" effects afterwards, including a fever, chills, and pain where his shot was injected the second time.&#160;</p><p>He said he was impressed with the study's follow-up, with calls from doctors and researchers. \"Nothing felt rushed, and I never felt like a guinea pig,\" he said.&#160;</p><p>He's not worried about long-term side effects, either:</p><p>\"It's been more than five months now since my first shot, and I can happily report that there are none,\" Fein added. \"I've helped out my older parents, I've gone to work in person, and I've exercised in small groups, and I haven't gotten COVID-19.\"&#160;</p><p>Given the emergency posed by the pandemic, Fein said \"the burden of proof is on those who don't want to authorize the vaccine,\" calling it \"immoral and unethical\" to not allow healthcare workers and first responders who want the shot to get it.</p><p>Fein compared the pandemic's devastation to another American tragedy: the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. He noted the daily death toll from the virus now exceeds the number of lives lost on 9/11.</p><p>\"In the words of Todd Beamer, let's roll,\" Fein concluded, referring to the famous last words of a passenger on one of the hijacked flights.</p>\n\t11:10 AM: The CDC wants to text you to see if the vaccine is safe in the real world\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd24a387b7e0500191072b4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"V-Safe vaccine monitoring program from CDC for coronavirus vaccines\" height=\"516\" width=\"950\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>How V-SAFE, a new vaccine monitoring program from CDC, will work for coronavirus vaccines.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-09/COVID-03-Shimabukuro.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">CDC</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official, told the committee that continuing to monitor the vaccines for safety and effectiveness as they are rolled out to the public is a \"top priority\" of the US government.</p><p>There's a range of monitoring systems to keep tabs on the shots, both new and old.&#160;</p><p>One new system, called V-SAFE, will follow people after they get the shots with text messages and web-based surveys. But to be useful, Messonnier, said, people will need to opt-in to V-SAFE and participate.</p><p>\"We really need people to sign onto this program to give us the best data possible,\" she told the committee.&#160;</p><p>The federal government is also rolling out <a href=\"https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/news/2020/11/brown-university-receives-grant-develop-adverse-events-monitoring-system-nursing-home\">another new tracking program</a> tailored for long-term care facilities, built in partnership between the National Institutes of Health, Brown University, and Genesis HealthCare. It will monitor roughly 35,000 long-term care residents at 250 facilities across the US, Messonnier said. Nursing homes are expected to be prioritized to receive the shot.</p><p>Messonnier said that vaccine efficacy may turn out to be different in the real world, when millions of people are getting shots, than it was in clinical trial conditions. Already, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-ingredients-allergic-reactions-2020-12\">two patients have had allergic reactions to the vaccine</a> in the UK. There were no allergy issues in Pfizer's trials of more than 44,000 individuals in six countries.&#160;</p>\n\t10:26 AM: CDC scientist gives grim update on pandemic's impact in US, highlighting the urgent need for a vaccine\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd23c8730f2740018b0f0b0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"grim chart aron CDC at FDA meeting \" height=\"460\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The CDC&#39;s Aron Hall displayed a staggering chart, showing the trends in the numbers of COVID-19 cases in the US over time.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owveMJBTc2I\" target=\"_blank\">FDA VRBPAC Meeting / YouTube</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Aron Hall, chief of the respiratory viruses branch at the CDC, gave a grim update on the current state of COVID-19 in the US.</p><p>Hall's update is particularly jarring given the optimistic progress with vaccines. In total, more than 14.8 million people in the US have had confirmed coronavirus infections, resulting in more than 280,000 deaths, he said.</p><p>The pandemic is raging like never before in the US. The April peak was driven by spread in New York City, and a July surge came from the southern US. But Hall noted cases have been rising again since September, with the sharpest increases in the past couple months. More than 3,000 people <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/09/world/covid-19-coronavirus#a-grim-new-record-for-the-us-as-daily-deaths-from-the-virus-top-3000\">died from COVID-19 in the US yesterday</a> &#8212; a new record.&#160;</p><p>The committee must weigh the benefits, and consequences, of approving the vaccine in this context. The pandemic's devastation isn't news to anyone, but Hall's presentation shows just how desperate the need for a vaccine is right now.&#160;</p>\n\t9:45 AM: The committee is an impressive mix of more than 20 virologists, doctors, and leading public health experts. There's one lawyer and one competing pharmaceutical maker in attendance too.\n\t\n\t<p>Some of the more prominent <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/144232/download\">committee members</a> from the world of medicine include:&#160;</p><ul><li>Dr. Eric Rubin, an infectious-disease specialist and editor-in-chief of The New England Journal of Medicine.</li><li>Dr. Paul Offit, a top vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania who co-invented the rotavirus vaccine.</li><li>Dr. Cody Meissner, chief of the pediatrics infectious disease division at Tufts University School of Medicine.</li><li>Dr. Stanley Perlman, a virology professor from the University of Iowa who has been studying coronaviruses for nearly four decades.&#160;</li></ul><p>Dr. Paula Annunziato, who works in vaccine research at Merck is the non-voting industry representative, and Sheldon Toubman, a lawyer from New Haven, is attending as a consumer representative. He often works <a href=\"https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Legal-aid-lawyer-sounds-warning-on-Medicaid-cut-12855429.php\">as a legal aid lawyer</a> for low-income families.</p>\n\t9:04 AM: As meeting gets underway, FDA reveals the question of the day.\n\t\n\t<p>The expert panel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owveMJBTc2I&#38;feature=youtu.be\">is now underway</a>, virtually, starting with opening remarks and introductions led by the committee's chair, Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan.</p><p>These meetings typically take quite a while &#8212; finishing by 5:15 p.m. is more a goal than a hard stopping point. The most interesting discussion usually comes close to the end of the day, when the committee is allowed to have a free-flowing dialogue ahead of the big vote. On today's agenda, that should start around 3:10 p.m.&#160;</p><p>The FDA committee will only vote on one yes-or-no question at the end of the day:&#160;</p><p><em>\"Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older?\"</em></p><p>New documents released just now show the FDA wants the panel to also weigh in on a couple of hot topics. First, what should researchers do with trial volunteers who received a placebo shot? There's a difficult tradeoff between the benefits of following those people for long-term data at the cost of withholding an effective vaccine and exposing them to the pandemic.</p><p>Secondly, the agency is asking the group to discuss if they see any gaps in the plans to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the shot going forward.</p>\n\t9:01 AM: FDA boss Stephen Hahn says \"we intend to act quickly\" after today's meeting.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fd24aaa7b7e0500191072b7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"stephen hahn\" height=\"1466\" width=\"1955\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn\n<p class=\"copyright\">Pete Marovich/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The head of the FDA <a href=\"https://www.today.com/video/fda-commissioner-stephen-hahn-we-need-to-get-to-herd-immunity-97466437881\">told NBC's Savannah Guthrie</a> he will listen to the advisory committee's discussion today, but ultimately, it's up to him and the FDA's in-house scientists to decide whether to approve or reject the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use in the US.</p><p>And, he hinted that the agency may already be leaning towards a favorable decision for Pfizer's shot, saying \"our initial assessment is that this is a vaccine that does meet our criteria.\"</p><p>\"We have the advisory committee to get outside opinions about this,\" commissioner Hahn said Thursday morning on TODAY.</p><p>\"We think it's very important for transparency. We're the only regulatory agency in the world that has a public vetting of the data. But we'll make that decision. Our scientific experts will make that decision.\"&#160;</p><p>Hahn also suggested that official decision could come as soon as this evening, shortly after the committee's vote:&#160;</p><p>\"We'll have to see what the scientific and medical discussion is today. But our plan is to take their recommendations into account for our decision making and make a decision shortly thereafter. Again, it really depends upon the complexity of the issues discussed, but we intend to act quickly.\"</p>\n\t8:00 AM: 7 unanswered questions we expect answers for today.\n\t\n\t<p>The advisory committee meeting is set to begin one hour from now, at 9 a.m. ET, with <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/144231/download\">a very full agenda</a> slated to last until 5:15 p.m.</p><p>Unlike many FDA advisory committee meetings, the pros and cons of the vaccine aren't likely to stir much debate, given the scale of the coronavirus outbreak across the US right now. It's widely expected that the committee will recommend the vaccine should receive emergency use authorization &#8212; teeing up the FDA to officially OK the vaccine to go into arms across America in the coming days.&#160;</p><p>We've already seen lots of data about this vaccine, both in what <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-first-effective-coronavirus-vaccine-pfizer-2020-11\">Pfizer initially described in November about the shots' efficacy,</a> and in far more detail through independently-vetted <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-december-10-2020-meeting-announcement\">briefing documents released Tuesday by the FDA</a>. Those documents showed FDA scientists making the case that Pfizer's vaccine had no major safety concerns, and was overwhelmingly protective &#8212; 95% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19.</p><p>Even so, the devil is often in the details. Some of the most interesting debates we expect today will be on nuanced topics, with this group of virologists, vaccine experts, and biostatisticians digging deep to get the full picture about what we know &#8212; and don't know &#8212; about this shot.&#160;</p><p>Here are seven of the most burning questions we are most eagerly looking forward to (hopefully) hearing some answers to today:&#160;</p><ol><li><strong>How much protection do people get after their first shot?</strong> Data released Tuesday suggested one Pfizer shot was about <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-big-mistake-skip-second-covid-shot-2020-12\">50% effective at preventing COVID-19 in the 21-day period</a> until people got their second (booster) shot. If that partial protection is legit, that would be a valuable benefit to know when immunizing people. Although experts have stressed it will still be essential to get the second dose for the more robust, 95% protection.</li><li><strong>How durable is the protection?</strong> Given that Pfizer's earliest coronavirus vaccine trials only started a few months ago, we probably won't know how long Pfizer's vaccine protection typically lasts, but the committee can unearth any new information they've discovered about waning immunity. Is the trial showing any signs that participants who've had the vaccine for several months now are losing their protection? Or is it still too early to tell?&#160;</li><li><strong>Does the vaccine also prevent transmission to unvaccinated people?</strong> The Pfizer vaccine trial was designed to measure if the shots prevent people from getting symptomatic disease, the kind of coronavirus that might prompt a fever, cough, or more serious issues. The results are an unambiguous success on that front. But that doesn't necessarily mean the vaccine can stop people from being infected. If vaccinated people can still be asymptomatic carriers, unknowingly spreading the virus to others who have not yet been vaccinated, that would have big public-health consequences. Is there any data to suggest one way or the other whether the shot provides so-called 'sterilizing immunity'?&#160;</li><li><strong>What happens to the placebo group now that we know the shot works?</strong> Half of the roughly 40,000 volunteers in Pfizer's trial got a placebo shot (aka no treatment) and they still don't know they're walking around vaccine-free. Keeping the study blinded allows researchers to continue to gather valuable information &#8212; particularly in figuring out the durability of the vaccine's protection. But it poses an ethical conundrum as well. When should the placebo group be offered the real vaccine, particularly if it's known to be very safe and effective? The committee is likely to have thoughts on what should happen next.</li><li><strong>Is there enough data on really old people to classify the shot as fully safe for them?</strong> We're not talking about the 55-plus seniors group, but people in their 80s and 90s. With nursing homes being a top immunization priority, this is a relevant population to make sure will be safe to vaccinate. Data released Tuesday showed 860 people in Pfizer's trial (out of more than 21,000 participants worldwide) were over the age of 75, with the oldest person being 89 years old. Is that a rigorous enough experiment to satisfy the committee and OK this shot to be rolled out to nursing homes across the nation?</li><li><strong>What can we learn from the non-responders?</strong> Some of the most valuable insights may be gleaned from people who got Pfizer's vaccine and still got sick. Fortunately, there weren't a lot of them. Just one volunteer on the active arm registered a severe case of COVID-19 (compared to nine severe cases who were given the placebo) and there were eight cases of COVID-19 overall who got Pfizer's shot (compared to 162 in the placebo group). Can that handful of cases tell us something we don't know about who may or may not respond poorly to this vaccine?&#160;</li><li><strong>What about allergic reactions?</strong> UK health regulators have warned that people with a history of severe allergic reactions shouldn't get Pfizer's shot, after two adverse events were observed in the British rollout. Is there a suitable explanation from Pfizer for why that may be a case, particularly given this vaccine was developed using messenger RNA, a new technology platform? And will this expert panel make a similar recommendation in restricting who should get the shot?</li></ol>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/live-updates-on-fda-covid-19-vaccine-advisory-committee-pfizer-2020-12'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_IN3KY71wa4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 22:38:57 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5fd13fe848a25900182628d9?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f5c9f9be5a58b625a6467264b782b6ee","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn90@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-35-20-556_c91393bd13ed125f.webp","destWidth":6387,"destHeight":4790,"sourceBytes":476190,"destBytes":476190,"author":"adunn@businessinsider.com (Andrew Dunn,Hilary Brueck)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5fd0fd1acee0cf00114fa685?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn25@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-22-853_1e5830f133145a2a.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fd28b372dc42e0018f0e48f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn99@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-25-366_271a4767306678ea.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fd261e130f2740018b0f1f8?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn46@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-27-805_a71ee1f1582764f7.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fd24a387b7e0500191072b4?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn60@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-27-213_69f800f35df76160.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fd23c8730f2740018b0f0b0?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn51@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-35-25-995_ce6de8db125f298d.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fd24aaa7b7e0500191072b7?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn71@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-35-28-882_679a7ca00fb34055.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-35-32-215_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn22@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-35-32-776_befdab66dc31e48b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn64@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-35-27-231_f7f2d7d3fb0d0de9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn10@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-35-26-907_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_IN3KY71wa4:15mt4xNMFAM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn56@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-35-32-264_3542b36f724fe950.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_IN3KY71wa4":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607675712044},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:35:12","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:35:12","title":"The 'unprecedented' wreck of a Hyundai cargo ship off the coast of Georgia a year ago is no longer a mystery - here's what happened","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/cargo-ship-capsizes-thousands-of-new-hyundais-kias-on-board-2019-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d76a0042e22af7c1559b8b2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Golden Ray capsized 8\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Golden Ray capsized on Sunday for unknown reasons.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Cargo-Ship-Georgia/191bbe8fb5cc41f0ab442a5695f7590f/2/0\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen B.

href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download\">a detailed look</a> at the side effects of Pfizer's coronavirus shot on Tuesday.&#160;</p><p>Most trial participants reported temporary side effects after being vaccinated, including fatigue, headaches, and pain at the injection site. People under 55 reported more side effects overall, but relatively few participants had severe fatigue or headaches that stopped them from performing normal activities.</p><p>These results were consistent across genders, age groups, ethnic and racial groups, and people with preexisting medical problems. But several populations were excluded from the trials - meaning the vaccine isn't known to be safe for all Americans just yet.</p><p>\"There are currently insufficient data to make conclusions about the safety of the vaccine in subpopulations such as children less than 16 years of age, pregnant and lactating individuals, and immunocompromised individuals,\" a recent Food and Drug Administration review concluded.</p><p>Some public-health experts have also questioned whether <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/do-people-who-got-coronavirus-long-haulers-get-vaccine-2020-11\">individuals who were already infected with the coronavirus</a> should get vaccinated,&#160;particularly if they have lingering symptoms.</p><p>An FDA advisory committee is meeting Thursday to decide whether to recommend the vaccines for emergency use. But even then, these four groups will have to wait for more safety data.</p><h2>Children under 16 are often last to be included in trials</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fcff9d9cee0cf00114fa45c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"face mask kid school covid 19\" height=\"3142\" width=\"4473\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Kindergartner Grace Truax, 5, removes her mask before posing for a portrait during &#34;picture day&#34; at Rogers International School on September 23, 2020 in Stamford, Connecticut.\n<p class=\"copyright\">John Moore/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Research shows that many children clear the coronavirus before it leads to severe disease, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/children-weaker-antibody-response-coronavirus-milder-cases-study-2020-11\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"0b78a14d4daa2b69c599e052e45a47af\">mild or asymptomatic</a> cases. Children only represent around 7% of confirmed coronavirus infections in the US - the lowest of any age group, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6924e2.htm#F1_down\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"68eec87c82641847d3bf08ee196b19cc\">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p><p>That means kids aren't a priority group when it comes to vaccinations. They're also difficult to include in trials due to ethical and safety concerns: Some parents may not feel comfortable signing their kids up to participate, and researchers often prefer to test vaccines in a small group of adolescents before enrolling young kids.</p><p>Pfizer's clinical trials, for instance, did not include any participants younger than 12. Even then, the sample size of kids from ages 12 to 15 was too small to weigh the risks.</p><p>But there's little reason to suspect that kids will react poorly to the shots.</p><p>\"Children generally respond well to vaccines,\" Donna Farber, a Columbia University immunologist, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/children-weaker-antibody-response-coronavirus-milder-cases-study-2020-11\">told Business Insider</a>. \"They should respond well or comparably to a young adult - and maybe even better.\"</p><h2>Pregnant women were excluded from trials, too</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ed11e35988ee316dd011007?format=jpeg\" alt=\"pregnant woman covid 19.JPG\" height=\"1335\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nancy Pedroza, 27, experiences contractions while taking a walk with her doula.\n<p class=\"copyright\">REUTERS/Callaghan O&#39;Hare</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Pfizer's phase-one clinical trial included primarily healthy men and women. Its late-stage clinical trials then tested the vaccine among more vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers and people with autoimmune diseases.</p><p>But the company excluded pregnant women. It asked female volunteers to take a pregnancy test before each vaccination, and any with positive results were not allowed to continue.</p><p>That means researchers don't know how the vaccine affects pregnant women yet.</p><p>Pfizer plans to follow up with women who reported pregnancies during the course of the study, or those who choose to get vaccinated anyway once the shots are approved. That's how public-health experts eventually determined it was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/publications/safety_pregnancy_nov2014.pdf\">safe for pregnant women to get the flu vaccine</a>, even though these women were never included in flu vaccine trials.</p><p>Pfizer also plans to include pregnant women its vaccine study moving forward.</p><p>It's important to get this data as soon as possible, since <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pregnant-women-at-risk-severe-covid-19-cant-get-vaccine-2020-12\">pregnant women are at high risk for COVID-19 complications</a>.

But only 24% of women who gave birth in 2019 were Hispanic. White women, on the other hand, represented 51% of women who gave birth in 2019, but only 24% of symptomatic pregnant women with COVID-19.</p><h2>HIV-positive individuals and others with weakened immune systems must also wait for more data</h2><h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fce6464037cbd0018614425?format=jpeg\" alt=\"covid safe hug\" height=\"1467\" width=\"2200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Michelle Grant hugs her mother, Mary Grace Sileo, through a plastic drop cloth in Wantagh, New York. It was the first time they&#39;d physical contact since February.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Al Bello/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></h2><p>Though Pfizer's late-stage trials included people with preexisting health problems, there wasn't enough data to determine whether the vaccine is safe for those with weakened immune systems, according to the FDA review. For example, the trials only included a small number of HIV-positive individuals, and researchers didn't have enough time to follow up with this group before applying for emergency authorization.</p><p>It's a good sign that serious adverse events were only reported in 0.6% of vaccine recipients, but immunocompromised people have to be particularly careful about vaccines. If a patient's immune system isn't working properly, they may require extra doses. Others might want to avoid getting vaccinated while taking immunosuppressants like corticosteroids or chemotherapy drugs.&#160;</p><p>For the most part, doctors recommend that immunocompromised people steer clear of vaccines that use live virus. But Pfizer's vaccine instead relies on a snippet of the virus' genome to trigger an immune response.&#160;</p><p>Dr. Edward Jones-Lopez, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Southern California, <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-some-immunocompromised-people-may-not-be-eligible-for-a-covid-19-vaccine#Immunocompromised-not-included-in-initial-vaccine-trials\">told Healthline</a> that he estimates \"we are one or two studies away\" from finding out whether coronavirus vaccines are safe for immunocompromised people.</p><h2>People who previously got COVID-19 are in a grey area&#160;</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4d7a6b60bf1f00280799b1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"coronavirus testing\" height=\"3264\" width=\"4896\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Patient Setsuko Smidmore awaits testing at St George Hospital in Sydney, Australia, May 15, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Pfizer hasn't specified whether its vaccine is safe for people who previously had COVID-19. Studies suggest these patients may have immunity to the virus that lasts anywhere from several months to several years. But the research is far from conclusive. They're likely to need a vaccine at some point down the line.</p><p>\"We want to look at vaccinating patients who have not been infected with COVID who are susceptible,\" Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health in Massachusetts, told Business Insider. \"The post-COVID patients are not going to be your first, second, third, or fourth tier of groups that you're going to look at to want to vaccinate.\"</p><p>For people with long-lasting symptoms - known as long-haulers - it's possible that a vaccine could intensify an already aggressive immune response that for many has led to fatigue, muscle aches, trouble breathing, heart palpitations, or difficulty concentrating or sleeping.&#160;</p><p>\"It'd be hard to engage a long-hauler in [a vaccine] study if they're having ongoing health problems,\" Natalie Lambert, an associate professor of medicine at Indiana University, told Business Insider. \"Ethically there'd be big problems with having them take a vaccine, if you're worried about those effects.\"</p><p>Pfizer, however, didn't screen participants for evidence of a prior coronavirus infection during its late-stage clinical trial. So it turned out that 3% of participants had been infected before. The data showed that the vaccine was just as effective among this group, but the FDA review said there wasn't enough evidence to know if the vaccine prevented reinfection.</p><p>Ellerin said it's unwise to inoculate previously infected people without more safety data.</p><p>\"We have to keep our eye on the prize right now,\" he said. \"Of course patients can get COVID more than once, so I'm not trying to tell you that they'll be excluded from this down the road, but we have a lot more to learn.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a
