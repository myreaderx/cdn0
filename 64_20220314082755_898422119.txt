Could this concept Nothing phone (1) be anything like it?</p>\n<p>Nothing <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/smartphone/\">smartphone</a> is rumored for a next month launch with multiple leaks pointing towards the existence of the prototype version. In a recent development trusted tipster, Evan Blass shared a picture of Carl Pei in a conversation with Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon – showing him a smartphone that everyone believes will be the upcoming gadget by the company. On zooming in, things get a bit blurry as the outline of the device and the camera bump on the back are distinguishable. More about the Nothing smartphone is expected to be revealed in the coming weeks, and the tech community is eager – including me!</p>\n<p>Designer: Povilas Grigas</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367076\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-nothing-phone-1-concept-design-is-definitely-something-refreshing/Nothing-Phone-1-by-Povilas-Grigas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Until that happens and we get a close look at the off-beat phone (presumably) which is going to inculcate the transparent element, a concept design fuels our imagination. Just like the Nothing Phone (1) concept by <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/12/23/nothing-phone-1-breaks-the-ice-with-transparent-design-and-rear-fingerprint-sensor/\">Osho Jain</a>, the see-through form factor of the imagined Nothing smartphone here is overpowering and for good reason. The ear (1) earbuds created a niche with their unique design highlighted by the see-through components, and the next product could follow suit.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367084\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-nothing-phone-1-concept-design-is-definitely-something-refreshing/Nothing-Phone-1-by-Povilas-Grigas-9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367081\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-nothing-phone-1-concept-design-is-definitely-something-refreshing/Nothing-Phone-1-by-Povilas-Grigas-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>This one too is called the Nothing phone (1) – what else could it be named otherwise! In a way carrying the DNA philosophy of creating tech that improves our lives without getting in the way of it. To be precise – tech that feels like nothing. Povilas Grigas’ concept design here is inspired by the old pacemakers, creating a refreshing form factor without compromising on the ergonomics and comfort. The inspiration explains the dynamic rear panel shape which has two camera bumps on each of the top corners.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367086\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-nothing-phone-1-concept-design-is-definitely-something-refreshing/Nothing-Phone-1-by-Povilas-Grigas-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Going beyond just the transparent rear panel showing off the innards, the designer envisions the Nothing phone (1) to get the Teenage Engineering influenced Gallium Nitride charger which is ultra-small and ultra-fast. Other than that, the concept design doesn’t reveal the front display of the device. So, we’re left to imagine that in our own daydreams.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367083\"

rider.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yankodesign.com/tag/kick-scooter\">Kick scooters</a> have now been the more trendy and sensible option to commute in the cities. So have been the skateboards which can be seen in every corner owing to their cool factor and flexibility to not only ride the roads but also the pavements or stair rails depending on the user’s skill level. So why not combine the best of both worlds and create a kick scooter that has the bright prospect of making it to the consumer market?</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.dailynkimdesign.com/ext-e-kick-scooter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dailyn Kim</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-368008\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/shape-shifting-electric-kick-scooter-gets-short-and-longboard-configuration-in-one/EXT-E-Kick-Scooter-hero.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366759\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/shape-shifting-electric-kick-scooter-gets-short-and-longboard-configuration-in-one/EXT-E-Kick-Scooter-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>The EXT E-Kick Scooter by Dailyn Kim is the perfect example of an electric kick scooter done right. The reason – there are countless kick scooter ideas already on the market and this one brings a new dimension of riding. The EXT is designed keeping in mind the flexibility to switch between short and longboard modes. Apparently, the shortboard configuration on a kick scooter enhances speed and performance for power users, while the longboard form supports comfort and balance.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366751\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/shape-shifting-electric-kick-scooter-gets-short-and-longboard-configuration-in-one/EXT-E-Kick-Scooter-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366752\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/shape-shifting-electric-kick-scooter-gets-short-and-longboard-configuration-in-one/EXT-E-Kick-Scooter-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Delightfully, the EXT E-Kick Scooter can do both thanks to its extendable wheelbase that can make the quick switch between the short and longboard configuration to support both the riding modes. This is done by the extendable and retracting wheelbase which alters the length by 3 inches. The deck extends above the rear wheel which essentially creates a wheelbase to slide easily. There are no complex mechanisms that pose a challenge to the function of the electric kickboard, and that’s big merit here.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366758\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/shape-shifting-electric-kick-scooter-gets-short-and-longboard-configuration-in-one/EXT-E-Kick-Scooter-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366760\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/shape-shifting-electric-kick-scooter-gets-short-and-longboard-configuration-in-one/EXT-E-Kick-Scooter-19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Dailyn creates a deck with an arc and patterned grip for a more comfortable stance while riding. The ease of use extends to the driving aid in the form of a thumb throttle and brake. There’s a dynamic touchscreen to keep the rider abreast with all the information such as current speed, battery charge levels, listening to music, and navigation aid for snaking through the dense suburbs. The rims get a reflective pattern for visibility to other motorists in the nighttime.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366756\"

Leisure have shown in the past. Now Campervan Co, known for its hybrid camper vans, gives outdoorsy people enough reason to explore their world with Ford Transit PHEV Eco Evolution.</p>\n<p>While on the outside the camper van looks like any the Ford Transit, on the inside it has all that’s required for a comfy life on the road. The customized<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/camper/\"> camper</a> gets powerful solar panels installed on the roof, generating around 1,000 watts of zero-emission power on a good sunny day. The fold-out solar panels can charge the Eco Evolution’s 3,000-watt Clayton Power leisure battery while it&#8217;s rolling on the road. This onboard battery is employed to power the modular kitchen, lighting system, and induction stovetop for living comfortably off the grid.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://campervanco.com/ford-transit-phev-eco-evolution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Campervan Co</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367991\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/solar-panel-loaded-ford-transit-camper-is-spacious-practical-option-for-outdoorsy-enthusiasts/Ford-Transit-PHEV-Eco-Evolution-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>On top of this, the well-illuminated interiors will not make you feel bogged up at any time – especially during extended camping or road trips. To shed a little weight off the camper, a lightweight folding bed is used as the replacement. The removable kitchen modules give the occupants option to save space and improve the mileage when the Ford Transit will be used for daily commuting.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367983\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/solar-panel-loaded-ford-transit-camper-is-spacious-practical-option-for-outdoorsy-enthusiasts/Ford-Transit-PHEV-Eco-Evolution-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>For more customizable options, a couple of extra seats can be installed to get a six-seater configuration. The Ford Transit PHEV Eco Evolution will sleep four people courtesy of the folding bench-bed and the additional pop-up roof bed. Since you’ll be away from home for quite some days, the camper has a cabinet and a full-size rear console for clothes, storing gear, and other accessories. Other than that, the camper gets a side kitchenette and folding bench floor plan.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367981\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/solar-panel-loaded-ford-transit-camper-is-spacious-practical-option-for-outdoorsy-enthusiasts/Ford-Transit-PHEV-Eco-Evolution-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>To ensure campers get everything they desire for their adventure trips, Campervan Co is also working on a zero-emission heating system capable of putting the waste heat to use. This will come in handy for heating up the cabin in the colder locations without burning up fuel. This system will function in tandem with the boosted insulation package for better heat efficiency.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367987\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/solar-panel-loaded-ford-transit-camper-is-spacious-practical-option-for-outdoorsy-enthusiasts/Ford-Transit-PHEV-Eco-Evolution-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>For now, the Campervan Co Ford camper is in the latter prototype stage and is soon expected to sell at a starting price tag of approximately $101,900. There will be more option accessories coming in the consumer-oriented version – including hot water facility, microwave, coffeemaker, Wi-Fi and even an Omni-slide indoor/outdoor cooking system.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367996\"

than keeping them in closed cabinets for no one to see for decades!</p>\n<p>Family heirlooms connect generations who’ve never ever met – making them a valued asset for centuries to come. The emotional attachment and the family history representation from a completely different era is what makes heirlooms special. It could be anything from a piece of jewelry, exquisite dress, an antique memento to a valued portrait or family bible. For young people, keeping heirlooms secured while having the trendy quotient is important. So, why not have an uber-cool accessory to store any valued heirloom digitally in style?</p>\n<p>Designers: Vesta Rugilė Nausėdaitė and Auguras Pipiras</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367886\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-see-thought-fashion-accessory-stores-important-heirlooms-digitally-to-pass-down-to-future-generations/Airloom-digital-heirloom-storage-module.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Meet the Airloom, a fashion accessory that’s essentially a digital picture frame in a clear case inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2022/03/10/nothing-ear1-review/\">Nothing ear(1) buds</a> case design. So, now, rather than shunning the ancient things in your closet that you rarely access, it’s time to keep them in digital form in this mindful case. This way you’ll not end up hurting the family feelings, simply because you don’t find much interest in tagging along ancient things of your great, great grandfather all the time with you.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367892\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-see-thought-fashion-accessory-stores-important-heirlooms-digitally-to-pass-down-to-future-generations/Airloom-digital-heirloom-storage-module-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367893\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-see-thought-fashion-accessory-stores-important-heirlooms-digitally-to-pass-down-to-future-generations/Airloom-digital-heirloom-storage-module-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367891\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-see-thought-fashion-accessory-stores-important-heirlooms-digitally-to-pass-down-to-future-generations/Airloom-digital-heirloom-storage-module-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>The idea is to click pictures or make videos of the important family heirlooms and upload them to the Airloom. If this reminds you of the popular Aura digital frame, you are not alone. It’s more like your personal <a href=\"https://yankodesign.com/tag/nft\">NFT</a> that can be accessed anytime, anywhere. Moreover, this being a totally different concept could become the next fad. Imagine young buddies bragging about their heirlooms at a coffee shop – giving reasons why their ancestors were the coolest people around in the yesteryears.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367899\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-see-thought-fashion-accessory-stores-important-heirlooms-digitally-to-pass-down-to-future-generations/Airloom-digital-heirloom-storage-module-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>As the designers imagine this to be a single fashion accessory to keep all your heirlooms for countless years, passing them down to the next generations (who are going to be even more tech-savvy) in the digital form makes complete sense. This ensures, even if the real heirloom is damaged or lost, it still lives in the memories forever in the form of high-resolution photos or videos.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full

One such patent involves a phone with a flap, which is probably the most accurate way to describe this concept that both makes sense and doesn&#8217;t at the same time.</p>\n<p>Designer: Jermaine Smit (Concept Creator)</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367589\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>The current breed of foldable phones uses screens that fold right in the middle, whether vertically or horizontally, inside or out. That&#8217;s not the only way to fold, of course, but companies are limited by current manufacturing technologies and materials. In the world of patents, however, it&#8217;s almost a free for all affair, as long as you can get the design or idea approved first.</p>\n<p>With very few constraints, Samsung envisioned a phone that, when laid out unfolded, resembles a shorter version of the L-shaped Tetris block. The top half of the screen extends to the left, and that extension folds back like a flap, with the folded screen facing the same way as the cameras. This transforms the phone into a more regular shape, like the I-block of the same game.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367593\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>The patent reported by <a href=\"https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-flip-telefoon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LetsGoDigital</a> almost has an uncanny resemblance to one of LG&#8217;s weirdest phones, the LG Wing and its swiveling screen. That existing phone forms a T-shape, though, again like a Tetris block, with a smaller square screen that acts as a secondary display. Samsung&#8217;s idea is almost similar but with one extra trick that LG couldn&#8217;t pull off.</p>\n<p>That flap seems to be functional even when folded, which makes it possible to display things like notifications on the backside of the phone. It can even be used as a viewfinder, allowing the owner to take selfies with the more powerful main cameras. The curved part of the screen at the edge can also be used as a display for something like the date, battery status, and maybe even a ticker for notifications.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367590\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"880\" /></p>\n<p>When unfolded, that extra screen could display a different app or extended controls for the same app. Conversely, you can use the top portion to watch a video in full, leaving the bottom half of the screen for typing or other things. Unfortunately, the LG Wing proved that a successful implementation relies heavily on software as much as hardware, and not even Samsung, with its fancier Android skin, is there yet. Then again, this is just a patent after all, and it&#8217;s simply an act of calling dibs on an idea, whether or not Samsung ends up implementing something as odd as this.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367591\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367592\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2022/03/12/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/\">Samsung foldable phone concept seems to be inspired by Tetris</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com\">Yanko Design</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:30:56 +0000","feedId":64,"bgimg":"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-1.jpg","linkMd5":"5fd8bd8830ab7ef68de56b66c166838b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn14@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-48-947_bea4c9f2d5751ab0.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":850,"sourceBytes":49892,"destBytes":49892,"author":"JC Torres","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn14@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-48-947_bea4c9f2d5751ab0.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn89@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-51-405_273f20afa5ee9c03.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-52-119_f6d31b4cab877676.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn51@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-51-195_f5435c336a24bd37.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn42@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-50-839_10114752736c2e3e.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/samsung-foldable-phone-concept-seems-to-be-inspired-by-tetris/samsung-foldable-patent-tetris-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-51-066_c2b9fb0f266fe68b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408799},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"This sleek rowing machine is all you need to strengthen core muscles","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=365990","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365994\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Home <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/workout/\">workouts</a> are now becoming more common than before, as fitness freaks explore the more practical option compared to visiting gymnasiums susceptible to the spread of infections. While having dumbbells and weight rods is the easier option, getting a hardcore machine for a particular body toning regime is also beneficial. How the machine looks and whether it fits the modern interior space well, is a question well worth pondering over.</p>\n<p>The Beam rowing machine designed by Minho Lee is one of them, and it’s already got me charged up to flex those muscles. Rowing is a very important exercise to build the shoulder, back, bicep and tricep muscles along with the core. Hence getting a rowing machine makes more sense than getting any other isolated muscle workout machine. Since space is at a premium when it comes to getting indoor workout machines, a rowing machine is the one to go for prime fitness.</p>\n<p>Designer: Minho Lee</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365993\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>This sleek rowing machine blends in with any home interior and is compact enough to not take much space once the daily workout is done. The intensity controller toggles the level of resistance the machine will provide, while the sturdy legs ensure it will not move even an inch with intense rowing action. The optimum length of the machine can also be adjusted via the slide rail to provide varied angles of pulling action to target back and shoulder muscles. The footrest too looks very sturdy and ergonomically positioned for the right body posture.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365996\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>The shining chrome dark gray finish of the body combined with the light gray of the seating and pull rod is so inviting. I would love to have this rowing machine tucked in the corner of my recreational room, ready to unleash it every evening after a challenging workday to get in prime physical as well as mental condition.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365992\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365997\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365995\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2022/03/13/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/\">This sleek rowing machine is all you need to strengthen core muscles</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com\">Yanko Design</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 22:30:42 +0000","feedId":64,"bgimg":"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-3.jpg","linkMd5":"9fea27316727c0ec9af94e6ed449b073","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":850,"sourceBytes":38048,"destBytes":38048,"author":"Gaurav Sood","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-3.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn91@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-51-030_382db9cad04731b3.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn1@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-49-914_50f2c14a6f651159.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-1.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn69@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-49-916_63f763f358572a65.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/this-sleek-rowing-machine-is-all-you-need-to-strengthen-core-muscles/Beam-rowing-machine-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn64@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-51-156_126e8bf3c739f100.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408798},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"Origami Lamp looks like two hanging pyramids but is really inspired by a lizard’s head","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=367830","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-368042\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/origami-lamp-looks-like-two-hanging-pyramids-but-is-really-inspired-by-a-lizards-head/Origami-Lamp-2-Design_Hero.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>You have already heard of similarly-designed lamps but this Origami Lamp is probably the best. Inspired by the Japanese art of paper folding, this lamp looks like a large folded creation that lights up when you open it. It boasts a flat-packed design that is now becoming more popular.</p>\n<p>The Origami Lamp is a paper pendant lamp that comes with built-in LED. It is packaged in something like a pizza box and can be easily assembled. You can say it is a design you may probably find in Ikea, or maybe you have already seen something similar.</p>\n<p>Designers: Egor Bogomolov and Иван Горбунов for <a href=\"https://kidz-design.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KIDZ</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367861\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/origami-lamp-looks-like-two-hanging-pyramids-but-is-really-based-on-a-lizard-head/Origami-Lamp-2-Design.jpg\" alt=\"Origami Lamp 2 Design\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367849\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/367830/Origami-Lamp-4.jpg\" alt=\"Origami Lamp\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>You no longer have to do the origami as it comes already folded inside the box. All you have to do is attach the LED light and the cord after folding the paper in two moves, and then you’re good to hang this anywhere. The origami figure is the head of the lizard, which is easy to do. It won’t remind you of a lizard, though—just two pyramids hanging and illuminating from underneath.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367848\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/367830/Origami-Lamp-5.jpg\" alt=\"Origami Lamp\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367852\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/367830/Origami-Lamp.jpg\" alt=\"Origami Lamp\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367839\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/367830/Origami-Lamp-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Pull the counterweight to open the lamp and turn on the light. Place the Origami Lamp in the corner of your living room or use it as an accent light. It can also be ideal for the dining room over the table where you spend a lot of time eating. Like most exciting lighting solutions we’ve featured here, this one is another conversation starter. The size of the Origami Lamp is just right but it looks like a giant folded paper creation. However, it doesn’t overwhelm the space with its simple and minimalistic design, making it perfect for most home interiors.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367850\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/367830/Origami-Lamp-3.jpg\" alt=\"Origami Lamp\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Using origami in design presents endless possibilities. Every fold shows depth and richness that may be customized to your liking. The aesthetic beauty of origami starts when you can transform a simple object, a paper, into something beautiful. Origami celebrates minimalism in art and this lamp design is a perfect example.<br />\n<img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/1400_opt_1/125852128357593.6156e816a19a5.gif\" alt=\"1\" width=\"1280\" /></p>\n<p>The Origami Lamp is a flat-packed creation that comes in a rectangular box. Please don’t mistake it for a box of pizza because you won’t find your favorite pepperoni pizza. Also, you can’t throw it after you&#8217;re done setting up the lamp because the box can grow grass for your pet. Just pour water, close the box, and wait for two to three days. After that, grass will grow and be ready for your cat to eat or play with. It’s edible grass but don’t attempt to eat it and no, pizza still won’t grow out of the box.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367847\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/367830/Origami-Lamp-Grass-for-Pets.jpeg\" alt=\"Origami Lamp Grass for Pets\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>The Origami Lamp by KIDZ can be likened to other lamps we’ve previously seen.

Maybe you will in terms of knowledge about ancient Rome. This particular chess set is a new interpretation of the old game but still gives the same excitement, especially if you’re into chess.</p>\n<p>The Arena is a different version of chess based on the Roman amphitheater. This recreates the ancient times when gladiators would fight under the watchful eyes of the spectators. The Arena is a version of chess where every position in the army is represented by the chessmen wearing different architectural armor.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.materialimmaterial.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MIM Studio</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367879\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-Pieces.jpg\" alt=\"Arena Chess Set Pieces\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>All the chessmen from both mighty armies enter the battle with the determination to win. However, victory will depend on who is controlling them—you and your opponent. So go on, start preparing to defend your kingdom. Once ready, take the positions and begin the battle of wits and strategy.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367876\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Board.jpg\" alt=\"Arena Chess Board\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Arena &#8211; The Game of Chess is one expensive chess set made from concrete. It’s heavy so you may want to decide where to place the board. We suggest you set it by the window as every position offers a beautiful play of shadow depending on the time of day. The Arena is where two opponents will fight and hold ground. It is one intriguing version of chess where strength, courage, and fearless are required.</p>\n<p>The Arena chess set weighs 2770 grams and the board itself measures 304mm x 304mm x 40mm. It is made of concrete so it took some time to create a whole set. There are 32 chessmen (chess pieces)—16 pieces each in Dark Grey and Light Grey.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367873\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-Details.jpg\" alt=\"Arena Chess Set Details\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>Chess is already centuries-old but it continues to be one rewarding and fascinating game for people of all ages. Others may find it boring, but we understand the game&#8217;s thrill, especially when a King is checked mate unexpectedly. We don’t claim to be champions, but this particular set evokes a feeling of bravery—the kind you should feel when you’re about to get into an arena to fight for your life.</p>\n<p>The amphitheater is a famous symbol of Roman architecture. It is an ideal battlefield for even as simple as a chess match, at least, on your tabletop. Designed by Material Immaterial Studio (MIM Studio), this $400 Arena chess set defines strong aesthetics and magnificent details. Every piece is made of concrete, so be careful that you don’t break them.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367877\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chessmen.jpg\" alt=\"Arena Chessmen\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p>This Arena Chess Set will become more than just a conversation starter. It will make you play a game or two just for the sake of playing. Every corner of your house must have something unique, quirky, or interesting. The Arena Chess Set is one to capture any guest’s attention. Just make sure you really know how to play chess in case somebody challenges you to a game.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367874\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-3.jpg\" alt=\"Arena Chess Set 3\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367881\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Game.jpg\" alt=\"Arena Chess Game\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367880\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-2.jpg\" alt=\"Arena Chess Set 2\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367878\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-Price.jpg\" alt=\"Arena Chess Set Price\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" /></p><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2022/03/13/arenas-concrete-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/\">Arena’s concrete chess set can start one heavy battle of wits and courage</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com\">Yanko Design</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 19:15:27 +0000","feedId":64,"bgimg":"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-Design.jpg","linkMd5":"9633a35d464a4b75c96b00d106ceac20","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-49-082_13a331eb30b74938.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":850,"sourceBytes":55014,"destBytes":55014,"author":"Rei Padla","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-Design.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-49-082_13a331eb30b74938.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-Pieces.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn97@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-50-074_9d563a99258b8a29.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Board.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-Details.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chessmen.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn85@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-49-918_73dcd68c9d04dec1.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn48@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-50-432_543e1c06dc702bf3.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Game.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn44@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-51-641_5173ca21e9f1ef22.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn81@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-49-935_57e2f49adb22a1e1.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/03/arena-chess-set-can-start-one-heavy-battle-of-wits-and-courage/Arena-Chess-Set-Price.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn24@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-50-407_8913a346b920b3e4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408798},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"This space-inspired pen levitates magically in its docking station, looking absolutely out of this world!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=367976","description":"<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Levitating Pen\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/piBPWIEqCpY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Sure, you&#8217;ve got pens that can write in zero gravity&#8230; but can your pen defy gravity on earth?? Meet the pen that quite literally floats in mid-air while docked in its unique &#8216;anti-gravity&#8217; pen stand.</p>\n<p>Designed as what I assume is the world&#8217;s first and only &#8216;sci fi&#8217; pen, the pen is a marvel of engineering as it floats within its gravity-defying stand, looking almost like something out of an alien&#8217;s spaceship. The pen itself is a remarkable writing instrument, equipped with a Schmidt ballpoint cartridge for a smooth, luxurious writing experience, however, when you&#8217;re taking a break from writing, the pen doesn&#8217;t just simply go into a pencil-case or a pen-stand. The pen comes with its own magnetic stand that allows it to rest in an inclined position with its tip touching the pen-stand, without tipping over. Magnets within the pen-stand&#8217;s arc-shaped guardrail help the pen hover on its own, resting on just one point. The magnetic forces also cause the pen to gently sway up and down or even spin on its axis, resulting in an experience that feels metaphorically and literally out of this world!</p>\n<p>Designer: Novium</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.yankodesign.com/products/levitating-pen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $89.10</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2022-03-14T01:52:37+00:00\">$99</del> (10% off).

Designed to be less like the Bic ballpoint pen you buy and forget about, and more like an incredibly premium Mont Blanc pen you carefully place on your office table, the pen has a charming, fidget-ish quality that is sure to attract your eyes and fingers. Docking the pen in its stand feels almost like docking a space-pod in the hull of a spaceship. There&#8217;s a satisfying pull that causes the pen to slip out of your hand and automatically align with the magnetic rim of the stand. In fact, even spinning the pen in place will cause it to rotate on its own for 20-ish seconds afterwards, giving the pen a wonderful interactive quality.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://shop.yankodesign.com/products/levitating-pen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/227/402/d0ffb9e2222aa7abaa5b9b7126ae110b_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1590507697&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=fcdb2e546dfa441f8ed7267ad5898979\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"383\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Resisting gravity at a 23.5 degree angle.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://shop.yankodesign.com/products/levitating-pen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/227/438/dd3654742fb3a8dbcc00cb44f53c03b5_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1590507853&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=d9abff0261078e7036a0ffe7181479e2\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"383\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A simple twist will send the pen spinning for up to 20 seconds in flawless, kinetic motion.</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://shop.yankodesign.com/products/levitating-pen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/029/741/758/3cf3683faeb9f68e3e887d47794e4c02_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1594160985&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=7c6ee938db8016c7dda2b2bba31f030b\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"383\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A study by Harvard Business Review found that frequently interrupting your brainstorming with consistent micro-breaks resulted in more idea generation than no breaks.

Sustainability has been running on everybody’s mind. Ever since the pandemic shook up our world, we’re trying to incorporate sustainability into every aspect of our life, including our homes! And, with everyone aspiring toward’s eco-friendly and mindful ways of living, micro homes have completely taken over the world of architecture and cemented their place as sustainable, minimal, and economical living setups. What started off as a cute little trend is now turning into a serious option for home spaces. They are a space-saving and eco-friendly living solution that reduces the load on Mother Earth! They’re simple and minimal alternatives to the imposing and materialistic homes that seem to have taken over. And, we’ve curated a wide range of micro-home setups that totally grabbed our attention! From a disused grain silo that was converted into a micro-home to a community consisting of 310 micro-homes designed for formerly unhoused people &#8211; there&#8217;s a micro-home out there for everyone.</p>\n<h4>1. van Beers&#8217; micro-home</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/02/359519/02_siloliving_stellavanbeers_microhome.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2022/02/359519/01_siloliving_stellavanbeers_microhome.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Plotted all over the Netherlands’ countryside, grain silos are largely going out of use due to a country-wide reduction of livestock, leading to lower demand for grain. Converting the disused silos into a functional and quirky place of respite, Stella van Beers renovated the cylindrical unit into a micro home. Starting from the container’s exterior, van Beers constructed a set of double doors to create an entrance into <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2022/02/02/this-disused-grain-silo-was-converted-into-a-micro-home-is-destined-for-the-pages-of-dr-seuss/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">her micro-home</a>, which connects with a semi-wraparound deck and spiral staircase. Moving inside, van Beers lengthened the interior volume by installing two floors joined together by a short staircase and ladder.</p>\n<h4>2. Community First!

Designed for a client who is a young single man that loves to entertain and host guests while occasionally working from home. Now here was the real challenge – accomodating all the zones you will find in a large apartment (for entertaining and working) while keeping it compact, it is Manhattan after all! So rather than diving an existing small space into even smaller pieces with dividers, MKCA relied on the core principle of flexibility and transformed a pumpkin into a carriage!</p>\n<h4>5.

Designed by Montreal-based L’Abri, La Pointe is a serene little cabin that provides shelter to the visitors of the park. The triangular-shaped structure is a rejuvenated reinterpretation of the typical A-frame chalets that became so popular in North America in the 1950s. The A-frame cottage-inspired cabin can house up to four individuals, while also helping them stay connected to the pure undiluted nature all around. “It was important for the designers to create a simple, almost sculptural structure that would provide functional and nature-oriented spaces,” said L’Abri.</p>\n<h4>8.

Following the cabin’s fortuitous beginnings, the Kupfer’s conceived a layout for their snug, solar-powered, 97-square-foot micro cabin built from recycled and repurposed outfittings, amounting to a total net cost of only $50. Finding new purpose in discarded steel, the Kupfer’s cast the micro cabins siding in steel for an all-season, durable finish.</p>\n<h4>9.
