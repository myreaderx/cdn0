But it should come as no surprise when content is personalized to the shopper's needs, likes, and even using their name, they're far more likely to engage and purchase from that brand. </p>\n\n<p>Don't take my word for it. Take a look at the stats that prove the benefits of eCommerce personalization:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://instapage.com/blog/personalization-statistics#:~:text=Ecommerce%20personalization%20statistics&#38;text=Marketers%20see%20an%20average%20increase,personalization%20influences%20their%20shopping%20decision.&#38;text=31%25%20of%20consumers%20say%20they,personalized%20than%20it%20currently%20is.\">80%</a> of shoppers are more likely to buy from a company that offers personalized experiences.</p></li>\n<li><p>44% of consumers say that they will likely become repeat buyers after a personalized shopping experience with a particular company.</p></li>\n<li><p>Marketers see an average increase of 20% in sales when using personalized experiences.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>First, what is eCommerce personalization?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Summing it all up, eCommerce personalization is the act of showing individualized offers, product recommendations, and other content to your visitors based on their previous actions, demographics, and other personal data.</p>\n\n<p>Today, we'll dive into the 10 genius ways to use eCommerce personalization to attract and convert customers.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4 id=\"1deliverweathersensitivepersonalization\">1. Deliver Weather-Sensitive Personalization</h4>\n\n<p>Based on the weather, consumers change the way they shop, whether it's postponing, pushing, or pivoting purchases based on their needs. For example, if winter is approaching, it's more likely that people will be searching for sweaters and coats rather than sunglasses and swimsuits. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pure360.com/weather-based-personalisation/#:~:text=Weather%2Dbased%20personalisation%20allows%20you,on%20location%2Dspecific%20weather%20data.\">Weather-Sensitive Personalization</a> is an overlooked and simple way to personalize your eCommerce shopping experience. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ecommercepersonalizationexampleamazonsnowitssummerhttpswwwamazoncom\">Ecommerce Personalization Example: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\">Amazon's #NowItsSummer</a></h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Amazon_NowItsSummer-1.jpg\" alt=\"10 Genius Ways to Use eCommerce Personalization to Attract and Convert Customers\"></p>\n\n<p>Brands like Amazon, Nordstrom, and Old Navy understand that personalizing eCommerce content and products during seasonal or weather changes shows that you know your customers' needs and the changing times. </p>\n\n<p>Even if your products are not weather-related conditions, you should still make an effort to change how you position your products due to weather personalization. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"2createlandingpagesforspecificproducts\">2. Create Landing Pages for Specific Products</h4>\n\n<p>When you're running social media or digital marketing ads, it's good to practice using a specific landing page or product page to help. This helps you to maximize your conversions and perfect your eCommerce personalization.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of throwing out various ads, you can now hyper-focus on your best sellers or product categories to attract their ideal consumer. This helps you to generate more qualified leads, aka potential sales, which interns allow you to spend less or smarter. </p>\n\n<p>Creating personalized landing pages for your eCommerce store to promote specific products also removes distractions that your homepage might otherwise have when visitors are scrolling through your site. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ecommercepersonalizationexamplethescentmarkethttpsblogwishpondcompost115675438110casestudythescentmarketuniqueoffer\">Ecommerce Personalization Example: <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675438110/case-study-the-scent-market-unique-offer\">The Scent Market</a></h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/screenshot-the-scented-market.wishpondpages.com-2020.10.14-11_35_29.jpg\" alt=\"10 Genius Ways to Use eCommerce Personalization to Attract and Convert Customers\"></p>\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.wishpond.com/canvas/?utm_source=blog\">Wishpond's Canvas</a>, Wishpond's marketing team was able to create a stunning landing in minutes for <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675438110/case-study-the-scent-market-unique-offer\">The Scent Marketing</a>. The landing page would be used to house customers who clicked on Facebook ads, emails, or social media content.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://the-scented-market.wishpondpages.com/freeshipping/\">The Scent Market's landing page</a> was also integrated with a Shopify button so that customers could purchase directly on the landing page with ease.</p>\n\n<p>The team wanted to ensure that the visitor could effortlessly access our free shipping offer without moving from page to page manually, which would affect <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675436055/conversion-rate-optimization\">sales and conversions.</a></p>\n\n<p>This tactic resulted in making The Scent Market over $34,000 in sales in 32 days.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"3sendpersonalizedsmsmobilemarketingcampaigns\">3. Send Personalized SMS Mobile Marketing Campaigns</h4>\n\n<p>Everyone is glued to their phones, so why not use mobile marketing to target potential customers or remarket to past customers? </p>\n\n<p>Similar to email marketing strategies, SMS marketing focuses on sending updates, promotions, discounts, and reminders directly to a customer's phone number. </p>\n\n<p>Collect phone numbers with every order from past customers regardless of their country and location. Of course, it's crucial to let them know that charges may apply based on their location. Use SMS remarketing to remind them to restock on their products or update them on sales. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ecommercepersonalizationexampledominospizzahttpswwwdominoscomen\">Ecommerce Personalization Example: <a href=\"https://www.dominos.com/en//\">Domino's Pizza</a></h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/image4-2.jpg\" alt=\"10 Genius Ways to Use eCommerce Personalization to Attract and Convert Customers\"></p>\n\n<p>Dominos regularly sends personalized messages based on past purchases, reminder, and personalization of their customers SMS subscription.

Recommend Product Categories Based on Browsing Behavior</h4>\n\n<p>With a snip of code or an integrated app, you can upsell by showing customers recommended products solely based on their search history. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike browsing, when visitors make an active effort to search for products, it showcases their desire for a specific item. Sometimes they're looking for the best alternative or answer. Instead of having them go back and forth, show off their browsing history below to make their search and buying process easier. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ecommercepersonalizationexamplejcrewhttpswwwjcrewcom\">Ecommerce Personalization Example: <a href=\"https://www.jcrew.com/\">J Crew</a></h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/JCrew.jpg\" alt=\"10 Genius Ways to Use eCommerce Personalization to Attract and Convert Customers\"></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"5personalizeddiscountsbasedoveracertainamountpopup\">5. Personalized Discounts Based Over a Certain Amount Popup</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bareinternational.eu/how-coupons-and-promo-codes-improve-personalization/\">Bare International</a> found that high-value coupons and offers are nearly 100% effective in getting both existing and inactive customers back into a store. Not to mention, customers prefer receiving high-value coupons for one-time use over lower-value coupons that can be used again and again.</p>\n\n<p>You can personalize your coupon based on first-time shoppers, returning customers, or their search history. </p>\n\n<p>When people visit a page on your website, <a href=\"https://www.wishpond.com/website-popups/\">the popup appears</a>. It asks them to signup to get a discount coupon that they can use in your eCommerce store on orders of a minimum amount (usually an amount that requires customers to place an order with at least 2 items)</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"ecommercepersonalizationexamplewishpondspopuptemplatehttpswwwwishpondcomwebsitepopups\">Ecommerce Personalization Example: <a href=\"https://www.wishpond.com/website-popups/\">Wishpond’s Pop-Up Template</a></h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.wishpond.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/black-friday-popup-example.png\" alt=\"10 Genius Ways to Use eCommerce Personalization to Attract and Convert Customers\"></p>\n\n<div class=\"takeaway\">  \n  <h2>Need help marketing your eCommerce store or products?</h2>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.wishpond.com/vip-demo/?utm_source=blog\">Book a free call </a>to learn how our team can help you to generate more eCommerce sales.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h4 id=\"6sendpersonalizedemailbasedonuserbehavior\">6.

Use Geo-Location Targeting for Google Ads</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/77711920097/why-does-my-small-business-need-google-adwords\">Geo-Location</a> targeting with Google ads is the act of creating ads that target people in a specific place, radius, or country. Ads are seen on web browsers and devices that provide location data so you can access potential leads regardless. </p>\n\n<p>By using <a href=\"https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675437828/get-more-leads\">geo-location targeting</a>, you improve conversions with a personalized message that connects. For example, Denny's can use geo-targeting ads during breakfast and lunch hours to target people to check-in within a 5-mile radius. </p>\n\n<p>For more on how to use personalization with <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722043?hl=en\">Google ads geo-location</a> features, check out Adespresso's <a href=\"https://adespresso.com/blog/google-ads-location-targeting/\">Google Ads Location Targeting: When and Why You Should (and Shouldn't) Use it</a></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"8closefriendslistoninstagram\">8.
