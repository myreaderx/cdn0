Please don't submit more than one request for your account. For denied requests, you can submit a new request after 30 days.\")</strong></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Why can't I verify my Facebook Business Page?</h2> \n<p>There are a few reasons Facebook might deny your request. Let's explore two common ones, and how you can fix them.</p> \n<h3>1. Something is wrong with your submitted documents.</h3> \n<p>Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2342133782492969?id=180505742745347\">outlines a few primary issues</a>&nbsp;you might have with the documents you submitted in the request form. If your document doesn't align with Facebook's requirements — or is low resolution or low-quality — consider re-uploading a new document that fits Facebook's standards.</p> \n<p>For instance, your document:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Might not be the type of document Facebook accepts (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/159334372093366\">more on that here</a>).</li> \n <li>Might be a self-filed document. Facebook needs to see a document with an accompanying official signature or seal.</li> \n <li>The document is blurry, low resolution, or corrupted. Ensure you've scanned your document at a high resolution or format.</li> \n <li>The document is expired.</li> \n <li>The document you submitted doesn't contain your full business address.</li> \n <li>The document's language is unsupported (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/159334372093366\">supported languages are shown in the image</a>, below):</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/supported%20language.png?width=501&amp;name=supported%20language.png\" alt=\"the languages facebook supports for verified badges\" width=\"501\" style=\"width: 501px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>2. Your information — including business website, business address, and your business's legal name — doesn't match up.</h3> \n<p>When it comes to requesting a verified badge, accuracy and attention to detail is key. For instance, your request might be denied if your company's name listed on your Facebook Business Settings is different from the name that appears on your submitted documents.</p> \n<p>Here are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The legal business name on your submitted document needs to match the name that appears in your Business Settings. (To fix this, update your business name in Business Settings or submit a new document that includes the business name that appears in your Business Settings.)</li> \n <li>Your document needs to include your business's full address and business phone number. (A partial address won't be accepted.)</li> \n <li>Your email domain and website address need to match, and your website should feature your company's name or logo.</li> \n <li>Your business name needs to be listed on your submitted document. For instance, if a utility bill has your business' phone number but your business name isn't included, it won't be accepted. (More information on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/159334372093366\">acceptable documents here</a>.)</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Why Its Important to Verify My Facebook Business Page</h2> \n<p>A verified badge tells prospects and customers that they can trust your Facebook Page as the true, authentic presence of your brand. Additionally, it's often critical for differentiating your brand from other, similar terms that might make it difficult for users to find your business on Facebook.</p> \n<p>However, there are a few other major benefits to having a verified Facebook Business Page, aside from increased visibility.</p> \n<p>For one, Facebook's algorithm automatically places verified badges at the top of search results when someone is looking for your business. This is especially important if your brand hosts a few groups on Facebook.</p> \n<p>For instance, HubSpot has a few dedicated groups for various, niche purposes like HubSpot education or HubSpot marketers. It's critical Facebook users are able to find the more general, official HubSpot Page when searching \"HubSpot\", which is why it's good HubSpot's Page has a verified badge, which enables it to rise to the top of search results:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/search%20for%20hub.png?width=1236&amp;name=search%20for%20hub.png\" alt=\"search for hub\" width=\"1236\" style=\"width: 1236px;\"></p> \n<p>Since the verified badge will help surface your brand to the top of search results, you'll ideally increase followers and leads as a result of having a verified badge — a major benefit of the symbol.</p> \n<p>Additionally, a verified badge earns you early access to new Facebook features that aren't yet available for all users. This can help you level-up on competitors who might not have the same access.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And that's it! You're all set to request a verified badge for your own business' Page.

If you want more specific data relating to these topics, you’ll have to <a href=\"https://claritas.com/contact/\">contact Claritas’ sales team</a> to become a customer.</p> \n<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: Free; <a href=\"https://claritas.com/contact/\">Pricing available on request</a></p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">SurveyMonkey</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/surveymonkey-market-research-tool.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=surveymonkey-market-research-tool.jpeg\" alt=\"SurveyMonkey market research tool for surveying panelists\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>SurveyMonkey is a powerful tool for creating in-depth <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32206/An-Uncomplicated-Approach-to-Conducting-Solid-Market-Research.aspx\">market research surveys</a> that will help you understand your market and consumer preferences.</p> \n<p>With this tool, you can create targeted, uber-specific surveys that help you collect answers that pertain specifically to your product. While using a data source can give you a general overview of your target audience and market, SurveyMonkey can help you get more granular insights from real consumers.</p> \n<p>SurveyMonkey offers dedicated <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/market-research/solutions/\">market research solutions and services</a>, including a global survey panel, a survey translation service for international research, and a reporting dashboard option that allows you to easily parse through the results.</p> \n<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/pricing/individual\">Free, $32/month (Advantage Annual), $99/month (Premier Annual), $99/month (Standard Monthly)</a>; <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/pricing/teams/\">$25/user/month (Team Advantage, minimum 3 users), $75/user/month (Team Premier, minimum 3 users), Enterprise (Contact for pricing)</a></p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\">Typeform</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/typeform-market-research-tool.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=typeform-market-research-tool.jpeg\" alt=\"Typeform surveying platform and market research tool\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Like SurveyMonkey, Typeform allows you to run research surveys to get direct answers from your target consumers. It’s an easy-to-use, mobile-optimized form-builder that's great for market research.</p> \n<p>Typeform’s distinguishing factor is that it shows viewers one form field at a time. In its templates, it encourages a more conversational, casual approach (like in its <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/templates/t/market-research/\">market research survey template</a>). This makes it a better fit for product launches that target a younger demographic. If you’re targeting C-suite executives at established firms, consider a more formal option such as SurveyMonkey or keeping your tone more formal in your questions.</p> \n<p>You can create a wide range of question types, including multiple choice questions, short-form questions, and rating scale questions. Other features include the ability to recall answers from previous questions and create logic jumps.</p> \n<p>In a survey, you’d want to collect both demographic and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-psychographics-faqs-ht\">psychographic information</a> on your customer, seeking to understand their purchasing behaviors and the problems they encounter. The goal is to find out if your product is the solution to one of those problems — and whether, before launching, you should add more features or rethink your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5208/4-ways-to-create-a-remarkable-product-strategy.aspx\">product positioning strategy</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/pricing/\">Free; $35/month (Essentials); $50/month (Professional); $70/month (Premium) </a></p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://www.upwave.com/instant-insights/\">Upwave Instant Insights</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/upwave-instant-insights-market-research-tool.jpeg?width=1200&amp;name=upwave-instant-insights-market-research-tool.jpeg\" alt=\"Upwave Instant Insights tool for market and consumer research\" width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px;\"></p> \n<p>Upwave Instant Insights is a consumer research tool that’s part of the Upwave brand marketing platform.

One pro of using this platform is that Upwave distributes your survey to real people — not just people taking surveys for the money, which could skew the results.</p> \n<p>To create a survey, you <a href=\"https://insights.upwave.com/quote\">sign up on the Upwave platform</a>, click your name in the upper right-hand corner, and click “My Surveys,” where you can create as many surveys as you want.

You can also identify snags that prevent conversions.</p> \n<p>Loop11 tests your site by making users perform tasks. They then complete a short question about how easy or difficult the task was to complete. Your product may be phenomenal, but unless consumers can buy it through your site, you won’t launch it successfully.</p> \n<p>You can use Loop11’s participants or bring in your own.</p> \n<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.loop11.com/pricing/\">$63/month (Rapid Insights), $239/month (Pro), $399/month (Enterprise)</a></p> \n<h3>11. <a href=\"http://www.userlytics.com/sitepublic/\">Userlytics</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/userlytics-market-research-tool.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=userlytics-market-research-tool.jpeg\" alt=\"Userlytics usability testing platform for market research\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Like Loop11, Userlytics allows you to test the usability of your website, mobile app, and site prototype.

They then answer a simple question about the difficulty of the task. You can structure the question in various ways; you can leave it open-ended, provide multiple choices, or ask for a rating. Other formats you can use include System Usability Scale (SUS) questions, Net Promoter Score (NPS) questions, and Single Ease Questions (SEQ).</p> \n<p>Userlytics performs both a webcam and a screen recording. You can compare the user’s answers with their reactions on video to understand how they feel when they’re interacting with your assets.</p> \n<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.userlytics.com/prices-plans\">$49/participant (Quick &amp; Easy); $69/participant (Annual Enterprise); Custom pricing available on request</a></p> \n<h3>12. <a href=\"https://www.temper.io/\">Temper</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/temper-market-research-tool.png?width=650&amp;name=temper-market-research-tool.png\" alt=\"Temper quick survey tool for market research\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Sometimes you need a no-frills test to take the pulse of consumers.

The smiley face, \"meh\" face, and frown face make it easy for viewers to make a snap judgment.</p> \n<p>One great way to use this tool is by adding the widget on a blog post announcing the launch of your new product. That way, you can find out general sentiment on the product before launching it.

[+ Examples]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/comparative-advertising","description":"<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising?_ga=2.260943437.1342203147.1615561491-1046125508.1615561491\">Advertising</a>&nbsp;is the process of creating messages that raise awareness of your brand.</p>  \n<p>These messages can have various purposes like attracting potential customers, promoting upcoming sales, and introducing new products to market. Most advertisements center around one business, but a unique type, called comparative advertising, centers around two.</p> \n<p>When done right, comparative ads can successfully convince consumers to do business with one brand over another. But, when done wrong, companies may find themselves in the middle of a lawsuit. Given this, using comparative advertising requires care and attention.</p> \n<p>In this post, we’ll explain what comparative advertising is, give examples from real-life businesses, explain the legality of using the strategy, and present pros and cons that you can use to make the best decision for your business.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Ad Campaign Planning Kit\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>These ads can directly or indirectly mention a competitor, but consumers can typically deduce who the other business is through product features and call-outs. Comparative ads also give customers a direct point of comparison between two companies, as they can view products and assess features all at once, rather than needing to seek out information from multiple sources.</p> \n<p>Although they may feature two businesses, it is important to note that one company creates the ad for their benefit, so its tone is swayed in their favor. That being said, businesses aren’t allowed to make false claims about their competitors, so consumers are presented with factual information.</p> \n<p>There is no set template for comparative advertisements; they can be digital or print, videos or images, humorous or serious. Many businesses take advantage of 21st-century viral culture and share ads on social media platforms and capitalize on the traffic from likes, retweets, follows, and shares.</p> \n<h2>Comparative Advertising Examples</h2> \n<p>Below we’ll go over some real-life examples of comparative advertising to help you understand the practice.</p> \n<h3>Popeyes</h3> \n<p>Popeyes is an American fast-food chain that serves fried chicken. Chick-fil-A is their direct industry competitor, well known for being closed on Sundays.</p> \n<p>Popeyes capitalized on this and created a comparative advertisement that emphasized that their restaurant is open on Sundays, ready and able to serve consumers every day of the week, especially while Chick-fil-A takes a day off. The video is shown below.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 200px; max-height: 113px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJxLX9suK6I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h3>Sprint</h3> \n<p>Verizon, a cellular provider, used the same actor as the face of their commercials for nine years. Sprint, an industry competitor, poached the actor in 2016 and used his switch to their service to take a unique approach to comparative advertising.</p> \n<p>In the video below, Sprint essentially says, if a long-time, loyal Verizon actor can switch to Sprint, why can’t you change as well? The business positions itself as a qualified competitor by saying that their cell phone service has a 1% difference in coverage than Verizon.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 200px; max-height: 113px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UlOZYJ3l9SA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Cocoon by Sealy</h3> \n<p>Casper is a well-known mattress brand that has managed to garner significant hype and recognizability for its products.</p> \n<p>Cocoon by Sealy, a direct competitor, uses comparative advertising in search engine result pages (SERPs) to target Casper’s intended audience. The company placed a paid ad in a SERP for the term Casper mattress (shown below), with the headline “Don’t Buy the Hype, Shop Cocoon &amp; Save Hundreds.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/casper%20serp.jpg?width=495&amp;name=casper%20serp.jpg\" alt=\"paid ads top result in google search engine results page for &quot;casper mattress&quot; query\" width=\"495\" style=\"width: 495px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Cocoon claims that its competitor is only a competitor because people buy for the name-brand hype. If a curious consumer clicks on the ad, they learn that Cocoon offers mattresses that are worthwhile because they are conducive to peaceful sleep and are affordable (displayed in the image below).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mattress.jpg?width=508&amp;name=mattress.jpg\" alt=\"side by side image of woman sitting on cocoon by sealy mattress and empty casper mattress\" width=\"508\" style=\"width: 508px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.cocoonbysealy.com/Casper/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA1pyCBhCtARIsAHaY_5e1ATbxd1aRJr9KF0juKca2J7ijA-ew5BDkAd2FzjCYbQ806nqgpVMaAtc1EALw_wcB\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>Adidas</h3> \n<p>Adidas is a well-known sports apparel brand that is only outshined by Nike. Adidas created a comparative video (shown below) that features a person running in the desert wearing Nike shoes.</p> \n<p>Runners know outdoor terrains are challenging to run in. Still, the most impressive thing in the video is that the cameraman carrying a 50-pound camera can keep up with the runner because he’s wearing Adidas shoes.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 200px; max-height: 150px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 75%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8TnG7jyfoWI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Kroger</h3> \n<p>Kroger is a grocery store chain that took out a full-page comparative advertisement against a local competitor (Publix) in a Tennessee newspaper.</p> \n<p>The advertisement, shown in the image below, features two long receipts from both stores that are the same length, but costs were cheaper, and savings were higher at Kroger. The brand essentially says that, even if you buy the same products, Kroger offers lower prices, savings, and additional perks that consumers cannot find at Publix.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kroger-vs-publix.jpg?width=380&amp;name=kroger-vs-publix.jpg\" width=\"380\" style=\"width: 380px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://couponsinthenews.com/2012/08/26/grocery-stores-tussle-in-tennessee/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>Bounty</h3> \n<p>Bounty is a paper towel brand that created a comparative ad to display the benefits of using their paper towels versus the leading generic brand. While they don’t explicitly name a competitor, they make a dig at whoever it may be by calling them the “ordinary brand” because they can’t clean up messes as well as Bounty can.</p> \n<p>Essentially, they’re saying Bounty is premium, and any other option is just regular.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bounty-ad.jpg?width=418&amp;name=bounty-ad.jpg\" alt=\"bounty paper towel comparative advertisement that reads &quot;2x more absorbent so you can use less.&quot;\" width=\"418\" style=\"width: 418px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://swipefile.com/bounty-paper-towel-comparison-ad/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>While all of these businesses used comparative advertising, it’s essential to understand that it’s only that — comparative. Each company believes it is the best option, but they say that through comparison, not false or misleading claims.</p> \n<p>However, given that the line can be vague, many countries have laws that dictate how comparative ads can and can’t be used.</p> \n<h2>Comparative Advertising Law</h2> \n<p>Below, we’ll discuss the comparative advertising laws from three different countries and the explicit language they use to explain what advertisers are allowed to do.</p> \n<h3>United States Comparative Advertising Law</h3> \n<p>The U.S.’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) protects consumers from being deceived, defrauded, and manipulated by businesses. It also protects companies from unfair practices and activities of competitors.</p> \n<p>The FTC <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/14.15\">ruled on comparative advertising</a>&nbsp;and said, “Comparative advertising, when truthful and nondeceptive, is a source of important information to consumers and assists them in making rational purchase decisions. Comparative advertising encourages product improvement and innovation, and can lead to lower prices in the marketplace.”</p> \n<p>In brief, the FTC supports comparative advertising, as it benefits consumers by giving a well-rounded view of product offerings. What they don’t tolerate is advertising that disparages competitors and is deceptive as a means to get consumers to do business with one company over another. Companies can use the FTC ruling to file claims if they feel as though they are being discredited.</p> \n<h3>Australia Comparative Advertising Law</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/accc-book/printer-friendly/29527\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</a>&nbsp;says that “Businesses may use comparative advertising to directly promote the superiority of their products over another.” Like U.S. law, businesses must follow general advertising best-practices of not being deceptive or misleading in an attempt to entice consumers to do business with them.</p> \n<h3>Hong Kong Comparative Advertising Law</h3> \n<p>Hong Kong has no specific legislation intended to limit comparative advertising. Still, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance <a href=\"https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap362?p0=1&amp;p1=1\">prohibits false trade descriptions</a>&nbsp;and misleading or incomplete information advertisements, and the Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies of Hong Kong <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advertising#Hong_Kong\">has the authority to investigate</a>&nbsp;instances of violation.</p> \n<p>All in all, regardless of your location, it’s important to understand the laws and regulations of comparative advertisements, so you don’t find yourself in the middle of a lawsuit.</p> \n<h2>Comparative Advertising Pros and Cons</h2> \n<p>The reality of choosing to use comparative advertising is up to your individual business needs.</p> \n<p>Suppose you have an industry competitor that owns most of the market share. In that case, comparative advertising can be beneficial as you’re letting your target market know that there are other options out there. If you’re a new business, comparative advertising can also help generate awareness around the fact that you exist.</p> \n<p>However, if you’re unable to support your claims of superiority and your advertisements seem more berating than comparative, you can stand to lose business. Overall, as mentioned above, the decision to use comparative advertising depends on your goals.</p> \n<p>We’ve compiled a list of comparative advertising pros and cons that will help you make a comprehensive decision about whether you should opt to use the strategy.</p> \n<table style=\"border-color: #99acc2; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Pros</p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p>Cons</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Explicit product emphasis.</p> <p>Comparative advertising specifically focuses on a single product or feature that makes you better than a competitor, which is helpful advertising for your products in general.</p> <p>Even if you don’t sway your audience, they are still becoming aware of its direct specifications, benefits, and features.</p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #000000;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">You can face legal action.</p> <p>As mentioned above, many countries have laws protecting consumers and other businesses from comparative ads.</p> <p>If you don’t follow legal requirements, you may face legal action from your competitors that requires significant legal fees.

You can add them to your status update, your published article, and your business page to reach an audience beyond your network. You can also browse through hashtag feeds to see what conversations are happening surrounding those topics.</p> \n<h3>How To Use Hashtags on Your LinkedIn Status Update</h3> \n<p>There are a few ways to add hashtags to your status update.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"GIF showing how to add LinkedIn hashtag to status update\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-1.gif?width=448&amp;name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-1.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 448px;\" title=\"\" width=\"448\"></p> \n<p>As the GIF illustrates, you can add a hashtag by:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>Typing out the pound sign followed by the word or phrase. As you type out your hashtag, LinkedIn will auto-generate hashtag suggestions based on what's trending and popular.</li> \n <li>Clicking on the \"Add Hashtag\" button located on the bottom left of the box.</li> \n <li>Selecting one of the related hashtags next to the \"Add Hashtag\" button.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Pro-tip: Don't add spaces or symbols in your hashtags, as they will no longer be clickable.</p> \n<h3>How To Use Hashtags on Your LinkedIn Article</h3> \n<p>As it currently stands, users cannot add clickable hashtags in the body of their articles published on LinkedIn. However, they can make it discoverable by adding hashtags to the article description box.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"GIF showing how to add a hashtag to an article on LinkedIn\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-2.gif?width=624&amp;height=332&amp;name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-2.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"332\"></p> \n<h3>How To Use Hashtags on Your Business Page</h3> \n<p>If you have a business page on LinkedIn, you can associate it with relevant hashtags. This will put you right in the center of conversations surrounding those hashtags and allow you to connect with relevant audiences. Here are the steps to add them:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li> <h4>Start on your business page's homepage.<img alt=\"LinkedIn business page homepage\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></h4> </li> \n <li> <h4>Click on the \"Add\" button on the bottom right under \"Hashtags.\" A smaller page will open up.</h4> <img alt=\"LinkedIn page where users can add three hashtags related to their business page \" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-3.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-3.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></li> \n <li> <h4>Click \"Add a hashtag\" and select up to three hashtags.</h4> <img alt=\"Example of three hashtags LinkedIn users can put on their business page\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-2.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">You're all set.</span></li> \n</ol> \n<h2>Should I use hashtags on LinkedIn?</h2> \n<p>The short answer is yes, hashtags are a great way to reach audiences beyond your direct connections on LinkedIn.</p> \n<p>Let's say you only have 200 connections on LinkedIn. You publish an article on SEO and don't use any hashtags. For it to make a substantial impact, you'll need a lot of post engagement from second- and third-degree connections.</p> \n<p>Why place such limits on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-content-marketing\">your content</a>? By using hashtags, you maximize your post's reach potential. If the SEO hashtag has 100,000K followers and you use it, your post engagement can easily triple what it was without hashtags.</p> \n<p>With that said, here are a few things to keep in mind when using them:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Don't go overboard </strong>– LinkedIn's former senior director of product management, Pete Davies, recommends <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-your-linkedin-feed-people-you-know-talking-things-pete-davies/\">sticking to three hashtags</a>. That should be enough to target the main keywords without looking spammy.</li> \n <li><strong>Hashtags don't replace </strong><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/good-copywriting-practices-list\">copy </a></strong>– Hashtags don't provide context, they should only be used to improve your discoverability. You should still have descriptions in everything you post.</li> \n <li><strong>Mix the popular with the niche </strong>– When you only use popular hashtags, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/23454/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-mastering-linkedin.aspx\">your content</a> can get lost. If you go too niche, you may not reach enough people. Using a little bit of both strikes the perfect balance.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you get comfortable with the use of hashtags, you can start identifying which ones are performing the best. You may find that some lead to higher engagement rates than others. If so, those are worth reusing.</p> \n<h2>How to Find Top LinkedIn Hashtags</h2> \n<p>There are three types of hashtags that LinkedIn recommends to its users based on their network and industry: recommended, popular, trending. LinkedIn's 'Discover More' page is the first – and best – place to look when considering which hashtags to use in your posts.</p> \n<p>To access this page, follow these steps:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>Click on the \"Discover More\" button. \n  <ul> \n   <li>On the mobile app, this will appear when you click on your profile picture on the top left corner of the page.</li> \n   <li>On desktop view, it will be at the bottom of the left sidebar.</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>On this page, you'll see trending pages, recommended connections and pages, and hashtags toward the bottom of the page.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>As a marketer, LinkedIn recommends me many marketing-related hashtags, such as #digitalmarketing, #seo, and #contentwriter. However, this list will vary from one user to the next.</p> \n<h2>LinkedIn Trending Hashtags</h2> \n<p>In 2020, LinkedIn released data on the top trending hashtags for Q1 in 2020.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"LinkedIn top trending hashtags in 2020\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-1.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://about.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/resource-hub/linkedIn-3.30-content-insights-infographic.pdf\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>In January and February, the list was virtually identical. However, conversations shifted in March when the pandemic started. Searches for topics on remote working tripled and the #remotework hashtag also started trending.</p> \n<p>The best way to optimize your hashtag use is by referring to your recommended hashtags and analyzing their performance on your posts.</p> \n<h2>How To Follow Hashtags on LinkedIn</h2> \n<p>Following hashtags will allow you to see what other content creators are posting, how users are responding, and get ideas for future posts.</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>Head to the search bar and type the hashtag you want to follow.</li> \n <li>Select an option from the dropdown menu.</li> \n <li>That will take you to the hashtag's feed where you can see all content published with this hashtag. Click \"Follow\" at the top of the page.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>See the GIF below to see the steps in action.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"GIF showing how to follow hashtags on LinkedIn\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>Now that you're following the hashtag, you'll see it on the left sidebar under \"Followed Hashtags\" when navigating on a computer. When using the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-stats\">LinkedIn </a>mobile app, you can access the hashtags you're following by clicking on your profile picture on the top left of the window and scrolling down to the \"Followed Hashtags\" dropdown menu.</p> \n<p>Hashtags are integral to the success of your content. By relying on LinkedIn's hashtag recommendations and your analytics, you can ensure your posts are reaching the right audience.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b612a0dc-34ea-4e79-908b-28874def7e5a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"How to Use LinkedIn for Business and Marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b612a0dc-34ea-4e79-908b-28874def7e5a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fuse-hashtags-on-linkedin&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe.png","linkMd5":"cd88b345192683b387cbe527476f0778","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-30-537_a5901e98cb60ea43.webp","destWidth":754,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7622,"destBytes":12106,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-30-537_a5901e98cb60ea43.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-1.gif?width=448&name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-1.gif":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-2.gif?width=624&height=332&name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-2.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn46@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-58-992_c3b518574590b7e0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn.png?width=624&name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn81@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-00-262_69621f623395b610.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-3.png?width=624&name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn81@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-52-211_5e087d386743bb52.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-2.png?width=624&name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-51-788_957d695f2ebfdd40.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-1.png?width=624&name=How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-51-489_7283af8f28efd6f7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20To%20Use%20Hashtags%20on%20LinkedIn.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn8@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-58-903_c0def32074d8f984.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b612a0dc-34ea-4e79-908b-28874def7e5a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-01-107_85ce3eb0b1d04252.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fuse-hashtags-on-linkedin&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-51-586_bc03cff127f5d300.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370090},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"How to Size & Design Your Facebook Cover Photo or Video [Templates]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cover-photo-size-best-practices","description":"<p>When people arrive at your Facebook Page, where do you think they first look?</p> \n<p>I'll give you some hints.

It's therefore crucial that you follow Facebook cover photo best practices and optimize your cover photo for the right dimensions.</p> \n<p>A cover photo can take your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5492/how-to-create-a-facebook-business-page-in-5-simple-steps-with-video.aspx\">Facebook Business Page</a> to the next level. Whether you're using Facebook to generate leads, close your next sale, or create a customer community, knowing how to make and optimize your cover photo is very important.

Below, you'll find Facebook cover photo templates, and just as many best practices to guide you when designing your brand's banner artwork. At the bottom of this post, find out how to turn your cover photo into a cover video, and check out a few examples to see what others have done.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Facebook Cover Photo Best Practices</h2> \n<h3>1. Do abide by Facebook's cover photo guidelines.</h3> \n<p>It seems like a no-brainer, but obeying <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/www/276329115767498?rdrhc\">Facebook’s cover photo guidelines</a> is crucial to your Facebook Page existing in the first place. I'd highly suggest reading through the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php\">full Page Guidelines</a>, but here are a few important things to keep in mind for your Facebook banner:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your cover is public.</li> \n <li>Covers can't be deceptive, misleading, or infringe on anyone else's copyright.</li> \n <li>You can't encourage people to upload your cover to their personal timelines.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you get caught violating the above terms, Facebook could take action against your Page. And while Facebook doesn't explicitly say what will happen if you violate their cover photo guidelines, it's probably not smart to get your Facebook Page taken down over a cover photo infraction, so read the guidelines in full and adhere to them.</p> \n<h3>2. Do make sure your Facebook cover photo size is right.</h3> \n<p>As stated at the beginning of this article, the best Facebook banner size is 820 pixels wide by 312 pixels tall for computers, and 640 pixels wide by 360 pixels tall on mobile devices.</p> \n<p>You don't want to spend all this time designing a cover photo only to have it look weird when you upload it to Facebook.</p> \n<p>If you upload an image smaller than those dimensions, Facebook will stretch it to fit the right size, as long as it's at least 399 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall.</p> \n<p>If you want a no-hassle way to make sure your cover photos are the right size, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-cover-photo-templates?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cover-photo-size-best-practices&amp;hubs_post-cta=download%20our%20pre-sized%20template%20for%20Facebook%20cover%20photos%20here\">download our pre-sized template for Facebook cover photos</a>.</p> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Featured Resource: <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-cover-photo-templates\">Facebook Cover Photo Templates</a></h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-cover-photo-templates?hubs_post-cta=image&amp;__hstc=233546881.7e6d2aead10f5c676f7d722052b8ea0d.1615235731484.1615235731484.1615235731484.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1615235731484&amp;__hsfp=512429567&amp;_ga=2.212232084.1006362716.1615235730-1953554424.1615235730\"><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen_Shot_2021-01-25_at_2.52.22_PM-removebg-preview.png?width=400&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2021-01-25_at_2.52.22_PM-removebg-preview.png\" alt=\"Facebook Cover Photo Templates\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></strong></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-cover-photo-templates?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom&amp;__hstc=233546881.7e6d2aead10f5c676f7d722052b8ea0d.1615235731484.1615235731484.1615235731484.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1615235731484&amp;__hsfp=512429567&amp;_ga=2.245059461.1006362716.1615235730-1953554424.1615235730\">Download the Free Templates</a></p> \n<h3>3. Don't worry about the old '20% text' rule, but still try to stay visual.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"http://marketingland.com/toss-all-the-text-youd-like-on-facebook-covers-the-20-rule-has-been-lifted-50516\">Back in 2013</a>, Facebook removed any reference to the 20% rule on text in cover photos ... but that doesn't mean you should go wild with using text in your design. The previous rule said that only 20% of your cover photo could be text. Personally, I thought that was way too restrictive for marketers, but the sentiment behind the rule was a good one.</p> \n<p>If you're going to use text in your cover photo, keep that text concise. Your photo will be much more informative and engaging. You can see how we've tried to strike that balance on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hubspot/\">HubSpot's Facebook Page</a> below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot-facebook-page-banner.jpg?width=650&amp;name=hubspot-facebook-page-banner.jpg\" alt=\"HubSpot Facebook cover photo \" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Want to see how HubSpot uses Facebook? Like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hubspot\">Facebook Page here</a>.</p> \n<h3>4. Do give your cover image a focal point and colors that match your brand.</h3> \n<p>Think of your cover photo as the portion of your Page that's \"above the fold.\" If it's distracting or confusing, people will be more likely to click off the Page.</p> \n<p>Many of the best Facebook cover photos include a centerpiece to focus visitors' attention, along with a color scheme that aligns with the rest of their brand. Remember, your social media accounts are extensions of your business, and should give that impression to visitors right away.</p> \n<p>They also use negative white (i.e., empty) space as an advantage to make the subject, the copy, and the elements unique to Facebook (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-call-to-action-buttons-business-pages\">like the CTA button</a> on Facebook business Pages) stand out even more.</p> \n<p>Here's an example from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nytimes/\">The New York Times</a>:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/the-new-york-times-facebook-banner.png?width=650&amp;name=the-new-york-times-facebook-banner.png\" alt=\"The New York Times' simple Facebook cover with its logo against white text\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>And one from social media management platform <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SproutSocialInc/\">Sprout Social</a>:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sprout-social-facebook-cover.jpg?width=650&amp;name=sprout-social-facebook-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Sprout Social Facebook cover photo\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>5. Don't try to blend the contents of your cover photo with your profile picture.</h3> \n<p>With some clever design tweaks, you used to be able to manipulate your profile picture and cover photo so they appear as if they're two parts of the same canvas.</p> \n<p>One of Paris' old cover photos is a great example of this:</p> \n<h4 style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-family: AvenirNext, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #33475b;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/paris-facebook-cover-photo.jpg?width=650&amp;name=paris-facebook-cover-photo.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Facebook cover photo with blended profile picture\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></h4> \n<p>You can still do this on your personal profile, but Facebook no longer sets up Business Pages this way.</p> \n<p>Now, as shown in the examples earlier in this article, the profile picture is completely separate from the cover photo.</p> \n<p>We admire your creativity, but don't prepare your design this way if you haven't yet launched a Business Page.</p> \n<h3>6. Do draw attention to the action buttons on the bottom right.</h3> \n<p>You might've noticed in a few of the cover photo examples above that their primary call-to-action (CTA) buttons were different. HubSpot’s says \"Send Message,\" while Sprout Social's says \"Sign Up.\"</p> \n<p>Depending on your business, you can launch a Page on Facebook with a unique CTA button to the bottom right of your cover photo. Take this button into consideration when designing your cover photo, and make it clear in the photo that this is a visitor's next step.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/linkedinlearning/\">LinkedIn Learning</a> does this in a subtle way below, placing the graphic of a man on a laptop over the “Sign Up” button, drawing your eye to that call-to-action.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/linkedin-learning-facebook-page-cover.jpg?width=650&amp;name=linkedin-learning-facebook-page-cover.jpg\" alt=\"LinkedIn Learning Facebook cover photo\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Note</strong>: While it might seem like a good idea to add directional cues like an arrow to get people to click on the CTA buttons, note that those CTA buttons don't appear the same way on the mobile app. In other words, it might be confusing to mobile users if you directly integrate the cover photo design with the buttons.</p> \n<p>I'll show you how Business Pages look on mobile devices in just a minute.</p> \n<h3>7. Do right-align the objects in your cover photo.</h3> \n<p>Since your profile picture is on the left, you want to add some balance to your Facebook cover photo design by having the focus of the image be on the right.</p> \n<p>Take a look at these cover photos. Which one looks more aesthetically pleasing?</p> \n<h4 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Right-aligned focus:</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/samsung-new-facebook-cover.jpg?width=650&amp;name=samsung-new-facebook-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung's new Facebook cover photo with a pair of phones on the right\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h4 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Left-aligned focus:</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/samsung-old-facebook-cover.jpg?width=650&amp;name=samsung-old-facebook-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung's old Facebook cover with important elements on the left\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Doesn't the right-aligned cover photo look better? In Samsung’s new cover photo, the biggest design elements (the profile picture, the text, and the two phones) are evenly spaced. In Samsung's old cover photo, your attention goes immediately to the left side of the page, completely missing the name of the product on the upper-right side.</p> \n<p>Not only is adding balance a crucial element of design, but it also allows for your cover photos to be more visually effective on mobile. Which brings me to my next point ...</p> \n<h3>8. Do keep mobile users in mind.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/377808/distribution-of-facebook-users-by-device/\">Statista</a> reports that 98.3% of Facebook's user base accesses the social network from mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. That's huge — and it's exactly why it's so important to keep mobile users top-of-mind when designing your Facebook cover photo.</p> \n<p>On mobile, a much larger portion of your cover photo is blocked out. The right side is typically cut out entirely.</p> \n<p>Let's take a look at a real-life example. Below, check out what <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Cisco/\">Cisco's Facebook Page</a> looks like in a desktop browser versus on Facebook's mobile app.</p> \n<h4 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Desktop:</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cisco-desktop-facebook-cover.jpg?width=650&amp;name=cisco-desktop-facebook-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Cisco's Facebook cover on desktop \" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h4 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Mobile:</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cisco-mobile-facebook-cover.jpg?width=650&amp;name=cisco-mobile-facebook-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Cisco's Facebook cover on the mobile website\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Whereas your cover photo displays at 820 pixels wide by 312 pixels tall on desktop, it displays only 640 pixels wide by 360 pixels tall on smartphones. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/125379114252045\">Take a look at this Facebook help document</a> for more information.</p> \n<p>It’s important to note that the text in Cisco’s cover photo is completely cut off. While it looks best to right-align your visual elements, be careful not to put important content so far to the right that it gets cut off on mobile.</p> \n<h3>9. Do include a shortened link in your cover photo description that aligns with your page CTA.</h3> \n<p>If you want to use your cover photo to support a Page CTA, make sure your cover photo description also includes a text CTA and link to the same offer. This way, any time people view your cover photo directly, they can access the link.</p> \n<p>Here's this practice in action on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/adobecreativecloud\">Adobe Creative Cloud Facebook Page</a>:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/adobe-cc-facebook-cover.jpg?width=650&amp;name=adobe-cc-facebook-cover.jpg\" alt=\"Adobe Creative Cloud Facebook cover with a CTA link in the description\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Make sure you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">shorten your links and add UTM codes</a> so you can track clicks on them. Shortening and tracking features are available <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/analytics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cover-photo-size-best-practices&amp;hubs_post-cta=in%20the%20HubSpot%20Marketing%20Platform\">in Marketing Hub</a> and in tools like <a href=\"https://bitly.com/\">bitly</a>.</p> \n<p>(If you want to learn more about how to write effective call-to-action copy for your cover photo description, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/write-design-calls-to-action?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cover-photo-size-best-practices&amp;hubs_post-cta=click%20here%20to%20download%20our%20free%20ebook%20on%20creating%20compelling%20CTAs\">click here to download our free ebook on creating compelling CTAs</a>.)</p> \n<h3>10. Do pin a related post right below your Facebook cover image.</h3> \n<p>Have you ever \"pinned\" a post to your Facebook Page's Timeline? Basically, pinning a post allows you to highlight a typical Facebook post on the top of your Timeline for seven days. It's signified by a “PINNED POST” title on the top right of the post, like on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Behance\">Behance’s Page</a> below:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/behance-pinned-facebook-post.jpg?width=650&amp;name=behance-pinned-facebook-post.jpg\" alt=\"Behance pinned Facebook post announcing its new features\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>How does this relate to optimizing your Facebook cover photo? Well, if you're spending time aligning your Facebook Page CTA, your cover photo design, and your cover photo description copy, you should also make sure to post about the same thing directly to your page, and pin that post to the top of your Timeline.</p> \n<p>That way, you're giving people one very clear call-to-action when they arrive to your page (albeit in several different locations) — which should help conversions.</p> \n<p>To pin a Facebook post: Simply publish the post to Facebook, then click the three dots on the top right corner of the post and choose \"Pin to Top of Page.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pin-to-top-option.png?width=400&amp;name=pin-to-top-option.png\" alt=\"Drop-down menu with pin to top option highlighted\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>11. Do consider publishing a Facebook cover video.</h3> \n<p>You read that right. Facebook Business Pages now have the option to add a video in lieu of a static cover photo, provided they meet certain requirements.</p> \n<p>Let’s go over how you can do that.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/132465104004008\">Post a Facebook cover video</a> by first saving a video file at 820 pixels wide by 312 pixels tall to your desktop.</p> \n<p>Next, upload that video to your Page’s video library.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/facebook-upload-video.jpg?width=650&amp;name=facebook-upload-video.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook Creator Studio with a blue button that says &quot;Upload Video&quot;\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Facebook will only let you choose a video that fits its dimension requirements. The platform currently supports cover videos that are between 20 and 90 seconds long, and a minimum of 820 pixels wide by 312 pixels tall. The maximum (and recommended) size is 820 by 462 pixels with a video resolution of 1080p.</p> \n<p>After uploading the video, click \"Edit\" at the bottom right of your cover photo, and select “Choose from Videos.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/choose-from-video-option.png?width=400&amp;name=choose-from-video-option.png\" alt=\"Drop-down menu with the Choose from Videos option highlighted\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Pick the video you’ve just uploaded and reposition it so that it focuses on the element you’d like to highlight.</p> \n<p>When you click “Next,” you'll be asked to select from 10 thumbnails for your video. Choose the one that works best.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that Facebook cover videos play on a loop — once it ends, it automatically starts over if the viewer is still on your Facebook page. With that in mind, make sure whatever you post is pleasant if seen more than once. Extreme, action-packed videos might appear exhausting when played over and over.</p> \n<h3>Facebook Cover Video Examples</h3> \n<p>Cover videos are a terrific option for the video-inclined, and brands across numerous industries have already taken advantage of it to hold their visitors' attention.</p> \n<p>Here are some great cover videos to inspire you.</p> \n<h4 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">REI</h4> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">REI sells outdoor equipment for activities like camping, hiking, running, boating, and biking.

href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/25121710392270396/\">Joey from \"Friends,\"</a> we recognize the importance of giving and receiving in marketing. One of the best things to give and receive is feedback.</p> \n<p>Without feedback, we would never be able to improve. And even though it's hard, feedback is a great way to measure success.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>With a post event survey, you'll learn what attendees thought about the event, how they heard about it, and what they enjoyed most. Measuring attendee satisfaction will help you improve your event marketing and figure out what's working and what isn't.</p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.markletic.com/blog/virtual-event-statistics/\">90% of virtual event organizers</a> use surveys to measure attendee satisfaction. And <a href=\"https://welcome.bizzabo.com/post-covid-19-event-outlook-report\">80%</a> report that attendee engagement and satisfaction were KPIs used for measuring event success.</p> \n<p>To design a post event survey, you'll want to ask several types of questions -- from Yes/No, rating, to open-ended questions.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review the best post event survey questions to ask.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download free resources for executing your best event yet. [Free Kit]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. How satisfied were you with the event?</h3> \n<p>First and foremost, it's important to ask attendees about their overall satisfaction with an event. You can also ask participants to rate specific things including the venue, date, speakers, vendors, catering, quality of sessions, amount of sessions, and more.</p> \n<p>This will help you gauge specifically how well you did in each area, but also the overall satisfaction of attendees.</p> \n<p>This is probably the first and most important question that is asked on most surveys. It's a great starting point for the specific questions that follow next.</p> \n<h3>2. What was your favorite experience or moment of the event?</h3> \n<p>This question should be open-ended and let the participants describe what they liked most about the event and why they liked that moment.</p> \n<p>This will help you discover what you did right and what experiences are most valuable to your event attendees.</p> \n<p>With this information, you can get an idea about how to plan events in the future and figure out if there's anything that a majority of your attendees agree with or want to see again.</p> \n<h3>3. What could we improve on?</h3> \n<p>Again, this will be an open-ended question that lets your participants give constructive feedback. While it's hard to hear sometimes, this will help you figure out what resonates with your audiences and what doesn't.</p> \n<p>By tracking what audiences don't like, you can then improve and iterate future events so people don't have those barriers about attending your next event.</p> \n<p>The point of getting feedback isn't just to receive positive feedback, but to figure out what isn't working as well.</p> \n<h3>4. How useful was the event?</h3> \n<p>This is a great question for figuring out how actionable the event content was. Did your attendees find the information useful? Did they learn anything? Were they able to apply something they learned from your event into their work flow?</p> \n<p>Depending on the type of event you're holding, this can be a great way to figure out if people felt they got their money's worth.</p> \n<h3>5. Did the event meet your expectations?</h3> \n<p>Similar to the question above, this question measures if people got what they thought they were going to get. This answers the question, <em>\"Did my audience achieve their goal by attending this event?\"</em></p> \n<p>This should be an open-ended question that allows users to expand and explain why the event met their expectations, or why it didn't.</p> \n<h3>6. How likely would you be to attend our events in the future?</h3> \n<p>With this question, you'll learn how many people plan to keep up to date with your events. If they were generally satisfied, they'll say yes. If they weren't, they'll say no.</p> \n<p>This does a good job of figuring out how well you marketed and sold your company as an authority and trustworthy leader in the industry.</p> \n<h3>7. Would you recommend our events to a friend or colleague?</h3> \n<p>Given that people are more likely to purchase a product their friend has shared with them and the importance of customer reviews, referrals are a great way to measure how satisfied your event attendees are.</p> \n<p>Liking your event or products isn't enough -- do they like you enough to talk about you with their friends? That's the true mark of success for an event.</p> \n<h3>8. Did you have an opportunity and place to ask questions and participate?</h3> \n<p>Whether you provided online support or you had event helpers around the building, it's important to note whether attendees noticed that help and if they felt supported. When you run an event, there are bound to be questions about registration, access to certain workshops, and more.</p> \n<p>This question lets you know that your audience knew where to go if they had a question. If they didn't feel like they had a space to ask questions, then you can do better about promoting your support channels.</p> \n<h3>9. What would have made this event better?</h3> \n<p>This is a great question to crowdsource event ideas from your target audience. What do they want to see? What gaps did they see in your event from competitors? With this question, you'll be able to brainstorm ways to improve your next event.</p> \n<h3>10. Why did you attend this event?</h3> \n<p>You can use this question as a way to inform your pre event marketing. This will let you know what your audience liked about your marketing and what they expected from you. This open-ended question will give you a chance to show up for your audience and give them what they want.</p> \n<h3>11. How did you hear about this event?</h3> \n<p>Again, this is a great way to evaluate your pre event marketing. Where are attendees learning about your event? What marketing channels are working best? What marketing channels aren't working at all?</p> \n<p>This will tell you where to focus your pre event marketing for your next event and let you know places where you need to pay more attention and improve on.</p> \n<h3>12. Have you attended this event before?</h3> \n<p>A great metric to keep track of is how many repeat attendees you have coming to your regular or annual events. This will let you know how many people see the value in your event and want to continue attending.</p> \n<p>Again, this metric will let you know where to focus your marketing efforts. Do you want to increase repeat attendance? Then perhaps you need to focus on the customer experience during the event. Do you have great repeat customers but not enough new acquisitions? This will let you know that you need to focus on pre event marketing channels.</p> \n<h3>13. Would you want to attend this event again in the future?</h3> \n<p>This question, while similar to one of the above, measures how likely someone is to attend the same event in the future. Do they see value in attending this event every year? Or do they feel like they got everything they needed?</p> \n<p>Again, just like it's easier to retain customers than get new ones, it's easier to convince former participants to attend the same event again. This will reveal if your audience is excited about coming to your event in the future and then you can compare with the number of attendees who actually came back the next year.</p> \n<h3>14. Have you attended our other events before?</h3> \n<p>This question will let you know how many loyal followers you have. Are the people coming to your events in your community? Or are these new people who haven't heard of your brand before? This will help you measure where you're acquiring event attendees.</p> \n<h3>15. Were you satisfied with the amount of activities/workshops?</h3> \n<p>This is a specific question that measures satisfaction with the quantity of activities or workshops available to attendees. Essentially, was there enough for your participants to do during the event. Or was there too much? Either way, this question is important to figure out if you and your audience are aligned on what content they want.</p> \n<h3>16. Were you satisfied with the quality of the content?</h3> \n<p>Once you know how much content to offer your audience, it's time to ask about the quality of the content. Did they find the information helpful? Was this worth paying for? This will help establish trust with your audience that you can present high quality content and information that they find valuable and useful.</p> \n<p>This will also help you gauge what content your audience is interested in. If they were not satisfied with the quality, it could be because the type of content, the speakers, or the way it was presented.</p> \n<h3>17. How helpful was the staff at the event?</h3> \n<p>This is an excellent question that will help you figure out how your staff performed during this event. When attendees asked questions or used support, was the staff friendly and helpful? Or was there a staffing issue?</p> \n<p>This will help you figure out how quickly issues were resolved and if participants enjoyed their experience.</p> \n<h3>18. What was your biggest takeaway from the event?</h3> \n<p>Again, this helps you determine what people were able to learn from your event and what they got out of it. Does that align with your goals for the event? If not, this is a great way to learn what people took away from your event and what they expected.</p> \n<h3>19. How satisfied were you with the virtual experience?</h3> \n<p>If you're holding a virtual event, it's important to add post event questions that measure the success of the virtual experience.</p> \n<p>You can leave this as a rating and/or an optional open-ended question to let people explain why they were or were not satisfied with the virtual experience. Attendees might comment on the ease of navigation or the audio quality, for instance.</p> \n<h3>20. What were your favorite virtual features?</h3> \n<p>If you offered any special online features or an event app, this is the place to figure out what your attendees thought about those features. This lets you measure the success of your virtual platform overall -- did this platform provide features that your audience liked? Or were there other features they wished were available?</p> \n<h3>21. How easy to navigate was the platform for the event?</h3> \n<p>Similarly, this question is meant to measure the effectiveness of your online platform for your virtual events. If the platform isn't intuitive or easy for participants to use, then they probably won't consider coming back for your other events. This will help you gauge if improvements need to be made to the online experience.</p> \n<h3>22. How satisfied were you with the networking opportunities provided?</h3> \n<p>Lots of marketing events are meant to allow networking and a lot of people attend these events to network with other professionals. If networking is something that your audience wants from you, it's important to measure the success of your networking opportunities.</p> \n<p>This can be a rating question or an open-ended question so your attendees can elaborate on what they liked about the networking opportunities or didn't like.</p> \n<h3>23. What topics would you want to see more of at future events?</h3> \n<p>Again, it's always a good idea to learn what content your audience wants to see. How can you figure that out? Just ask.</p> \n<p>In your survey, you can ask what type of topics they're interested in learning about in the future. This will also give you new perspectives and content ideas for your next event.</p> \n<h3>24. How did this event impact your perception of our company?</h3> \n<p>This is a great question for learning how effective your brand story and messaging is at your event. Is your branding clear through your event marketing materials? How does it fit in to the larger strategic picture? This question will let you track how effective your event was in terms of branding.</p> \n<h3>25. Please share any additional comments, thoughts, suggestions for future events.</h3> \n<p>Of course, ending with an open-ended question where participants can leave feedback on any area is a best practice. You want your attendees to feel like they can tell you their overall thoughts and opinions.</p> \n<p>Hopefully the questions in your survey got your attendees thinking and they might also feel like there are other topics to cover. Since you can't ask every question you'd probably like to, this helps you figure out what's important to your audience.</p> \n<p>Post event surveys are mainly used to measure how successful an event was. These surveys will give you information that you need to improve future events.</p> \n<p>Now, post event survey questions aren't the only type of surveys you'll want to send out. You might consider also sending a pre-event survey. A pre-event survey will help you measure your current event marketing, see what got people excited about the event in the first place, and how to tailor the event to the actual attendees.</p> \n<p>Here are some examples of what that might look like.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. How did you hear about this event?</h3> \n<p>This question is great to ask either before or after an event. You could send this in a pre event survey to figure out what marketing channels are working the best. This will help you make changes to your budget and priorities when you continue marketing the event.</p> \n<h3>2. What are you most excited about?</h3> \n<p>With this pre event question, you can gauge what people are most looking forward to. Again, this will help inform your marketing budget and priorities so you can fulfill any customer expectations.</p> \n<h3>3. Have you attended this event before?</h3> \n<p>Similar to the first question, this can be asked before or after an event. The reason to find this out before an event is to see if you are getting a lot of repeat attendees or if you need to do more marketing to previous attendees.</p> \n<h3>4. Why did you choose to attend this event?</h3> \n<p>This is a great question to ask before an event because it will tell you what people are most looking forward to. This will help you prepare for an event so you can deliver on what people are expecting.</p> \n<h3>5. Do you have special accommodations you would like us to be aware of?</h3> \n<p>Logistically, this is important to know. If you don't have a lot of attendees, and accommodations need to be made, then you should be aware of what those accommodations are. If you're holding a larger event, you need to consider the type of accommodations you'll need to make for various attendees.</p> \n<h3>6. Was there any event information that was difficult for you to find?</h3> \n<p>Again, this will help you make adjustments to the pre event and registration process while it's still going on. This should help you get more registrants, ultimately, because you can pivot your strategy in real time.</p> \n<h3>7. Which social media platform do you use the most?</h3> \n<p>If you don't have a plan for how you're going to communicate with your attendees during the event, social media is a great option. But what platform would work best? You can use a pre event survey to learn what social media platforms your audience uses the most, so you can provide helpful information during your event.</p> \n<p>Conducting pre or post event surveys is an important part of measuring the success of your event team and marketing team. To do this, you can use a survey tool, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/service/customer-feedback\">HubSpot</a>. Regardless of the tool you use, remember that the goal of sending a survey is to receive both positive and constructive feedback so that you can improve your event marketing and events.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=bd0c27ef-31a6-464a-b8a8-a65cbc33e2a5&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Event Marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/bd0c27ef-31a6-464a-b8a8-a65cbc33e2a5.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpost-event-survey-questions&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1.png","linkMd5":"05fb53bb3b49354e7a6d93ec079f7494","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn68@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-30-795_6ca0430bfb5ec4d1.webp","destWidth":472,"destHeight":19,"sourceBytes":4523,"destBytes":4712,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7ad084e3-bb2d-429e-9cbd-2b09416729f1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn68@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-30-795_6ca0430bfb5ec4d1.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/bd0c27ef-31a6-464a-b8a8-a65cbc33e2a5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-56-208_31f5fd92c8680d09.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fpost-event-survey-questions&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn95@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-50-00-822_1985586e96e90a40.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425369946},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"13 Things NOT to Do on Facebook","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/9134/top-5-things-not-to-do-on-facebook.aspx","description":"<div class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\"> \n <p>These days, most businesses know they need to have a presence on Facebook. Searching for a business on Facebook and seeing they don't have a page garners the same reaction from users as searching for a business on Google and seeing they don't have a website: They just don't look legitimate.</p> \n <p>But <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5492/How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Business-Page-in-5-Simple-Steps-With-Video.aspx?_ga=2.152964976.858853954.1615321527-821602908.1615321527\">once you've created your business page</a>, navigating the waters of building a Facebook presence is another matter entirely. How often should you post? When should you post? Why are your images all pixelated, and how can you fix them?

Don't create a profile instead of a page for your business.</h3> \n <p>This may seem elementary, but you'd be surprised by how many people make this mistake. Before we get to more advanced tips, let's set the record straight: Facebook profiles are meant for people, while <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-for-business?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/9134/top-5-things-not-to-do-on-facebook.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=Pages%20are%20meant%20for%20businesses\">Facebook pages are meant for businesses</a>.</p> \n <h3>2. Don't have multiple Facebook accounts.</h3> \n <p>This advice applies to both your personal and professional activities on Facebook. You might think having more than one Facebook account helps you separate your personal life from your work, family, or school life. Let’s be real, you can’t have your great Aunt Debrah commenting on your embarrassing college photos from ten years ago causing them to resurface in people’s timelines.</p> \n <p>On a more practical note, Facebook does <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=765037383609149#:~:text=People%20can't%20have%20more,have%20more%20than%205%2C000%20fans.\">limit personal accounts</a> to 5,000 friends. After that, people will need to follow you which limits the type of engagement they can have with your content. As a fix, you might think a second or third account might be a good idea.</p> \n <p>However, there are two reasons why you wouldn't want to have two accounts. The main reason is that Facebook doesn't allow users to have more than one personal account — it's against their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms\">Terms of Service</a>. So if they find out you have two personal accounts, they'll shut them down.</p> \n <p>The second reason is that, even if it weren't against their terms, having two personal accounts would be a pain to maintain. Do you have enough content going up on both to round out your presence? Where do you draw the line between the two? Which account will you show to your friend who works in your industry? Instead of having to delineate between two parts of your life, you should instead take advantage of Facebook's robust privacy settings.</p> \n <p>On the professional side, there are no such restrictions from Facebook. You can make several pages for your business without the social network even noticing. But should you?</p> \n <p>For most businesses, we don't recommend it. You've only got so much time in the day to devote to Facebook — why spread yourself thin just to maintain several pages?</p> \n <p>Plus, there are lots of other great options for you. First, you can <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/352402648173466\">take advantage of Facebook's targeting options </a>— you don't need to pay to send updates to certain segments of your audience. Instead of creating a page for one segment of your audience, you can just post tailored content to be shown only to them.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/GlobalPagesFB.png?width=635&amp;name=GlobalPagesFB.png\" alt=\"Facebook Global Pages structure\" width=\"635\" style=\"width: 635px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/331800410323820?id=960266880806087\"><em>Image Source</em></a></span></p> \n <p>Second, if you have a huge audience that lives all over the world, you can think about <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/905034079579176\">implementing a global page</a>. If you'd like to get your global page set up, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/contact-us/\">you need to get in contact with Facebook directly</a>. (Full disclosure: You'll probably already need to have a hefty Facebook ad budget in place to make this happen.)</p> \n <p>In short: Keep it simple. Don't create more accounts and pages than you need.</p> \n <h3>3. Don't neglect the posts or comments on your page.</h3> \n <p>JetBlue's manager of customer commitment Laurie Meacham <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/jetblue-customer-service-twitter\">once told me</a>, \"We're all about the people, and being on social media is just a natural extension of that. It's no different than any other part of the airline.\"</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-09%20at%202.47.56%20PM.jpg?width=650&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-09%20at%202.47.56%20PM.jpg\" alt=\"JetBlue airplane on the tarmac\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/jetblue-customer-service-twitter\"><em> Image Source</em></a></span></p> \n <p>No matter your industry, that couldn't be more true. The point of business accounts on Facebook is to interact with your customers and prospects who are already engaging there. (And considering as of Q4 2020, Facebook had <a href=\"https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx\">just under two billion</a> active users, it's likely that they are engaging out there.)</p> \n <p>Ignoring comments and interactions is like saying to your customers, \"I don't care what you have to say.\" To avoid this, start by making sure that the desired publishing options for your Timeline are turned on. While some businesses allow users to post and leave comments on their page without review, others prefer to manually approve them, and some don't allow publishing permissions at all.</p> \n <p>Although the choice is entirely up to you, we recommend that you treat your page like a two-way street rather than a channel to broadcast your voice, and your voice only.</p> \n <p>Once you've got that straightened out, be sure to monitor the comments daily and respond when appropriate.</p> \n <p style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-templates?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F9134%2Ftop-5-things-not-to-do-on-facebook.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=flip%20through%20our%20free%20ebook&amp;_ga=2.158872895.483290293.1615432405-2017445484.1615432405\">Pro Tip: For time-saving tips, flip through our free ebook on how to monitor your social media accounts in 10 minutes a day.</a></p> \n <h3>4. Don't ignore negativity.</h3> \n <p>What if customers complain? What if they troll?</p> \n <p>You can't stop people from saying things about your brand, good or bad. What you can do is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/12-methods-for-diffusing-negativity-on-social-media\">respond respectfully</a> and with helpful information based on the comments that were shared. Responding not only shows people you're concerned about their happiness but it also shows that you're engaged and listening.</p> \n <h3>5. Don't leave the meta description as is.</h3> \n <p>When you paste a link into a new Facebook post, the metadata from that post (an image and a short description) gets pulled in automatically. But that doesn't mean you should just press \"Publish.\" Instead, add some relevant post copy like a quote or statistic from the article you're linking to.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-09%20at%202.55.27%20PM.png?width=650&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-09%20at%202.55.27%20PM.png\" alt=\"Editing a meta description and removing the URL before posting to Facebook\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing?_ga=2.264946959.1629497862.1615322760-982386085.1615322760\"><em>Image Source</em></a></span></p> \n <p>In addition to editing the post copy, you'll want to remove the URL from the box before posting. Knowing that Facebook automatically populates metadata when you paste a link, deleting the extra URL will help to reduce visual clutter without messing with the post.</p> \n <h3>6. Don't just post photos.</h3> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics#4_Consumers_Love_Seeing_Videos_on_Social_Media\">Video is now </a>consumers’ favorite type of content on Facebook. As of 2020, <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/facebook-trends\">17% of all content</a> on the platform is video content..</p> \n <p>Instead of sticking to one or two content types, experiment a little bit. Facebook is a place where you can let your brand's personality shine. Post company culture pictures and have people tag themselves. Consider having Facebook Q&amp;A discussions. Post links with one-word copy, and others with several paragraphs of copy. Find out what works best for your audience, and remember that your audience is always changing — so <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615325088154000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1j4gWpn1PZsADs87RVr4Ka\">t</a><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615325088154000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1j4gWpn1PZsADs87RVr4Ka\">est continually</a>.</p> \n <h3>7. Don't make your posts too long.</h3> \n <p>Again, testing post length is the best way to gauge what your audience likes. The optimal length of your Facebook Timeline posts will vary from company to company. For some, longer, informative Facebook posts perform better. For others, like BuzzFeed, short ones work perfectly.</p> \n <p>While it's important to experiment and see what your audience responds to best, here's what we will say: There is some solid evidence that shorter posts generate the highest engagement — in fact, a HubSpot research experiment found that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/character-count-guide\">posts with about 40 characters in length received more engagement</a> than longer posts.</p> \n <h3>8. Don't post images of just any size.</h3> \n <p>Pixelated, cluttered, or difficult-to-read visuals will not only frustrate users, but they'll also give you a bad reputation.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic?_ga=2.215891218.483290293.1615432405-2017445484.1615432405\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social-Media-Image-Sizes-2020.png?width=650&amp;name=Social-Media-Image-Sizes-2020.png\" alt=\"Social Media Image Sizes Infographic\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\"><em>Image Source</em></a></span></p> \n <p>Not only does Facebook have specific image dimensions for profile photos and cover photos, (although those are important, too), it also has ideal image dimensions for images you post on your timeline, the ones you use in sponsored posts, sidebar ads, and so on. To help you keep everything straight, bookmark this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">handy cheat sheet</a>.</p> \n <h3>9. Don't post click-bait.</h3> \n <p>When you link to a web page in a Facebook post, the platform tracks <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/dwell-time\">dwell time</a> on the page to see how much time people spend looking at it. The lesson? Don't post click-bait headlines that don't deliver on your promises.</p> \n <p>If you're looking to meet the needs of your audience on Facebook, consider posting links to clear, informative blog articles. When the headline sets the right expectation for what a user can expect from the content, it's easier for them to see the value in what you're offering and remain on the page to read the article. When it doesn't, they bounce off the page and Facebook takes note.</p> \n <h3>10. Don't assume you should only post during business hours.</h3> \n <p><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/#fb-times\">A Sprout Social study</a> found that the best times and days to post on Facebook vary by industry. However, the common theme across industries using Facebook to generate engagement is that activity on the platform hits a peak on Wednesdays and the best time to post is early afternoon.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/BTP-2020-Facebook-Heatmap-Global.png?width=650&amp;name=BTP-2020-Facebook-Heatmap-Global.png\" alt=\"Heatmap of the best times to post on Facebook by SproutSocial\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/#fb-times\"><em>Image Source</em></a></span></p> \n <p>What about weekends? Sprout Social also noted that Sundays are, across the board, the worst days to publish content to Facebook. In summary, stick with publishing posts during the middle of the week, right before engagement and activity wane heading into the weekend.</p> \n <h3>11. Don't post too often (but do post regularly.)</h3> \n <p>Yes, you should post regularly to keep your audience engaged, show them you're present and listening, and answer their questions and concerns.</p> \n <p>However, what you don't want to do is overwhelm them with tons and tons of posts. We even ran a few experiments to figure out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-frequently-should-i-publish-on-social-media\">how often businesses should post on Facebook</a>. Our research included posting frequency benchmarks by industry and company size based on Facebook data from thousands of our customers.</p> \n <p>What we found was this: Companies that are selective about what they publish — i.e. they take the time to craft a smaller number of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/24422/the-ultimate-facebook-marketing-cheat-sheet.aspx\">high-quality Facebook posts</a> instead of a lot of Facebook posts — performed best.</p> \n <h3>12. Don't forget to experiment with targeting and ads.</h3> \n <p>As a result of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-declining-organic-reach\">recent decline in organic reach on Facebook</a>, many companies are turning to Facebook advertising to capture the attention of a more qualified audience. With <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-paid-ad-checklist\">Facebook advertising</a>, you can target people who've visited your website, used your app, or signed up for an email list. You can also target similar or \"Lookalike\" audiences or set up campaigns aimed at getting likes on your page.</p> \n <p>But you can't just throw money at Facebook advertising and expect everything to work. It'll only work if you're smart about it — which means experimenting and tweaking your advertising plan to see what works.</p> \n <p>Where should you start? We created <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/guide-social-media-advertising?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/9134/top-5-things-not-to-do-on-facebook.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=this%20step-by-step%20guide%20to%20Facebook%20advertising\">this step-by-step guide to digital advertising</a> to help marketers learn how to create successful Facebook ads. And if you want to check out examples of real Facebook ads that have worked really well for brands, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33319/10-Examples-of-Facebook-Ads-That-Actually-Work-And-Why.aspx\">check out this blog post</a>.</p> \n <h3>13. Don't forget which account you're posting from.</h3> \n <p>The Facebook News Feed looks basically the same whether you're logged in to your personal account or your company's account, making it all too easy for Page administrators to forget which one they're posting from. You wouldn't want to respond to commenters from your personal account when you meant to respond from your business account or vice versa.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pamelumps-hubspot-twitter-fail-cropped.png?width=418&amp;name=pamelumps-hubspot-twitter-fail-cropped.png\" alt=\"Pam Bump baby bump photo on HubSpot's Twitter account\" width=\"418\" style=\"width: 418px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/15-minutes-social-media-shame?__hstc=233546881.1d7ce66fb7438b7409cfa0488f21afc4.1615322760771.1615322760771.1615322760771.1&amp;__hssc=233546881.1.1615322760772&amp;__hsfp=1304563561&amp;_ga=2.260825101.1629497862.1615322760-982386085.1615322760\"><em>Image Source</em></a></span></p> \n <p>However, the truth is sometimes accidents happen. In fact, one of my colleagues accidentally posted a picture of her baby bump from HubSpot's Twitter account. While it was a harmless mistake, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/15-minutes-social-media-shame\">she wrote up a blog article</a> to provide businesses with the advice they need to overcome a social media slip-up.</p> \n <h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Do This Not That On Facebook</h2> \n <p>Facebook is one of the longest-standing social media platforms that businesses rely on to reach their audiences. And it makes sense — more than a third of the people on earth use Facebook. With such a large audience watching for the latest and greatest social content to connect with, you must be certain that you put your best foot forward when publishing posts. I hope this list gives you more than enough ideas for what not to do on Facebook so you aren’t caught off guard by even the wildest faux pas.</p> \n <p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in June 2015 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n <p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5fc2491c-cd3c-4adb-ad3c-b082ce2793d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5fc2491c-cd3c-4adb-ad3c-b082ce2793d3.png\"></a></p> \n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F9134%2Ftop-5-things-not-to-do-on-facebook.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3dc1dfd9-2cb4-4498-8c57-19dbb5671820.png","linkMd5":"fb42b8624bcde57993af648dc91deb2a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn47@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-30-576_ebc276d76ef14084.webp","destWidth":517,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6135,"destBytes":8328,"author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich Cox)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3dc1dfd9-2cb4-4498-8c57-19dbb5671820.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn47@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-30-576_ebc276d76ef14084.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/GlobalPagesFB.png?width=635&name=GlobalPagesFB.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-336_080f7a7b83eadf7c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-09%20at%202.47.56%20PM.jpg?width=650&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-09%20at%202.47.56%20PM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-58-965_ff4033cd3e5025a1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-09%20at%202.55.27%20PM.png?width=650&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-09%20at%202.55.27%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn28@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-540_aedcef231d50459a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Social-Media-Image-Sizes-2020.png?width=650&name=Social-Media-Image-Sizes-2020.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn23@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-57-915_4e287c5146bc4856.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/BTP-2020-Facebook-Heatmap-Global.png?width=650&name=BTP-2020-Facebook-Heatmap-Global.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn10@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-59-500_bdfe53d7a4c467a8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pamelumps-hubspot-twitter-fail-cropped.png?width=418&name=pamelumps-hubspot-twitter-fail-cropped.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-54-084_ea7829971c89c990.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5fc2491c-cd3c-4adb-ad3c-b082ce2793d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn80@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-59-302_73ab6e288063122a.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F9134%2Ftop-5-things-not-to-do-on-facebook.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-00-860_8674c56062c20796.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370023},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"How Primary Colors Help HubSpot Build a CRM That Customers Love","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/primary-colors-help-build-hubspot-crm","description":"<p>At HubSpot, customer experience comes first. Always.</p>  \n<p>Whether our marketing team is selecting a time at which to send an email or our web team team is choosing the size and location of a button on our homepage, the question we always go back to is: “Will this be a good experience for our customers?”</p> \n<p>As HubSpot's Chief Product Officer, this customer-first principle is my guiding light when it comes to product development. And it's the reason why we don't <em>buy</em>&nbsp;technology when we want to deliver a new product to our customers. We <em>build</em>&nbsp;it.</p> \n<p>This build-first approach is becoming increasingly rare in our industry. Traditional SaaS companies tend to acquire other companies when they want to significantly expand their product offerings or quickly increase their customer base. This can sometimes lead to a quick uptick in revenue — after all, when a company buys another, it acquires all of its customers — but it's often a very negative experience for the customer.</p> \n<p>When two completely different systems are cobbled together after an acquisition, the burden of making them work together is foisted onto the customer. Each company probably took a completely different approach to product development, resulting in different underlying technology, different processes, and different user interfaces.</p> \n<p>Reconciling these differences without causing friction for customers is an almost impossible task. And when SaaS companies apply this approach over time, the friction accrues, technical debt goes through the roof, and the customer experience steadily degrades as a result.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=76520ae5-1a3b-4055-9e8e-95e150b90965&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Free Download: How to Create a Style Guide [+ Free Templates]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/76520ae5-1a3b-4055-9e8e-95e150b90965.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>This approach solves for the company implementing it, not the customers it's supposed to serve. That's why we do things differently at HubSpot. After all, it isn't like us to follow the crowd.</p> \n<p>When most companies were doubling down on the old outbound playbook, we championed inbound approaches instead. When most businesses were wondering whether remote work could ever work, we saw the percentage of HubSpotters working from home<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/careers-blog/future-of-work-hybrid\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/careers-blog/future-of-work-hybrid?_ga=2.212458068.1513525045.1615841638-356781811.1615841638\">hit double digits</a>&nbsp;long before 2020 forced everyone's hand. And while our industry was still furiously focused on funnels, we embraced <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel?_ga=2.212458068.1513525045.1615841638-356781811.1615841638\">the flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p>We're different. It's in HubSpot's DNA. It's even reflected in our company mission: we help organizations grow better. Not grow according to the status quo. Not grow by adhering to age-old playbooks. Grow better.</p> \n<p>Just as we believe there's a better way to <em>grow</em>, we also believe there's a better way to <em>build</em>. That's where the Primary Colors come in.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Meet the Primary Colors</h2> \n<p>Our approach to product development is simple, and it allows us to create multiplicative benefits for customers that no other CRM platform offers. We focus on five foundational elements that span all of our products, and we work at improving each one of them, all of the time. Those elements are: Automation, Content, Data, Messaging, and Reporting. We call them “Primary Colors.”</p> \n<p>Every one&nbsp;of our Hubs – CMS Hub, Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and Service Hub&nbsp;– comprises a different blend of the five Primary Colors, meaning that every product on our platform is built on the same underlying foundation.</p> \n<p>So when the product team shows up to work every day, the question we ask ourselves isn't “Which Hub or feature will we work on today?” It's: “Which Primary Color will we enhance?”</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Primary%20Colors%20Help%20HubSpot%20Build%20a%20CRM%20That%20Customers%20Love.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20Primary%20Colors%20Help%20HubSpot%20Build%20a%20CRM%20That%20Customers%20Love.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p>As a result, when we add value to one area of HubSpot, value is automatically added across the entire CRM platform. And that allows us to deliver a steady stream of delight to all of our customers on an ongoing basis.</p> \n<p>Here are three ways in which this approach allows us to offer unique value to our customers in the crowded CRM market:</p> \n<h3><strong>1</strong><strong>. Continuous improvement across the platform.</strong></h3> \n<p><em>“HubSpot is the perfect, always-improving </em><em>marketing</em><em>&nbsp;software” – </em><em><a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/hubspot-sales-hub/reviews/hubspot-sales-hub-review-4530313\">review on G2</a></em></p> \n<p>The same five Primary Colors go into building each HubSpot product, so when we improve one Primary Color, we improve every Hub. And every customer of every HubSpot product sees an immediate benefit, whatever part of the platform they use.</p> \n<p>For instance, when we invest in making Reporting in Sales Hub more robust, this robustness ripples out to every Reporting tool across the HubSpot CRM platform. So Marketing Hub customers who use our Reporting tools benefit, Service Hub customers who use our Reporting tools benefit, as do CMS Hub customers — all because we invested in improving just one Primary Color.</p> \n<h3><strong>2</strong><strong>. Easy adoption of new products.</strong></h3> \n<p><em>“We quickly adopted the Sales Hub Pro and Marketing Enterprise for our growing needs. It has been one of the best decisions we have made” – </em><em><a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/hubspot-sales-hub/reviews/hubspot-sales-hub-review-4530313\">review on G2</a></em></p> \n<p>Since all of our Hubs are built on the same Primary Color foundation, our customers can expect a familiar, fast, and friendly user experience every time they add a new feature or product to their tech stack. This means customers can enjoy the benefits of each new addition right away, with no time lost to training, integration, or new-system frustration.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>As HubSpot's co-founder, Dharmesh Shah, puts it: \"Our customers' time-to-joy is reduced.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Once a customer learns how to use Automation in, say, Marketing Hub, they instantly know how Automation works in all of HubSpot's products across the CRM platform. So as their company scales and adds new products, features, and integrations to their tech stack, they can expect consistency, not complexity.</p> \n<p>They don't have to relearn how Messaging works or how Data is stored every time they add a new Hub — something they would likely have to do if they were working with a system that had been cobbled together through acquisitions or if they use different tools for different customer-facing teams.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. </strong><strong>The ability to run an entire business on a single platform.</strong></h3> \n<p><em>“I can manage the website, CRM, email marketing and all other efforts in one single place. This allows me to have a single location for all my data Reporting and have a single source of truth” – </em><em><a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/hubspot-marketing-hub/reviews/hubspot-marketing-hub-review-4530415\">review on G2</a></em></p> \n<p>With HubSpot, fast-growing companies can run their whole business on a single system, because HubSpot offers the same insights and power to marketers, salespeople, and service professionals alike.</p> \n<p>And when all teams at a company are working out of the same familiar system, silos crumble, data is centralized, and information flows freely. The whole team has access to the same valuable insights, allowing them to understand their customers better and deliver a seamless experience across every touchpoint.</p> \n<p>For example, when a company's marketing team uses Marketing Hub and its sales team uses Sales Hub, both teams gain access to the same customer data in a centralized CRM.&nbsp;And because both Hubs offer identical functionality for recording and storing Data, it becomes equally easy for each team to access not only the data they generate, but also Data the other team generates.</p> \n<p>This gives marketers and salespeople a holistic view of the customer, enabling each of them to tailor their tactics and personalize their outreach. If a prospect is showing particular interest in marketing content about a certain feature, the sales team can see this information in the shared CRM and will know to focus on that feature on their next call with the prospect.</p> \n<p>They don't need to wait on a marketing report or rely on an impersonal script – they can personalize their outreach and hone in on a prospect's specific areas of interest, all as a result of both Hubs being built on the same foundation.</p> \n<h3><strong>Building Differently, Growing Better</strong></h3> \n<p>The challenges that companies face in 2021 are new, so our approach to building our products needs to be new as well. With the rise of the hybrid workplace, we're all finding our work lives intersecting our home and family lives, too.

I'm willing to bet you've already heard about the importance of Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter — and if you use all three as part of your lead generation strategy, you might think you're all set.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>However, if you're not using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/23454/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-mastering-linkedin.aspx?_ga=2.251297604.393759301.1614202868-613488095.1614202868\">LinkedIn</a> you could be missing out on a major opportunity to grow both brand recognition and revenue, especially if you’re a B2B business. In fact, studies have shown that LinkedIn is the <a href=\"https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2020_B2B_Research_Final.pdf\">top paid and organic social channel</a> for B2B businesses, and 82% of B2B marketers report finding the <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/marketing-solutions/cx/2020/pdfs/read-me-drive-more-leads-fa.pdf\">greatest success on the platform</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These statistics make sense, especially if we consider platform-specific demographics. The average <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-for-business-guide?_ga=2.58489960.393759301.1614202868-613488095.1614202868\">Instagram</a> user scrolls through their feed, like photos of their friends, watches their favorite celebrity’s Story, and occasionally uses the platform to find and purchase products.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alternatively, the average LinkedIn user is on the site <em>specifically</em> for professionally-geared content. They're already seeking out information to help grow their businesses, so you should meet them where they are.</p> \n<p>Of course, it's easier said than done. Without a clear strategy in mind, the task of lead generation on LinkedIn can feel challenging. Justin Shriber, Vice President of Marketing at LinkedIn, was interviewed as part of HubSpot's campaign, \"<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/behind-the-screens?utm_source=hubspot&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=behind-the-screens&amp;utm_content=thought-leadership&amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/generate-leads-on-linkedin&amp;hubs_post-cta=Advertising%2C%20a%20Look%20Behind%20the%20Screens&amp;_ga=2.217725908.393759301.1614202868-613488095.1614202868\">Advertising, a Look Behind the Screens</a>.” Take a look at the full interview series <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/behind-the-screens?utm_source=hubspot&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=behind-the-screens&amp;utm_content=thought-leadership&amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/generate-leads-on-linkedin&amp;hubs_post-cta=here&amp;_ga=2.58489960.393759301.1614202868-613488095.1614202868\">here</a>, or keep reading to learn some of his key insights, as well as additional tips on how to use LinkedIn for lead generation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Get the essential guide to using LinkedIn for marketing and professional  networking.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>LinkedIn Lead Generation Strategy</h2> \n<p>As a refresher, lead generation refers to all of the activities and strategies you use to attract potential customers. Generating leads is important because, with nurturing, potential customers can become paying customers that use your products and drive revenue.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>LinkedIn’s typical audience comprises professional decision-makers with purchasing power, helping you speak directly to the potential customers that can become paying customers. Below, we’ll discuss how you can use LinkedIn for lead generation.</p> \n<h3>1. Make sure your executives have a strong LinkedIn presence.</h3> \n<p>When you're first getting started on LinkedIn, it can be tricky to know how to dedicate your initial efforts. Should you create a compelling <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-company-pages?_ga=2.251297604.393759301.1614202868-613488095.1614202868\">LinkedIn Page</a> and immediately begin posting content to your business's feed? Or should you start by posting all your job openings to attract new talent?</p> \n<p>Shriber suggests another strategy: \"We definitely want to fuel the growth of small businesses that have aspirations to grow to become larger, and we put together a playbook that allows them to do that. The playbook always starts with the individual LinkedIn profiles of the employees at the company, and in particular, the executives at the company.\"</p> \n<blockquote>\n \"[Executives are] trendsetters. They can make statements about what they stand for, and in many cases, develop a strong following in relatively short order.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>Consider the leaders at your company and their current LinkedIn presence. Could they contribute more thoughtfully to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164/linkedin-groups-membership-overview\">LinkedIn groups</a> within your industry or post more often to their feeds? More likely than not, your executives could be doing more to grow their LinkedIn following.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's take a look at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/salliekrawcheck/detail/recent-activity/shares/\">Sallie Krawcheck's</a>, CEO and co-founder of Ellevest, LinkedIn activity:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Generate%20Leads%20on%20LinkedIn,%20According%20to%20LinkedIns%20VP%20of%20Marketing-1.png\" alt=\"linkedin personal profile page example\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">\n</div> \n<p>Krawcheck uses LinkedIn wisely, leveraging the platform to promote content from her own investment company while also liking or sharing other relevant financial content geared towards women. Ultimately, Krawcheck uses LinkedIn to build a personal brand and help her followers find valuable content related to investing and women in finance. Ideally, your executives should be doing the same.</p> \n<h3>2. Create a powerful LinkedIn Page for your business.</h3> \n<p>Once you've ensured your own executives have a strong LinkedIn presence, it's time to cultivate an impressive page.</p> \n<p>You'll want to ensure your page is active, with thought-provoking content and contributions to conversations already happening on LinkedIn.</p> \n<p>Shriber notes —&nbsp;\"Once you've got a strategy related to your executives and their presence on LinkedIn, step two is to think about the presence of your company on LinkedIn. We have a product called <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/linkedin-news/2018/introducing-the-new-linkedin-pages\">LinkedIn Pages</a>, which has been incredibly powerful for businesses that want to establish their place in the world's professional community.\"</p> \n<blockquote>\n \"[LinkedIn Pages is] a free product,\" Shriber adds, \"and really, at the end of the day, it's a place for you to stage the content that you have to offer, and really promote all of the benefits that you have for people that want to follow you.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>He continues, \"So, when you come to a good LinkedIn Page, you'll find information about what the company does, but beyond that, some of the thought leadership that's happening. There will be video content as well as the written word, commentary from executives, but also in many cases, information that's curated from other sources. It doesn't just need to be from the marketing group or from an internal source.\"</p> \n<h3>3. Post relevant content and updates.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>To ensure your LinkedIn page and profile are strong, consider posting various content types, including <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83106/sharing-a-video-on-linkedin-faq\">video</a>. Featuring this industry-relevant content can help you position yourself as a knowledgeable source and establish relevance and credibility with potential customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When you’re recognized as an insightful, valuable source, you’ll begin to develop connections with like-minded professionals that fit your ideal customer profile. If you post often, you’ll become a regular on their feed, and familiarity makes it easier to initiate further conversations.</p> \n<p>If you assume that the connections you have on LinkedIn are professionals within your industry, they can expose you to new audiences with the content you post. When your connections click ‘Like’ on a post you’ve made, it may show up on the feed of a new lead. This lead will see that your shared connection has liked your post, vouching for your credibility and authority, and possibly prompting them to send a request to connect.</p> \n<p>To ensure that you’re creating content that people want to see, follow your page analytics to figure out what resonates with them the most and create accordingly.</p> \n<h3>4. Join LinkedIn groups your clients and customers are in.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>LinkedIn, at its core, is a social platform like any other. Just as you can on Facebook, users can create groups centered around industry-relevant interests, and you should join these groups and have conversations with other professionals.</p> \n<p>You can post content and updates to encourage discussions about relevant topics or simply talk about the services you offer. If you’ve joined groups wisely, your potential customers can see what you say and begin to recognize you as a source of valuable information.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You can also use groups to learn more about your audience. If members are active, learn from what they say and discover common industry pain points and how leads want these issues addressed. Use this information to your advantage, and create hyper-targeted value propositions when you reach out that speak directly to your customer’s needs.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>5. Use paid products to ensure your content reaches your intended audience.</h3> \n<p>Businesses with small marketing budgets may be wary of putting money behind paid campaigns on LinkedIn. They often ask — We have a small marketing budget, and we want to use it wisely. Where should we spend it? Given that LinkedIn is the top paid and organic channel for B2B businesses, spending your money on the platform would be worth your while.&nbsp;</p> \n<blockquote>\n Shriber told me, \"Once you've built that strong LinkedIn Page, companies tend to realize that that audience that's consuming information is incredibly valuable, and it's different than what they're finding on other platforms.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>He adds, \"We have a series of paid products that you can then move into that allow you to insert content into the LinkedIn feed. Now you've got a series of followers or you've got a set of targeted members that you care about. Suddenly, they're seeing your content appear in the feed itself and there are some really rich ways to turn that engagement into actual activity.\"</p> \n<p>While LinkedIn has a native ads management service, you can also use HubSpot’s <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ads?_ga=2.256464713.393759301.1614202868-613488095.1614202868\">ads management tool</a> to create, organize, and execute advertising campaigns on LinkedIn. You’ll also get access to high-quality reports that explain ad performance, helping you optimize a strategy to meet your customers’ needs.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Ensure you have strong sales and marketing alignment.</h3> \n<p>You're likely all too familiar with the recent shift in consumer buying behavior. Nowadays, customers are researching online ahead of time and typically use marketing content to inform their purchasing decisions before even reaching out to a sales rep.</p> \n<p>Shriber describes the shift like this: \"What you're seeing now, is consumers are becoming more savvy about learning about products and services that they need and progressing deep into the sales process before they reach out, raise their hand, and say that they need help.\"</p> \n<p>He adds, \"It's becoming incumbent upon marketing to really meet the needs of customers that are investigating and exploring, and then seamlessly handing that off to salespeople so sales has context on the journey customers have already traveled.\"</p> \n<blockquote>\n \"I've got a number of customers that have come to me and said, my salespeople know my target customers better than my marketing group. They've been in the business for 20 years, and they know all the key people, so I'm going to use them to create awareness, build a brand in a way that historically has been reserved for marketing.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>On the flip side, of course, marketers play a heavier role in closing a deal. Shriber told me, \"Imagine, for example, that you're procurement and you're trying to negotiate a contract. Historically, that's been the domain of a sales professional, but today, savvy marketers know that that's where you are in the sales process.\"</p> \n<p>Shriber adds, \"They're able to target that procurement person, send in some relevant content related to validation of the solution, why it's valuable, what other customers are saying about it, and all of a sudden, that marketer has played a key role in getting the deal closed.\"</p> \n<p>All of which is to say — it's critical you align your sales and marketing teams since they play equally valuable parts in finding prospects and closing deals, and they overlap more heavily now than ever before.</p> \n<p>To figure out strategies for better aligning your sales and marketing departments, take a look at this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/sales-and-marketing?_ga=2.256464713.393759301.1614202868-613488095.1614202868\">Ultimate Guide to Sales and Marketing</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. Leverage connections with current customers and clients.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>LinkedIn’s main draw is networking, and you should use this feature to your advantage for lead generation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Connect with current customers and clients on LinkedIn and learn from who their industry connections are, as they may be relevant to you as well. If you have relationships with existing clients you connect with, ask for referrals, references, or simply learn how to get in contact with a connection they have that matches your customer profile.</p> \n<p>As LinkedIn is a professional network, such requests are less pushy, spammy, and salesesque than cold calling someone after finding their number online. Leads can receive your request to connect, browse your profile, and see your shared connection as a guarantee of trust.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In addition, when you connect with new leads, you’re using warm outreach. This means that you already know a bit about them and can immediately make propositions that relate to their interests, providing value to them off the bat.</p> \n<h3>8. Maintain a consistent presence on the platform.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Just like all of your other social media sites, LinkedIn requires consistency. If you post an article once a week and then log out, you’re not establishing yourself as a consistent presence with your connections. You also want to communicate consistently with your leads. Disappearing in the middle of a conversation is not a good look and does the opposite of furthering their interest in doing business with you.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As mentioned above, use platform analytics to learn about your audience’s interests, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-time-post-on-linkedin?_ga=2.256464713.393759301.1614202868-613488095.1614202868\">when your posts get the most traction</a>, and create a strategy that will keep you consistently present and visible on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>LinkedIn Can Help You Attract Your Ideal Customers</h2> \n<p>Ultimately, if you aren't using LinkedIn or using it often enough, you're likely missing out on significant opportunities to grow your business.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Shriber told me, \"We've really tried to think through the full spectrum of what you might care about, from building a brand to generating leads, whether you're a small business or a large enterprise — and we built playbooks that address you where you are, and help you to get where you're going.\"</p> \n<p>Learn more from Justin Shriber and other advertising leaders by accessing an <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/behind-the-screens?utm_source=hubspot&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=behind-the-screens&amp;utm_content=thought-leadership&amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/generate-leads-on-linkedin&amp;hubs_post-cta=exclusive%20interview%20series%20with%20LinkedIn%2C%20Google%2C%20and%20Facebook&amp;_ga=2.256464713.393759301.1614202868-613488095.1614202868\">exclusive interview series with LinkedIn, Google, and Facebook</a>.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b612a0dc-34ea-4e79-908b-28874def7e5a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"How to Use LinkedIn for Business and Marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b612a0dc-34ea-4e79-908b-28874def7e5a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgenerate-leads-on-linkedin&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe.png","linkMd5":"20b35b471d2cf17c3b6a94077f84234b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-30-537_a5901e98cb60ea43.webp","destWidth":754,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7622,"destBytes":12106,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-30-537_a5901e98cb60ea43.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/How%20to%20Generate%20Leads%20on%20LinkedIn,%20According%20to%20LinkedIns%20VP%20of%20Marketing-1.png":null,"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b612a0dc-34ea-4e79-908b-28874def7e5a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-01-107_85ce3eb0b1d04252.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgenerate-leads-on-linkedin&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn97@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-02-401_dd80895da0486aa1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370060},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"How Much Should Your Marketing Team Budget for 2021?

For instance, while 73% of companies invested in website optimization in 2020, only 20% invested in machine learning and automation.</p> \n<p>Web optimization, digital media and search, and digital marketing were the <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/chief-marketing-officer/topics/marketing.html\">top three priorities for companies</a> when determining budget allocation in 2020 — with roughly 73%, 65%, and 57% of companies (respectively) investing in each.</p> \n<p>These <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-predictions-experts\">trends are predicted to continue</a> into 2021 and beyond.</p> \n<p>However, the data we've reported so far pertains to marketing budget percentage of overall company budget — but what about marketing budget as it pertains to overall company <em>revenue? </em>Let's dive into that, next.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Marketing Budget Percentage of Revenue</h2> \n<p>The U.S. Small Business Administration recommends small businesses (businesses with revenue less than 5 million) allocate between <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/taxonomy/term/15051\">7% and 8% of total revenue to marketing</a>&nbsp;— assuming your business has margins in the range of 10-12 percent.</p> \n<p>The amount of revenue businesses allocate to marketing has increased steadily over the past 10 years, with average <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/chief-marketing-officer/topics/marketing.html\">marketing percentage of revenue landing around 13% in 2021</a>, compared to just <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/chief-marketing-officer/topics/marketing.html\">8% back in 2011</a>.</p> \n<p>B2B Product industries allocate, on average, roughly <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/chief-marketing-officer/topics/marketing.html\">10% of revenue to marketing</a>, which is similar to B2C Services (10.1%). B2B Services and B2C Product allocate <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/chief-marketing-officer/topics/marketing.html\">higher numbers of 15% and 18%</a>, respectively, of total revenue.</p> \n<p>Of course, decisions related to marketing budget allocation remain largely industry-specific. To determine more accurate, industry-specific insights, let's explore marketing budgets by industry, next.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Marketing Budget Percentage by Industry [2021 Data]</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/chief-marketing-officer/articles/cmo-survey.html\">Deloitte's 2020 CMO Survey</a>&nbsp;found B2B (product-focused) companies attribute roughly 9.4% of overall budget to marketing efforts, while B2B (services-focused) companies attribute 11.4%.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, if you work for a B2C (product-focused) company, Deloitte reports 15.9% of overall budget is the average given to marketing teams — for B2C (service-focused) companies, this is closer to 12%.</p> \n<p>Of course, the type of business you work at (B2B or B2C) is only one factor when determining marketing budget percentage. Industry is a major factor, as well.</p> \n<p>For instance, marketing expenses are highest in the Education sector at 19.4% of total budget — and they're lowest in the Energy industry, at roughly 4%.</p> \n<p>If you work in the healthcare industry, you might expect to see a marketing budget around 7% of total budget.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, consulting services typically attribute 13%. Lastly, technlogy/software platforms attribute 12% of total company budget to marketing.</p> \n<p>If you're unsure how to manage your marketing budget, you're in luck.

To draw its target audience in, create content that resonates with them and build a connection, i.e.: social media presence.</p> \n<p>Let's dive into what social media presence is and how to build it.</p> \n<p>For brands, there's no single metric tied to social media presence. However, it can translate to a high engagement rate, a growing brand awareness, and a positive brand perception.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalwu\">Krystal Wu</a>, social media community manager at HubSpot, highlights that visibility and presence are different.</p> \n<p>\"A social media channel has no presence if there is no audience who values it. Use social media to listen, monitor, and analyze your audience behavior,\" said Wu. \"That information will allow you to gain consumer feedback, improve new or existing relationships, and expand your brand's social presence.\"</p> \n<p>So, while visibility comes with having a strong presence, it's not the measure of success – resonance is.</p> \n<h2>Importance of Social Media Presence</h2> \n<p>Having a social media presence goes beyond having a profile with content. It means creating content tailored to the interests and needs of your target audience.</p> \n<p>Doing so builds trust, and once you have that, you're one step closer to earning your audience's business.</p> \n<p>Having a strong social media presence also allows you to better understand your audience.</p> \n<p>\"While there are a ton of growth 'hacks' to boost a brand's social presence, I think the greatest value goes back to knowing your audience,\" said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariel-boswell/\">Ariel Boswell</a>, social media analyst at HubSpot. \"The ability to know your audience so deeply to where you understand what captivates their attention and pair that with content that provides value in that moment is a recipe for success.\"</p> \n<p>Connecting with your community on this level helps you get to the core of their needs so you can better serve them with your product or service.</p> \n<h2>How To Increase Social Media Presence</h2> \n<h3>1. Engage your audience.</h3> \n<p>Social media is arguably the closest contact you have with consumers on a regular basis. Within a few hours after publishing, you can gauge your audience's response and learn something new with every post.</p> \n<p>Take it one step further by creating opportunities for your followers to connect with your brand on a deeper level. This can be inviting them to participate in discussions in the comment section, answering fun \"This or That\" quizzes, creating polls, answering Q&amp;As and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-live-download\">doing </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-live-download\">live videos</a>.</p> \n<p>You can gain invaluable insight into your audience's likes, dislikes, challenges and concerns through these activities. This will then arm you to create targeted campaigns that convert.</p> \n<h3>2. Manage your community.</h3> \n<p>Having a social media account without community management is like having a car that is always nearing empty (a.k.a my car in college). You won't make it very far.</p> \n<p>Community management is a major driver in building your social media presence. In fact, Wu says it's fundamental to a brand's growth, its image, and social success.</p> \n<p>\"Being proactive by reaching out to other brands, fans, customers and followers in similar industries really helps build that community around your brand,\" said Wu. \"People start to recognize the name, the types of conversations that brand is having and its level of knowledge in that specific market.\"</p> \n<p>This aspect of social media management requires brands to be proactive and seek out conversations that will draw audiences in.</p> \n<p>Think of it like going to a party. You showed up, but now you'll have to talk to a few people and start making some friends.</p> \n<p>\"Without doing these proactive pushes, just putting a brand on social and not tying in the community efforts won't get it very far,\" Wu added. \"Community management is the center of the customer journey, like the flywheel model, crafting the relationship between the brand and customer.\"</p> \n<h3>3. Stay active and be consistent.</h3> \n<p>Have you ever scrolled past a brand and done a double take, and thought \"<em>Oh you! I forgot you even existed.</em>\" No brand wants that kind of reaction.</p> \n<p>Social media is a game of visibility and with brands. It's often out of sight, out of mind, so it's crucial that you are active on your social media platforms and post consistently.</p> \n<p>Many brands start off strong, posting everyday and then less and less until they're only posting once in a while.</p> \n<p>\"Success doesn't usually happen on your first, second or even third try. Social media is playing the long game and once brands realize that it doesn't usually blow up overnight, that's when consistency comes into play,\" said Wu. \"In social, you need to test, experiment, analyze, and even take risks to learn what strategy your brand should move forward with to connect and build an audience.\"</p> \n<p>If you find yourself running out of content or ideas, start with a lower posting cadence and limit the platforms on which you are active. It's also helpful to plan out your content at least a month ahead of time and have your creative assets ready so that you're never left scrambling.</p> \n<h3>4. Understand that it's a long game.</h3> \n<p>A lot of the mistakes brands make on social media stem from a desire to grow quickly.</p> \n<p>You get impatient and want to generate results fast. So, you might try the social version of get-rich-quick schemes to build your following. However, those strategies are only valuable on the surface.</p> \n<p>But you soon realize that they don't actually bring you closer to meeting your goals and connecting with your audience.</p> \n<p>\"Don't take the 'easy' way out by paying for views and followers,\" Wu said, \"because you'll eventually run into a wall where you have this audience but no engagement, no one converting or signing up for your content.\"</p> \n<p>Organic growth is the most authentic and effective way of building a sustainable presence. Why? Because you'll be getting real data from your target audience and that will help you tailor your approach to serve them better.</p> \n<h3>5. Stick to your brand voice and aesthetic.</h3> \n<p>Consistency isn't only about your posting schedule, it also encompasses your brand as a whole.</p> \n<p>Your brand identity should be the same across all marketing channels. It can be confusing for consumers to understand your brand if its messaging and identity seems to switch from one day to the next. How can your audience connect to something they can't figure out?</p> \n<p>So, once you design your brand strategy, make sure it aligns with your social media strategy.</p> \n<h3>6. Track your competitors.</h3> \n<p>Your competitors are like your neighbors. It's fine to be a little nosy and see what they're up to from time to time.</p> \n<p>\"When I think of conducting a competitive analysis I go in with the expectation to be both challenged and inspired,\" said Boswell. \"The biggest thing you should look for when evaluating a competitor's social media presence is how they are positioning themselves in the market and how shared or overlapped audiences are perceiving their efforts.\"</p> \n<p>While it's good to be aware of your competitive landscape, Boswell emphasizes that it shouldn't influence your entire social strategy. What works well for one brand may not be suitable for yours, so be selective about what ideas you're adapting.</p> \n<h3>7. Leverage trends and buzzy content.</h3> \n<p>Trends make social media go round.</p> \n<p>Every few weeks or even days, there's a new trend making its way around platforms like Twitter and TikTok. Brands often ask themselves two questions: \"<em>Should we join in on this? </em>\" and \"<em>How do we make this our own? </em>\"</p> \n<p>Trends can boost your brand awareness and help you generate bursts of traffic. It's an opportunity to think outside of the box and join in on something you already know your audience will enjoy.</p> \n<p>When in doubt, always refer back to your brand strategy. Is this in alignment with your overall brand identity and messaging? If not, treat it like a school dance you're chaperoning and sit it out.</p> \n<h3>8. Adjust your posts based on current events.</h3> \n<p>These days, consumers hold brands to a higher standard.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/brands-creating-change/\">Companies are expected to be more vocal about social issues </a>and be more transparent on their stance. This approach should also be reflected in your social media strategy during times of social unrest, cultural events and news.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, it can be as simple as not posting anything for the day and pausing paid social ads. In other cases, it can require releasing a statement.</p> \n<p>In any case, you have to be flexible and work quickly to determine how to proceed.</p> \n<h3>9. Invest in high-quality creative assets.</h3> \n<p>Social media is one of the main sources of brand discovery.</p> \n<p>Your target persona is scrolling through Instagram, your post shows up and it garners their interest. What's one of the first things they'll do? Visit your profile.</p> \n<p>You often only have a few seconds to make an impression on a potential customer and you don't want them turned away because of bad content. This can include low-quality images, copy with grammar mistakes and use of non branded content.</p> \n<p>Your social media profile tells a story, so make sure it's the one you want to tell.</p> \n<h3>10. Listen to your audience and adjust as needed.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/social-listening-tools\">Social monitoring and listening </a>can be your cheat sheet to success on social media.</p> \n<p>They give you insight into not only your industry and competitors but also how your audience is perceiving your brand. Using that as leverage to inform your brand strategy can make you stand out among your competitors.</p> \n<p>\"Where we once used to live in the marketing age of brand innovation, we now live in a consumer first era. This is an exciting time, particularly on social media where brands have a direct line of communication with their audience,\" said Boswell. \"Brands that not only actively engage with but seek to deeply understand their audience are winning at social.\"</p> \n<p>Not sure where to start? Begin by searching topics relating to your brand and seeing how audiences are responding to it. Then, search your company name and see what's the general sentiment surrounding your brand.</p> \n<h3>11. Optimize your profiles for SEO.</h3> \n<p>As mentioned before, social media has made it easier than ever to discover new brands. But just because it's easier, doesn't mean there's no work to do on your end.</p> \n<p>When thinking of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-tips\">SEO</a>, it's easy to assume it's website optimization. However, you'll also want to optimize your social profiles to make it easier for your target audience to find you.</p> \n<p>One of the easiest ways to optimize your posts is with hashtags. Beyond that, you'll also want to optimize your bio page in a few ways:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Include a few keywords (identified through social media tools) in your company description bio.</li> \n <li>Have working links that lead your followers to other channels, like your website or YouTube channel.</li> \n <li>Use the same profile image and handle on all social media platforms.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>12. Own your mistakes.</h3> \n<p>If you're posting regularly on social media, you're bound to make a mistake. Not to mention, the landscape itself is always changing and evolving.</p> \n<p>Whether it's trying a strategy that didn't quite work out or writing copy that was misunderstood by your audience, it's a normal part of growing your social media presence. Wu says that it's an opportunity to discover areas for improvement.</p> \n<p>\"Strategies in social are built by experimentation and taking chances to find what fits and what doesn't. If you found out that you've made a mistake, own up to it, learn from it and evolve into something better.\"</p> \n<p>It's OK to make mistakes, as long as you take note of the experience and use that to inform your next course of action.</p> \n<h3>13. Treat each platform as its own.</h3> \n<p>What works on one platform won't necessarily work on another.</p> \n<p>One thing you may be tempted to do with social media is duplicate your own content. There's an important difference to note between <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-repurposing-content\">repurposing </a>and duplicating.</p> \n<p>The former refreshes the content to extend its value while the latter keeps it the same, simply transferring it to another platform.</p> \n<p>When duplicating your content, you run the risk of missing the mark with your audience. While they may love your videos on YouTube, they may not like them on TikTok, as the context is different.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, be sure to customize your approach to the platform you're posting on.</p> \n<h3>14. Balance promotion and adding value.</h3> \n<p>There's a time to promote your product or service, and a time to add value. Find the right balance and you're golden.</p> \n<p>Most users don't go on social media to see ads. Social media is usually a place to be entertained, whether that's through funny videos or informative threads.</p> \n<p>While a certain amount of promotion is expected, you'll quickly lose your audience if the only thing you push is product. You'll have to balance this with content they can relate to.</p> \n<p>Once you've earned their trust and gained credibility, they'll be more open to trying your product or service.</p> \n<h3>15.Use tools to publish, monitor and track posts.</h3> \n<p>Social media is not a set-it-and-forget-it marketing play – it requires constant monitoring.</p> \n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-tools\">social media tools</a> come in handy. Software like <a href=\"https://contentstudio.io/\">Content Studio </a>and <a href=\"http://later.com\">Later </a>allow you to schedule your posts on various platforms, track your analytics and competitors, conduct audits, and get data-driven recommendations for future posts.</p> \n<p>Social media tools become indispensable when building a sustainable presence, especially as you scale your business.</p> \n<h3>16. Prioritize accessibility.</h3> \n<p>When it comes to accessibility online, the progress on social media is slow moving.</p> \n<p>Things like captions and alt text may seem superfluous, but they actually hold more weight than you may think. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/accessible-marketing\">Accessible social content</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Makes it easier for deaf, hard of hearing and visually impaired people to engage with your content.</li> \n <li>Helps you reach audiences who may not be native speakers of your language.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As you reach users who may have otherwise not had access to your content, you can grow your brand awareness and generate more engagement.</p> \n<h3>17. Let the data guide you.</h3> \n<p>Analytics aren't just there to tell you how your posts are currently forming, they're also meant to inform your future ones.</p> \n<p>To grow your social presence, you'll have to understand not only <em>what </em>is performing well but also <em>why</em>.</p> \n<p>\"Seek to understand what captivates and engages your audience depending on where they are in their lifecycle,\" said Boswell. \"This can be auditing historic posts to establish quantitative performance benchmarks or looking at qualitative data to understand what types of content, topics, or media formats resonate best.\"</p> \n<p>You can start finding those answers in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-analytics\">your analytics </a>dashboard. As you track your posts' performance, you will start to notice trends and can use them to guide your strategy.</p> \n<h3>18. Invest in the right platforms.</h3> \n<p>It's easy to assume that you should be visible everywhere to increase your social media presence. However, if your audience doesn't live on certain platforms, it's a waste of time and resources.</p> \n<p>That's why you should do some research to narrow down exactly where your audience is, so you can meet them where they are. You can find this information through surveys, interviews, competitors, and perusing the platforms.</p> \n<h3>19. Leverage user-generated content (UGC).</h3> \n<p>Your own content can only take you so far on social media. The great thing is, you can reach audiences beyond your community through influencers, partners and your own followers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers\">Influencer marketing </a>is one of the best ways to attract an audience that falls within your target market but may be currently out of reach.</p> \n<p>What's more, influencers and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/user-generated-content-stats\">UGC </a>come with social proof, which sets up a solid foundation on which to build your relationship with newcomers. It's like your friend introducing you to their friend. You already trust them so naturally, there's some built-in trust with the person they're introducing you to.</p> \n<h3>20. Promote your social accounts on other platforms.</h3> \n<p>You've got awesome social media accounts. So, you'll want to make sure your audience can find them.</p> \n<p>For instance, you might have a dedicated list of subscribers who may not yet follow you on social media. As such, be sure to include links to your social platforms across all channels – both digital and offline.</p> \n<p>This includes the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Business cards</li> \n <li>Emails</li> \n <li>Website</li> \n <li>YouTube videos and your channel homepage</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>21. Embrace new features.</h3> \n<p>In recent months, Twitter introduced \"Twitter Spaces,\" YouTube released a new feature called \"Shorts\" and Instagram launched \"Guides.\"</p> \n<p>Social media platforms come out with new features all the time, and brands are often apprehensive to try them. However, don't be afraid to be an early adopter.</p> \n<p>\"Social media is an ever changing space, every few months there's a new feature, placement, or algorithm change,\" said Boswell. \"Always test assumptions and keep an eye on your performance metrics to see how these changes impact your strategy and be prepared to pivot.\"</p> \n<p>Boswell adds that you should be open to these new additions while still investing in strategies your audience already responds well to.</p> \n<h2>Companies With the Best Social Media Presence</h2> \n<p>There are countless companies who are building strong communities on social media – here are a few of them.</p> \n<h3>1.

They offer reasonable prices, make it easy to rack up points, and always have fun and kind flight attendants.</p> \n<p>One thing I’ve noticed about Southwest is their branding is on <em>point</em>. Whether I’m booking a flight on their mobile application, being served my go-to in-flight ginger ale, or walking through the terminal at Midway Airport, I’m surrounded by Southwest’s consistent brand colors, messaging, and imagery.</p> \n<p>This is an example of integrated marketing at work. If you’re interested in presenting a cohesive, consistent brand experience that leaves your products or services top-of-mind — like Southwest does — this guide is for you.

If their website promoted a different message or campaign than the one you found on their Instagram account, you’d have a hard time understanding the gist of the brand, right?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31057/the-ultimate-checklist-for-integrated-marketing.aspx\">Integrated marketing</a> exists to eliminate these disparities and differences regardless of how or when a customer interacts with your brand. It’s similar to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-multi-channel-marketing-faqs-ht\">multi-channel marketing</a>, except integrated marketing is what aligns the message you’re sharing on all of those channels.</p> \n<p>Speaking of channels, integrated marketing doesn’t apply to just your inbound or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-digital-marketing\">digital marketing</a> channels; <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/how-to-shift-your-marketing-from-traditional-to-inbound\">traditional media</a> channels are also included. Many of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/integrated-marketing#integrated-marketing-examples\">integrated marketing examples we’ll review below</a> incorporate traditional marketing channels such as print, radio, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tv-ad-business\">TV ads</a>.</p> \n<p>Now, let’s talk about integrated marketing campaigns.</p> \n<h3>Why are integrated marketing campaigns effective?</h3> \n<p>While integrated marketing campaigns can differ in their goals (e.g. converting views, building brand awareness, etc.), they should all have one component in common: to align your marketing channels to present a united marketing “front”.</p> \n<p>If your marketing channels are players, consider your integrated marketing campaign the coach in charge of running plays and helping your channels work as a unified system — not disparate ones.</p> \n<p>It’s also more effective to run integrated marketing campaigns as compared to campaigns on individual channels. Integrated marketing campaigns are impactful for a few reasons:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>They reach a wider audience than a single marketing channel.</li> \n <li>They have a greater chance of being seen on multiple channels, thus keeping your brand top-of-mind and pushing visitors closer to conversion.</li> \n <li>They build trust with visitors as they see a consistent message on multiple channels.</li> \n <li>They save you money since assets can be shared between and repurposed for different marketing channels and, depending on your campaign, customers can help you market your product or service for you.</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<p>So, how can you build your own integrated marketing campaign? Follow these steps to get started.</p> \n<h3>1. Establish your overarching campaign goal.</h3> \n<p>Before you consider what channels will be part of your integrated marketing campaign, you must consider the goal of the entire campaign.</p> \n<p>Maybe you’ve <strong>launched a new product, service, or initiative</strong> and want to get it in front of customers — like <a href=\"https://marketingland.com/southwest-airlines-boasts-simple-fee-structure-fun-transfarency-campaign-146092\">Southwest’s <em>Transfarency</em></a>. Maybe you’ve <strong>completely</strong> <strong>rebranded</strong> and want to broadcast your new message — like <a href=\"https://www.wk.com/work/old-spice-smell-like-a-man-man/\">Old Spice’s <em>Smell Like a Man, Man</em></a>. Perhaps you’ve simply <strong>chosen a new positioning tagline</strong> and want your audience to start associating your brand with it — like <a href=\"https://thebrandgym.com/snickers-youre-not-you-when-youre-hungry-the-best-global-campaign-ever/\">Snickers’ <em>You’re Not You When You’re Hungry</em></a>.</p> \n<p>(Don’t worry, we’ll <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/integrated-marketing#integrated-marketing-examples\">dig deeper into these examples</a> later.)</p> \n<p>Whatever your campaign goal may be, always remember to make it <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/smart-goal-examples\">SMART</a>. This will help you stay focused, track your campaign success, and learn how to improve the next time around.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>These goals should also relate to at least one of the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and their subsequent metrics, which <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/integrated-marketing#launch-measure-and-iterate-your-campaign\">you can track when you launch your campaign</a>.</p> \n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-color: #99acc2; border-style: solid; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed;\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">KPI</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">related Metrics</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Traffic/reach</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Unique page views by channel and source</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Engagement</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Bounce rate; average time on page</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Top (and falling) content</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Top page views; top exits</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Impact</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Click-throughs; conversions; backlinks</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Sentiment</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Comments; social shares</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Lead generation</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Total leads; total sessions; session to lead conversion rate</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Sales</td> \n   <td style=\"width: 50%;\">Lead to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-marketing-qualified-lead-mql-under-100-sr\">marketing qualified lead</a> (MQL); MQL to sales qualified lead (SQL); customer purchase/closed-won business</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Also, while increased engagement and new leads are always exciting, a multi-channel campaign should also consider the bigger picture: how your campaign impacts sales opportunities and business revenue. Take a moment to map out how you want your campaign to impact your bottom line, too.</p> \n<h3>2. Choose your marketing channels and set goals for each one.</h3> \n<p>Now that you know your overarching integrated marketing campaign goal, you probably have a better idea of what channels (if not all of them) can help you reach that goal.</p> \n<p>For example, if your goal is to roll out a new logo and branding suite, you don’t necessarily need to leverage radio ads. On the other hand, if you’re extending your audience to target a new geographic region or city, radio ads, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/billboard-advertising\">billboard ads</a>, TV ads, and other local channels may come in handy.</p> \n<p>When choosing your channel(s), it all boils down to what you’re trying to achieve through your integrated marketing campaign. There are 10 major marketing “channels” that you can use to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-distribution\">distribute your campaign content</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising\">Advertising</a> (both print and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\">PPC</a>)</li> \n <li>Direct marketing</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide\">Email marketing</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/public-relations\">PR</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/personal-selling\">Personal selling</a></li> \n <li>Sales promotions</li> \n <li>Digital marketing (e.g. website, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-strategy-guide\">content marketing</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\">SEO</a>)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing\">Social media</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/event-marketing\">Events</a> and sponsorships</li> \n <li>Packaging</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Your integrated marketing campaign should include a variety of marketing channels in order to reach the widest audience and drive home your campaign message. If you see one or more channels plateau, don’t hesitate to add, remove, or test new ones.</p> \n<h3>3. Define your buyer personas by channel.</h3> \n<p>Every marketing channel targets its own specific <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona\">buyer persona</a>. For this reason, instead of defining a broad persona for your campaign, you must define your audience by channel.</p> \n<p>There will inevitably be some overlap, but it’s wise to understand exactly who you’re talking to on each medium and how you can tailor those specific assets to be the most successful.</p> \n<p><em>Note: With some campaigns, you may be targeting a specific audience. In this case, steps 2 and 3 would be flipped — you’d define your buyer persona(s) first and then decide which channels can help you reach that audience.</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>Download our free Persona Templates to easily organize your audience segments and make your marketing stronger.</em></a></p> \n<h3>4. Identify your channel managers.</h3> \n<p>Depending on the size of your marketing team, you may have different people (or entire teams) in charge of different channels. When running a multi-channel marketing campaign, you must determine who <em>specifically</em> will be in charge of ensuring their channel(s) is aligned with the campaign.</p> \n<p>This is important for two reasons: 1) that manager is the expert on their channel (e.g. audience, posting cadence, optimization tactics, reporting strategies, etc.) and will know how to tailor the campaign content to be the most successful; and 2) putting one person in charge of all channels may be overwhelming and will cause the content and campaign to suffer.</p> \n<p>Perhaps you have a smaller marketing team where one person handles multiple channels. Regardless of your team size, do your very best to share channel management responsibilities across a few people — ideally with one person handling one or two channels.</p> \n<h3>5. Create adaptable marketing assets and messaging.</h3> \n<p>At this point, you have your campaign goal, target audience(s), and marketing channels. It’s now time to create your integrated marketing campaign content. This stage is where <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/copywriting-examples\">copywriting</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design\">graphic design</a>, and other creative processes come into play.</p> \n<p>Before I dive into <em>how</em>, let’s talk about an important component of integrated marketing content: <strong>adaptability</strong>. To keep your campaign consistent (and ease your workload), you should be able to <a href=\"https://beomniscient.com/repurpose-content/\">repurpose any content</a> to be used on different channels.</p> \n<p>For example, let’s say your integrated marketing campaign is focused on the launch of a new 3-minute brand video. You could repurpose this video into:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>30-second and one-minute “trailer” videos</li> \n <li>Still images</li> \n <li>Quotes</li> \n <li>GIFs</li> \n <li>Hashtags</li> \n <li>Blog posts</li> \n <li>Soundbites</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As you develop and repurpose these creative assets, keep them aligned with your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding\">brand guidelines</a> <em>and</em> consistent with each other. In fact, it may be helpful to create your own set of brand guidelines for your integrated marketing campaign to share with your team and any channel managers.</p> \n<p>This documentation could include a few things:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Visual guidelines (logo, color palette, typography, etc.)</li> \n <li>Any developed and repurposed assets in multiple file formats</li> \n <li>Voice and tone guidelines (taglines, preferred language, words to avoid, etc.)</li> \n <li>Messaging guidelines (pain points, goals, types of content, resources, etc.)</li> \n <li>Buyer persona information and guidelines</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Integrated marketing is all about a consistent brand experience. Be sure your campaign assets reflect that, regardless of what channel your audience visits or sees.</p> \n<h3>6. Establish your plan for collecting leads.</h3> \n<p>Whether or not you intend your campaign to collect leads, you should always be prepared to receive them. You don’t want to leave this as an afterthought once you launch your campaign. Even if you’re simply campaigning to raise awareness of your brand, consider how your visitors might convert to leads — and, eventually, customers.</p> \n<p>First, consider how a visitor might convert to a lead. Would they subscribe to your newsletter? Input their information to download a content offer? Create an account on your website? Ensure these conversion aspects of your campaign are also on-brand with the rest of your visual and messaging assets.</p> \n<p>Next, consider how your leads will be nurtured once they convert. Would they roll into an <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/marketing-automation\">automated email workflow</a>? Would you pass them along to Sales? However you go about this step, make sure your leads aren’t forgotten once they willingly give over their information.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>As always, communicate with Sales to confirm that they’re aware of your campaign and on-board with your plan for new leads and customers.</p> \n<h3>7. Launch, measure, and iterate your campaign.</h3> \n<p>Ready to launch your integrated marketing campaign? It might be time to put your campaign to work … but it’s not time to rest just yet.</p> \n<p>Remember those <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/integrated-marketing#kpis-and-metrics\">KPIs and metrics from step one</a>? Whichever KPIs relate to your overarching campaign goal (e.g. boosting brand awareness, rebranding, new product, etc.), start tracking those subsequent metrics each week, month, and quarter (depending on how long your campaign is running) to see how successful it is at reaching your goal.</p> \n<p>As always, take what you learn from each integrated marketing campaign and apply it to future campaigns. With the right strategies, managers, and tools in place, you can create a never-ending cycle of integrated marketing campaigns — and wins.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Integrated Marketing Strategies and Best Practices</h2> \n<p>As you construct your integrated marketing campaign, there are a few key strategies and best practices to keep in mind. We’ve detailed them here, and they apply regardless of what media, channels, or goals you’ve chosen.</p> \n<h3>Align behind the scenes.</h3> \n<p>In order for you to successfully implement an integrated marketing approach, it’s imperative that you not only choose marketing channel managers but that all your marketing managers also communicate often about projects and campaigns.</p> \n<p>While not every integrated marketing campaign or promotion needs to be on all of your channels, they should at least complement each other to avoid a fragmented brand experience for customers.</p> \n<h3>Consider the channel transition.</h3> \n<p>Integrated campaigns receive traffic from a number of sources — and pass along those sources like a game of <em>Hot Potato</em>. Consider how a visitor may view/experience each marketing channel 1) if it was their first visit and 2) if they transitioned from another channel. Think about how each channel can help others convert.</p> \n<p>For example, say a customer saw your new billboard on their way to work and, once they arrived, visited the website that was on the billboard. Imagine if, on your website, the customer couldn’t easily find whatever your billboard was marketing. How confusing would that be? That customer would likely drop off immediately.</p> \n<h3>Don’t neglect the small overlaps.</h3> \n<p>When preparing to launch your integrated marketing campaign, it’s tempting to separately think about each channel and its respective media assets. But this thought process inherently goes against the ethos of integrated marketing. Integrated marketing exists to eradicate the silos of traditional marketing and bring together a cohesive campaign experience.</p> \n<p>For this reason, don’t neglect the places in which your campaign overlaps. Here are a few examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your email signature, where you can plug your social media handles, website URL, or video links</li> \n <li>Your social media bios and posts, where you can include links to your website, <a href=\"https://beomniscient.com/content-marketing-seo/\">blog posts</a>, content offers, or other digital content</li> \n <li>Your blog and website, where you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/14624/7-ways-to-integrate-search-engine-and-social-media-marketing.aspx\">incorporate social sharing buttons</a></li> \n <li>Your standalone landing pages, where you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27426/7-ways-to-integrate-search-engine-and-email-marketing.aspx\">optimize for relevant keywords and SEO</a></li> \n <li>Your PPC copy, where you can test subject lines to see what your audience responds to</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While these overlaps might not directly support your campaign goals, they help your audience transition seamlessly between channels, enjoy that consistent, cohesive brand experience, and ultimately find their way to a page that converts them.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Every marketer knows just how much you can learn from those who’ve come before you. In this section, we’ve pulled together a handful of well-executed integrated marketing campaigns to give you an example of just how successful this tactic can be.</p> \n<h3>1. <em>Smell Like a Man, Man</em> by Old Spice</h3> \n<p>For years, I associated Old Spice with something only my dad or grandfather would wear. I can remember the old, white bottle of aftershave — the one with the faded pirate ship — that used to sit in my dad’s cabinet.</p> \n<div> \n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/integrated%20marketing%20example%20old%20spice%20old%20bottle.jpg?width=570&amp;name=integrated%20marketing%20example%20old%20spice%20old%20bottle.jpg\" alt=\"integrated marketing example old spice old bottle\" width=\"570\" style=\"width: 570px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"> </img>\n</div> \n<div>\n  &nbsp; \n</div> \n<div>\n  I don’t think I’m the only one who held this association, so it’s no surprise that, in 2010, Old Spice launched a major rebranding campaign to give its products a more youthful, playful feel — and ultimately attract a younger audience. Not only did Old Spice change the design of their packaging, but they also renamed their products and crafted a new tagline (“Smell Like a Man, Man”). \n</div> \n<p>The initial campaign launch featured one 30-second TV spot, <em>The Man Your Man Could Smell Like</em>, that was so beloved that Old Spice launched a handful of others.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/owGykVbfgUE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Old Spice didn’t stop at the TV commercial. They also included their website, product pages, Instagram, YouTube, and other channels in their campaign.</p> \n<p>No, they don’t all feature the specific characters or taglines from the original TV spots (remember, the campaign launched almost 10 years ago), but they do reflect the same tone, theme, and brand, thus giving customers a consistent brand experience across all media.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/integrated%20marketing%20example%20old%20spice%20website.png?width=600&amp;name=integrated%20marketing%20example%20old%20spice%20website.png\" alt=\"integrated marketing example old spice website\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>2. <em>Transfarency </em>by Southwest Airlines</h3> \n<p>I discussed Southwest Airlines' consistent branding at the beginning of this article. One campaign that stands out is their <em>Transfarency</em> movement, which introduced a brand new word that marketed Southwest as an airline with straightforward pricing and no hidden fees.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/AiBZTnk5c44\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>The campaign originally launched in 2015, but Southwest has since been rolling out phases to release new elements and <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/behind-every-seat-is-a-story-southwest-airlines-launches-next-phase-of-transfarency-consumer-campaign-300524643.html\">introduce more themes and stories</a>. This tactic has helped elongate the campaign message and truly solidify the association between flying Southwest and saving money on fares.</p> \n<p>Southwest has used almost every possible marketing channel to broadcast this campaign: a dedicated landing page on which you can purchase tickets, print advertisements posted along airport walls and tucked behind airplane seats, a slew of video spots, and plenty of user-generated content on their social media.</p> \n<h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/integrated%20marketing%20example%20southwest%20instagram.png?width=600&amp;name=integrated%20marketing%20example%20southwest%20instagram.png\" alt=\"integrated marketing example southwest instagram\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></h3> \n<h3>3. <em>You’re Not You When You’re Hungry</em> by Snickers</h3> \n<p>Snickers is one of my favorite chocolate bars, so I paid close attention when I started to see commercials for their <em>You’re Not You When You’re Hungry</em> advertisements.</p> \n<p>Launched at the 2010 Super Bowl, this Snickers campaign has remained top-of-mind for chocolate and candy lovers everywhere.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VLy4qzV1gL0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One reason for this is the campaign’s humor, but the other, more pertinent reason is that Snickers pasted this movement <em>everywhere</em> … on its website, social media, TV, print ads, and more, and they included plenty of celebrities to boot. By presenting an aligned, cohesive integrated marketing campaign, customers now think of Snickers when craving a sweet snack — and <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.com/article/case-study-fame-made-snickers-youre-not-when-youre-hungry-campaign-success/1413554\">the company has benefitted as a result</a>.</p> \n<div> \n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/integrated%20marketing%20example%20snickers%20billboard.jpg?width=600&amp;name=integrated%20marketing%20example%20snickers%20billboard.jpg\" alt=\"integrated marketing example snickers billboard\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"> </img>\n</div> \n<h3>4. Share<em> a Coke</em> by Coca-Cola</h3> \n<p>Coca-Cola's Share a Coke campaign was unique in that the company put their customers front and center by featuring names and fun phrases on their product. Not only did this create endless advertising angles, but it led to endless user-generated content from customers wanting to share products with their own name. The #ShareaCoke hashtag was shared via <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/100715/what-makes-share-coke-campaign-so-successful.asp#:~:text=Consumers%20shared%20more%20than%20500%2C000,Facebook%20followers%20that%20same%20year.\">500,000+ customer photos</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Share-a-Coke-with-even-MORE-jpg.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=Share-a-Coke-with-even-MORE-jpg.jpeg\" alt=\"coke share a coke integrated marketing campaign\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When this campaign was at its height, I found myself taking pictures of and even buying Cokes featuring the names of my friends and family. It seems that others did the same — the campaign resulted in an increase in Coke consumption from <a href=\"https://mayecreate.com/blog/3-marketing-lessons-from-the-share-a-coke-campaign/\">1.7 billion to 1.9 billion</a> daily servings.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\"> \n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;\"> \n   <iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGjQnGio5mw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>5. <em>Grow Better</em> by HubSpot</h3> \n<p>HubSpot has countless digital properties — its blog, website, social media channels, and SaaS products. This level of variety requires a lot of consistency in messaging and marketing.</p> \n<p>HubSpot recently set its ultimate vision to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/grow-better\">help customers grow better</a> — all customers, on all channels.

In this post, we’ll outline what market share is, how to calculate it, give real life examples, and explain how you can increase yours.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=6ba52ce7-bb69-4b63-965b-4ea21ba905da&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Market Research Templates [Free Kit]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6ba52ce7-bb69-4b63-965b-4ea21ba905da.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>What is market share?</h2> \n<p>Market share is the percentage of an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/total-addressable-market\">industry's sales</a> that a particular company owns. Essentially, it is the share of total industry revenue that your business has generated from selling your products and services. Businesses with larger market shares are industry leaders and competition for smaller companies.</p> \n<p>You can think of it like this: if consumers buy 100 t-shirts and 70 of them are from company A, 25 from company B, and 5 are from company C, Company A owns a market share of 70% and is the leading industry <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit?_ga=2.142252277.691120071.1613660624-1549707591.1613660624\">competitor</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Market share is typically calculated for a specific time period, like yearly or quarterly sales, and is sometimes separated by region.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>Market Share Formula</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ms%20formula.png?width=600&amp;name=ms%20formula.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"formula that you can use to find your business market share\"></p> \n<p>Calculating your market share will give you an overall understanding of your position in the industry, but it’s also helpful to understand how you measure up to your direct competitors.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Relative Market Share</h3> \n<p>Relative market share is a way to compare your performance to industry leaders.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rather than using total industry revenue, you’re dividing your market share by your top industry competitors market share, and multiplying the result by 100. The result will show you the portion of the market you own in relation to your largest competitor. The image below shows the relative market share formula.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Relative Market Share Formula</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rms%20formula.png?width=600&amp;name=rms%20formula.png\" alt=\"mathematical formula that is used to calculate your business relative market share\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h2>&nbsp;</h2> \n<h2>Market Share Examples</h2> \n<p>It may be easier to understand market share with real-life examples, so we’ll go over some below for businesses you may already be familiar with.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Nike Market Share</h3> \n<p>Nike is part of the athletic footwear and apparel industry selling a wide variety of sports equipment, casual shoes, and accessories.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With footwear alone, Nike’s global market share is estimated to be <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a2aa0f99f07f5a1339d0569/t/5a5e5a78e2c48341149c61d7/1516132986505/Landscape+Analysis+-+Nike+PDF.pdf\">29.25%</a>. The brand is an industry competitor for Adidas and Under Armour.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Tesla Market Share</h3> \n<p>Tesla is part of the automotive industry and it produces electric vehicles (EV). Within the EV industry, Tesla holds an <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2020/10/30/tesla-tsla-market-share-global-ev-sales-change/\">18% </a> market share.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While that number may seem small, it’s important to recognize that the market for EV worldwide is significantly smaller than standard vehicles. EV’s market share in the automobile industry is <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/mckinsey-electric-vehicle-index-europe-cushions-a-global-plunge-in-ev-sales\">2.8% </a> and Tesla’s is <a href=\"https://www.torquenews.com/1083/here-s-what-tesla-s-current-market-share-looks-globally-us-china-and-europe\">.8% </a>. These differences are significant, which is why it is important to analyze relative market share to compare your business to your direct competitors, rather than just the market as a whole.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Google Market Share</h3> \n<p>Google has a market share of <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\">91.86%</a>, making it the most popular search engine in the world. It dominates the competition, as the second-largest industry leader is Bing with a market share of just 2.71%.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve calculated your market share and understand how you relate to your industry competitors, you can begin strategizing how to increase your overall revenue.</p> \n<h2>How To Expand Your Market Share</h2> \n<p>Below are a few strategies your company can use to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-increase-market-share\">expand your market share</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>1. Lower prices.</h3> \n<p>A great way to compete in your industry is to offer low prices. This is the low-hanging fruit of expanding your market share because consumers typically look for lower cost products.</p> \n<p>However, it's also important to note being the cheap option isn't the right move for every brand. You want to ensure that you’re <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/pricing-strategy?_ga=2.163188859.691120071.1613660624-1549707591.1613660624\">pricing products </a> appropriately in terms of providing value to customers, but not losing out on revenue opportunities for the sake of beating out the competition.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. Innovate new products and features.</h3> \n<p>Companies that are innovating and bringing new technology to the table often see their market share increase.</p> \n<p>New products and features attract new customers, a.k.a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-acquisition?_ga=2.231037272.691120071.1613660624-1549707591.1613660624\">acquisition </a>, which is a driving factor for generating revenue. New customers make new purchases and, in turn, contribute to higher profit margins and larger contributions to overall industry revenue. Larger contributions directly translate to increased market share.</p> \n<h3>3. Delight your customers.</h3> \n<p>One of the best ways to grow your market share is to work on existing customer relationships.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By delighting current customers by providing exceptional experiences, you can inspire <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-loyalty?_ga=2.231037272.691120071.1613660624-1549707591.1613660624\">customer loyalty </a>. Loyal customers are more likely to make repeat purchases, which increases your business revenue and contribution to total industry revenue. As mentioned above, higher revenue contributions equals a higher market share percentage.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4. Increase brand awareness.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/brand-positioning-strategy\">Branding awareness</a> and national marketing play a large role in capturing market share. It's important to get your name out there so customers know who you are. Becoming a household name and the preferred brand in an industry will help increase your market share.</p> \n<p>Generally, larger companies have the highest market share because they can provide products and services more efficiently and effectively.</p> \n<p>But, why is this so important? Below, let's figure out what impact market share can have on your company.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Market share is more important in industries that are based on discretionary income. In industries that are constantly growing, market share doesn't always have a large impact. However, it's important to keep in mind that a company can have too much market share — also known as a monopoly.</p> \n<p>For example, with growing industries, which have a growing available market share, companies can still increase their sales even if they are losing market share.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, with discretionary income industries, such as travel or non-essential goods like entertainment and leisure, the economy can have a major impact on market share. Sales and margins can vary depending on the time of year, meaning that competition is always at an all-time high.</p> \n<p>Higher competition often leads to risky strategies. For instance, companies might be willing to lose money temporarily in order to force competitors out of the industry and gain more of the market share. Once they have more market share, they can raise prices.</p> \n<h2>Understand Your Market Share to Increase Business Success</h2> \n<p>Lower market shares can let you know that you need to focus on customer acquisition, marketing to raise brand awareness, and overall strategies to increase revenue. Higher percentages indicate that your current strategy is effective, and you should focus your efforts on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-retention?_ga=2.242572741.691120071.1613660624-1549707591.1613660624\">customer retention </a> and product innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whether your company is well-established or just starting out, it’s important to understand your business’ industry standing as it will help you meet business objectives and achieve desired success.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=560aa80b-9e0b-4615-851c-f23e4f49b62f&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/560aa80b-9e0b-4615-851c-f23e4f49b62f.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-calculate-market-share&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6ba52ce7-bb69-4b63-965b-4ea21ba905da.png","linkMd5":"038f7fd7cfa532c548e26430779a749e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-30-715_3c323ccea639359f.webp","destWidth":486,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":5174,"destBytes":7456,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6ba52ce7-bb69-4b63-965b-4ea21ba905da.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-30-715_3c323ccea639359f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ms%20formula.png?width=600&name=ms%20formula.png":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rms%20formula.png?width=600&name=rms%20formula.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn69@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-52-973_e619c9ad07700135.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/560aa80b-9e0b-4615-851c-f23e4f49b62f.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn98@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-58-608_56bafbfb62a605be.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-calculate-market-share&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn34@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-52-616_c6d8af48f0522757.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425369989},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"The Plain English Guide to Writing a Business Case","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-case","description":"<p>Have you ever heard the age-old classic story of a company that got its start from a back-of-the-napkin idea? Or about the start-ups that started in someone's garage?</p> \n<p>While all those stories are, of course, inspirational, a huge element that they leave out is that every business started because someone felt the project justified spending time and money on it.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>That's why some projects require you to write a business case. Whether you want to start a company, pitch a new product, or perhaps you just want your business to use a new project management tool. Either way, a project that requires time and resources will also require justifying those expenses in the form of a business case.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review what a business case is, plus an example and template to inspire your own business case.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Business Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>In a business case, you might include the background on a project, expected benefits, costs, risks, and opportunities. This document will justify taking on a certain project. So, how do you develop a business case? Let's dive in below.</p> \n<h2>Business Case Development</h2> \n<p>To develop a business case, you'll need to write several key components, including a proposal, strategy, budget, SWOT analysis, and project plan. With these documents, you should be able to prove that the project you're pitching is worth doing.</p> \n<p>Let's dive into the steps for how you'll develop a business case below:</p> \n<h3>1. Research</h3> \n<p>Before you can write a business case, you need to do your research. First, you should have a goal in mind for your project, whether it's to create a new product, help drive more traffic/leads, or improve user experience.</p> \n<p>Write down your goal and then conduct research to prove that your project is the way to achieve your goal.</p> \n<p>You can begin by researching what competitors are doing and look for gaps that your project solves.</p> \n<p>Start to brainstorm what this project's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are. Additionally, you'll want to learn about your market -- whoever will be the consumer of the project, even if that's your own team.</p> \n<p>Finally, you should start to look into what a budget would look like for your proposed solution.</p> \n<h3>2. Focus on one component at a time.</h3> \n<p>A business case will usually include several documents. Focus on one at a time, while keeping your notes organized.</p> \n<p>Start with your proposal, then move on to your SWOT analysis, the competitive analysis, the project plan, overall strategy, and then the budget. It can be easy to get lost in just one of these tasks, so focus on one thing at a time to complete the bigger picture business case.</p> \n<h3>3. Write an implementation plan.</h3> \n<p>Once you've gathered your research and you're working through each component, it's time to start thinking about implementation.</p> \n<p>How will you implement your project? Once you've made the business case that your project should be done, stakeholders will wonder how you'll execute it.</p> \n<p>To do this, write an implementation plan that discusses how you'd complete the project and metrics that you'd track to measure success.</p> \n<p>Once you're done writing your business case, look at the whole document and ask yourself whether it's comprehensive, measurable, and adaptable.</p> \n<p>A business case doesn't need to be an entire business plan for a new product. Sometimes it will be less formal due to the size of the project. Either way, you want to make a strong case for your project, so it should be easy to understand and implement.</p> \n<p>Now, let's look at an example of what a business case might look like.</p> \n<h2>Business Case Example</h2> \n<p>Now that you've seen what it takes to write a business case and what the process looks like, let's look at an example for inspiration.</p> \n<p>In the example below, the project is about getting a new phone system to help the sales staff. Because this is a fairly small project, the business case isn't several pages long with exhaustive research.</p> \n<p>However, it's important to keep in mind that while your business case might look something like this for a small scale project, it might include several pages of information if you're pitching something like a new product or a new UI to improve user experience.</p> \n<p>The point in the business case is that it's adaptable to be whatever you need. However, the components of the business case will be the same regardless of how long it is. Every business case should include why a project should be done, the benefits, costs, risks, and budget.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"A business case example.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Plain%20English%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Business%20Case.png?width=600&amp;name=The%20Plain%20English%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Business%20Case.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 600px; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://expertprogrammanagement.com/2017/06/project-business-case/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h2>Simple Business Case Template</h2> \n<h3>Proposal</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Project details</li> \n <li>Strategic context</li> \n <li>Vision, goals, objectives</li> \n <li>Benefits</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)</h3> \n<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>See if competitors are doing the same thing</li> \n <li>Look for gaps in their offerings, if applicable</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Risk Analysis</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>What risks are involved?</li> \n <li>Will these risks present opportunities?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Market Assessment</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Do your consumers want this?</li> \n <li>How will this help your stakeholders?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Budget</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Economic analysis</li> \n <li>ROI</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Implementation/Project Plan</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Roles/Team</li> \n <li>Duties/Responsibilities</li> \n <li>Stakeholders</li> \n <li>Specs and Requirements</li> \n <li>Timeline</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you have a new project idea for your company that requires a budget and resources, it might be a good idea to develop a business case to show your superiors that the project is worth taking on.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9ce704de-19f2-4fd0-8041-22dc3c021b87&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Business Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9ce704de-19f2-4fd0-8041-22dc3c021b87.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbusiness-case&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa.png","linkMd5":"75512b3b93cdb33313246eaf51cfffd2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn100@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-711_8ff1ce58a24f6d9c.webp","destWidth":428,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4856,"destBytes":6606,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn100@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-711_8ff1ce58a24f6d9c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Plain%20English%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Business%20Case.png?width=600&name=The%20Plain%20English%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Business%20Case.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn85@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-53-197_9269671074b1013a.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9ce704de-19f2-4fd0-8041-22dc3c021b87.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn41@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-51-604_ec9e2c896a128892.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbusiness-case&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-548_8f7c1be0d410338d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370058},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"How to Use Facebook for Business: 25 Facebook Marketing Tips and Tricks","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/24422/the-ultimate-facebook-marketing-cheat-sheet.aspx","description":"<p>Although some of the younger demographics are passing up Facebook in favor of tools like Instagram and Snapchat, Facebook still dominates the market.</p> \n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/\">1.85 billion people</a> logging in daily (a 16% increase year-over-year), it's still the most popular social network around.

That's why it's important for your business to be on Facebook and use it to connect with your audience. With over a billion people on Facebook every day, your audience is probably on the site daily.</p> \n<p>So, how can you use this tool to connect with your audience? Let's dive in below.</p> \n<h3>How to Use Facebook for Marketing</h3> \n<h4>1. Engage with your audience.</h4> \n<p>Social media is best known for its ability to help you connect with your audience. On Facebook, you can enter direct conversations with your target audience through comments, reactions, and even messages. By engaging with your audience, you'll increase brand awareness and help tell your brand story.</p> \n<h4>2. Listen to your audience.</h4> \n<p>Now, when you're on social media, it's important that you don't just use the tool to talk at your audience without listening when they respond. To really leverage Facebook for marketing, you should use social media listening tools and track what people are saying. You can track mentions of your company and follow hashtags so you always know what's trending and going on with your customers.</p> \n<h4>3. Develop a contest and giveaway strategy.</h4> \n<p>A great way to use Facebook for your marketing purposes is to run contests and giveaways. Now before you dive in, make sure you develop a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-giveaway\">strategy</a>. What kinds of things will you giveaway? How will your audience participate? It's important to think this through and make sure your decision aligns with what your audience wants from you.</p> \n<h4>4. Promote your events.</h4> \n<p>Of course if you're running any online events, it's important to market that. Facebook is a great place to do that because you can create an event and invite your followers. This is a great way to get the word out about your events.</p> \n<h4>5. Use Facebook Ads.</h4> \n<p>Facebook actually might be most popular among businesses for its advanced ads tool. If you're running online ads, Facebook is one of the best places to do it.</p> \n<p>Now that you know how to use Facebook for business, let's dive into some tips and tricks to help you succeed.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>25 Tips and Tricks for Marketing on Facebook</h2> \n<pre><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/facebook-marketing-training\">Learn Facebook Marketing in HubSpot Academy</a></pre> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Tips for Your Facebook Business Page</h3> \n<h4>1. Create a business Page, not a personal profile.</h4> \n<p>First thing's first: You need to create a business Page -- <em>not</em> a personal profile -- to represent your brand. Pages look similar to personal profiles, but they include unique tools for businesses, brands, and organizations. Your fans can Like your Page to see updates from you in their News Feeds, which is something they can't do for personal profiles.</p> \n<p>Not only will this maximize Facebook's business potential for you, but it's actually against <a class=\"_5dwo\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms\">Facebook's Terms of Service</a> to use a personal account to represent something other than that person, like a business. If you've already created a profile for your business, you'll want to convert it into a business Page, which you can <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/116067818477568\">learn how to do easily here</a>.</p> \n<p>Setting up a page is simple. Just <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/create\">visit this page</a> and follow the step-by-step setup instructions.</p> \n<h4>2. Claim your Page's vanity URL.</h4> \n<p>Once you've created your business Page, it'll get a randomly assigned number and URL, like facebook.com/pages/yourbusiness/123456789. To make your Page more shareable and easier to find, you'll want to create a recognizable vanity URL (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/hubspot\">http://www.facebook.com/hubspot</a>).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To create a vanity URL, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/username/\">visit this page</a>, then follow the instructions.</p> \n<h4>3. Add a great cover photo.</h4> \n<p>Facebook's page design lets you feature a 820 x 312 pixel cover photo at the top of your business Page. You'll want to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cover-photos-best-practices-ht\">optimize that cover photo</a> to capture the attention of new visitors, encourage them to explore and learn more, and provide an effective mobile experience -- all the while ensuring you're following Facebook's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php\">Page Guidelines</a>.</p> \n<p>Learn all about do's and don'ts for your Facebook cover photo <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cover-photos-best-practices-ht\">in this blog post</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jcrew-facebook-cover-photo.png?width=690&amp;height=300&amp;name=jcrew-facebook-cover-photo.png\" alt=\"J Crew Facebook cover photo.\" title=\"jcrew-facebook-cover-photo.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"300\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/twitter-header-image-examples#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\" title=\"awesome examples of business page cover photos\">Here are some more awesome examples of business Page cover photos </a> to get your creative juices flowing.</p> \n<h4>4. Add a recognizable profile picture.</h4> \n<p>Pick a profile picture that will be easy for visitors to recognize -- like your company logo, or a headshot of yourself if you're a solopreneur or consultant. Being recognizable is important for getting found and Liked, especially in Facebook Search. Your profile image is pictured at the top of your Facebook Page and is also the thumbnail image that gets displayed next to all your Facebook Page updates, so choose wisely.</p> \n<p>When choosing a photo, keep in mind that Facebook requires your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">profile picture dimensions</a> to be 170 pixels by 170 pixels.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/makr-facebook-profile-photo.png?width=690&amp;height=300&amp;name=makr-facebook-profile-photo.png\" alt=\"Makr Facebook profile picture.\" title=\"makr-facebook-profile-photo.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"300\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<h4>5. Optimize your \"About\" section -- especially the preview.</h4> \n<p>Your \"About\" section is one of the first places people will look when they arrive on your Page. A preview of it is located on the left-hand side of your page beneath your profile picture, and people can also navigate to the full section by clicking on the \"About\" tab at the top of your page.</p> \n<p>Be sure to optimize the preview section on the left side of your page with brief yet descriptive copy to give visitors a sense of what your Page and your business is about before they decide to Like you. This copy will get pulled from the \"Short Description\" you provide within your full \"About\" tab.</p> \n<p>Here's an example video marketing software company <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wistia/\">Wistia</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/wistia-about-preview-facebook.png?width=314&amp;height=172&amp;name=wistia-about-preview-facebook.png\" alt=\"Wistia Facebook about preview.\" title=\"wistia-about-preview-facebook.png\" width=\"314\" height=\"172\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>And another from a restaurant called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TahazaHummusKitchen/\">Tahaza Hummus Kitchen</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tahaza-about-preview-facebook.png?width=318&amp;height=367&amp;name=tahaza-about-preview-facebook.png\" alt=\"Tahaza Hummus Kitchen about preview on Facebook.\" title=\"tahaza-about-preview-facebook.png\" width=\"318\" height=\"367\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>To edit your own \"About\" tab, click on it, hover over the section you'd like to edit, and click the pencil icon.</p> \n<h4>6. Earn the \"Very responsive to messages\" badge.</h4> \n<p>If you respond quickly to most users who send you messages on Facebook, then you can earn what Facebook calls a \"Very responsive to messages\" badge. You'll earn a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/www/475643069256244\">\"Very responsive to messages\" badge</a> below your Page's cover photo if you have a response rate of 90% and a response time of 15 minutes over the last seven days.</p> \n<p>If you're responsive to messages but haven't quite earned the badge, Facebook will still show off how responsive you are to visitors. Here's an example <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zappos/\">from Zappos' Page</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zappos-about-preview-facebook-1.png?width=311&amp;height=132&amp;name=zappos-about-preview-facebook-1.png\" alt=\"Zappos response rate on Facebook.\" title=\"zappos-about-preview-facebook-1.png\" width=\"311\" height=\"132\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>If you're not very responsive to messages, nothing will appear. So, while it's not the end of the world if you don't respond, having that badge lets users know your business is listening and cares about their needs.</p> \n<p>By the way, there's a lot you can do with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/marketing/messenger\">Facebook's \"Messenger\" tool for businesses</a>. We recommend you explore and make the most out of Facebook as a communication and support tool.</p> \n<h4>7. Add milestones.</h4> \n<p>The \"Milestones\" feature lets you highlight some of your business' biggest accomplishments, like award wins, product releases, major events, or other accolades. Recent milestones will be posted to your Timeline, and users will be able to find them later under your \"About\" tab.</p> \n<p>To add milestones, click on the \"Timeline\" section of your Page, and click the \"Offer, Event +\" option in the page update composer near the top of your page.</p> \n<h4>9. Choose a call-to-action button.</h4> \n<p>Facebook's option to place a simple call-to-action button at the top of your Facebook Page is another handy feature. You can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cta-button#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">learn how to add a CTA button to your business' Facebook Page here</a>.</p> \n<p>You can choose from seven pre-made button options (\"Sign Up,\" \"Shop Now,\" \"Contact Us,\" \"Book Now,\" \"Use App,\" Watch Video,\" and \"Play Game\") and link it to any website that aligns with your business' goals. It could link to your homepage, a landing page, a contact sheet, a video, or somewhere else.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dollar-shave-club-facebook-page-cta.png?width=690&amp;height=299&amp;name=dollar-shave-club-facebook-page-cta.png\" alt=\"Dollar Shave Club Facebook CTA\" title=\"dollar-shave-club-facebook-page-cta.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"299\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<h4>10. Create custom page tabs.</h4> \n<p>By default, your page tabs are set as Timeline, About, Photos, Likes and More. But Facebook lets you create and leverage custom tabs -- which are basically like landing pages within your Facebook Page, or calls-to-action where you can feature anything from case studies to marketing offers to other promotions you're running.</p> \n<p>They're right at the top of your page and let you give visitors specific path to do what you want them to do on your Page. For example, if you're hiring a lot of people, you might create a custom tab for \"Jobs\" that links to your jobs site, like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zendesk/\">Zendesk does on their Page</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zendesk-facebook-jobs-tab.png?width=550&amp;name=zendesk-facebook-jobs-tab.png\" alt=\"Zendesk Facebook jobs tab.\" title=\"zendesk-facebook-jobs-tab.png\" width=\"550\" style=\"width: 550px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>You can create custom tabs by signing in, visiting your Page, clicking the \"More\" tab and choosing \"Manage Tabs\" from the dropdown menu.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Tips for News Feed Visibility</h3> \n<h4>11. Prioritize quality over quantity.</h4> \n<p>Here are two questions we hear a lot: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-post-frequency-benchmarks\">How often should I post to Facebook</a>? Will posting more frequently will help me reach more people?</p> \n<p>In short, the answer is no. At the end of the day, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-algorithm-works-facebook-twitter-instagram\">how visible your posts are in people's News Feeds</a> all comes down to the quality of your posts. These algorithms are meant to filter out the irrelevant and the poor quality posts so that the highest-quality stuff is what gets through and gets shown to users.</p> \n<p>So don't overwhelm your customers with content on Facebook, and be selective about what you're publishing. Spend more time <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-perfect-social-media-posts-slideshare\">crafting <em>better</em> Facebook posts</a>, and less time crafting a lot of Facebook posts. Remember: It's a marketer's job to post content to social that's interesting, entertaining, helpful, and/or relevant to the audience. This means picking relevant topics, writing delightful copy, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy\">posting compelling images and videos</a>.</p> \n<h4>12. Post at the best times for your audience.</h4> \n<p>Another common question: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-times-post-pin-tweet-social-media-infographic\">When’s the best time to post to Facebook</a>? Unfortunately, there's no perfect answer -- different businesses may find different days and times work best for them. Timing often depends on what your target audience uses Facebook for, the region(s) you're targeting, the content of your post (e.g. funny or serious), and your goals (e.g. clicks versus shares), and so on.</p> \n<p>That being said, <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/\">there is data out there on optimal times to post on Facebook</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The best time to post on Facebook is Wednesday, 11 a.m. and 1–2 p.m. Other optimal times include Tuesday through Thursday, 8 a.m.–3 p.m.</li> \n <li>The worst times to post on Facebook on Sundays, or every day either before 7 a.m. or after 5 p.m.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Think of this data as a general guideline, and use it to help you find the optimal posting times for your business.</p> \n<h4>13. Post your best blog content.</h4> \n<p>For businesses, social media continues to be driven by content. It's a marketer's job to post content to social that's interesting, entertaining, helpful, and/or relevant to our audience. Start populating your Page's timeline with content by handpicking your best, most helpful blog posts.</p> \n<p>If you're strapped for resources but maintain a business blog, you can try connecting your blog to auto-post links to new blog content you publish. Many blogging platforms (like <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-trial-social-media-tools\" title=\"HubSpot\">HubSpot) </a>automatically offer this feature within the software -- you'll just need to turn it on and sync it with your Page. You don't want to put too much emphasis on automation, though. It's OK to auto-publish <em>some </em>content, but make sure a real human is posting and engaging with your fans, too.</p> \n<h4>14. Make sure your blog posts' meta descriptions are complete.</h4> \n<p>Have you noticed that when you post a link to Facebook, it pulls in a brief description as well as an image?</p> \n<p>The description gets pulled from <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/meta-descriptions\">the page's meta description</a>, which refers to the HTML attribute that explains the contents of a given web page. It's the short description you see on a search engine results page to \"preview\" what the page is about, and it's also the copy Facebook will automatically pull in the populate the description of a post.</p> \n<p>Without a meta description, Facebook may pull in the first text they can find, which doesn't make for a very good user experience. Plus, meta descriptions are your chance to sell your visitors on what you have to offer: informative, valuable content.</p> \n<p>Your meta description should be compelling enough to get people to click, and it should be <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/character-limit-social-media-blog-posts#Blog\">155 characters or fewer</a> in length. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-meta-description-ht\">Read this blog post</a> to learn more about writing effective meta descriptions.</p> \n<h4>15. Remove links from your post copy.</h4> \n<p>Keep your copy succinct by removing the horrendously long URL you're sharing from the text in your post.</p> \n<p>Your post real estate is precious, and you want to ensure any characters employed are purely for the sake of sparking a reader's attention. Plus, any user can click on the generated thumbnail or title for that URL to navigate to the blog post, web page, or any URL you're linking to -- so no need to include it in the copy of your post as well.</p> \n<h4>16. Post your most compelling visual content.</h4> \n<p>Facebook's timeline page design places more of an emphasis on visual content like images and videos. After all, Facebook posts with images see <a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/blog/how-to-massively-boost-your-blog-traffic-with-these-5-awesome-image-stats/\">2.3X more engagement</a> than posts without images. <a href=\"http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Photos-Cluttering-Your-Facebook-Feed-Herersquos-Why/1010777\">One study found</a> that Facebook posts with photos saw the most engagement over any other type of post, accounting for a whopping 87% of total interactions.</p> \n<p>That's why posting compelling visual content is one of the most important things you can do to improve your Facebook strategy. Use this to your advantage <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/shareable-visual-content\">posting your best visual content to your Facebook Page</a>, or making more of an effort to make the content you already create more visual. (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/templates-shareable-graphics-social-media\">Click here to download 50 social media image templates for free</a>.)</p> \n<p>A successful social strategy will often include photos, videos, and screenshots of infographics or other graphs. In addition to being fun to look at, it's important that your visual content be compelling and relevant to your audience.</p> \n<p>Another reason to post lots of visual content? It'll help auto-populate the \"Photos\" and \"Videos\" tabs, which are automatically added to every Facebook Page. You want those to be rife with visual content when people click on them.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cisco-facebook-photos-tab.png?width=500&amp;name=cisco-facebook-photos-tab.png\" alt=\"Cisco Facebook photos tab.\" title=\"cisco-facebook-photos-tab.png\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<h4>17. Make sure your images are properly formatted.</h4> \n<p>Don't just post images for the sake of posting images. To give your users the best experience possible, you need to optimize your images for Facebook so that they're the right sizes and dimensions. (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-cover-photos\">Click here to download pre-sized cover photo templates for Facebook and other social networks for free</a>.)</p> \n<p>Below are a few of the most common Facebook image sizes, but <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">you can find a more detailed guide here</a>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Cover photo: 820 px wide by 312 px tall</li> \n <li>Profile image: 170 px wide by 170 px tall</li> \n <li>Shared image: 1200 px wide by 630 px tall</li> \n <li>Shared link thumbnail image: 1200 px wide by 627 px tall</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>18. Post videos, especially live videos.</h4> \n<p>The folks at Facebook know that people like watching videos on Facebook. The number of people watching video content is rapidly increasing. In fact, there are more than <a href=\"https://www.omnicoreagency.com/facebook-statistics/\">4 billion video views</a> on Facebook every day.</p> \n<p>Facebook is continuing to tweak <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-algorithm-works-facebook-twitter-instagram\">how the algorithm measures people's interest</a> in video content on Facebook, but the main takeaway is to make your videos as visually engaging as possible -- especially in the first few seconds.</p> \n<p>Why? Because although all videos on Facebook autoplay in people's News Feeds, they're on mute until the viewer manually turns the volume on. The more visually engaging your video, the more you can entice people to stick around. Getting people to spend more time watching your video will help your video rank higher in the News Feed because to Facebook, signs of user engagement with a video include spending time watching the video, turning on the audio, switching to full-screen mode, or enabling high definition.</p> \n<p>In their continued effort to promote video content in the News Feed, Facebook <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-live-guide\">launched Facebook Live</a>, a live video streaming service that lets anyone broadcast live videos from their mobile device straight to their Facebook News Feed.</p> \n<h4>19. Use <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/insights\">Facebook Insights</a>.</h4> \n<p>Facebook Insights is Facebook's internal analytics tool right that helps you measure and analyze your Facebook presence. The tool provides Facebook page administrators with analytics data about Page visits and engagement, which can help you understand which content is and isn't engaging to your fans.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/insights\">Access your page's Insights here</a>, or by clicking into the 'Admin Panel' on your Page. We've also published an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31965/How-to-Analyze-Facebook-Insights-to-Improve-Your-Content-Strategy-With-Video.aspx\" title=\"informative blog post and video\"> informative blog post and video </a> that walk you through how to analyze Facebook Insights to improve your content strategy.</p> \n<h4>20. Schedule posts in advance.</h4> \n<p>Scrambling for Facebook content is not a new phenomenon. We have meetings. We run late. Things come up. That's why you'll want to use a third-party Facebook application like <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/free-trial-social-media-tools\" title=\"HubSpot's social media publishing tool\">HubSpot's social media publishing tool</a> to schedule your Facebook posts (and other social media posts) in advance.</p> \n<p>First, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\">download our free social media content calendar template</a> to help plan your posts in advance. You can fill it in at the same day and time every single week to prep for the following week's social media content. Then, use that third-party Facebook application to actually schedule out your posts.</p> \n<p>However, just as we advised against too much Facebook automation with blog auto-posting, the same holds true for scheduling. Don't get caught in the trap of turning your page into a robot, and make sure you're actively engaging with your fans, too.</p> \n<h4>21. Add Facebook social media buttons to your blog and website.</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx#facebook\">Adding Facebook social media buttons</a> will help encourage visitors who are on your website to also connect and interact with you on Facebook, as well as spread your content and expand its reach.</p> \n<p>The Facebook Follow Button lets you expand your Facebook reach by making it easy for your site visitors to Like your business' Facebook Page with just one click. It displays your page's number of Likes, as well as faces of people who already like your page, using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32418/10-Ways-to-Instantly-Amplify-the-Social-Proof-of-Your-Marketing.aspx\">social proof</a> to amplify its effectiveness.</p> \n<p>The Facebook Like Box lets you promote your business' Facebook Page on your website and blog, highlight other users who have already Liked your page, display your follower count, and feature recent posts on your page. With just one click, people can Like your business Page -- without leaving your site.</p> \n<p>The Facebook Like Button lets people easily Like your content. When a user Likes a piece of content, it may show up in your friends' News Feeds because the algorithm takes it as a signal your friends will find it relevant.</p> \n<p>(Note: This button doesn't allow them to add personalized messages to links before sharing them. To allow users to add a personalized message, use the Facebook Share Button, explained below.)</p> \n<p>To customize your Facebook Like Button, <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/\">visit this page</a> and follow the instructions.</p> \n<p>Facebook Share Buttons act similarly to the Like Button by sharing your content on their Timeline and in friends' News Feeds, except they also let people add a comment or message to the link when sharing it.</p> \n<p>To generate a Facebook Share Button, <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button\">visit this page</a> and follow the instructions.</p> \n<h4>22. Subscribe to Facebook's Official Blog for future announcements from Facebook.</h4> \n<p>Give yourself a competitive edge by staying on top of the latest announcements from Facebook such as new features and tools by subscribing to the official <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/\" title=\"Facebook Blog\">Facebook Blog</a>.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Tips For Advertising on Facebook</h3> \n<h4>23. Choose the right advertising tool.</h4> \n<p>Facebook offers users the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/creation\">Ads Manager</a>. Facebook's Ads Manager works great for most companies. Figure out which is best for your business based on your company size and the number of ads you plan to run at once.</p> \n<h4>24. Use Audience Insights to learn about your audience.</h4> \n<p>The best Facebook ads are high-quality, relevant ads that fit seamlessly into the user's environment on Facebook. Learn more about your customers and prospects using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-audience-insights-guide\">Audience Insights</a>, which you can find inside the Facebook Ad Manager in the left-hand navigation.</p> \n<p>The tool will help you target your ads more effectively and learn about your audience -- even if you are not advertising to them. How? The data can help you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">build stronger buyer personas</a>, create more compelling content, and uncover some gems for your competitive research.</p> \n<h4>25. Test multiple versions of a single ad.</h4> \n<p>Running a single campaign won't give you much to work with in terms of finding your audience, optimizing your ads, and determining if Facebook advertising works for your business. You need to be able and willing to run multiple campaigns to test and experiment with different parts of a single campaign.</p> \n<p>Test your targeting first, using a simple advertisement and basic image. In order to reach and test on a wider audience, you're going to have to invest a reasonable amount of money on your campaign. <a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/blog/acquire-new-customers-social-media/\">The folks at BuzzSumo suggest</a> that number be in the thousands. The reason for this? Facebook ads reward you for testing more ads and targets. Whereas cost-per-click doesn't change much when you're advertising on Google or LinkedIn, <a href=\"http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/facebook-case-studies/\">Facebook ads cost a lot less</a> if you're diligently testing them.</p> \n<p>Then, you can test the creative side of the ad, including images, headlines, and body text. Try testing 20–25 variations on your proven targets.</p> \n<p>Facebook is still a great tool for your business and it's important to figure out how it can work for your company.</p> \n<p>Want to learn more? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-paid-ad-checklist\">Read this blog post to learn more about creating, optimizing, and analyzing your Facebook ads</a>.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1ed53ce-abab-413f-b67a-846d53ac1657&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"generate leads with facebook\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1ed53ce-abab-413f-b67a-846d53ac1657.png\" /></a> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F24422%2Fthe-ultimate-facebook-marketing-cheat-sheet.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83.png","linkMd5":"9f9bf98b9b36b85c4554b8c20590bb46","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn55@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-30-600_6a8ae002ca8736e9.webp","destWidth":612,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6310,"destBytes":9676,"author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich Cox)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9f7c45b7-c71b-4797-8d5d-e6b296fb6a83.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn55@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-30-600_6a8ae002ca8736e9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jcrew-facebook-cover-photo.png?width=690&height=300&name=jcrew-facebook-cover-photo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn2@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-52-114_51e2e853f0cd40ed.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/makr-facebook-profile-photo.png?width=690&height=300&name=makr-facebook-profile-photo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn88@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-54-697_35dd718f91ac3d17.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/wistia-about-preview-facebook.png?width=314&height=172&name=wistia-about-preview-facebook.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn46@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-54-914_74a42d1870473d64.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tahaza-about-preview-facebook.png?width=318&height=367&name=tahaza-about-preview-facebook.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn42@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-59-666_1f5152189fed10c9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zappos-about-preview-facebook-1.png?width=311&height=132&name=zappos-about-preview-facebook-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn50@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-01-795_24298cf92118c775.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dollar-shave-club-facebook-page-cta.png?width=690&height=299&name=dollar-shave-club-facebook-page-cta.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-59-867_ebaa37876c2e8c7b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zendesk-facebook-jobs-tab.png?width=550&name=zendesk-facebook-jobs-tab.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn33@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-54-950_2d1433e146cec544.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cisco-facebook-photos-tab.png?width=500&name=cisco-facebook-photos-tab.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn71@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-54-446_f64fc564428f4875.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1ed53ce-abab-413f-b67a-846d53ac1657.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-55-798_43149526df2d3104.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F24422%2Fthe-ultimate-facebook-marketing-cheat-sheet.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn18@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-52-407_8cdc49e3b238b53f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370165},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"What Consumers Want to See on Company Websites [New Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5521/chart-of-the-week-what-buyers-want-from-your-website.aspx","description":"<p>For many businesses, a website is undeniably critical for reaching new audiences — and is often the first impression someone will have of your brand.</p> \n<p>But having a website alone isn't enough to reach and convert new customers. It's equally vital that your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/website-strategy\">website is well-designed</a>, or you risk losing valuable leads.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;Website design plays a huge role for a few reasons: First, web design can impact your website's ability to rank on search engines for keywords related to your products or services. Additionally, web design can influence whether a user stays on your site once they find it.</p> \n<p>And, lastly, web design will ultimately impact how many leads and prospects you're able to convert into customers.</p> \n<p>Good website design always begins with the question, \"What is the main <em>action</em>&nbsp;we want someone to take when they visit our site?\"</p> \n<p>However, \"good\" website design can seem vague — what exactly do marketers mean when they say, \"That's an impressive website design\"?</p> \n<p>To uncover key design features you'll want to include in your website in 2021 and beyond, we asked 285 people around the U.S. which elements they feel are most important for a company website.</p> \n<p>Here are their responses.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/Which%20element(s)%20are%20most%20important%20for%20a%20business%20website_.pdf\"><img alt=\"graph depicting the most important elements of a company website\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Consumers%20Want%20to%20See%20on%20Company%20Websites,%20According%20to%20Marketers%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png?width=624&amp;height=416&amp;name=What%20Consumers%20Want%20to%20See%20on%20Company%20Websites,%20According%20to%20Marketers%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/Which%20element(s)%20are%20most%20important%20for%20a%20business%20website_.pdf?_ga=2.71012245.466989618.1615579045-1889142982.1615579045\">Click here for the PDF version of this graph.&nbsp;</a></p> \n<h3>1. According to 62% of those polled, including contact information on your website is critical.</h3> \n<p>Including contact information seems simple, but a lot of companies miss this. And it's undeniably important — in fact, those surveyed rated \"Contact Us Information\" as the most important element you can include on your company's website.</p> \n<p>You'll want to include the phone number, email address, or other contact medium you want people to reach you for sales inquiries — preferably in an easy-to-find location, like the header of the page.</p> \n<p>Also, consider including a clickable \"Email us!\" CTA that either opens an email client or links to your contact form. And, speaking of forms, you might want to embed \"Contact Us\" forms throughout your site. Visitors don't need to go on a scavenger hunt to find out how to get in touch with you.</p> \n<h3>2. 19% believe a blog is most important.</h3> \n<p>All digital, social, and other online marketing requires quality content. And a blog is one of the most effective opportunities you have to create and distribute high-quality content related to your products or services.</p> \n<p>Out of those surveyed, 19% believe it's actually the most important element on a business' website.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To get maximum SEO benefit, your blog should be listed under your domain (something like www.yourcompany/blog) instead of off-site through a third-party service.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a blog can help you reach new audiences, increase brand awareness, and convert prospects through educational, valuable content.</p> \n<h3>3. An About Us page is a vital element, and can help your brand share its story.</h3> \n<p>Sharing your story and highlighting core values is critical for your brand's long-term success. In fact, 85% of consumers say they'll only consider a brand&nbsp;if they <em>trust</em>&nbsp;the brand.</p> \n<p>As shown in the poll we conducted, an About Us page is the second-highest rated element, with 31% ruling an About Us page the most important element — overshadowing live chat, product images/video, and even case studies.</p> \n<p>Simply put, people care about who they do business with, so tell people who you are and why your work matters. That said, keep it brief. Customers don't have time to read a research paper.</p> \n<p>For About Us page inspiration, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remarkable-about-us-page-examples\">26 About Us &amp; About Me Pages + Templates to Make Your Own</a>.</p> \n<h3>4. You'll want to include social media icons to drive traffic to your social pages.</h3> \n<p>We know social media icons are important, but I was surprised to see this element overshadow live chat, customer case studies, and blog as the most important element of a company's website, according to 30% of those surveyed.</p> \n<p>Once your website is regularly bringing in traffic, it's important you link out to your social media pages so prospects and customers can follow you.</p> \n<p>However, it's important you don't overdo it — when in doubt, go for simplicity over scale. For instance, <a href=\"https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/insights/g/consumer-trends-2021-report\">if you work for an ecommerce company</a>, consider linking to a few visually appealing pages, such as Instagram, Pinterest, or YouTube.</p> \n<p>Of course, don't add platforms that you don't update regularly. You're building trust, and that comes by regularly having updated and relevant content and answering queries from customers and leads.</p> \n<h3>5. According to 20% percent of those polled, customer testimonials can effectively take your website to the next level.</h3> \n<p>Potential customers need to trust you before choosing to work with you. Fortunately, customer <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/testimonial-page-examples\">testimonial pages</a>&nbsp;can help you effectively build that trust with prospects.</p> \n<p>Use your website to build your credibility by sharing your expertise and successful track record with clients and customers. When you do get testimonials, ask your clients for permission to use their real names. Real endorsements from recognizable businesses and organizations means a lot more than an anonymous testimonial or a&nbsp;quote from a&nbsp;fictional&nbsp;persona.</p> \n<p>Case study pages should have a consistent, concise format and template to explain what problem a customer had, how your company solved it, and what process you&nbsp;used&nbsp;to get to resolution.</p> \n<h3>6. Geographic details are invaluable for local search SEO.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-seo\">46% of all Google searches are looking for local information</a>&nbsp;— which means if your business isn't optimized for local search, you could be missing out on potential customers who are searching for products or services within your geographical region.</p> \n<p>And, as shown in our research, 26% feel a business' physical location is a key component of an effective website.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The pandemic has made many of us forget a physical world exists. Most businesses with brick-and-mortar locations rely on customers within a certain geographic area. Fortunately, when many people search for a product or service, they include a location. Including your location information will help your SEO strategy and help people unfamiliar with your region find your business.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you need a locksmith, you might search \"locksmith in Maplewood, NJ.\" This is why you should use your location in page titles and other metadata, as well as in the text that appears on your website. If you have several cities you serve, you should consider creating landing pages on your site for each location for easier navigation.</p> \n<h3>7. Live chat is an important element of a business' website&nbsp;in 2021.</h3> \n<p>According to 28% of our respondents, live chat is a necessary component of a successful website.</p> \n<p>Chatbots can't replace&nbsp;real people with customer service, but they <em>are</em>&nbsp;a good alternative for those who don't want to call or email and may be inquiring about services or simple FAQs. To meet customers where they are and provide the instant feedback they require, consider installing a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customers-want-live-chat\">live chat option on your website</a>.</p> \n<p>Chatbots are easy to program and many don't even require code. Artificial intelligence has made this functionality much more feasible for companies of all sizes. In fact, many companies offer live chat as a simple plugin for your CMS platform.</p> \n<p>Other reasons to consider a chatbot:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/Case%2BStudy%2BWells%2BFargo%2BProves%2BThe%2BBusiness%2BCase%2BFor%2BOnline%2BChat/-/E-RES57154?objectid=RES57154\">44% of online consumers</a>&nbsp;say having questions answered by a live person while in the middle of an online purchase is one of the most important features a website can offer.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/Case%2BStudy%2BWells%2BFargo%2BProves%2BThe%2BBusiness%2BCase%2BFor%2BOnline%2BChat/-/E-RES57154?objectid=RES57154\">63% said they are more likely to return</a>&nbsp;to a website if it offers live chat.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/Case%2BStudy%2BWells%2BFargo%2BProves%2BThe%2BBusiness%2BCase%2BFor%2BOnline%2BChat/-/E-RES57154?objectid=RES57154\">38% said they made their purchase</a>&nbsp;due to the chat session itself, and <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/Case%2BStudy%2BWells%2BFargo%2BProves%2BThe%2BBusiness%2BCase%2BFor%2BOnline%2BChat/-/E-RES57154?objectid=RES57154\">62% reported</a>&nbsp;being more likely to purchase&nbsp;from the site again.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>8. 27% of people say it's most important to use original videos and images of your products or services on your website.</h3> \n<p>Customers like images —&nbsp;but they are weary of stock photos, particularly of products or services. This is where authentic behind-the-scenes videos and photos can help.</p> \n<p>For instance, if&nbsp;your company provides a service such as landscape design or IT maintenance, show before-and-after pictures of your work.</p> \n<p>If your service is something less tangible,&nbsp;such as insurance or life coaching, show&nbsp;pictures of your friendly staff and your belief system using visuals. Or, better yet, include video. Videos where you are explaining your business' purpose are powerful opportunities for increasing trust with potential customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>9. According to 10% of those polled, a newsletter sign-up button is a valuable component of a company's website.</h3> \n<p>Offering visitors to your site a chance to stay up-to-date via a subscription to your blog posts, newsletters, or product&nbsp;releases is a great way to stay top-of-mind for prospects and customers and increase brand loyalty.</p> \n<p>A subscription will let you share information about your company through email marketing, and build your email list at the same time. Use this list to share information you think your clients and prospects will find valuable whenever you have it.</p> \n<h3>Finally, Don't Forget About Analytics</h3> \n<p>Should you simply limit your web design to just these nine&nbsp;important design elements? Of course not. Depending on your industry&nbsp;and business needs,&nbsp;there are a number of other design integrations that should be considered a priority.</p> \n<p>And, of course, we can't&nbsp;forget the value of a&nbsp;compelling homepage, effective&nbsp;site navigation, mobile responsiveness, and more technical aspects like readability and accessibility.</p> \n<p>There's also one other critical element you should consider when designing your website: Analytics. Analytics can help you determine how your website is currently performing, the pages that attract the most visitors, and how you might improve and iterate on your web design for the long-haul.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, it's important to continue testing your web design over time to ensure it continues to meet — and exceed — consumers expectations.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F5521%2Fchart-of-the-week-what-buyers-want-from-your-website.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png","linkMd5":"4e7b94a4c055d6c96f06fa4b220167a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-681_5a38291bbbb54ba3.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5125,"destBytes":6842,"author":"Geoffrey Colon","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-681_5a38291bbbb54ba3.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Consumers%20Want%20to%20See%20on%20Company%20Websites,%20According%20to%20Marketers%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png?width=624&height=416&name=What%20Consumers%20Want%20to%20See%20on%20Company%20Websites,%20According%20to%20Marketers%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn83@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-59-731_21e977466d69ea46.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-54-880_b69ef96b2d492171.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F5521%2Fchart-of-the-week-what-buyers-want-from-your-website.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn85@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-07-469_28eee9db56c55b27.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370115},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:29","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:29","title":"Do Blog Posts Actually Lead to Purchases [New Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/do-blog-posts-lead-to-purchases","description":"<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/executive-marketing-leadership-survey?utm_source=hscm-exec-marketing-leadership-canva-122020-hpbnr&amp;_ga=2.198436399.1807057516.1616632512-1796057632.1616632512\">2021 Executive Marketing Leadership Survey</a>, 20% of marketing leaders described company blogs as one of their \"most important channels\" for hitting goals.</p>  \n<p>The enduring importance placed on blogging isn't shocking.

And, if you're a marketing manager on a tight budget, you might only be interested in tactics that directly benefit your bottom line.</p> \n<p>As you determine how you'll invest your time, effort, and money in 2021, you might ask yourself, \"Will my blog posts actually lead to purchases?\"</p> \n<p>To help marketers answer the question above, we surveyed nearly 300 consumers using Lucid software to learn if reading company blog posts had ever led them to make purchases from that brand.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=79c9c1d7-e329-46a2-9095-7ebf693a17f9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: How to Start a Successful Blog [Free Guide]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/79c9c1d7-e329-46a2-9095-7ebf693a17f9.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>Do Blog Posts Lead to Purchases?</h2> \n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?_ga=2.198436399.1807057516.1616632512-1796057632.1616632512\">growth of other content strategies</a>, like video marketing, might have you thinking that consumers will only buy products after seeing them on other platforms, you might be surprised by how consumers responded to our survey question.</p> \n<p>When we asked, \"Have you ever purchased something from a company after reading a blog post from them?\", a whopping 56% said, \"Yes.\"</p> \n<p><img alt=\"percentage of people who've bought something after reading a blog is 56%\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Do%20Blog%20Posts%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png?width=624&amp;height=416&amp;name=Do%20Blog%20Posts%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http://luc.id\" style=\"font-size: 10px;\">Data Source</a></em></p> \n<p>While blogs are <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?_ga=2.206679699.1807057516.1616632512-1796057632.1616632512\">no longer the most commonly used type of marketing content</a>, data like the small survey above reaffirms that blogging is still an effective way to market your brand and even sell products.</p> \n<h2>Why Blogs Lead to Purchases</h2> \n<p>If your company has a blog that discusses your industry or how your offerings can help with the average reader's everyday pain points, your audiences can discover and gain trust in your brand's expertise. That trust and credibility could ultimately lead to purchases.</p> \n<p>Why? If a prospect trusts the advice or information given in your blog posts, they might trust that your offerings are better quality than your competitor's because your brand knows the industry, what customers want, and the pain points that your product or service solves.</p> \n<p>Even if you prefer video, social media, or visual marketing strategies, it's important to remember that blogs can help you sell products in ways that other content types can't.</p> \n<p>For instance, while videos and images might only give prospects a glimpse of how a product or service works in real life, blog posts can offer extensive information that a visual content editor might need to cut to avoid overwhelming a viewer on social media or other platforms.</p> \n<p>And, while blog posts offer more chances to provide in-depth information than some content types, they also could increase your search ranking and allow more opportunities to link directly to a landing or purchasing page. Because of this, consumers could find your content via search, read your post, and click straight to a product purchasing page with low friction after your content has persuaded them to buy a product.</p> \n<p>Additionally, because most blog sites allow you to embed videos, podcasts, and imagery, your company blog can also be a great place to promote your other marketing assets while still informing prospects about your brand. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the next year, consider a mix of content marketing that includes blogging. Not sure how to persuade shoppers with your blog posts? Here are a few quick tips.</p> \n<h2>How to Lead Readers to Purchases</h2> \n<h3>Strategically place product page links and CTAs.</h3> \n<p>Aside from mentioning your brand, product, or service where it feels natural in your blog posts, you can also use hyperlinks to link out to product pages, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-ctas-blog?_ga=2.170502816.1807057516.1616632512-1796057632.1616632512\">CTA buttons that draw slightly more attention</a>&nbsp;to a product or offer without directing reader attention too far away from the blog post.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we usually place <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-anchor-text-call-to-action-study?_ga=2.170502816.1807057516.1616632512-1796057632.1616632512\">at least three CTAs related to a blog topic in each post</a>: a text-based CTA in the introduction, a larger banner image at the bottom, and a slide-in CTA that shows up to the side of your text as you're scrolling through the middle of the post. This allows three mentions of a product or offering without interrupting the reader's experience.</p> \n<h3>Offer a free resource:</h3> \n<p>If your brand sells a subscription, service, or product that's on the pricier side or needs leadership approval from your company, blog readers might need more than a few blog posts to trust your brand and invest in your product. In that case, you might need to focus on lead-nurturing rather than sending blog readers directly to a purchasing page.</p> \n<p>HubSpot and many other blogs have grown their contact and qualified lead lists simply by creating a free downloadable resource, such as an ebook, template, or research report, and offering it through CTAs at the end of blog posts.</p> \n<p>Below is an example of a recent free research report resource we offered at the end of one of our Sales Blog posts:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"example of a blog post with a bottom CTA\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Do%20Blog%20Posts%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png?width=578&amp;name=Do%20Blog%20Posts%20Actually%20Lead%20to%20Purchases%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 578px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"578\"></p> \n<p>To access free -- <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ungated-content-free?_ga=2.208259858.1807057516.1616632512-1796057632.1616632512\">but gated</a>&nbsp;-- offers, readers must give basic information about themselves and their company. From there, they receive an automated email or instant download of the resource while also becoming a contact -- or lead -- and enter our lead-qualification process to see if they could be a good prospect to reach out to.</p> \n<p>The HubSpot Blog's free resource strategy results in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-anchor-text-call-to-action-study?_ga=2.208259858.1807057516.1616632512-1796057632.1616632512\">thousands of qualified leads</a>&nbsp;per year that could potentially convert into HubSpot customers. You can learn more about how to implement it on your blog <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-anchor-text-call-to-action-study\">here</a>.</p> \n<h3 style=\"color: #434343; font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"color: #434343; font-size: 14px;\">Remember, quality beats over-promotion.</span></h3> \n<p>In another <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-do-people-read-blogs#:~:text=At%20the%20HubSpot%20Blog%2C%20each,teaches%20readers%20about%20something%20specific.&amp;text=We%20also%20like%20to%20include,ve%20just%20taught%20them%20about.\">recent Lucid survey</a>, one-third of our group of general consumer respondents most commonly read blog posts to \"learn something new.\" Meanwhile, roughly 20% read blog posts for the sake of entertainment.</p> \n<p>As a content creator, it's important to remember that readers will likely find your blog because they're looking for information related to an industry they work in, want to learn something related to their hobbies, or need solutions for a pain point they deal with in their daily or professional lives.</p> \n<p>Odds are, they're not looking solely for promotional content. If a reader visits your blog site and finds nothing but blog posts filled with product shots and cheesy advertorial language, they might lose interest in your content and might not develop the sense of trust needed to make a purchase.</p> \n<p>While it's wise to place a few unintrusive CTAs in your blog posts, and even mention your product or service when it feels relevant, be sure your content primarily offers valuable guidance, advice, and information that will help your reader and fulfill their needs.</p> \n<p>For example, in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ai-social-media-tools?_ga=2.208259858.1807057516.1616632512-1796057632.1616632512\">this post about AI social media tools</a>, we give valuable information about how to implement AI-based technology in a social media process while listing HubSpot as one of the tools readers can use. While we still mention our offerings, the post's goal is to show readers how multiple AI tools can streamline a marketing process.</p> \n<h2>Creating Your Blog Nurturing Process</h2> \n<p>Ultimately, every brand has a target audience with different interests and content needs. While one blog strategy, such as free resources, will work well to generate qualified leads for a B2B company, other tactics, like simply linking to a product in blog posts, might be more lucrative for consumer-facing brands.</p> \n<p>As you focus more on turning your blog traffic into revenue, keep these questions in mind:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What information is valuable to my audience?</li> \n <li>Does my product require lead nurturing such gated offers?</li> \n <li>Will the tactic I'm using seem over-promotional or disengaging to my audience?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Want to learn more about how the HubSpot blog generates leads? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-anchor-text-call-to-action-study\">Check out this post</a>&nbsp;from one of our content acquisition managers.

Even worse, it started to decline. So, after months of stressing over the mysterious cause of our blog's traffic plateau, we decided to sit down, chug a bunch of coffee, and find the culprit.</p> \n<p>We discovered that our editorial strategy of brainstorming topics and relying on our intuition to determine our audience's content preferences was no longer enough. We decided to pivot and focus our energies on the channel that has consistently generated most of our blog’s traffic for its entire existence — organic search.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Today, years after we adjusted our organic strategy, we've exceeded the majority of our monthly traffic goals and even broke some monthly traffic records. Needless to say, we're thrilled (and relieved) that our organic strategy fueled our traffic boost and shattered the great traffic plateau of 2017. In this post, we’ll outline the essential tips that helped us drive our organic strategy, with insight from HubSpot SEO experts.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: SEO Starter Pack [Free Kit]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Download this checklist and save it to your desktop to check-off an SEO tip every time you complete it.</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/checklist.jpg?width=304&amp;name=checklist.jpg\" alt=\"downloadable seo checklist \" width=\"304\" style=\"width: 304px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>1. Spend as much time on the SERPs as you do in tools.</h3> \n<p>Even though an algorithm dictates a search engine's results page (SERPs) rankings, the algorithm rewards web publishers that craft the best content on the internet.</p> \n<p>Because of this, it’s important to understand search intent. To accomplish this, we analyze a keyword's SERP and determine the problems users are trying to solve when searching for this query.</p> \n<p>Aja Frost, the Head of English SEO at HubSpot, says, \"Yes, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-analysis-tools?_ga=2.23075065.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">tools</a> offer us a ton of information. But that information is often based on incomplete, out-of-date, or biased data sets. I encourage SEOs to combine the insights they're getting from their tools with real-time clues on the SERPs. Every time you decide to target a new keyword, refresh a piece of content, or diagnose a page or section of pages with irregular traffic, take a look at what's coming up for the main queries on Google.\"</p> \n<p>Depending on your goal, Frost says to pay attention to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Search features,</li> \n <li>The type of content that's ranking (product pages, listicles, tutorials, etc.),</li> \n <li>The websites that are ranking (databases, businesses, media sites, directories, etc.),</li> \n <li>How far down the page the first organic result appears,</li> \n <li>How your page shows up (title, meta description, date, jump links, schema if applicable, etc.).</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When you conduct these kinds of searches, \"Don't forget to use an incognito window, frequently clear your cache, cookies, and history, and run your searches on both a desktop and phone,\" Frost adds.</p> \n<h3>2. Master the SERP overlap test.</h3> \n<p>While in SERPs, Frost conducts a SERP overlap test. She says, \"I use this test all the time to determine whether to target two-plus queries with a single piece of content.\"</p> \n<p>Now, you might be wondering, what is the SERP overlap test?</p> \n<p>Frost details the steps below:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Do a quick search in incognito for Keyword A and a separate search for Keyword B.</li> \n <li>If the SERPs look fairly different (i.e., the top-ranking pages are different, or the first result for Keyword A is the ninth result for Keyword B), Google treats those queries as separate searches with different intent.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>However, if the SERPs have a lot of overlap, you can treat them as the same query.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>3. Aim for the featured snippets in SERPs.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-featured-snippet-box?_ga=2.23075065.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">Featured snippets</a> are what search engines use to display an answer to a query directly on the SERP, so a user doesn't need to visit another page to get the answer to their question. The image below is an example of a featured snippet for the query “What is inbound marketing?”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-01%20at%203.46.59%20PM.jpg?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-01%20at%203.46.59%20PM.jpg\" alt=\"what is inbound marketing featured snippet box in google search results\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>As you can imagine, featured snippets <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-traffic-and-snippets?_ga=2.220205147.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">impact organic search results</a>, which is why it’s also essential to try and rank with as many featured snippets as possible.</p> \n<p>To do so, create posts that answer specific questions users have. The content within your featured snippet must be semantically relevant to the keyword a user searches for. This means that you can’t answer the question of “What is inbound marketing?” with unrelated content as the algorithm knows enough to detect relationships between the keywords and descriptions you give.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Additionally, your blog post should be organized and formatted in a way that lets Google know you've answered a question. For instance, this could mean using specific coding, so your featured snippet stands out on the page.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to Karla Cook, the Senior Manager of HubSpot's blog team, \"Targeting featured snippets with consistently formatted sections has removed some (but definitely not all) of the guesswork when it comes to ranking for featured snippets.\"</p> \n<p>\"Matthew Howells-Barby, Vice President of Marketing at HubSpot, has stressed that clean and consistent code is a significant factor in winning snippets.\"</p> \n<div>\n <iframe style=\"border: none; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://listen.casted.us/player/6e702bcd\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>  \n</div> \n<h3>4. Consider on-page SEO, but not everything you publish has to be search-friendly.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33655/a-step-by-step-guide-to-flawless-on-page-seo-free-template.aspx?_ga=2.220205147.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">On-page SEO</a> is the process of optimizing a page on your site with front and back-end components that help you rank higher in search engines. These components include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>High-quality page content</li> \n <li>Page titles</li> \n <li>Headers</li> \n <li>Meta descriptions</li> \n <li>Image alt-text</li> \n <li>Structured markup</li> \n <li>Page URLs</li> \n <li>Internal linking</li> \n <li>Site speed</li> \n</ul> \n<p>For this example, let's focus on the copy-oriented elements like high-quality content, page titles, headers, meta descriptions, and image alt-text.</p> \n<p>You should prioritize creating optimized page copy to improve your SERP rankings. What you write should include your target keyword, be contextually relevant to your target keyword, and answer questions your users may have. Ultimately, the goal is to indicate to search engines that you've answered questions a user might have about a query.</p> \n<p>However, Victor Pan, Head of Technical SEO at HubSpot, says that not everything you publish has to be search-friendly.</p> \n<p>\"This could be ad landing pages, thank-you pages, internal sales enablement pages, and login pages. Prioritize optimizing for search when the opportunity is greater than the time invested, and leave the rest on the back burner. Tackle the back burner once you're able to build a process to reduce the amount of time needed to optimize,\" he adds.</p> \n<h3>5. Target a variety of high and low-volume keywords.</h3> \n<p>With an organic search strategy, it's important to target keywords that span an entire <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey?hsFormKey=0f3cd02747783fc65ebee06a2af3480d&amp;__hstc=259582869.c4a577029c49e44b73bd3bee6fa38565.1589932800150.1589932800151.1589932800152.1&amp;__hssc=259582869.1.1589932800153&amp;__hsfp=1235175601&amp;portalId=53&amp;_preview=true&amp;cacheBust=1594720451930&amp;preview_key=pSOAWoAu&amp;inpageEditorUI=true&amp;benderPackage=InpageEditorUI&amp;staticVersion=static-1.22392&amp;scriptPath=bundles%2Fapp.js&amp;cssPath=bundles%2Fapp.css&amp;hubs_signup-url=preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/content/5241498400&amp;hubs_signup-cta=null&amp;_ga=2.220205147.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">buyer's journey</a>, including a variety of high and low-volume keywords.</p> \n<p>Braden Becker, a Senior SEO Strategist at HubSpot, says, \"Broad, early-interest keywords tend to be higher in volume, while later-interest or even purchase-ready keywords tend to be lower in volume because the audience is more specific. Therefore, you shouldn't be afraid to target low-volume keywords if they have a higher likelihood of turning traffic into leads or customers.\"</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, the SEO team conducts in-depth keyword research for our four onsite blog properties (Marketing, Sales, Service, and Website). They first look for search volume, some as high as 120,000+ and some as low as 50 searches per month.</p> \n<p>According to Frost, it's important <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/organic-search-blog-strategy?_ga=2.220205147.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">to get creative</a> with the high-volume keywords you’re targeting.</p> \n<p>For example, when she was the editor on HubSpot's Sales blog, she assigned content that may have strayed from our usual topics but boasted significant search volume. However, all posts answered our audience’s questions, aligned with our values, and were well-researched and comprehensive.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Consider pruning content after long periods of growth.</h3> \n<p>Pruning your content is the process of reducing the number of indexed pages by deleting old, low-quality content that doesn't add value to your site.</p> \n<p>Becker says, \"Consider 'pruning' content after long periods of growth. As websites grow and scale, you'll find some content fails to perform as expected. As that pile gets bigger, it can have adverse effects on the rest of your site's speed and performance. Audit your site for pages that aren't driving a certain level of traffic, backlinks, or conversions, and unpublish them.\"</p> \n<p>You can learn more about the content pruning process <a href=\"https://cognitiveseo.com/blog/5587/content-pruning-the-technique-that-will-protect-your-rankings-from-google-panda/\">here</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. Consolidate website pages using redirects and canonical tags.</h3> \n<p>When you conduct a site audit, you may find multiple pages containing similar content. If that happens, you should consider consolidating website pages using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7430/what-is-a-301-redirect-and-why-should-you-care.aspx?_ga=2.220205147.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">redirects</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/canonical-url?_ga=2.220205147.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">canonical tags</a>.</p> \n<p>Becker says, \"Nobody wants multiple pieces of website content serving the same purpose because it can cause you to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/keyword-cannibalization?_ga=2.220205147.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">cannibalize</a> your traffic in SERPs.\" To fix this, you can redirect low-performing pages to a page on your site containing related information.</p> \n<p>Becker adds, \"Besides redirecting, if you have exact duplicates, you may even add a canonical tag from the duplicate to the core page, which keeps the duplicate visible but tells Google to prioritize the core page when ranking your website. Be careful when deciding to canonicalize or redirect — these are delicate decisions and should only be made when it makes perfect sense to.\"</p> \n<p>Google explains more about this process <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en\">here</a>.</p> \n<h3>8. Implement a historical optimization strategy.</h3> \n<p>In 2015, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pamelump\">Pam Vaughn</a>, Principal Marketing Manager of HubSpot's Web Strategy and former Editor of HubSpot's Marketing Blog, made a revolutionary discovery about HubSpot's organic blog traffic — the overwhelming majority of it came from posts published before that month. In fact, 76% of our monthly blog views came from these old posts.</p> \n<p>Today, Vaughn's groundbreaking revelation rings louder than ever — 89% of our monthly blog views come from posts published at least six months prior, and we've developed an entire strategy dedicated to refreshing and republishing these historical pieces of content. We call these types of blog posts updates, and they comprise 35-40% of our editorial calendar.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By refreshing them with new information, SEO tactics, and effectively republishing them as new blog posts, we can build upon their existing organic value and user engagement and double or even triple their traffic. This process also helps us optimize our blog for efficiency, decreasing the amount of new content we have to create while simultaneously increasing our organic traffic and conversions.</p> \n<p>Historical optimization isn't for everyone, though. It's a strategy catered for a blog that:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Generates a significant amount of organic traffic,</li> \n <li>Has a considerable amount of blog subscribers,</li> \n <li>Has social media followers that can supply a surge of traffic, shares, and backlinks to your updates,</li> \n <li>Owns a substantial repository of old posts that are worth refreshing and republishing.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you have all four of these things, we recommend implementing a historical optimization strategy. To learn about specific types of historical content you should update and the exact process of updating them, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/historical-blog-seo-conversion-optimization?_ga=2.245104582.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">this blog post</a> written by Pam Vaughn herself.</p> \n<h3>9. Train your website visitors to search for your brand.</h3> \n<p>SEO is used to increase the number of unbranded searches for your business.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Pan says, \"The logic was that these were potential customers that would not have otherwise converted. This logic is good for a young business, but for mature businesses that have a good relationship with their customers, branded traffic is just as important.\"</p> \n<p>For example, platforms like Amazon have trained their customers searching on Google to append \"amazon\" to their searches for site-specific results.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Pan says you can encourage and inspire users to do this by becoming the go-to expert on topics related to your brand. Since Amazon is one of the leading shopping sites, customers refer to the platform for their shopping needs. To become an expert, you have to develop page authority.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>10. Develop page authority.</h3> \n<p>Page authority is <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors\">one of the factors</a> search engines use to determine rankings. For example, if you’re a seasoned blog with a reputation as a go-to industry expert, your site will likely rank higher than pages on a more recent site.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Given this, it’s important to build your brand and authority within your niche. Blogging regularly, posting on social media, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guest-blogging?_ga=2.245104582.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">guest posting on other sites</a>, and simply being active in your industry are valuable ways to build your reputation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Additionally, you should write about tangential topics your customers are interested in, helping you provide them with the most relevant information while also signaling to search engines that you write about your industry in-depth.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All of these strategies will give your website authority and indicate to search engines that they need to pay attention to your domain.</p> \n<h3>11. Leverage the pillar-cluster model.</h3> \n<p>Since people heavily rely on Google to provide accurate and relevant answers to their questions, search engines need to understand every search’s intent and context.</p> \n<p>To do this, Google has evolved to recognize topical connections across user queries, monitor similar queries users have made in the past, and surface content that they deem the most authoritative on the topic. To help Google recognize our blog content as a trusted authority, we decided to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/pillar-cluster-model-transform-blog?_ga=2.245104582.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">implement the pillar-cluster model</a> (further explained in the video below).</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 200px; max-height: 113px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJsQLwTeF60?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By creating a single pillar page that provides a high-level overview of a topic and hyperlinks to cluster pages, we effectively signaled to Google that our pillar page is a source of authority on the subject.</p> \n<p>Another benefit of the pillar-cluster model is that it provides site visitors with a better <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ux-user-experience?_ga=2.245104582.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">user experience</a>. Not only is it easier for Google to crawl our blog and identify semantic relationships between posts, but it's also easier for our audience to find the content they’re looking for.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>12. Create a link-building strategy.</h3> \n<p>Earning high-quality inbound links from websites and pages with high-authority is crucial for boosting your domain authority. Unfortunately, as nice as it would be, \"If you write it, they will link to it” is not a viable SEO tactic.</p> \n<p>The primary method we use to earn high-quality links is networking with other sites with a higher domain or page authority and requesting links to our content. We also make sure our content is relevant to the referring website's content. Another way to earn quality backlinks is by following Backlinko's <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique\">skyscraper method</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The skyscraper method involves identifying content that ranks well for keywords you want to rank for and creating content that is of better quality than the top-ranking posts. Then, you use SEO tools to find the sites that link to your competitor’s content and ask the most authoritative source to replace your competitor’s link with your links.</p> \n<p>Backlinko tried this strategy and asked 160 websites to link to their post about&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors\">Google's 200 Ranking Factors</a>. As a result, they earned 17 backlinks from referring sites with high domain authority, and the posts’ organic traffic increased by 110% in only two weeks.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>13. Don’t change URLs.</h3> \n<p>The inventor of the internet, Tim Berners-Lee, once said, \"Cool URIs don't change.\"</p> \n<p>In fact, it's a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html\">popular saying</a> — \"What makes a cool URI? A cool URI is one which does not change. What sorts of URI change? URIs don't change: people change them.\"</p> \n<p>As a refresher, URI stands for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/uri-vs-url?_ga=2.253260618.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">Uniform Resource Identifier</a> and it is meant to identify a resource, whereas a URL gives information about how to locate a resource. For example, a URI would be your name, and a URL would be your home address. Your name simply identifies you, and a address shares where to find you.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Pan says, \"URLs, a subset of URI's, should change as little as possible. The history of ‘why a URL changes' is filled with good intentions that often get lost with time, so be sure to add a note the same way you should when you notice traffic anomalies.\"</p> \n<p>Note: You can do this within HubSpot's constantly evolving <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cos-general/how-to-redirect-a-hubspot-page?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-tips&amp;hubs_post-cta=URL%20Mapping%20tool&amp;_ga=2.253260618.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">URL Mapping tool</a>.</p> \n<h3>14. Compress and optimize your multimedia files.</h3> \n<p>Compressing multimedia files may not seem like a high priority for your SEO strategy, but it should be. According to Becker, your video, image, and gif file size directly affect your site’s page load speed, which is one of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-ranking-algorithm-infographic?_ga=2.253260618.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">ten most important</a> ranking factors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“The bigger an image's file size, the longer it takes your web browser to load that image, which increases your website's loading time as a whole. And the longer your website's loading time, the more likely it is that Google will penalize you,” he says.</p> \n<p>The act of compression blends similarly colored pixels into single pixels to reduce the image’s resolution and, in turn, file size. These changes are <a href=\"https://fireflydigital.com/image-compression/\">undetectable</a> to the human eye, as it is more sensitive to details between light and dark than colors. Compression does not diminish the impact your images will have on your audience, and your pages will load faster.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>High-quality tools for multimedia file compression are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://squoosh.app/\">Squoosh</a>&nbsp;</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://tinypng.com/\">TinyPNG</a> (supports batch compression)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.youcompress.com/\">You Compress</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://clipchamp.com/en/video-compressor/\">Clipchamp</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>15. Use image alt text.</h3> \n<p>Search engine crawlers that scan your site can’t understand your images unless they include <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/image-alt-text?_ga=2.253260618.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">alt text</a> descriptions. Because of this, adding these descriptions to your pictures is a priority for SEO, as bots will strike against you if they can’t understand what’s on your site pages. Image alt text is also helpful for ranking your site pages in image-based SERPs.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Also, alt text is a best practice for creating an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-accessibility?_ga=2.253260618.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">accessible website</a>. Screen readers can pick up on alt text when converting screen elements, ensuring that all of your site visitors have a consistent browsing experience.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All alt-text should be descriptive, contextually relevant to the page content, and short. Consider the following example from Becker:&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/david-ortiz-fenway-1.jpg?width=690&amp;name=david-ortiz-fenway-1.jpg\" alt=\"David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox batting from home plate at Fenway Park\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/boston-sports-guide\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Low-quality alt text would read “Baseball player hitting a ball at a baseball field,” while descriptive and contextual alt text would read \"David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox batting from home plate at Fenway Park.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>16. Leverage CTAs as often as possible.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Optimizing your page to rank in search engines doesn’t do you any good if your pages aren’t optimized to convert visitors.

Since you can assume that page visitors are there to learn something, CTAs are exciting as they offer more insight and educational information.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>17. Form good relationships with your developers and designers.</h3> \n<p>Hitting your SEO goals isn’t a marketing-specific effort — you’ll also need to collaborate with our developers and designers. Because of this, Frost suggests forming good relationships with these teams.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>She says, \"Get to know these people, learn their language, figure out what motivates them (usually it's cool projects), and, most importantly, teach them important SEO concepts. This could entice them to come to you before deleting an older page that has 500 backlinks.\"</p> \n<h3>18. Conduct a technical SEO audit.</h3> \n<p>When a search engine bot crawls your site for indexing, it needs to understand what your site is. That refers to content but also how your site is set up. Unorganized websites are difficult to index because contextual relationships are hard to discern, and, as a result, these pages won’t rank in SERPs.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Because of this, your site’s <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/technical-seo-guide?_ga=2.224342872.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">technical set-up</a> is a critical component of SEO. These technical aspects can include, but are not limited to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Page speed</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/build-sitemap-website?_ga=2.224342872.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">XML site map</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/parts-url?_ga=2.224342872.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">URL structure</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/website-architecture?_ga=2.224342872.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">Site architecture</a></li> \n <li>Pagination</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To avoid strikes from bots, we recommend conducting a technical audit of your web pages.</p> \n<h3>19. Check, double-check, and triple-check your data.</h3> \n<p>To truly succeed in your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo?_ga=2.224342872.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">SEO strategy</a>, you need to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-analysis-tools?_ga=2.224342872.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">measure your success</a> by checking standard data metrics like organic traffic growth, conversion rate, bounce rate, and keyword rankings.</p> \n<p>Becker says, \"Growing organic traffic takes time, but it also takes a village. When performing keyword research, traffic analysis, or any performance-related audit, always have more than one source of data to guide you.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you see traffic drop in your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-tips&amp;hubs_post-cta=content%20management%20system&amp;_ga=2.224342872.277259835.1614954717-557398049.1614954717\">content management system</a>, check Google Search Console to see which pages that drop has affected. If the decline is concentrated to just a few pages or articles, use a rankings tracker to determine if you've lost position for any high-volume keywords. The smarter your diagnostics are, the better your decisions are in response.</p> \n<h2>SEO Is An Ever-Evolving Landscape</h2> \n<p>This post uncovered tactics that helped us devise an SEO strategy that allowed us to shatter a year-long traffic plateau and break monthly traffic records. However, as SEO is continuously changing, it’s entirely possible that these practices could become obsolete one day.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The moral of our blog's story isn't to glom onto these SEO tactics for the rest of your content marketing career; it's to keep adapting, no matter how well you're performing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in March 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=8835eaa3-be7b-4697-81d2-488e03708d34&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"SEO Starter Pack\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8835eaa3-be7b-4697-81d2-488e03708d34.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fseo-tips&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e.png","linkMd5":"9223624e712c407699c519a21fe0e6da","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-30-734_ac504860637ee534.webp","destWidth":368,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4411,"destBytes":6042,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-30-734_ac504860637ee534.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/checklist.jpg?width=304&name=checklist.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn7@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-54-711_e1f26ab56a087abe.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-01%20at%203.46.59%20PM.jpg?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-01%20at%203.46.59%20PM.jpg":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/david-ortiz-fenway-1.jpg?width=690&name=david-ortiz-fenway-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn94@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-00-142_6ba68c13fbea4bf2.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cta-example.png?width=1374&name=cta-example.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn45@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-59-684_521e88126adb91e9.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8835eaa3-be7b-4697-81d2-488e03708d34.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn18@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-51-552_be9ebc9bbdc9c6d5.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fseo-tips&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn64@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-54-199_cd7de1413a7e8ce0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370011},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"The 10 Best Video Conferencing Tools for Small Businesses","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-conferencing-small-business","description":"<p>Over the past year, marketers got a crash course in remote work.</p> \n<p>As 2021 approached, many of us had already invested in at-home desks, workout equipment, and other tools meant to make work-from-home a little easier.</p> \n<p>At the top of that list? Video conferencing software.</p> \n<p>Video conferencing tools saw a <a href=\"https://www.trustradius.com/vendor-blog/covid-19-software-industry-data-and-statistics\">500% increase in demand in 2020</a>&nbsp;as a result of the worldwide pandemic. And, as the workforce continues to shift to a more <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/post-covid-workplaces\">flexible, hybrid model</a>, it's critical your business invests in equipment designed to foster collaboration regardless of an employee's location.</p> \n<p>But video conferencing software isn't always cheap, and the fancy bells-and-whistles aren't always necessary for small businesses looking for a simple, effective solution.</p> \n<p>Here, we've compiled 10 of the best video conferencing tools for small businesses, ranging in price and features, to help you find the best fit for your needs.</p> \n<p>But first — what are the benefits of video conferencing software, and do you need it, anyway?</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=52250291-8fed-4fe7-ad28-e6e244e1fcd8&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download our complete productivity guide here for more tips on improving your  productivity at work.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/52250291-8fed-4fe7-ad28-e6e244e1fcd8.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>Video Conferencing Benefits</h2> \n<p>Video conferencing offers opportunities for collaboration, productivity, and increased engagement with colleagues, stakeholders, and customers — all without the hassle (and cost) of traveling to an in-person location.</p> \n<p>I could write a whole blog post about the benefits of video conferencing, but for our purposes, let's focus on four:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Video conferencing is a cost-effective opportunity to have face-to-face interactions with colleagues, prospects, stakeholders, or customers. It's more personal and engaging than a phone call, and it's much cheaper and more efficient than paying to commute — or fly — to a physical location to meet someone for an in-person conversation.</li> \n <li>Like mentioned above, video conferencing offers an opportunity for more personal connection. Eye contact, facial expressions, and body language are cues we use to effectively communicate with one another on a daily basis — and those cues are all lost in a phone or email conversation. &nbsp;</li> \n <li>Video conferencing can increase your team's productivity, since it limits the amount of time you spend running to conference rooms in-between meetings, driving to meet a client, etc.</li> \n <li>Video conferencing can foster increased collaboration, as opposed to email or Slack. For instance, if I hear an interesting project a colleague is working on, I'll ask them to join a quick Zoom call with me so we can discuss opportunities for collaboration — which is much more efficient than emailing about it.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>However, video conferencing software can be expensive, and if you work for a small business with limited resources, it can be difficult to persuade leadership that it's a worthwhile investment. Fortunately, you don't have to break the bank to test it out — in fact, a few of the tools in this list are free forever, and others offer free trials.</p> \n<p>Let's dive into the most impressive video conferencing tools we've found for small businesses.</p> \n<h2>10 Best Video Conferencing Tools for Small Businesses</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://explore.zoom.us/meetings\">Zoom</a>&nbsp;</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zoom-Mar-02-2021-08-10-27-46-PM.png?width=1204&amp;name=zoom-Mar-02-2021-08-10-27-46-PM.png\" alt=\"zoom dashboard example\" width=\"1204\" style=\"width: 1204px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> If you're on a tight budget, you can't beat the free option you get with Zoom, one of the <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/categories/video-conferencing/small-business\">highest-rated video conferencing</a>&nbsp;tools available. The tool offers clear audio with background noise suppression, an option to share your screen, and a recording function to save and send the meeting to those unable to participate.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Zoom has a few fun, engaging tools for increased participation among attendees — including filters, reactions, polls, hand raising, and chat. Plus, you can schedule a Zoom meeting right from your Outlook, Gmail, or iCal email calendar.</p> \n<p>Zoom is also part of the <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/webinar/zoom\">HubSpot ecosystem</a>&nbsp;and connects seamlessly with your CRM.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Outside of meetings, Zoom doesn't offer any collaboration tools such as file sharing or messaging to follow-up with colleagues — additionally, the links you might've shared in the Zoom chat aren't saved anywhere for later viewing. You also can't add a meeting agenda to the invite from the app itself.</p> \n<p>Overall, Zoom is a great option for small teams, but as you scale, there are some growing pains. For instance, you can get 100 participants in a meeting for 40 minutes with the free version, but if you have a company of 100+, you'll need to pay more to increase participants.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong>Free for Basic, which includes the ability to host up to 100 participants, up to 40 minutes of group meeting time, and unlimited one-on-one meetings. $149.90 per year for Pro version, which is recommended for small teams, and $199.90 per year for Small &amp; Med Businesses version.</p> \n<h3>2. <strong><a href=\"https://www.jiminny.com/\">Jiminny</a>&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jiminny.png?width=840&amp;name=jiminny.png\" alt=\"jiminny dashboard example\" width=\"840\" style=\"width: 840px;\"></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Jiminny offers a ton of unique, impressive features that can be particularly useful if you're hoping to use your video conferencing tool for your sales team or for client-facing purposes.</p> \n<p>For instance, the software offers a \"Themes\" feature, which means your meeting recording will be automatically broken up into important parts like \"Next Steps\" — for anyone who's ever scanned an hour-long meeting recording looking for a two-minute conversation right in the middle, this can greatly increase efficiency with follow-up materials.</p> \n<p>The recording feature can integrate with your CRM to automatically input data from your recordings, enabling you to reduce the time-consuming task of manual note-taking. The software also offers metrics such as ratio of talking versus listening to improve your sales reps conversation (and listening) skills.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong>The company is in the early-stages, so as they continue to iterate and improve on their product, you might experience some growing pains. Additionally, if you're <em>not </em>planning on using the video conferencing tool for prospect/customer-facing purposes, some of these features might be unnecessary for your internal marketing team.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong>Pro plans starting at $75/month per user if you sign up for a full year; that goes up to $95/month per user if billed monthly.</p> \n<h3>3. <strong><a href=\"https://apps.google.com/intl/en/meet/\">Google Meet</a></strong></h3> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google%20meet.png?width=1130&amp;name=google%20meet.png\" alt=\"google meet's dashboard\" width=\"1130\" style=\"width: 1130px;\"></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Google Meet is an incredibly cheap and easy-to-use video conferencing tool for small teams. In fact, if you're not interested in recording or storing meetings, the tool is free forever for up to 100 participants.</p> \n<p>Google Meet integrates with other apps and even lets you build a custom app using Apps Script. The tool also comes with unlimited Google Drive storage.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the tool offers a speech-to-text real-time captioning feature for video chats and meetings — ideal for hearing impaired participants, non-native speakers, or participants with noisy backgrounds.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong>The free version doesn't offer the ability to record or save your meetings, which means you'll need to upgrade if you need either feature.</p> \n<p>Google doesn't offer personalized setup or training, and it doesn't offer the same robust features as some of the other options in this list. It also can't support more than 250 participants, so it won't work if you plan on hosting larger webinars or conferences.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong>The app is free for up to 100 participants and an unlimited number of meetings. However, if you want to record or store meetings, pricing starts at $8/month per user.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.bluejeans.com/products\">Bluejeans</a>&nbsp;</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hey-4.png?width=1480&amp;name=hey-4.png\" alt=\"Bluejeans virtual conference dashboard\" width=\"1480\" style=\"width: 1480px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Bluejeans, a video conferencing software created by Verizon, offers impressive features such as the ability to use AI and voice recognition to automatically take notes, create action items, and identify key moments for later follow-up. Additionally, engagement is a breeze from within the tool with features such as screen sharing, polling, Q&amp;A, and chat.</p> \n<p>Bluejeans integrates with messaging, scheduling, and productivity tools, and offers impressive security and scalability requirements.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong>Bluejeans doesn't offer file sharing capabilities, and if you only purchase the Me plan, you're limited to 25 hours of recordings. Additionally, support is limited.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong>$13.99/host per month, up to 75 participants and 25 hours of recordings.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.gotomeeting.com/\">GoToMeeting</a>&nbsp;</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/logmein.png?width=952&amp;name=logmein.png\" alt=\"GotoMeeting's example dashboard\" width=\"952\" style=\"width: 952px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pros: </strong>LogMeIn's video conferencing software has some impressive features, including a \"Smart Meeting Assistant\" transcription service that automatically transcribes the meeting so you can search through and share detailed notes with others.</p> \n<p>You can record the meeting and store the recording locally or in the cloud, and participants can join the meeting on desktop or through a mobile app.</p> \n<p>Overall, GotoMeeting's HD video and audio software is high-quality and integrates easily with Google Calendar or Chrome for increased efficiency.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong>GoToMeeting requires an error-fee data connection to work well, and some reviewers have noted the <a href=\"https://www.getapp.com/it-communications-software/a/gotomeeting/features/\">mobile app isn't as user-friendly as they'd like</a>. Additionally, the Professional plan doesn't offer the transcription, note taking, or drawing features.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong>$16/user per month, for up to 250 participants, for Business plan.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.skype.com/en/features/group-video-chat/\">Skype</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/skype-1.png?width=1086&amp;name=skype-1.png\" alt=\"Skype for Business video call\" width=\"1086\" style=\"width: 1086px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pros: </strong>If you have a tight budget and you're often calling people from across the globe, Skype could be a great option for you. The software is free to use, and doesn't charge users for calling anyone from <em>anywhere</em> in the world. Video calls can also include up to 50 participants at once. The tool is easy to install and use.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong>The audio quality isn't always great with Skype, particularly since Skype's audio quality is based on bandwidth, so if users have a slow speed ISP, then audio quality will be negatively affected. Additionally, since Skype calls occur over the internet, there's always a possibility that data will be intercepted. This makes it a less secure option than some others in the list.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Free</span></p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software/\">Microsoft Teams</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/microsoft-Mar-02-2021-08-05-46-32-PM.png?width=1338&amp;name=microsoft-Mar-02-2021-08-05-46-32-PM.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Team dashboard\" width=\"1338\" style=\"width: 1338px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> If you're planning on hosting large webinars or conferences with over 250+ attendees, Microsoft Teams is a good tool for you to consider. The software allows up to 10,000 participants to meet at once, and lets you host with anyone inside or outside your organization.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Microsoft Teams enables you to organize different departments or groups into \"Teams\" (which can be up to a few thousand people) — within those Teams, you can have separate channels of conversations and focus on different projects.</p> \n<p>Microsoft Teams provides a few impressive features for increased engagement, including notifications, mentions, comments, GIFs and emojis in chats, and the ability to chat one-on-one or in groups. The software also offers advanced security features.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong>Microsoft Teams is an inclusive option for ensuring everyone within a given \"Team\" automatically has access to all the files, notes, and channels in the Team. Unfortunately, that means you don't have permission settings to inhibit certain users from accessing files within a group, and you also can't invite guest users to selected channels.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong>Microsoft 365 Business Basic is $5/user per month (annual commitment) and allows for 300 participants, but doesn't include the advanced security and compliance features, administration, or support. Microsoft 365 Business Standard is $12.50/user per month (annual commitment), and Office 365 E3 is $20/user per month (annual commitment) and includes everything Microsoft Teams has to offer.</p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.ringcentral.com/\">RingCentral Video</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hey-Mar-02-2021-08-28-56-36-PM.png?width=968&amp;name=hey-Mar-02-2021-08-28-56-36-PM.png\" alt=\"RingCentral's video dashboard on desktop and phone\" width=\"968\" style=\"width: 968px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pros: </strong>RingCentral offers HD video and high-quality audio, and it's a cost-effective option for an unlimited number of users, video meetings with up to 100 participants, and up to 24-hour meeting duration. The software enables you to hop easily between mobile and desktop devices, and provides seven layers of security.</p> \n<p>Additionally, RingCentral provides personalized onboarding training and 24/7 live support, so if you feel your team might need support getting set up or in the future, this is a good option to consider.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong>RingCentral offers a recording feature but it's only available as an offline option, meaning you need to download the recording as a local hard disk rather than a publicly available folder like Dropbox. The software also doesn't come with its own calendar and task management function to integrate video meetings with your calendar events — for that, you'll need to download the company's Glip app.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong>$24.99/user per month for the standard version.</p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/meeting/\">Zoho Meeting</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zoho-2.png?width=1660&amp;name=zoho-2.png\" alt=\"Zoho meeting attendee list dashboard\" width=\"1660\" style=\"width: 1660px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pros: </strong>One of the most cost-effective options in the list, this is a good, user-friendly video conferencing software for small businesses. Users don't need to download and install any software, since Zoho is hosted on a web browser, and the software offers all the basic features you'd need in a video conferencing tool, including screen sharing and meeting recordings.</p> \n<p>Aditionally, you can use 100+ local dial-in numbers and 55+ toll-free numbers to join from different countries. Best of all, the interface is easy to navigate and use.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong>Zoho Meeting limits attendees to 100. If you need more participants than that, you'll need to switch to Zoho Webinar. You also need to purchase an add-on if you plan on storing over 10 recordings.</p> \n<p>The tool doesn't offer some of the fancy features we've seen elsewhere in this list, including a smart assistant or cloud video recording. Still, this is a good option for smaller teams who don't need all the bells and whistles.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong>$2.50/host per month for 10 participants, $5/host per month for 25 participants, and $10/host per month for 100 participants.</p> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"https://www.intermedia.com/anymeeting-video-conferencing\">Intermedia AnyMeeting</a></h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/intermedia.png?width=1508&amp;name=intermedia.png\" alt=\"intermedia anymeeting dashboard screenshare\" width=\"1508\" style=\"width: 1508px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Intermedia AnyMeeting has a clean, easy-to-use interface and offers an impressive array of features — including an AI-powered smart assistant for meeting transcriptions, and screen annotations so participants can direct attention to key points on a shared screen — for a relatively low cost.</p> \n<p>The software integrates with plenty of popular office tools including Outlook, G-Suite, and Slack, and offers unlimited recording storage and sharing capabilities. With the Pro version, you're also able to create custom branded meetings with a company logo and personalized background.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong>Intermedia AnyMeeting doesn't have end-to-end encryption of ongoing calls, which could raise privacy and security concerns. Additionally, some <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/anymeeting-video-conferencing/reviews#reviews\">G2 reviewers have mentioned the audio</a>&nbsp;quality could be better.</p> \n<p><strong>Price: </strong>$9.99/user per month for the Lite version, which enables up to 10 participants. $12.99/user per month for the Pro version, which enables up to 100 participants.</p> \n<p>Remember — when choosing video conferencing software, it's critical you keep your own team's needs, resources, and requirements in-mind. If you're still unsure after reading through this list, consider testing out a few demos or trial versions to see which feels best-suited for your brand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3d8890a4-b446-496e-b60f-a8a7ee44ae85&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-Action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3d8890a4-b446-496e-b60f-a8a7ee44ae85.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvideo-conferencing-small-business&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/52250291-8fed-4fe7-ad28-e6e244e1fcd8.png","linkMd5":"6d212fdee6591c5dbaa9d281d8d8e593","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-665_e57995fecd8b2257.webp","destWidth":395,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4668,"destBytes":6412,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/52250291-8fed-4fe7-ad28-e6e244e1fcd8.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-665_e57995fecd8b2257.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zoom-Mar-02-2021-08-10-27-46-PM.png?width=1204&name=zoom-Mar-02-2021-08-10-27-46-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn38@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-00-005_c9f4bb8ec2b0854c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jiminny.png?width=840&name=jiminny.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-54-196_27dba2b8a371a9bc.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google%20meet.png?width=1130&name=google%20meet.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn83@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-56-675_34251738e33c280d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hey-4.png?width=1480&name=hey-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn18@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-02-058_a0adc5c5d7b29fc3.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/logmein.png?width=952&name=logmein.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn13@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-59-662_9af514841e8bc0e4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/skype-1.png?width=1086&name=skype-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn16@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-01-322_43d7c2434c466865.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/microsoft-Mar-02-2021-08-05-46-32-PM.png?width=1338&name=microsoft-Mar-02-2021-08-05-46-32-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn81@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-01-971_145b0836ad4f3b8d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hey-Mar-02-2021-08-28-56-36-PM.png?width=968&name=hey-Mar-02-2021-08-28-56-36-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn37@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-51-620_2940ab5b8e35cff5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zoho-2.png?width=1660&name=zoho-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn50@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-59-168_c3bef37e7f20c6ba.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/intermedia.png?width=1508&name=intermedia.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn9@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-52-401_9e13608eaea80b78.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3d8890a4-b446-496e-b60f-a8a7ee44ae85.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn69@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-50-01-981_d4985b3af97d5b9c.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvideo-conferencing-small-business&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn99@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-00-061_7313ff8e2c9b6876.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370130},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"How to Make Quotes for Instagram: 9 Apps to Try This Year","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/quote-maker-apps-instagram","description":"<p>When you come across a beautiful sight -- be it a beach, a mountain, or your pet's face -- sometimes, it inspires you to think bigger about what certain sights and experiences mean.</p>  \n<p>For those moments, you might consider posting a photo on Instagram with an equally inspiring quote as the caption. But you could take it even further -- and save characters -- by posting the photo <em>with </em>the quote.<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=890d1040-16c9-4b04-a1be-fe38f6c25c8f&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Access Now: 9 Free Instagram Quote Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/890d1040-16c9-4b04-a1be-fe38f6c25c8f.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>You've likely seen quotes on Instagram posts before, but you may never have created one for your brand's account.

FaceGarage</h3> \n<h4><a href=\"http://www.facegarage.com/photoEditors/instagramQuotes\">Web App</a></h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/FaceGarage-Step%206.jpg?width=320&amp;name=FaceGarage-Step%206.jpg\" alt=\"Image from FaceGarage, an Instagram text and quote maker app\" width=\"320\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 320px;\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.facegarage.com/\">FaceGarage</a> is a browser tool that helps you create Instagram images with quotes overlaid in just a few simple steps. You can upload an image of your own or use one of the site's stock background images, type in your quote, adjust the font, text size, color, and formatting, and voila -- you generate your image and download it to post on Instagram.</p> \n<p>Our favorite thing about FaceGarage is the images don't come with a watermark, so you can create more beautiful posts that don't have a logo in the corner.</p> \n<h3>2. Canva</h3> \n<h4><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/canva-photo-editor-design/id897446215?mt=8\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.canva.editor&amp;hl=en_US\">Android</a>, or <a href=\"https://about.canva.com/\">Web App</a></h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/canva%20instagram%20quote%20maker%20app.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Image from Canva, an Instagram text and quote maker app\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.canva.editor&amp;hl=en_US\">Google Play</a></span></p> \n<p>Canva's many features extend beyond text-based pictures and, for that matter, social media. But the mobile app and its gorgeous pre-made templates make it perfect for Instagram quotes.</p> \n<p>Using the Canva's social media post setting, you can draft banners, flyers, cards, and posts of all shapes and sizes using one of hundreds of pro-level backgrounds. Of course, feel free to snap a photo on the go, as well. One you select your image, you can choose from more than 100 fonts, adjust the size and color, and publish.</p> \n<h3>3. ReciteThis</h3> \n<h4><a href=\"http://recite.com/\">Web App</a></h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/recite-example.png?width=320&amp;name=recite-example.png\" alt=\"Image from ReciteThis, an Instagram text and quote maker app\" width=\"320\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 320px;\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://recitethis.com/\">ReciteThis</a> is another quick and easy browser tool you can use to create quotes for Instagram. Its two-step process involves selecting one of the ready-made background themes, typing in your quotation, and pressing \"Create.\" From there, you can upload the image to a variety of social networks (not including Instagram) or download the image to upload and post on Instagram.</p> \n<p>The downside to ReciteThis's ease of use is the highly visible watermark in the bottom-center of each image, but you might be able to crop it out using your phone's photo editor before uploading to Instagram, depending on the design you choose.</p> \n<h3>4. Word Swag</h3> \n<h4><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-swag-cool-typography/id645746786?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.wordswag.wordswag&amp;hl=en_US\">Android</a></h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BiwrvYUFVcl/?taken-by=wordswag\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/word-swag-quote-maker-app.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Image from Word Swag, an Instagram text and quote maker app\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BiwrvYUFVcl/?taken-by=wordswag\">Word Swag</a></span></p>  \n<p>Listed in iTunes's top 100 apps in the&nbsp;<em>Photo &amp; Video</em> category, Word Swag helps you create text images that are as edgy as the app's name sounds. The app uses a special typing engine to create fresh quote designs based on the background picture you're working with.</p> \n<p>Just select (or shoot) your picture, type your quote into the app's plain text editor, select one of nearly 50 styles, and shuffle through the diverse choices that appear. Word Swag has literally thousands of quote and image options to choose from through a handy integration from Pixabay, a free image gallery.</p> \n<h3>5. InstaQuote</h3> \n<h4><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instaquote-add-text-captions/id551012097\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redcactus.instaquote&amp;hl=en\">Android</a></h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/InstaQuote.jpg?width=320&amp;name=InstaQuote.jpg\" alt=\"Image from InstaQuote, an Instagram text and quote maker app\" width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>This free app offers a lot of options to customize your quote image, font styles, and color schemes. You can use your own photos or one of InstaQuote's, and it allows you to automatically upload your image to Instagram so you don't have to download it and <em>then</em> upload it.</p> \n<p>The downsides to many free apps -- including InstaQuote -- are the prevalence of ad interruptions, and that many features are locked unless you upgrade to the paid version.</p> \n<h3>6. Text2Pic</h3> \n<h4><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/text2pic-musical-text-on-photo/id536817268\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=textpic.wonder.caption&amp;hl=en\">Android</a></h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Text2Pic.png?width=320&amp;name=Text2Pic.png\" alt=\"Image from Text2Pic, an Instagram text and quote maker app\" width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Text2Pic stands out from the crowd in a couple of ways. It has the widest variety of font style and formatting options -- including 3-D and shadowing capabilities to add more effects to your text. It also auto-connects to Instagram for seamless uploading and posting on the platform.</p> \n<p>The biggest downside we've noted is the inability to upload your own photo as a background image, but Text2Pic makes up for that with a ton of different background options to choose from.</p> \n<h3>7. Quotes Creator</h3> \n<h4><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quotes-creator/id895331100?mt=8\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ist.quotescreator&amp;hl=en\">Android</a></h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/quotes%20creator.jpg?width=320&amp;name=quotes%20creator.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Quotes Creator, an Instagram text and quote maker app\" width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Quotes Creator has a neat feature that suggests quotes to use -- including their attributions -- to take the work out of creating an inspirational post for you. We also like how subtly transparent the watermark is to make it as distraction-free as possible. This is another easy-to-use app that creates quotes for Instagram in just a few simple steps -- with an easy tap to upload to the platform.</p> \n<p>Quotes Creator's stock background options are a little cheesy, so we recommend finding your own and uploading them.</p> \n<h3>8. Quote Maker</h3> \n<h4><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quote-maker/id1084636376?mt=8\">iOS</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psd2filters.quotemaker&amp;hl=en\">Android</a></h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Quotes%20Maker-1.jpg?width=320&amp;name=Quotes%20Maker-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Quote Maker, an Instagram text app\" width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Quote Maker is another free app that tries to upsell its Pro version to unlock more background and style options, but you can always upload your own background if you feel too limited. Where Quotes Maker takes the cake is its cool font styling and effects. You could add neat decals to your brand's name or a stamp-like effect to a company motto or mission statement.</p> \n<p>We recommend exploring the app, but another warning -- it can be glitchy if your design and editing actions get more complex. It's best for simple images, like the one above.</p> \n<h3>9. Text on Photo Square</h3> \n<h4><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/text-on-photo-square-add-beautiful-captions-fonts-to/id767873908?mt=8\">iOS</a> only</h4> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Text%20on%20Photo%20Square.jpg?width=320&amp;height=320&amp;name=Text%20on%20Photo%20Square.jpg\" alt=\"Image from Text on Photo Square, an Instagram quote maker app\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Text on Photo Square is only available on iOS devices (for now), but its distinction from the rest of the pack is that users can add quotes to videos, in addition to photos. You can upload your videos and add quotes to create a neat audio and visual experience for your Instagram followers. A cool quote-video might distract from the watermark, which is admittedly one of the larger ones on this list.</p> \n<p>Some of these apps might be worth investing in the paid version to create more unique images -- without the watermarks -- to post quotes on Instagram. But for now, try out these free options during the next <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezYHn3gTVeI&amp;t=3s\">social media holiday</a> to see if your audience is ready to be inspired.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5848cf64-d1ce-4245-8440-eaffd08f875a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

Do you recommend a specific restaurant whenever out-of-towners ask for suggestions? Well, there's a good reason for it.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=72c7ece3-b9c6-4064-8a2a-33f42783a2d5&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"→ Free Resource: 100 Mission Statement Templates &amp; Examples\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/72c7ece3-b9c6-4064-8a2a-33f42783a2d5.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The reason we stay loyal to brands is because of their values. The best brands strive to combine physical, emotional, and logical elements into one exceptional customer (and employee) experience that you value as much as they do. Nowhere are those values more visible than in the company's mission statement.</p> \n<p>When you successfully create a connection with your customers and employees, many of them might stay loyal to you for life. This helps you increase your overall profitability while building a solid foundation of brand promoters.</p> \n<p>But achieving that connection is no easy task. The companies that succeed are ones that stay true to their core values over the years and create a company that employees and customers are proud to associate with.</p> \n<p>That's where company vision and mission statements come in.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>What is a Vision Statement?</h2> \n<p>A vision statement describes where the company aspires to be upon achieving its mission. This statement reveals the \"where\" of a business. Below are some vision statements from well-known companies to give you a sense of how a vision represents a brand.</p> \n<h3>Vision Statement Examples</h3> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.alz.org/about/strategic-plan\">Alzheimer's Association</a>: A world without Alzheimer's disease.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.teachforamerica.org/what-we-do/who-we-are\">Teach for America</a>: One day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/about/mission-and-vision/\">Creative Commons</a>: Realizing the full potential of the internet -- universal access to research and education, full participation in culture -- to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2015/04/05/technology/bill-gates-email-microsoft-40-anniversary/index.html\">Microsoft</a> (at its founding): A computer on every desk and in every home.</li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/annual-report-1415-toc~14-15-our-vision\">Australia Department of Health</a>: Better health and wellbeing for all Australians, now and for future generations.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://about.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a>: Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce.&nbsp;</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/about/\">Disney</a>: T<span>o entertain, inform and inspire people around the globe through the power of unparalleled storytelling, reflecting the iconic brands, creative minds and innovative technologies that make ours the world’s premier entertainment company.</span></li> \n <li><span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a>: </span>Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What is a Mission Statement?</h2> \n<p>If the above examples are vision statements, what's a mission statement? A mission statement is, in some ways, an action-oriented vision statement, declaring the purpose an organization serves to its audience. It often includes a general description of the organization, its function, and its objectives.</p> \n<p>As a company grows, its objectives and goals may be reached, and in turn they'll change. Therefore, mission and vision statements should be revised as needed to reflect the business's new culture as previous goals are met.</p> \n<p>Both mission and vision statements are often combined into one comprehensive \"mission statement\" to define the organization's reason for existing and its outlook for internal and external audiences -- like employees, partners, board members, consumers, and shareholders.</p> \n<p>With that in mind, what does a good mission statement look like? Check out some of the following company mission statements for yourself -- and get inspired to write one for your brand.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Mission Statement Examples</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Life is Good: To spread the power of optimism.</li> \n  <li>sweetgreen: To inspire healthier communities by connecting people to real food.</li> \n  <li>Patagonia: Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.</li> \n  <li>American Express: We work hard every day to make American Express the world's most respected service brand.</li> \n  <li>Warby Parker: To offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.</li> \n  <li>InvisionApp: Question Assumptions.

Life Is Good: To spread the power of optimism.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.38.06%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.38.06%20PM.png\" alt=\"Life Is Good vision and mission statement &quot;to spread the power of optimism&quot;\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" width=\"600\" title=\"life is good mission\"></p> \n<p>The Life is Good brand is about more than spreading optimism -- although, with uplifting T-shirt slogans like \"Seas The Day\" and \"Forecast: Mostly Sunny,\" it's hard not to crack a smile.</p> \n<p>There are a ton of T-shirt companies in the world, but Life is Good's mission sets itself apart with a <a href=\"http://content.lifeisgood.com/purpose/\">mission statement</a> goes beyond fun clothing: to spread the power of optimism. This mission is perhaps a little unexpected if you're not familiar with the company's public charity: How will a T-shirt company help spread optimism? Life is Good answers that question below the fold, where what the mission means is explained in more detail, with links to programs implemented to support it: <a href=\"http://content.lifeisgood.com/community/\">its #GrowTheGood initiative</a> and the <a href=\"http://content.lifeisgood.com/playmakers/\">Life is Good Kids Foundation page</a>. We really like how lofty yet specific this mission statement is -- it's a hard-to-balance combination.</p> \n<h3>2. sweetgreen: To inspire healthier communities by connecting people to real food.</h3>  \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.07%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/o2MNNPX_x1I\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div>  \n<p>Notice that sweetgreen's mission is positioned to align with <em>your </em>values -- not just written as something the brand believes. We love the inclusive language used in its statement, letting us know that the company is all about connecting its <a href=\"http://sweetgreen.com/our-story/\">growing network</a> of farmers growing healthy, local ingredients with us -- the customer -- because we're the ones who want more locally grown, healthy food options.</p> \n<p>The mission to <em>connect people </em>is what makes this statement so strong. And that promise has gone beyond sweetgreen's website and walls of its food shops: The team has made strides in the communities where it's opened stores as well. Primarily, it provides education to young kids on healthy eating, fitness, sustainability, and where food comes from. The <a href=\"http://sweetlifefestival.com/\">sweetlife music festival</a> attracts 20,000 like-minded people every year who come together to listen to music, eat healthy food, and give back to a cause -- the sweetgreen in schools charity partner, FoodCorps.</p> \n<h3>3. Patagonia: Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.</h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.46.06%20PM.png?width=669&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.46.06%20PM.png\" alt=\"Patagonia vision and mission statement\" width=\"669\" title=\"Patagonia mission\"></p> \n<p>Patagonia's mission statement combines both the values that bring them market success (building safe, high-quality products) <em>and </em>the values that contribute to a better world (philanthropic efforts to help the environment). <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/us/patagonia.go?assetid=2047\">For the people behind the brand</a>, \"a love of wild and beautiful places demands participation in the fight to save them.\" In the name of this cause, the company donates time, services, and at least 1% of its sales to hundreds of grassroots environmental groups around the world.</p> \n<p>If your company has a similar focus on growing your business <em>and</em> giving back, think about talking about both the benefit you bring to customers and the value you want to bring to a greater cause in your mission statement.</p> \n<h3>4. American Express: We work hard every day to make American Express the world's most respected service brand.</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/american-express-vision-mission-statement.png?width=600&amp;name=american-express-vision-mission-statement.png\" alt=\"American Express vision and mission statement\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p>  \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p>Customers will never love a company until the employees love it first.</p> — Simon Sinek (@simonsinek) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonsinek/status/456545886143643649\">April 16, 2014</a>\n</blockquote> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">  </h4>  \n<p>The tweet above is<a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonsinek/status/456545886143643649\"> from Simon Sinek</a>, and it's one that we repeat here at HubSpot all the time. American Express sets itself apart from other credit card companies <a href=\"http://about.americanexpress.com/oc/whoweare/\">in its list of values</a>, with an ode to great customer service, which is something it’s famous for.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.50.22%20PM.png?width=373&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.50.22%20PM.png\" alt=\"American Express values\" width=\"373\" style=\"width: 373px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"American Express Values\"></p> \n<p>We especially love the emphasis on teamwork and supporting employees, so that the people inside of the organization can be in the best position to support their customers.</p> \n<h3>5. Warby Parker: To offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.54.54%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.54.54%20PM.png\" alt=\"Warby Parker objective\" width=\"600\" title=\"Warby Parker objective\"></p> \n<p>Speaking of quirky, this \"objective\" statement from <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/history\">Warby Parker </a>uses words that reflect a young and daring personality: \"rebellious,\" \"revolutionary,\" \"socially-conscious.\" In one sentence, the brand takes us back to the root of why it was founded while also revealing its vision for a better future.</p> \n<p>The longer-form version of the mission reads: \"We believe that buying glasses should be easy and fun. It should leave you happy and good-looking, with money in your pocket,\" which further shows how Warby Parker doesn't hold back on letting its unique personality shine through. Here, the missions statement's success all comes down to spot-on word choice.</p> \n<h3>6. InvisionApp: Question Assumptions. Think Deeply. Iterate as a Lifestyle. Details, Details. Design is Everywhere. Integrity.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.59.57%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%202.59.57%20PM.png\" alt=\"InVision Values\" width=\"600\" title=\"InVision Values\"></p> \n<p>These days, it can seem like every B2B company page looks the same -- but InvisionApp has one of the cooler <a href=\"http://www.invisionapp.com/company\">company pages</a> I've seen. Scroll down to \"Our Core Values,\" and hover your mouse over any of the icons, and you'll find a short-but-sweet piece of the overall company mission under each icon. We love the way the statements are laid out under each icon. Each description is brief, authentic, and business babble-free -- which makes the folks at InvisionApp seem like trustworthy, B.S.-free types.</p> \n<h3>7. Honest Tea: To create and promote great-tasting, healthy, organic beverages.</h3> \n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%203.03.00%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%203.03.00%20PM.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Honest Tea vision and mission statement\" title=\"honest tea mission\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Honest Tea's mission statement begins with a simple punch line connoting its tea is <em>real, pure, </em>and therefore not full of artificial chemicals. The brand is speaking to an audience that's tired of finding ingredients in its tea that can't be pronounced, and have been searching for a tea that's exactly what it says it is.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not only does Honest Tea have a punny name, but it also centers its mission around the clever company name. For some time, the company even <a href=\"https://www.honesttea.com/wp-content/themes/honesttea/assets/pdf/HT_MR_2015_web_FINAL.pdf\">published a Mission Report</a> each year in an effort to be \"transparent about our business practices and live up to our mission to seek to create and promote great-tasting, healthier, organic beverages.\"</p> \n<h3>8. IKEA: To create a better everyday life for the many people.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%203.06.23%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%203.06.23%20PM.png\" alt=\"IKEA vision and mission statement\" width=\"600\" title=\"IKEA vision\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The folks at IKEA dream big. The vision-based mission statement could have been one of beautiful, affordable furniture, but instead, it's to make <em>everyday life better</em> for its customers. It's a partnership: IKEA finds deals all over the world and buys in bulk, then we choose the furniture and pick it up at a self-service warehouse.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\"Our business idea supports this vision ... so [that] as many people as possible will be able to afford them,\" <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_SG/about_ikea/our_business_idea/index.html\">the brand states</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Using words like \"as many people as possible\" makes a huge company like IKEA much more accessible and appealing to customers.</p> \n<h3>9. Nordstrom: \"To give customers the most compelling shopping experience possible.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%203.25.48%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%203.25.48%20PM.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Nordstrom history, vision and mission statement\" title=\"Nordstrom history\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When it comes to customer commitment, not many companies are as hyper-focused as Nordstrom is. Although clothing selection, quality, and value all have a place in <a href=\"http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/company-history\">the company's mission statement</a>, it’s crystal clear that it’s all about the customer: \"Nordstrom works relentlessly to give customers the most compelling shopping experience possible.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you've ever shopped at a Nordstrom, you'll know the brand will uphold the high standard for customer service mentioned in its mission statement, as associates are always roaming the sales floors, asking customers whether they've been helped, and doing everything they can to make the shopping experience a memorable one.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">10. Cradles to Crayons: Provides children from birth through age 12, living in homeless or low-income situations, with the essential items they need to thrive – at home, at school and at play.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%203.37.48%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%203.37.48%20PM.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"cradles to crayons vision and mission statement\" title=\"cradles to crayons mission\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Cradles to Crayons divided its mission and model into three sections that read like a game plan: The Need, The Mission, and The Model. The \"rule of three\" is a powerful rhetorical device called a tricolon that's usually used in speechwriting to help make an idea more memorable. A tricolon is a series of three parallel elements of roughly the same length -- think \"I came; I saw; I conquered.\"</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">11. Universal Health Services, Inc.: To provide superior quality healthcare services that: PATIENTS recommend to family and friends, PHYSICIANS prefer for their patients, PURCHASERS select for their clients, EMPLOYEES are proud of, and INVESTORS seek for long-term returns.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/universal-health-services-mission-statement.png?width=600&amp;name=universal-health-services-mission-statement.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Universal Health Services vision and mission statement\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A company thrives when it pleases its customers, its employees, its partners, and its investors -- and Universal Health Services endeavors to do just that, according to <a href=\"http://www.uhsinc.com/about-us/mission-statement/\">its mission statement</a>. As a health care service, it specifically strives to please its patients, physicians, purchasers, employees, and investors. We love the emphasis on each facet of the organization, by capitalizing the font and making it red for easy skimming.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">12. JetBlue: To inspire humanity – both in the air and on the ground.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Jb-for-good-3.jpg?width=600&amp;name=Jb-for-good-3.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"JetBlue vision and mission statement\" title=\"Jb-for-good-3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">JetBlue's committed to <a href=\"https://www.jetblue.com/corporate-social-responsibility/\">its founding mission</a> through lovable marketing, charitable partnerships, and influential programs -- and we love the approachable language used to describe these endeavors. For example, the brand writes how it \"set out in 2000 to bring humanity back to the skies.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For those of us who want to learn more about any of its specific efforts, JetBlue's provided details on the Soar With Reading program, its partnership with KaBOOM!, the JetBlue Foundation, environmental and social reporting, and so on. It breaks down all these initiatives really well with big headers, bullet points, pictures, and links to other webpages visitors can click to learn more. Finally, it ends with a call-to-action encouraging website visitors volunteer or donate their TrueBlue points.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">13. Workday: To put people at the center of enterprise software.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/workday-mission-statement.png?width=600&amp;name=workday-mission-statement.png\" alt=\"Workday vision and mission statement\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Workday, a human resources (HR) task automation service, doesn't use its mission statement to highlight the features of its product or how it intends to help HR professionals improve in such-and-such a way.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Instead, the business takes a stance on the state of enterprise software in general: There's a lot of great tech out there. But at <a href=\"https://www.workday.com/\">Workday</a>, it revolves around the people. We love how confident yet kind this mission statement is. It observes the state of its industry -- which Workday believes lacks a human touch -- and builds company values around it.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">14. Prezi: To reinvent how people share knowledge, tell stories, and inspire their audiences to act.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/prezi-vision-mission-statement.png?width=450&amp;name=prezi-vision-mission-statement.png\" alt=\"Prezi vision and mission statement\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you know Prezi, you know how engaging it can make your next business presentation look. According to its mission statement, the company's clever slide animations and 3-dimensional experience aren't just superficial product features. With every decision <a href=\"https://prezi.com/about/\">Prezi</a> makes, it's all about the story you tell and the audience that story affects.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">15. Tesla: To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tesla-mission-statement.png?width=600&amp;name=tesla-mission-statement.png\" alt=\"Tesla vision and mission statement\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A car company's punny use of the word \"accelerate\" is just one reason this mission statement sticks out. The main reason <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/about\">Tesla</a> makes this list is because of how its mission statement describes the industry.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It may be a car company, but Tesla's main interest isn't just automobile sales -- it's promoting sustainable energy. And sustainable energy still has a \"long road\" ahead of it (pun intended) -- hence the world's \"transition\" into this market.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ultimately, a mission statement that can admit to the industry's immaturity is exactly what gets customers to root for it. And Tesla does that nicely.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">16. Invisible Children: To end violence and exploitation facing our world's most isolated and vulnerable communities.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/invisible-children-mission-statement.png?width=600&amp;name=invisible-children-mission-statement.png\" alt=\"Invisible Children vision and mission statement\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tenacity is hard to come by in the non-profit sector, and that's what makes this mission statement so distinguished. <a href=\"https://invisiblechildren.com/challenge/\">Invisible Children</a> is a non-profit that raises awareness around the violence affecting communities across Central Africa, and the company takes quite a confident tone in its mission.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The most valuable quality of this mission statement is that it has an end goal. Many companies' visions and missions are intentionally left open-ended so that the business might always be needed by the community. Invisible Children, on the other hand, wants to \"end\" the violence facing African families. It's an admirable mission that all businesses -- not just non-profits -- can learn from when trying to motivate their customers.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">17. TED: Spread ideas.</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ted-mission-statement.png?width=600&amp;name=ted-mission-statement.png\" alt=\"TED vision and mission statement: Spread ideas\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We've all seen TED Talks online before. Well, the company happens to have one of the most succinct mission statements out there.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">TED, which stands for \"Technology Education and Design,\" has a two-word mission statement that shines through in every Talk you've seen the company publish on the internet. That mission statement: \"Spread ideas.\" Sometimes, the best way to get an audience to remember you is to zoom out as far as your business's vision can go. What do you really care about? <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization\">TED</a> has recorded some of the most famous presentations in the world, but in the grand scheme of things, all it wants is to spread ideas around to its viewers.</p> \n<p><i>Here are 22 <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-slogans-and-taglines\">companies with really catchy slogans and brand

Here are just a few:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Quarterly or Annual Marketing Plans:</strong> These plans highlight the strategies or campaigns you'll take on in a certain period of time.</li> \n <li><strong>Paid Marketing Plan:</strong> This plan could highlight paid strategies, such as native advertising, PPC, or paid social media promotions.</li> \n <li><strong>Social Media Marketing Plan:</strong> This plan could highlight the channels, tactics, and campaigns you intend to accomplish specifically on social media.</li> \n <li><strong>Content Marketing Plan:</strong> This plan could highlight different strategies, tactics, and campaigns in which you'll use content to promote your business or product.</li> \n <li><strong>New Product Launch Marketing Plan:</strong> This plan will be a roadmap for the strategies and tactics you'll implement to promote a new product.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Keep in mind that there's a difference between a marketing plan and a marketing strategy.</p> \n<h3>Marketing Strategy vs. Marketing Plan</h3> \n<p>A <strong>marketing strategy</strong> describes how a business will accomplish a particular mission or goal. This includes which campaigns, content, channels, and <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">marketing software</a> they'll use to execute on that mission and track its success.</p> \n<p>For example, while a greater plan or department might handle social media marketing, you might consider your work on Facebook as an individual marketing strategy.</p> \n<p>A <strong>marketing plan</strong> <em>contains</em> one or more marketing strategies. It is the framework from which all of your marketing strategies are created, and helps you connect each strategy back to a larger marketing operation and business goal.</p> \n<p>Let's say, for example, your company is launching a new software product it wants customers to sign up for. This calls for the marketing department to develop a marketing plan that'll help introduce this product to the industry and drive the desired signups.</p> \n<p>The department decides to launch a blog dedicated to this industry, a new YouTube video series to establish expertise, and an account on Twitter to join the conversation around this subject -- all of which serve to attract an audience and convert this audience into software users.</p> \n<p>Can you see the distinction between the business's marketing plan versus the three marketing strategies?</p> \n<p>In the above example, the business's <em>marketing plan</em> is dedicated to introducing a new software product to the marketplace and driving signups to that product. The business will execute on that plan with three <em>marketing strategies</em>: a new industry blog, a YouTube video series, and a Twitter account.</p> \n<p>Of course, the business might also consider these three things one giant marketing strategy, each with their own specific content strategies. How granular you want your marketing plan to get is up to you. Nonetheless, there are a certain set of steps every marketing plan goes through in its creation. Learn what they are below.</p> \n<h3>1. State your business's mission.</h3> \n<p>Your first step in writing a marketing plan is to state your mission. Although this mission is specific to your marketing department, it should serve your business's main mission statement. Be specific, but not too specific. You have plenty of space left in this marketing plan to elaborate on how you'll acquire new customers and accomplish this mission.</p> \n<p>For example, if your business's mission is \"to make booking travel a delightful experience,\" your marketing mission might be \"to attract an audience of travelers, educate them on the tourism industry, and convert them into users of our bookings platform.\"</p> \n<h3>2. Determine the KPIs for this mission.</h3> \n<p>Every good marketing plan describes how the department will track its mission's progress. To do so, you'll need to determine your key performance indicators, or \"KPIs\" for short. KPIs are individual metrics that measure the various elements of a marketing campaign. These units help you establish short-term goals within your mission and communicate your progress to business leaders.</p> \n<p>Let's take our example marketing mission from the above step. If part of our mission is \"to attract an audience of travelers,\" we might track websites visits using organic page views. In this case, \"organic page views\" is one KPI, and we can see our number of page views grow over time.</p> \n<p>These KPIs will come into the conversation again in step 4, below.</p> \n<h3>3. Identify your buyer personas.</h3> \n<p>A buyer persona is a description of whom you want to attract. This can include age, sex, location, family size, job title, and more. Each buyer persona should be a direct reflection of your business's customers and potential customers. Therefore, it's critical that business leaders all agree on what your buyer personas are.</p> \n<p>You can develop buyer personas for free <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-buyer-persona-makemypersona\">right here</a>.</p> \n<h3>4. Describe your content initiatives and strategies.</h3> \n<p>Here's where you'll include the main points of your marketing and content strategy. Because there are a laundry list of content types and channels available to you today, it's critical that you choose wisely and explain how you'll use your content and channels in this section of your marketing plan.</p> \n<p>A content strategy should stipulate:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Which types of content you'll create.</strong> These can include blog posts, YouTube videos, infographics, ebooks, and more.</li> \n <li><strong>How much of it you'll create.</strong> You can describe content volume in daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly intervals. It all depends on your workflow and the short-term goals you set for your content.</li> \n <li><strong>The goals (and KPIs) you'll use to track each type.</strong> KPIs can include organic traffic, social media traffic, email traffic, and referral traffic. Your goals should also include which pages you want to drive that traffic to, such as product pages, blog pages, or landing pages.</li> \n <li><strong>The channels on which you'll distribute this content.</strong> Some popular channels at your disposal include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, and Instagram.</li> \n <li><strong>Any paid advertising that will take place on these channels.</strong></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Clearly define your plan's omissions.</h3> \n<p>A marketing plan explains what the marketing team is going to focus on. However, it also explains what the marketing team is <em>not</em> going to focus on.</p> \n<p>If there are other aspects of your business that you aren't serving in this particular plan, include them in this section. These omissions help to justify your mission, buyer personas, KPIs, and content. You can't please everyone in a single marketing campaign, and if your team isn't on the hook for something, you need to make it known.</p> \n<h3>6. Define your marketing budget.</h3> \n<p>Your content strategy might leverage many free channels and platforms, but there are a number of hidden expenses to a marketing team that need to be accounted for.</p> \n<p>Whether it's freelance fees, sponsorships, or a new full-time marketing hire, use these costs to develop a marketing budget and outline each expense in this section of your marketing plan.</p> \n<h3>7. Identify your competition.</h3> \n<p>Part of marketing is knowing whom you're marketing against. Research the key players in your industry and consider profiling each one in this section.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind not every competitor will pose the same challenges to your business. For example, while one competitor might be ranking highly on search engines for keywords you want your website to rank for, another competitor might have a heavy footprint on a social network where you plan to launch an account.</p> \n<h3>8. Outline your plan's contributors and their responsibilities.</h3> \n<p>With your marketing plan fully fleshed out, it's time to explain who's doing what. You don't have to delve too deeply into your employees' day-to-day projects, but it should be known which teams and team leaders are in charge of specific content types, channels, KPIs, and more.</p> \n<p>Ready to make your own marketing plan?

Using data to optimize your content strategy spreads more awareness for your book, gets more people to subscribe to your content, converts more subscribers into buyers, and encourages more buyers to recommend your book to their friends.</p> \n<p>When Shane Snow started promoting his new book <em>Dream Team, </em>he knew he had to leverage a data-driven content strategy framework. So he chose his favorite one: the content strategy waterfall, which is defined by <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/waterfall-model\">Economic Times</a> as a model used to create a system with a linear and sequential approach. To get a better idea of what this means, take a look at the diagram below:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/5%20Marketing%20Plan%20Examples%20to%20Help%20You%20Write%20Your%20Own.png?width=600&amp;name=5%20Marketing%20Plan%20Examples%20to%20Help%20You%20Write%20Your%20Own.png\" alt=\"Contently's content strategy waterfall.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Snow wrote a blog post about how the content strategy waterfall helped him successfully launch his new book.

Buffer decided to help out the content marketing community.</p> \n<p>By sifting through countless content marketing strategy templates and testing the best, they crafted a content marketing plan template with instructions and examples for marketers who've never documented their content strategy.</p> \n<p>After reading Buffer's marketing plan template, you'll learn how to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Answer four basic questions that'll help you form a clear executive summary.</li> \n <li>Set SMART content marketing goals.</li> \n <li>Create highly accurate audience personas by interviewing real content strategists.</li> \n <li>Solve your audience's problems with your content.</li> \n <li>Do competitive research by analyzing your competitors' and industry thought leaders' content.</li> \n <li>Evaluate your existing content strategy by examining the topics and themes of your highest and lowest performing pieces.</li> \n <li>Determine which types of new content to craft, based on your team's ability and bandwidth.</li> \n <li>Establish an editorial calendar.</li> \n <li>Develop a promotional workflow.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Buffer's template is an incredibly thorough step-by-step guide, with examples for each section.

Instead of applying an entirely new strategy to each new marketing campaign, they leverage the strategy of their previous marketing campaign to drive the next one. Similar to a flywheel, their content methodology needs an initial push of energy to get the gears in motion.</p> \n<p>What supplies this energy? Their content plan.</p> \n<p>Contently fleshed out their entire content plan in a blog post to help marketers develop a self-sustaining <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">marketing process</a>. After reading it, you'll learn how to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Align your content objectives and KPIs with your business goals.</li> \n <li>Create highly detailed buyer personas using psychographics instead of traditional demographics.</li> \n <li>Craft content for each stage of your marketing funnel, based off your prospects' pain and passion points.</li> \n <li>Identify your most effective marketing channels.</li> \n <li>Discover the content topics your audience actually craves.</li> \n <li>Assess your organization's need for resources.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>By applying a flywheel-like strategy to your own marketing efforts, you essentially take away the burden of applying new strategies to each individual marketing campaign. Instead, your prior efforts gain momentum over time, and dispel continual energy into whatever you publish next.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davelavinsky/2013/09/30/marketing-plan-template-exactly-what-to-include/#2df9855f3503\">Forbes' Marketing Plan Template</a></h3> \n<h4>Main objective: Content Marketing Plan</h4> \n<p>An oldie, but a goodie -- Forbes published a marketing plan template that has amassed almost four million views since late 2013.

Comedy Sketches</h3> \n<p>When you’re in the midst of a two hour YouTube binge fest, you can probably blame the endless amount of funny videos that flood the platform. Some of the most successful YouTubers create comedy sketches, like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles\">Jenna Marbles</a>, a blogger turned YouTube sensation who has over 19 million subscribers, and<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/LifeAccordingToJimmy\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/LifeAccordingToJimmy\">Jimmy Tatro</a>, a college kid who made hilarious videos for fun, but ended up turning it into a career, amassing over 3 million subscribers to this day.</p> \n<p>Jenna and Jimmy both built their YouTube followings with low-production videos, but they completely nailed the humor and storytelling in most of their videos, too. With this in mind, if you can write a funny script, building a successful comedy channel with a low budget is definitely possible.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"famous YouTuber Jenna Marbles and boyfriend filming comedic video\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/30%20YouTube%20Channel%20Ideas%20to%20Help%20You%20Choose%20Your%20Own-Mar-26-2021-08-52-33-59-PM.png?width=624&amp;name=30%20YouTube%20Channel%20Ideas%20to%20Help%20You%20Choose%20Your%20Own-Mar-26-2021-08-52-33-59-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"> <em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHCfr7qvkJs&amp;t=638s\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Source</a></span><a></a></em></img></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>2. Web Series</h3> \n<p>The human brain is wired to respond to well-crafted narrative.<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-strange-thing-that-happens-in-you-brain-when-you-hear-a-good-story-and-how-to-use-it-to-your-advantage\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-strange-thing-that-happens-in-you-brain-when-you-hear-a-good-story-and-how-to-use-it-to-your-advantage?_ga=2.19986552.1117465120.1616791718-1796479782.1616791718\">Neuroscience</a> proves that storytelling is the best way to capture people’s attention, bake information into their memories, and forge close, personal bonds. We’re programmed to crave and seek out great stories — that’ll never change.</p> \n<p>If you can structure your YouTube channel like a season of television and weave your videos into a narrative-driven series, then you can get viewers hooked on your content -- just like your favorite Netflix show.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>3. Music</h3> \n<p>Covers of songs are some of the most entertaining videos on YouTube. People love listening to aspiring artists’ personal twists on their favorite songs. So if you can sing or play instruments, consider covering your favorite, trending, or hit songs and upload them to YouTube. Who knows, maybe you could even get discovered and become the next<a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube\">Justin Bieber or Tori Kelly</a>.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>4. Album Reviews</h3> \n<p>This highly popular channel idea is full of endless possibilities as new music is made everyday. Famous YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.theneedledrop.com/articles?category=Reviews\">Anthony Fantano</a>&nbsp;has been consistently reviewing both prominent and underground albums over a wide range of music genres for the past decade and earned a cult following for sharing his opinions. While his videos have reached millions, they are relatively easy to record yourself. If you have an ear for music, you’d be surprised to find just how many people would like to hear what you have to say.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>5. Tutorials</h3> \n<p>Whether they’re guitar lessons, beauty lessons, or how-to videos about<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v6RLUb2TQQ\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v6RLUb2TQQ\">making popsicle stick houses for your hamster</a>, people love learning how to enjoy their lives more. If you can cover topics that people are passionate about and teach them how to get better at these things, they’ll be able to live better lives. This’ll grow your channel’s brand loyalty and sentiment, retaining your viewers’ attention and attracting their friends’ attention by way of word-of-mouth marketing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>6. Software Tutorials</h3> \n<p>You don’t have to be a software engineer to make software tutorials, but having a good grasp on how to use them can make for some good YouTube tutorials. Software can encompass subjects like application and system software, YouTube viewers could benefit from learning how to accurately put theirs to use, or how to install newer versions of it.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>8. Photography</h3> \n<p>Photography is considered an artform that takes many different forms. Photos can capture a landscape, family portraits, or more creative editorial content. YouTube is a great website to share tutorials on how to take the best photos for different purposes and equipment. Likewise, you don’t even need expensive cameras or software to create great photos as some photography videos teach people how to take great <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRbnOWNDtlA\">iPhone photos.</a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"YouTuber filming photography tutorial for iPhone portraits\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/30%20YouTube%20Channel%20Ideas%20to%20Help%20You%20Choose%20Your%20Own-Mar-26-2021-08-52-34-10-PM.png?width=624&amp;name=30%20YouTube%20Channel%20Ideas%20to%20Help%20You%20Choose%20Your%20Own-Mar-26-2021-08-52-34-10-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRbnOWNDtlA\">Source</a></em></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>8. Video Editing</h3> \n<p>There are dozens of editing software available to users, but many may be overlooked as videographers may not know how to use them to their full capability. If you know how to use Premiere Pro or other quality softwares, posting a tutorial could engage your viewers to experiment with their content in ways they haven’t thought of before.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>9. Self Help</h3> \n<p>Another way you can grow your channel’s brand loyalty and sentiment is by helping people solve their personal problems. Whether it’s about their career or personal life, you can give people advice about common issues that you’ve experienced or that they ask about. But make sure you have extensive knowledge, education, or personal experience surrounding these topics. Otherwise, people will think you’re a quack and lose trust in you.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>10. Cleaning and Organization</h3> \n<p>Usually marketed toward large family households, even single living people can enjoy the benefits of house cleaning tips and reorganization to make a home more attractive. Making videos tackling tough to clean messes or untidy clothing bins can motivate viewers to the the same.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>11. Minimalism</h3> \n<p>The world dealt while immense change last year, among those changes were increased time periods spent at home. The rise of decluttering and minimalism skyrocketed as people strived to make their houses more enjoyable, and filming your minimalist tips could help people in their own journeys. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/CoreyJones3/videos\">Corey Jones</a>&nbsp;shares minimalism tips from home decorating, wardrobe, and even down to the equipment he uses to film his content.<img alt=\"YouTuber filming minimalist home decor video\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/30%20YouTube%20Channel%20Ideas%20to%20Help%20You%20Choose%20Your%20Own-Mar-26-2021-08-52-32-45-PM.png?width=624&amp;name=30%20YouTube%20Channel%20Ideas%20to%20Help%20You%20Choose%20Your%20Own-Mar-26-2021-08-52-32-45-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80p_6rEEiVE&amp;t=182s\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>12. Style</h3> \n<p>Everyone wants to look good. And by evaluating new clothing, keeping people updated on new trends and styles, and teaching them how to always look their best, you can build a dedicated YouTube following. If your YouTube channel is popular, you can also attract sponsors who will pay you to review their clothing and offer deals to your audience.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>13. Cooking</h3> \n<p>Humans’ love for cooking is primal. I mean, we need food to survive, so it makes complete sense that people are always trying to master certain dishes and learn about new ones. To help them do this, guide them through your recipes, delve into the techniques you use, and show them what their food should look like at each stage of your recipe. This will help them make the best dish possible. When sharing your techniques, don’t be afraid to add a little humor into your cooking like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChBEbMKI1eCcejTtmI32UEw\">Joshua Weissman</a>.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>14. Baking</h3> \n<p>Another part of YouTube that has significantly gained popularity are baking videos. As people scrambled to look for ways to use their freetime in 2020, many found ways to make baked goods a fun and enjoyable pastime. You don’t have to be a professional chef to share a recipe you’ve adapted, and chances are if it’s simple or quick, people will be more inclined to tune in because they can see themselves trying it out.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>15. Fitness Training</h3> \n<p>Personal trainers are expensive. Fortunately, though, you don’t need one to stay in shape. People are starting to resort to free personal trainers or yoga instructors on YouTube to stay active. So if you have a lot of expertise on weight lifting, yoga, or other fitness methods, consider creating workout videos for specific goals, like losing weight, gaining muscle, or improving cardiovascular health.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>16. Home Workouts</h3> \n<p>For many people, the idea of going into a gym may leave them feeling nervous because they don’t know how to use the equipment, or don’t know what a fitness routine includes. By making home workout videos, you make fitness more accessible and feasible for the everyday viewer.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>17. Yoga</h3> \n<p>Another form of fitness to explore is guided yoga videos. Yoga is a wonderful way to actively engage your body and mind, and sharing your expertise on how to properly do it will benefit viewers. By demonstrating how to do different versions of yoga like Ashtanga or Hatha, you’re helping people to calm and stay fit during their busy lives.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>18. Strength Training</h3> \n<p>Strength training videos are great for people of all backgrounds who are looking to build muscle and learn how to do it the right way. If you have a solid routine that others may want to learn and follow, sharing it on YouTube would be a good idea.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>19. Dance</h3> \n<p>Whether you're a professional dancer, or just somebody who likes to move, making dance videos to your favorite songs can make great entertainment. Choreographed numbers or freestyle moving to the latest charting hits can keep your content relevant and inspire others to dance along. Or get even more creative like the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/KukuwaFitness/featured\">Kukuwa Fitness </a>channel and embrace your cultural heritage, dancing to African beats.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"three Youtubers filming dance videos outdoors\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/30%20YouTube%20Channel%20Ideas%20to%20Help%20You%20Choose%20Your%20Own-Mar-26-2021-08-52-32-91-PM.png?width=624&amp;name=30%20YouTube%20Channel%20Ideas%20to%20Help%20You%20Choose%20Your%20Own-Mar-26-2021-08-52-32-91-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shC59uCMCFg&amp;t=17s\">Source</a></em></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>20. Travel</h3> \n<p>Humans are<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brain-triggers-copywriters-use-to-drive-sales\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brain-triggers-copywriters-use-to-drive-sales\">biologically driven to investigate the world</a>&nbsp;rather than respond to it. That’s why people love exploring so much. But before they shell out thousands of dollars to travel someplace they saw on Instagram, people like to do a little research first. So if you have the funds to travel, consider recording your adventures in destination cityscapes or landscapes. Your viewers can actually get an inside look at the location, helping them decide to take a vacation they’ll never forget or save money on a trip they’d regret.</p> \n<h3>Reviews</h3> \n<p>The category of review videos is incredibly expansive. Review category videos can cover different forms of media, items and experiences of your choosing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>21. Product Reviews</h3> \n<p>With websites like Amazon selling millions of different products, a good way to help consumers pick the right products would be to create product reviews. YouTubers can demonstrate the functionality, versatility, and their overall satisfaction with any product they find. While most websites have sections for written reviews, many prefer watching and listening to a trustable consumer like themselves for advice on which product they should choose.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>22. Movie Reviews</h3> \n<p>If you just watched the latest action movie, or smaller indie film, you can take your thoughts straight to YouTube and be amongst the first to share your viewing experience with the world. Movie review videos give viewers the opportunity to see if it’s worth the money to buy a movie that’s been buzzing through social media through YouTubers they can trust.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>23. Show Reviews</h3> \n<p>Similar to movie reviews, with the prevalence of streaming services and their constant new series releases, reviewing seasons of highly favored television is a good route to go on YouTube.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>24. Gaming</h3> \n<p>Some people still think that video games are just for children, but the reality is that it's projected to become a <a href=\"https://techjury.net/blog/gaming-industry-worth/#gref\">$256.97 billion industry</a>&nbsp;by 2025.&nbsp;With fans of all ages, gender and backgrounds, it’s no wonder why YouTube is full of gaming related videos.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>25. Game Playthroughs</h3> \n<p>If you’re already an avid gamer, why not record your game playthroughs? Whether it’s a classic franchise or the newest storyboard, chances are that someone is on YouTube looking for a playthrough. These videos help gamers decide whether they should purchase a game themselves, get past a tough quest, or just enjoy it like any other web series. Don’t be intimidated by the most popular gamers, because smaller channels like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-R8ghoWcuny0CUB3hmm9XA\">Narcissa Wright</a>&nbsp;have a steady stream of subscribers tuning into her playthroughs weekly.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>26. Information Based Gaming</h3> \n<p>Much like those who enjoy watching playthroughs, there is a large audience of gamers who go to YouTube for gaming guides. People that find themselves stuck in a tough quest, or unsure how to reach achievement know they can go to YouTube for visual, instructional videos to help them beat the games they enjoy.</p> \n<p>If these channel ideas seem a bit intimidating, then don’t feel discouraged! For those who are just starting out and want to begin making simplistic and fun videos, then keeping reading.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>YouTube Channel Ideas for Beginners</h2> \n<h3>1. ‘Favorites’ Video</h3> \n<p>People that use YouTube on a daily basis are all consumers of some form. Beginning your channel with something as simple as showing off your favorite games, collectibles, or more could help viewers choose what they invest their money into. These videos are particularly good for small channels as there is more trust in the YouTuber honestly sharing versus making sponsored content for brands.</p> \n<h3>2. Trending News Discussion</h3> \n<p>long as there’s news in pop culture or world events, making a channel solely for news commentary can grow rather quickly if done consistently. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/DAngeloWallace/videos\">D’Angelo Wallace</a> became a famous YouTuber in under 3 years for sharing his interpretation of headlining news or culture happenings. If you have a camera and a good microphone, beginning a channel on trending news discussion could be a good start.</p> \n<h3>3. Reaction Videos</h3> \n<p>you’re watching the latest sporting program or the grand finale of a suspenseful television series, chances are you’re not the only viewer brimming with excitement. This video category is popular because viewers want to connect or feel like they're sharing the experience with someone else.

Can one really explain this? No. Just as one can never learn how to paint.\"</p> \n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Picasso was wrong.</p> \n<p>You actually&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;figure out why “two colors, put one next to the other, sing.”<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=a6b4ed0b-1a8e-4f76-9a8b-7416dc0d7f26&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Download 195+ visual marketing design templates to use for social media posts,  infographics, and more.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a6b4ed0b-1a8e-4f76-9a8b-7416dc0d7f26.png\"></a> Or, more accurately, you can figure out why some color combinations work (i.e., look good) and why other color combinations don’t work (i.e., look terrible).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I realize that Picasso probably meant “one can never learn how to paint” in a less literal, more philosophical way. As in, you can’t teach someone to have a sense of style or how to develop artistic sensibilities; that there is some innate, incomprehensible trait that some people have and some people don’t.</p> \n<p>It would seem, according to Picasso’s quote, that being able to determine what colors look good next to each other is a talent you’re born with, and not something you can learn.</p> \n<p>Again, I would disagree.</p> \n<p>From a scientific standpoint, it’s certainly plausible that some people are genetically predisposed to being good at art and design. But I’d argue that the \"10,000 hours theory” makes that notion irrelevant.&nbsp;For those unfamiliar with <a href=\"http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/\">the 10,000&nbsp;hours theory</a>, it states that anyone can become a master of a particular skill provided that they practice that skill for, approximately, 10,000&nbsp;hours during their lifetime.</p> \n<p>So, while Picasso may have been born with some level of predisposition toward being good at painting, the primary reason why he was so good is quite simple: he painted a lot.&nbsp;And if you practice a lot, you can get better at picking the right color palettes, too.</p> \n<h2>Practice Makes a Perfect Palette</h2> \n<p>Now that we’ve thoroughly ripped apart a quote from one of history’s most famous artists, let’s get practicing!</p> \n<p>In the rest of this article, I’ll walk you through seven, real-word examples of color palettes on the web.&nbsp;For each example, we’ll see if you can guess which company or brand the color palette comes from. Then, we’ll dive into the color theory behind what makes a particular color palette work (or not work, if that happens to be the case).</p> \n<p>Note: <strong>Be sure to scroll down nice and slow so you have a chance to guess before revealing the answer!</strong></p> \n<h3>Example&nbsp;#1: Understanding Different Color Models</h3> \n<p>Alright, here we go: Which website does the color scheme below come from?</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2258431695-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/color-scheme-example1.jpg?width=761&amp;name=color-scheme-example1.jpg\" alt=\"color-scheme-example1\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p>Scroll down to see if you’re right!</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2258431690-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/google-color-palette.jpg?width=761&amp;name=google-color-palette.jpg\" alt=\"google-color-palette\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p>Of course, that blue, green, yellow, and red color palette belongs to none other than the great Google.</p> \n<p>Even without having any previous education around color theory, there are some basic lessons we can take away from this palette on how different color models work.</p> \n<p>For starters, you may have noticed that the&nbsp;red, blue, and yellow&nbsp;in Google's palette are primary colors -- colors you can mix together to form all of the other colors. So, to create green -- the only secondary color in Google’s color palette -- one simply needs to mix blue and yellow together.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2257250656-png/00-Blog-Related_Images/CMYK_color_model.png?width=250&amp;name=CMYK_color_model.png\" alt=\"CMYK_color_model\" width=\"250\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px 20px; float: right;\">Now, if we were mixing blue and yellow paint, that idea of \"mixing\" would hold true. But that’s because the world of painting (and printing) adheres to the CMYK — cyan (blue-ish),&nbsp;magenta (reddish), yellow, and key (black) — color model. Essentially, this color model is comprised of the three primary colors plus black, the latter of which is used for creating darker versions of colors.</p> \n<p>Here’s where things can get a little confusing: CMYK is a subtractive color model, which means colors are created through absorbing, or subtracting, particular wavelengths of visible light. The wavelengths of light that don’t get absorbed are reflected, and that reflected light ends up being the color we see.</p> \n<p>So, using this model, you could argue that a green object isn’t really green at all: it’s simply an object that’s reflecting the wavelength for green and absorbing the wavelengths for all the other colors.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2259292717-png/00-Blog-Related_Images/rgb_color_model.png?width=150&amp;name=rgb_color_model.png\" alt=\"rgb_color_model\" width=\"150\" style=\"margin: 0px 20px 10px 0px; float: left;\">With me so far? Great! Because the colors you saw in the above example weren’t created using the CMYK color model: they were created using the RGB (red, green, blue) color model, which is the model that computers, televisions, and other electronic devices use.&nbsp;Unlike CMYK, RGB is an&nbsp;additive model. Red, green, and blue light waves are added together in particular combinations in order to produce colors.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2255102263-jpg/00-Blog_Thinkstock_Images/color_blocks.jpg?width=250&amp;name=color_blocks.jpg\" alt=\"color_blocks\" width=\"250\" style=\"float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 20px;\"></p> \n<p>So while the green in Google's color palette is a secondary color in the CMYK system, it’s actually a primary color in the RGB system. And overall, Google’s color scheme does feel very primary; or basic. Like preschool or kindergarten. (I always think of those wood blocks with the letters painted on them when I see Google’s colors.)</p> \n<p>Alright, that’s enough with the CMKY / RGB stuff -- it's just to give you a reference point for later on in the post.&nbsp;Let's move on to the next example.</p> \n<h3>Example&nbsp;#2: Hue, Shade, Tint, Tone &amp; Saturation</h3> \n<p>What company's website does the color palette below belong to?&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2259317752-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/color-scheme-example2.jpg?width=761&amp;name=color-scheme-example2.jpg\" alt=\"color-scheme-example2\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p><span>Scroll down to see if you’re right!</span>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2257265871-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/twitter-color-palette.jpg?width=761&amp;name=twitter-color-palette.jpg\" alt=\"twitter-color-palette\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p>Twitter’s color palette provides us with a superb example of a monochromatic color scheme. Instead of thinking of the gray, dark blue, and light blue in Twitter’s palette as separate colors, think of them as different flavors of the same color. Or more accurately, different flavors of the same hue.</p> \n<p>Let’s run&nbsp;through some terminology real quick&nbsp;and this&nbsp;will all start to make a lot more sense:</p> \n<p><strong>Hue:</strong> What we usually mean when we talk about color. The hue is the&nbsp;overarching, discerning quality of a color (e.g. “red” or&nbsp;“blue”).</p> \n<p><strong>Shade:</strong> What you get when you add black to a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;hue (e.g. dark blue is a shade of blue).</p> \n<p><strong>Tint:</strong> What you get when you add white to a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;hue (e.g. light blue is a tint of blue).</p> \n<p><strong>Tone:</strong> What you get when you add both black and white&nbsp;— a.k.a.&nbsp;gray&nbsp;— to a particular hue (e.g. pastel blue is a tone of blue).</p> \n<p><strong>Saturation:</strong> While&nbsp;“tone”&nbsp;is a popular painting term, in the world of graphic design you’ll be more likely to encounter the term&nbsp;“saturation” when dealing with adding gray to color.&nbsp;More specifically, saturation defines a range of color starting with gray (0% saturation) and ending with a pure, gray-less form of the color (100% saturation).&nbsp;Desaturated colors are softer, and&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;duller in comparison to their highly saturated&nbsp;counterparts, which are more vivid.</p> \n<p>Now, back to Twitter: Let’s use the blue from the logo, the lighter blue, as our reference point. That’s our hue. That’s&nbsp;“Twitter blue.”&nbsp;The darker blue is simply a shade of that Twitter blue, yet it has a higher saturation, making it a bit more vivid&nbsp;and eye-catching (which makes a whole lot of sense considering Twitter is using that blue to draw attention to their&nbsp;primary&nbsp;CTA:&nbsp;“Tweet”).</p> \n<p>The gray used for the icons is also a shade of the Twitter blue, but it has a&nbsp;considerably&nbsp;lower saturation&nbsp;(around 20%).</p> \n<p>All said and done, we can&nbsp;describe Twitter’s color scheme as being monochromatic. The colors all look good&nbsp;next to each other because they all have the same root color in them: it’s just the shading, tinting, and&nbsp;saturation levels that make them different.</p> \n<p>This is in stark contrast to Google’s polychromatic color scheme, where there are four&nbsp;distinct hues and no root color&nbsp;binding them all together. So, why do Google’s colors still seem to mesh and look good next to each other? A key reason is because they all have similarly high saturation levels.</p> \n<h3>Example&nbsp;#3: Determining a Color Scheme</h3> \n<p>Aright, on to our next example. Whose website does this color palette come from?</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2259327907-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/color-scheme-example3.jpg?width=761&amp;name=color-scheme-example3.jpg\" alt=\"color-scheme-example3\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p><span>Scroll down to see if you’re right!</span></p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2258552110-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/ups-color-palette.jpg?width=761&amp;name=ups-color-palette.jpg\" alt=\"ups-color-palette\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p>This one was a bit trickier. While most of us are familiar with UPS’s famous (and trademarked) brown, that blue&nbsp;may -- at first glance -- seem to come out of left field.&nbsp;But regardless of whether or not you <em>like</em> that blue color, there's a clear reason why UPS chose it: It's complementary to the brown.</p> \n<p>In the world of color theory, complementary colors are pairs of colors that sit directly across from each other on the color wheel. When you put complementary colors next to each other in a design, they create a high degree of contrast (i.e., both colors really stick out) and the result is usually quite harmonious.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2259205824-png/00-Blog-Related_Images/color-wheel-complementary-colors.png?width=200&amp;name=color-wheel-complementary-colors.png\" alt=\"color-wheel-complementary-colors\" width=\"200\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; float: right;\">Now, there's one more piece to this UPS complementary color&nbsp;puzzle: Where the heck do you find brown on the color wheel?</p> \n<p>The answer: brown is actually just a shade -- or darker version -- of reddish-orange. So&nbsp;to find brown's complement, you first need to find reddish-orange on the color wheel. And when you do that, you'll see that blue appears right across from it.</p> \n<p>Of course, complementary colors aren't the only combination of colors&nbsp;that can make for a pleasing palette. There are also ...</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Analogous colors</strong>, which are colors that appear next to each other on the color wheel.</li> \n <li><strong>Triadic colors</strong>, which are three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.</li> \n <li><strong>Split-complementary colors</strong>, which consist of a base color plus the two colors that are adjacent to the base color's complement on the color wheel.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Here's a little diagram to help you understand these better:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2257994091-png/00-Blog-Related_Images/split-complementary-analogous-triadic.png?width=761&amp;name=split-complementary-analogous-triadic.png\" alt=\"split-complementary-analogous-triadic\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p>Now,&nbsp;truth be told, there are several other types of color combinations that are based on the color wheel -- these are just the most basic. (If you're looking for a deeper dive, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-harmonies.htm\">the&nbsp;Tiger Color website</a>.)</p> \n<p>The main takeaway here is that the observable qualities of colors (e.g., hue, shade, tint, etc.) aren't the only factors that affect how colors interact. By understanding how different colors are oriented on the color wheel, you'll&nbsp;be able to make more harmonious&nbsp;color choices.</p> \n<h3>Example&nbsp;#4: Color&nbsp;and Branding</h3> \n<p><span>Which company's&nbsp;</span><span>website does the color palette below come from?</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2258713446-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/color-scheme-example5.jpg?width=761&amp;name=color-scheme-example5.jpg\" alt=\"color-scheme-example5\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p><span>Scroll down to see if you’re right!</span></p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2259864520-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/fedex-color-palette.jpg?width=761&amp;name=fedex-color-palette.jpg\" alt=\"fedex-color-palette\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p>Whereas UPS added a new color (blue) to its typical brown and yellow color palette when designing their website, rival FedEx did the opposite: FedEx removed the&nbsp;orange that we usually&nbsp;see on their trucks&nbsp;and instead doubled down on the purple.</p> \n<p>As a result, UPS's and FedEx's website color palettes couldn't be more different. While UPS has this whole earth-tone vibe going on, using colors that could appear in nature, FedEx has more of a \"strictly business\" vibe. Their monochromatic scheme uses purple as the sole&nbsp;accent color, which also adds to this palette's inorganic, corporate feel, as the color purple rarely occurs in nature (some folks even claim that <a href=\"http://deron.meranda.us/ruminations/purple/\">purple is an artificial color</a>).</p> \n<p>The takeaway here: Remember that your website's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-does-your-logo-color-really-mean-infographic\">color palette can affect how people perceive you and your business</a>. Different colors correlate to different emotions. Brown, for example, is commonly associated with ruggedness and dependability. Purple, meanwhile, is associated with authority and&nbsp;sophistication.</p> \n<p>We'll explore&nbsp;the relationship between color and psychology a bit further in the examples to follow.</p> \n<h3>Example&nbsp;#5: Pairing Complementary Colors</h3> \n<p><span>Which popular</span><span>&nbsp;news website does the color palette below come from?</span></p> \n<p><span><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2256263778-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/color-scheme-example6.jpg?width=761&amp;name=color-scheme-example6.jpg\" alt=\"color-scheme-example6\" width=\"761\"></span></p> \n<p><span>Scroll down to see if you’re right!</span></p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2260691782-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/huffpo-color-palette.jpg?width=761&amp;name=huffpo-color-palette.jpg\" alt=\"huffpo-color-palette\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p>Ah yes, HuffPost green. From a psychological perspective, the color green is associated with balance, harmony, and reassurance (making it a good choice for a news website, no doubt).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, HuffPost's green is notably dark and desaturated -- like a pine green -- which&nbsp;means it's also associated with wealth and ambition.</p> \n<p>Now, how about that red? Red is the most emotionally charged color, tied to passion and love and hate and all that good stuff. So, when we look at HuffPost's homepage, it's not surprising that our eyes are immediately drawn to those two red call-outs: the \"Watch Live\" call-out on the left and the \"HuffPost Live\" call-out on the right.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Another reason why the red really pops in this situation? It's complementary to the green.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, it's a general rule in design that you should avoid pairing red with green, despite their complementary relationship on the color wheel. For starters, this is because seeing red adjacent to green creates a Christmasy feel that most designers try to avoid. Unless, ya know, they're designing Christmas stuff.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2259810518-png/00-Blog-Related_Images/red-and-green-bad.png?width=250&amp;name=red-and-green-bad.png\" alt=\"red-and-green-bad\" width=\"250\" style=\"margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px; float: left;\">A second reason why you should avoid pairing red with green: People suffering from color blindness -- specifically&nbsp;<span>deuteranopia, which is the most common form of color blindness&nbsp;--</span>&nbsp;can have trouble distinguishing between the two colors.</p> \n<p>A third reason: Red and green often \"compete\" with each other for visual attention when they're paired together,&nbsp;which results in both colors appearing brighter than usual (see left).</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2263688819-png/00-Blog-Related_Images/red-and-green-huffpost.png?width=250&amp;name=red-and-green-huffpost.png\" alt=\"red-and-green-huffpost\" width=\"250\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px; float: right;\">The designers behind HuffPost's color palette were certainly aware of these phenomena, which is why A) they use the red very sparingly in the design, and B) they chose a dark, desaturated green, which plays nicer with the red (see right).&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Example&nbsp;#6: Deep Saturation and Primary Colors</h3> \n<p><span>Which popular&nbsp;website does the color palette below come from?</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2255861923-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/color-scheme-example4.jpg?width=761&amp;name=color-scheme-example4.jpg\" alt=\"color-scheme-example4\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p><span>Scroll down to see if you’re right!</span></p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2259537725-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/buzzfeed-color-palette.jpg?width=761&amp;name=buzzfeed-color-palette.jpg\" alt=\"buzzfeed-color-palette\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p>The first few words&nbsp;that come to mind when looking at BuzzFeed's color palette include \"bright,\" \"vivid,\" \"in-your-face,\" and \"stop-what-you're-doing-right-now-and-read-this-OMG-OMG-OMG!!!\"</p> \n<p>Clearly, BuzzFeed's goal with this color palette&nbsp;is to attract our attention.&nbsp;But in terms of color theory, what's going on here?</p> \n<p>For starters, BuzzFeed -- like Google -- uses primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. But BuzzFeed's red, yellow, blue are brighter and more deeply saturated, and thus more&nbsp;eye-catching.</p> \n<p>Also, if we ignore that black (<a href=\"http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/are-black-and-white-colors\">which isn't really a color, per se,</a> but is rather what&nbsp;results from the total absence -- or total absorption -- of visible light waves), we could say that BuzzFeed uses a triadic color scheme, as red, yellow, and blue are spaced out evenly around the color wheel.</p> \n<p><span>In terms of color psychology,&nbsp;red (as I mentioned in the previous example) is the most emotionally charged color around, so it's not surprising&nbsp;that BuzzFeed employs it in their logo: They want you to feel&nbsp;energized and excited.</span></p> \n<p><span><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2263749409-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/smiley-faces.jpg?width=333&amp;name=smiley-faces.jpg\" alt=\"smiley-faces\" width=\"333\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;\">Yellow, another prominent color in BuzzFeed's palette, is associated with both energy and happiness. And speaking of happiness&nbsp;... doesn't that row of yellow circles with the black text at the top of BuzzFeed's homepage&nbsp;remind you of a row of smiley faces?</span></p> \n<p><span>The blue in BuzzFeed's color palette is reserved exclusively for links and call-to-action buttons, which is a smart move. Blue, you see, is associated with calmness and trustworthiness. So, amidst&nbsp;all the emotional chaos of BuzzFeed's red and yellow, the blue links feel inviting, as if to say, \"Don't worry, we know it's crazy here, but you can trust us! Go ahead, give us a click!\"</span>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Lesson&nbsp;#7: Desaturated Palettes</h3> \n<p><span>Alright, it's time for our final example: Which popular</span><span>&nbsp;website does the color palette below come from?</span></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2259849400-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/color-scheme-example7.jpg?width=761&amp;name=color-scheme-example7.jpg\" alt=\"color-scheme-example7\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p><span>Scroll down to see if you’re right!</span></p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p>.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2260671557-jpg/00-Blog-Related_Images/facebook-color-palette.jpg?width=761&amp;name=facebook-color-palette.jpg\" alt=\"facebook-color-palette\" width=\"761\"></p> \n<p>If you had trouble figuring out that the above palette was from Facebook, don't feel bad: I deliberately made it a little tricky by including the red and the yellow.</p> \n<p>Truth be told, if you scroll around Facebook, you'll see that they employ a variety of colors, especially when it comes to sidebar icons. (For our purposes, I focused specifically on the icons near the top of the page in order to extract the yellow and the red.)</p> \n<p>Now, this is where my master plan comes together: Take a look at the&nbsp;Facebook color palette, then scroll back up to BuzzFeed's. Both sites employ&nbsp;yellow, red, and blue in their colors schemes ... yet the schemes couldn't feel more different!</p> \n<p>By now, you're probably able to explain why this is. But let's run through it together just for funsies.</p> \n<p>For starters, Facebook employs a few different shades of its iconic blue (just like Twitter does). It's an easy way to add some contrast to a design without veering off into an entirely different stylistic direction.</p> \n<p>However, the main culprit here is saturation: Facebook's yellow, red, and blue are all&nbsp;desaturated to a similar degree. And as a result, they all feel calm and relaxed. Whereas seeing BuzzFeed's color palette feels like taking a shot of&nbsp;espresso, seeing Facebook's palette feels like getting wrapped up in a&nbsp;cozy blanket.</p> \n<p>Of&nbsp;course, the way the two sites employ their colors is very different. With BuzzFeed, blue -- a color that instills trust and calmness -- only appears on links. With Facebook,&nbsp;there's a&nbsp;fixed&nbsp;blue bar running right across the top of the site, so those feelings of trust and calmness are ever-present.</p> \n<p>All said and done,&nbsp;Facebook's muted, blue-centric color palette makes us want to kick off our shoes and relax&nbsp;a while. And considering <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-23/heres-how-much-time-people-spend-on-facebook-daily\">the average American spends about 40 minutes each day checking Facebook</a>, those color choices seems to be working out.</p> \n<p><em>Have some color theory wisdom you'd like to share?

All businesses should aim to have one, and below we’ll discuss how to create a compelling marketing message for your own business.</p> \n<h3>Know your target audience.</h3> \n<p>Just as with most marketing practices, you can’t begin creating your marketing message without identifying your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/target-audience?_ga=2.94793692.1944277943.1614376295-1637944583.1614376295\">target audience</a>. When you know who they are, you’re not marketing to customers you think are interested in you, but rather to those you know are interested in you.</p> \n<p>In brief, your target audience is a group of consumers with similar characteristics and purchasing intent, and stand to gain the most value from your products. While your overall target audience is probably defined by the industry you’re in, it’s important to have a deeper understanding.</p> \n<p>To learn more about your target audience and narrow down who they are, you can conduct <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer persona research</a>, analyze your competitors, practice <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/social-listening\">social listening</a>, and invite people to participate in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-focus-group\">focus groups</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-interviews?_ga=2.94793692.1944277943.1614376295-1637944583.1614376295\">interviews</a>.</p> \n<p>Overall, what you want to learn from identifying your target audience is understanding what they “look” like. This can be simple demographic information, like age and location, to what they like, desire, and want from the businesses they buy from.</p> \n<p>Having this information then makes it easier to personalize your strategies and create a marketing message that will resonate with them, especially when addressing their pain points.</p> \n<h3>Understand your audience’s pain points.</h3> \n<p>Your persona research should tell you about your audience’s pain points and challenges.</p> \n<p>As a refresher, pain points are issues that affect your target audience’s day-to-day routines, business tasks, or general life desires. These challenges are typically things that your audience is actively seeking solutions for.</p> \n<p>For example, if you’re a business selling marketing SaaS, you may discover that your audience has trouble managing their campaigns because they use multiple platforms throughout their process. When you create your marketing message, you should speak to your ability to streamline their efforts with your easy-to-use, all-in-one platform.</p> \n<p>If you’re a B2C business that sells eco-friendly clothing, a customer pain point could be that they struggle to find brands without significant environmental impact. In your marketing message, you should speak to their desire to minimize environmental pollution through sustainable shopping opportunities.</p> \n<p>When you understand pain points, you don’t have to guess why your customers need you — you’ll know why they need you. As a result, you can create a marketing message that addresses their needs.</p> \n<p>The first two steps on this list involve gathering the necessary background information, and the following steps will help you begin crafting your message.</p> \n<h3>Make value propositions.</h3> \n<p>Value propositions highlight your product or service’s unique value and tell customers that your brand is tailor-made to meet their needs. It clearly says why they should do business with you instead of a competitor, and that is precisely the point of a marketing message.</p> \n<p>When creating your message, present your product or service as a cure for their pain points, and prove it. Continuing with the eco-friendly business example, you can specifically mention that your clothing is locally produced, separating you from the competition that mass produces its goods abroad.</p> \n<p>This message tells consumers that you’re solving their pain point, which is a lack of sustainable clothing brands, because you design ethically produced and environmentally friendly products.</p> \n<h3>Prioritize clarity and concision.</h3> \n<p>Even though your marketing message needs to say a lot, you need to say a lot while saying a little. You shouldn’t beat around the bush. Instead, get to the point and explain how your product is a solution.</p> \n<p>Customers should read your message and find answers to their questions without needing to overanalyze your statements. Prioritize being clear, concise, and easily understood, as you want your words to speak for themselves. To reiterate, get to the point.</p> \n<p>You can think of it like this: I said a lot in this explanation just to tell you to get to the point. If this were a marketing message, you would’ve moved along already. However, if I wanted to follow the tips I’ve mentioned, I would simply say, “Tell me why you’re the best – no ifs, ands, or buts.”</p> \n<h3>Use familiar, conversational language.</h3> \n<p>Even though your customers are in your industry, you shouldn’t assume that they know or understand the technical jargon related to what you sell. Therefore, it’s important to sound conversational and use language that is familiar and palatable to most audiences. Your message copy should be simple, straightforward, and not require an industry-specific dictionary.</p> \n<p>For example, you can use technical terms to describe the features in your latest automobile model. Still, car enthusiasts would be the only ones that genuinely understand what it means to have a 600 horsepower engine and AAA uniform tire quality grading (I certainly don’t know what this means). &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Aim to write as people speak during conversations, maintain a friendly tone, and make customers feel welcomed. Robotic and technical language may be confusing and lead them to think that doing business with you will be complicated and confusing as well.</p> \n<p>In sum, by being conversational and familiar, you’re reaching everyone, from first-time industry customers to seasoned CEOs.</p> \n<h3>Showcase your brand's originality. &nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Your marketing message’s overall intent is to attract your target audience, but it’s also to set you apart from your competitors. Given this, a key pillar of your final message is originality.</p> \n<p>Run-of-the-mill marketing messages seem like they could belong to any of your competitors, and original ones showcase what makes you unique. This can be your brand's personality, the features that set you apart from your competitors, or a combination of the two.</p> \n<p>Your marketing message is unique to your business, your solutions are unique to your business, and your words should prove that.</p> \n<h3>Use user-generated content (UGC).</h3> \n<p>Consumers are 14% more likely to trust recommendations from <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2020-06/2020%20Edelman%20Trust%20Barometer%20Specl%20Rept%20Brand%20Trust%20in%202020.pdf\">someone like them</a>&nbsp;(another consumer) over a brand employee. With that in mind ,using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/user-generated-content-stats\">UGC</a>&nbsp;in your messaging, like testimonials and reviews, can help you support your products’ value.</p> \n<p>As your target audience likely shares the same challenges, seeing that someone like them has benefited from your product can help them make their final decision. For example, you could say, “95% of our customers love [xyz], and you will too.”</p> \n<h3>Appeal to customer emotions and logic.</h3> \n<p>There are a variety of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/consumer-behavior-model?_ga=2.94793692.1944277943.1614376295-1637944583.1614376295\">consumer behavior models</a>&nbsp;that explain how people make purchasing decisions. Some models say that it’s through logical reasoning, and others say that it’s purely emotional. In reality, it’s probably a combination of the two, and you should use this to your advantage.</p> \n<p>Through tactics like humorous copy, you can showcase your brand's uniqueness to appeal to customer emotions, and use value propositions to appeal to logical reasoning and show customers how you’ll solve their problems.</p> \n<h2>Use Your Marketing Message to Speak to Your Customers</h2> \n<p>The key takeaway here is that your marketing message should convince your audience to do business with you.</p> \n<p>Focus on showcasing your brands’ individuality, creating an emotional connection, and clearly showing your customers what’s in it for them. If you do this, you’ll likely find yourself with a marketing message that speaks directly to your target audience and helps you grow your list of clients.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-message&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png","linkMd5":"1ebc0cf1d0ab0e19203e25445f55eb9b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn10@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-30-610_eac7fa40866dc905.webp","destWidth":382,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4555,"destBytes":6088,"author":"fneedle@hubspot.com (Flori Needle)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn10@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-30-610_eac7fa40866dc905.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/nike-message.jpg?width=536&name=nike-message.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-00-819_ad8da0d0e76e79dc.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/black%20girl%20sunscreen.jpg?width=555&name=black%20girl%20sunscreen.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn30@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-330_2a295f621ba6b738.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chipotle.jpg?width=574&name=chipotle.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn37@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-306_518178afc591fee1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lab%20muffin-message.jpg?width=565&name=lab%20muffin-message.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn34@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-01-891_22141b351ce6ab21.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/zoom-message.jpg?width=569&name=zoom-message.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn74@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-55-265_ac5246ef56d9eae0.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn22@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-52-647_f4156d3bc1379fd0.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-message&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-51-443_3e142d7383c708ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370113},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"A Marketer's Short & Sweet Guide on Diversification","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/diversification-marketing","description":"<p>To consider the potential payoff of product diversification, let's start with an example.</p> \n<p>Lululemon, an athletic apparel company, was founded in <a href=\"https://info.lululemon.com/about/our-story/history\">1998 with one core product</a><span>: yoga clothing for women. </span></p> \n<p>If you've been to a store recently, you've likely seen how far beyond women's yoga-clothing Lululemon has grown.</p> \n<p>For instance, my brother now buys <em><span>all</span></em><span>&nbsp;his button-down shirts and work pants from Lululemon.</span></p> \n<p>Additionally, last week I bought a bathing suit from the shop.</p> \n<p>On their Our Story page, Lululemon states: \"Our first designs were made for women to wear during yoga. Through plenty of feedback from our guests, ambassadors and elite athletes, we now design for yoga, running, cycling, training and most other sweaty pursuits for women and men.\"</p> \n<p>This is an example of effective diversification in-action. Here, we'll explore what diversification marketing is, and how it pertains to your marketing strategy.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png\" align=\"middle\"></a> \n<p></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Why diversify your product offerings?</h2> \n<p>There are three reasons a business might choose to diversify its existing product line:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>You've reached the 'limit' on the amount of people you can convert in a market segment.</li> \n <li>You've identified a new product or service that complements the needs of your existing customers.</li> \n <li>You've decided a new level of growth can only be achieved through addressing new market segments.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Let's dive into the difference between the three of these reasons, now.</p> \n<p>First, perhaps you've reached the limit of the amount of people you can reach in a market segment. If you created a niche product or service, you might've spent the last few years marketing your product to your core audience demographic.</p> \n<p>Eventually, you'll reach your limit of potential people you can reach and convert within that audience segment.</p> \n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras\">GoPro</a><span>&nbsp;started out selling HD cameras for sports and adventure. However, there are only so many people they can target with GoPro cameras — which is likely why they expanded to camera accessories, and even lifestyle gear, including backpacks and clothing. </span></p> \n<p>With an expanded product line, GoPro can now target audiences who are looking for outdoor gear, along with audiences who are searching for HD cameras.</p> \n<p>Second, perhaps you've identified a complementary product or service to the one you currently offer. To identify complementary products or services, consider what goal(s) your products help your customers achieve, and what other tools or services they need to achieve those goals even faster.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">Mailchimp</a><span>, as an example, started as an email marketing tool. Now, the company has diversified its product offerings and expanded into social media tools and even website builders. </span></p> \n<p>Mailchimp created an email marketing tool to help customers reach new audiences and convert those audiences faster. Social media tools and website builders, then, are natural extensions of that primary goal.</p> \n<p>Finally, a third reason you might diversify your product offerings is simply to reach and convert new segments of customers. This is less of a brand-new product or service, and more of a tier-method in which you have the same product with varying features depending on audience segment.</p> \n<p>An example of this is a software company that initially targeted small businesses, and is now expanding into the enterprise audience segment.</p> \n<p>To successfully expand, you'll need to ensure your new product features accurately address enterprise users' needs — which will be drastically different from your small business clients'.</p> \n<p>Another example is a sports shoe company that continues to create sports shoes, and doesn't diversify its products or services beyond sports shoes. However, the company does start creating different lines of sports shoes to address different audience segments: including tennis players, golfers, and joggers.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Advantages and Disadvantages to Product Diversification</h2> \n<p>There are a few major benefits to diversification, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Minimizing losses</strong>: Ever heard the term, \"Don't put all your eggs in one basket\"? That's the premise of this advantage. Basically, if one of your products underperforms, you'll be able to minimize company revenue loss if your other products are performing well or better than expected.</li> \n <li><strong>Increasing brand recognition</strong>: If Apple only sold computers, it probably wouldn't be the well-known brand it is today. But since the company has expanded into smartphones and music players, it's expanded the amount of customers who use an Apple product. As customers increase, so does brand recognition.</li> \n <li><strong>Increasing customer lifetime value</strong>: By expanding your offerings, you're increasing opportunities for customers to find value in your brand — which could increase brand loyalty. For instance, if Lululemon <em>just</em>&nbsp;offered yoga pants, I probably wouldn't be such a big fan. But since I can get workout clothes, work clothes, and even swimwear from them, my loyalty towards them is high.</li> \n</ul> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">If you create a tier-program in which you offer additional product features for varying phases of a business, you're minimizing the risk that your customers will outgrow you. </span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>However, there are also risks associated with diversification. A few major risks include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Brand dilution</strong>: People no longer associate your brand with the product or service you your were initially known for, and they're unsure how your new products relate to your business mission or values.</li> \n <li><strong>Resourcing limitations</strong>: You don't have the budget or headcount to effectively create new products or services, or your marketing team doesn't have the resources to properly target a new market audience.</li> \n <li><strong>&nbsp;Inconsistent support for additional products</strong>: If your support team isn't prepped to handle the new complaints or challenges prospects and customers are facing with your new product, the industry's overall satisfaction with your brand could decrease.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Marketing's Role in Diversification</h2> \n<p>If your company is diversifying its product portfolio, your marketing team plays a major role in the success of that expansion.</p> \n<p>Among other things, your marketing team is likely in charge of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide\">market research</a><span>&nbsp;(including your new segment's unique challenges and pain points), <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/product-marketing\">product development</a><span>&nbsp;(i.e. ensuring your product successfully meets your target audience's needs, especially as those needs evolve over time), and creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/product-launch-checklist\">successful product launch</a><span>.</span></span></span></p> \n<p>Ultimately, your marketing team needs to learn how to target your new market segment — which might be difficult if your brand hasn't targeted that audience in previous marketing campaigns. (To learn more about audience segmentation and targeting, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/segmentation-targeting-positioning\">The Marketer's Guide to Segmentation, Targeting, &amp; Positioning</a><span>.)</span></p> \n<p>And, just as importantly, your marketing team needs to mitigate some of the risks associated with diversification.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>For instance, marketers can minimize brand dilution by telling a comprehensive story to the public that outlines <em><span>why</span></em><span> these new products or services make sense to your business' vision, goals, or overall mission.</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Lastly, when marketing your new products, services, or expanding into new market segments, consider how you might <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-strategy-guide\">diversify your marketing </a><em><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-strategy-guide\">strategy</a></em><span>&nbsp;to achieve growth with these new product offerings. </span></p> \n<p><span>A marketing strategy that worked well for one product won't necessarily work well for another — so it's critical, as a marketer, you remain flexible and open-minded to pivoting to properly address the needs of these new customers. </span></p> \n<p>When done properly, diversification is an incredibly exciting opportunity to fuel long-term growth ... Just consider the growth Lululemon has seen since making the courageous leap into apparel beyond women's yoga clothes.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdiversification-marketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png","linkMd5":"6b696b3fc2005772c14f667f230fb6ab","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-681_5a38291bbbb54ba3.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5125,"destBytes":6842,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-681_5a38291bbbb54ba3.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-54-880_b69ef96b2d492171.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdiversification-marketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn56@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-56-021_cfb46a45f1dd08f1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370091},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:29","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:29","title":"What is LinkedIn Live?

In 2020, it was <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/100225/broadcast-with-the-linkedin-live-feature\">announced that LinkedIn Live would also become available to business pages</a>.</p> \n<p>With this <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/linkedin-company-pages/2020/introducing-linkedin-virtual-events-solutions\">announcement</a>, LinkedIn decided \"to bring you a tighter integration between LinkedIn Events and LinkedIn Live, by turning these two products into a new virtual events solution that enables you to stay connected to your communities and meet your customers wherever they are.\"</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-live-stream-checklist\">Live streaming</a> continues to gain popularity among audiences. In fact, <a href=\"https://cdn.streamelements.com/static/Q4_December.pdf\">in 2019, internet users watched 1.1 billion hours of live video</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, according to <a href=\"https://www.go-globe.com/live-streaming-statistics/\">Go-Globe</a>, live streaming is expected to account for 82% of all internet traffic.</p> \n<p>Plus, <a href=\"https://news.linkedin.com/2020/april/linkedin-business-highlights-from-microsoft-s-fy20-q3-earnings\">LinkedIn Live streams have increased by 158% since February 2020</a>.</p> \n<p>Although LinkedIn Live isn't available to all businesses right now, it might be time to start thinking about live streaming.</p> \n<p>To get started with LinkedIn Live, you can <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/lv-app\">complete an application online to become a Live broadcaster.</a></p> \n<p>In this post, let's review how you can leverage LinkedIn Live in your marketing strategy to attract new audiences.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Get the essential guide to using LinkedIn for marketing and professional  networking.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe.png\"></a></p> \n<h2>LinkedIn Live</h2> \n<p>LinkedIn Live is the live streaming feature that allows you to stream live video to your audience so you can drive engagement and build deeper connections.</p> \n<p>In fact, LinkedIn Live videos get, on average, <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/linkedin-live\">seven times more reactions and 24 times more comments</a> than native video produced by the same broadcasters.</p> \n<p>LinkedIn, known as the professional social media network, is a great place to stream live videos because you can truly get to know your audience and engage with them in a way that companies haven't been able to do before.</p> \n<p>Now that you know what LinkedIn Live is and why you should use it, let's dive into the logistics.</p> \n<h3>1. Apply for LinkedIn Live.</h3> \n<p>To get started with LinkedIn Live, you'll need to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/lv-app\">apply</a> to have the feature added to your profile.</p> \n<p>The application will ask you where you want to live stream (from a personal profile or a business page) and the link to the page you want to stream from.</p> \n<p>If you want to stream from a business page, you'll also need to include the profile URLs of the page admins. Only up to three page admins can have the ability to stream from your business page.</p> \n<p>Once you've applied, it's time to wait for approval. Be sure to keep checking on this, because you don't want to miss the notification that you've gained access to LinkedIn Live.</p> \n<h3>2. Sign up for a third-party streaming tool.</h3> \n<p>Before you can go live on LinkedIn, you'll need to sign up for a third-party streaming tool because LinkedIn doesn't offer native streaming currently.</p> \n<p>You can use tools like <a href=\"https://streamyard.com/\">StreamYard</a> or <a href=\"https://www.socialive.us/\">Socialive</a>. These tools are also helpful for going live on a desktop computer. They can make it easier to see comments and actually interact with your audience during the stream.</p> \n<h3>3. Connect LinkedIn to third-party tool.</h3> \n<p>Now that you've signed up for your streaming tool and you've received approval for LinkedIn Live, it's time to connect the two platforms.</p> \n<p>To do this, log in to your third-party tool and navigate to the area where you can add streaming destinations (this will change depending on the tool you're using).</p> \n<p>Once you find the right place to add a streaming destination, you should be able to click LinkedIn profile and connect from there.</p> \n<h3>4. Write a title and description for the stream.</h3> \n<p>After the tools are connected, you're ready to go live. Just click the button that says go live or start streaming. Before the platform actually starts live streaming, you'll see an area to write a title and description for the stream.</p> \n<p>Be sure to accurately describe what's going on in the video and what users can expect. This will help get your audience interested in the live stream.</p> \n<h3>5. Go live on your third-party tool.</h3> \n<p>Now all you need to do is go live. Before you do, make sure your camera and mic are all set up. You'll also want to double check the camera position, lighting, camera quality, audio, and background. It's important that your set up looks professional, especially given that LinkedIn is the professional social network.</p> \n<p>So, we know what LinkedIn Live is and how to get started, but you might be wondering, <em>\"How can I use this tool?\"</em> Let's dive in below.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Virtual Events</h3> \n<p>With the recent integration of LinkedIn Live and LinkedIn Events, the social media platform is a great place to host your virtual events.</p> \n<p>LinkedIn virtual events allow you to meet your audience where they are and host your event in a trusted environment.</p> \n<p>Additionally, hosting a virtual event on LinkedIn Live will help you attract the right professional audience.</p> \n<p>You can share your events with your business page followers, plus you can send event invitations to your first-degree profile connections.</p> \n<p>Instead of taking videos during your virtual conference and posting them on LinkedIn later, LinkedIn Live allows you to connect with your audience in real-time.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/linkedin-company-pages/2020/introducing-linkedin-virtual-events-solutions\">LinkedIn</a>, LinkedIn Live is seeing 23 times more comments per host and six times more reactions per post than native video.</p> \n<p>With LinkedIn Live, you can engage and connect with your followers in real-time during your virtual events.</p> \n<h3>2. Recruiting</h3> \n<p>LinkedIn is one of the main hubs for recruiters and job-seekers alike. In fact, recruiting is one of the top benefits of having a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-stats\">LinkedIn</a> profile for individuals and brands.</p> \n<p>With LinkedIn Live, you can support your recruiting efforts by showing off your workplace culture, introducing team members, and answering questions from your audience.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can host a live panel with employees on what it's like to work for your company. Team members can discuss what their hiring journey looked like and give tips to people who want to work for your company one day.</p> \n<p>You can also host a Q&amp;A with different people on your team to highlight their specific roles. For example, you can have them introduce themselves and their role, and then take questions about their day-to-day tasks and duties.</p> \n<p>If you want to use LinkedIn Live to support your recruiting efforts, think about other social media tactics you've implemented, and then strategize how those can convert into a live stream.</p> \n<h3>3. Thought Leadership</h3> \n<p>One of the central <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-myths\">LinkedIn strategies</a> for most companies is to use the social media platform to position yourself as an industry leader.</p> \n<p>To do this with LinkedIn, you can discuss current events in your industry and boost your content creation strategy.</p> \n<p>Using LinkedIn Live, you can host a panel for industry thought leaders, including those at your company, to talk about industry trends and issues.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can host a live stream dedicated to interviewing industry professionals and experts.</p> \n<p>Amplifying thought leaders and participating in industry discussions is a great way to use LinkedIn Live to attract new audiences.</p> \n<h3>4. Showcase Expertise</h3> \n<p>Not to be redundant, but becoming an authority in your industry is an important part of your marketing strategy.</p> \n<p>LinkedIn Live presents an excellent opportunity to showcase your expertise.</p> \n<p>Using live streaming technology, you can share your tips and tricks with your audience. To do this, brainstorm how-to topics that your audience is interested in.</p> \n<p>If you're struggling to come up with ideas, consider repurposing old content like blog posts or YouTube videos.</p> \n<p>Producing live streaming content will help you boost your content marketing strategy.</p> \n<h3>5. Announce a New Product or Partnership</h3> \n<p>As a professional social media platform, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-stories\">LinkedIn</a> is a great place to announce a new product or partnership.</p> \n<p>In fact, you might consider doing this on LinkedIn Live. You can bring on representatives from your company and partner company to discuss what the new partnership entails.</p> \n<p>This is also a great opportunity to educate and interact with your audience.</p> \n<p>By launching a product during a live stream, you can get immediate feedback from your audience, answer questions, and conduct a live demonstration.</p> \n<p>The announcement of LinkedIn Live proves that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/live-video-stats\">live streaming</a> will continue to be an important tactic in your marketing strategy. In fact, this feature shows that consumers are interested in interacting with brands in real-time.</p> \n<p>If you've already used Facebook and Instagram Live, LinkedIn Live might be another platform to use and experiment with -- especially if your audience is more likely to be on LinkedIn than other platforms.</p> \n<p>To learn more about how real brands are using LinkedIn Live, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/linkedin-live-examples\">check out this blog post on LinkedIn Live examples</a>.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in June 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b612a0dc-34ea-4e79-908b-28874def7e5a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"How to Use LinkedIn for Business and Marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b612a0dc-34ea-4e79-908b-28874def7e5a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Flinkedin-live&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe.png","linkMd5":"801dfaf88348361c4982fc65db17d660","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-30-537_a5901e98cb60ea43.webp","destWidth":754,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7622,"destBytes":12106,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddd33609-1733-44d2-a811-a5435b201ffe.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-30-537_a5901e98cb60ea43.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b612a0dc-34ea-4e79-908b-28874def7e5a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-50-01-107_85ce3eb0b1d04252.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Flinkedin-live&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425369986},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"8 Image SEO Best Practices to Make Your Content More Discoverable","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/image-seo","description":"<p>To consider the importance of visual search in 2021, let's start with an example.</p> \n<p>The other day, I Googled \"how to conduct a vlookup in Excel\".

Use relevant, accurate alt text for user accessibility and SEO.</span></h3> \n<p>As a quick refresher: Alt text is written copy that describes an image. For instance, if you click on <a href=\"https://www.pipsnacks.com/\">Pipcorn's popcorn product</a> and inspect the page, you'll see the alt text describes the product image accurately as \"Popcorn Family Pack Popcorn Pipsnacks LLC\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/the%20alt%20text%20of%20popcorn%20family%20pack%20pipsnacks%20product.jpg?width=2534&amp;name=the%20alt%20text%20of%20popcorn%20family%20pack%20pipsnacks%20product.jpg\" alt=\"the alt text of popcorn family pack pipsnacks product\" width=\"2534\" style=\"width: 2534px;\"></p> \n<p>Alt-text plays two critical roles in SEO.</p> \n<p>First, alt text — also known as alt tags, or alt descriptions — helps search engine crawlers index your website more effectively, which has a positive effect on search results.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">In fact, Google <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/google-images\">states on its Developers page</a>, \"You can aid in the discovery process by making sure that your images and your site are optimized for Google Images … [and] increase the likelihood that your content will appear in Google Images search results.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Second, alt text improves the user experience. Alt text can describe an image to a visually impaired reader, and also helps if a reader can't load or see the image correctly on their device.</p> \n<p>To get a full run-down of how to write high-quality alt text, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/image-alt-text\">Image Alt Text: What It Is, How to Write It, and Why It Matters to SEO</a>.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2. Consider using captions to describe an image.</span></h3> \n<p>Captions aren't typically necessary if the context of the page can help readers understand what the image is depicting — for instance, in this blog post I haven't used any captions because I've used text to introduce each image I've shown.</p> \n<p>However, if you have a visual-heavy website, consider using captions to help readers understand an image in context. For instance, on <a href=\"https://tomhull.co.uk/projects\">Tom Hull's photography portfolio</a>, he captions his images so viewers can contextualize where, or what, the image represents:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tom%20Hulls%20photography%20portfolio.png?width=1358&amp;name=Tom%20Hulls%20photography%20portfolio.png\" alt=\"Tom Hulls photography portfolio\" width=\"1358\" style=\"width: 1358px;\"></p> \n<p>Use good judgment when it comes to adding captions, but if you feel it can help readers (and bots) better discern an image, then it might be a worthwhile addition to a page.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">3. Compress images for faster load time.</span></h3> \n<p>Compressing images is a vital component of any good website optimization strategy.</p> \n<p>Why?</p> \n<p>Because, simply put, it helps your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-reduce-your-websites-page-speed\">web pages load faster</a>, which provides a better user experience and also helps boost your website's search engine rankings.</p> \n<p>To compress your images effectively, try a tool like <a href=\"https://compressjpeg.com/\">Compress JPEG</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://squoosh.app/\">Squoosh</a>.</p> \n<p>Typically, less than 100 KB is ideal in terms of good file size.</p> \n<p>However, it's important to note — Google doesn't look at each individual image size. Instead, it looks at <em>total</em>&nbsp;page size.</p> \n<p>So, if you have a small image where quality differences are less substantial, then you might try compressing that image to 30-50 KB … which gives you extra room to keep another image 30 KB bigger, particularly if that image loses quality after compression.</p> \n<p>If you're still worried about image quality after compression, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/high-resolution-image-guide\">How to Ensure Your Images are High Resolution</a>.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">4. Post original images — not just stock photos.</span></h3> \n<p>Ultimately, Google (and readers) prioritize original content — which means, if you're hoping your images will rank on image results pages, it's vital you use original, unique images.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></span></p> \n<p>This is particularly important if you work for an ecommerce website and you're posting visuals of your product. Many shoppers use images to shop for consumer goods. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/search/online-shopping-image-statistics/\"><span>50% of online shoppers say images</span></a> helped them decide what to buy.<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></span></p> \n<p>If your image doesn't accurately demonstrate your product, it will get buried under better, higher-quality images from competitors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Consider using products like <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\"><span>Canva</span></a> to design in-house infographics, graphs, or animated images to help your brand stand out on search results pages and make your images more shareable.</span></p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">5. Name your file images before uploading them.</span></h3> \n<p>Your file name can impact how easy it is for search engine crawlers to interpret your image, so it's helpful to rename your file <em>before </em>uploading it onto your webpage.</p> \n<p>Rather than keeping the name a generic \"IMG_0883\", try using relevant keywords to describe what's in the image, similar to your alt text. This can also help ensure your image appears on the image search results page, which will increase traffic to your site.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">6. Use responsive images.</span></h3> \n<p>Responsive images are critical for ensuring your readers can see your images on any type of device. Nowadays, it's vital your pages are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-website-mobile-experience\">optimized for mobile</a>&nbsp;to impact search engine rankings, as well as user experience.</p> \n<p>If your images aren't responsive, the page won't appear as clean on mobile as it does on desktop — which negatively affects SEO, as well as your reader's perception of your brand.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, some website hosting services, including HubSpot, automatically ensure your images are responsive.</p> \n<p>However, if need be, you can make your images responsive by using quick code. For instance, you can add this code to your HTML:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&lt;img src=\"nature.jpg\" alt=\"Nature\" class=\"responsive\"&gt;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Or this code to your CSS:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">.responsive {</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp; width: 100%;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp; height: auto;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">}</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">7. Leverage images as a backlinking opportunity.</span></h3> \n<p>Creating high-quality, unique, original images isn't just great for your own website — it's also a fantastic opportunity to earn backlinks when <em>other</em>&nbsp;websites use your image for their own pages.</p> \n<p>For instance, consider the following graph created by Broadband Search:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mobile%20share%20of%20organic%20search%20visits%20graph.png?width=1802&amp;name=mobile%20share%20of%20organic%20search%20visits%20graph.png\" alt=\"mobile share of organic search visits graph\" width=\"1802\" style=\"width: 1802px;\"></p> \n<p>The image currently ranks in the first spot on the image search results page for the keywords, \"how many people use mobile to search\".</p> \n<p>Additionally, according to Ahrefs, this blog post has over <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ahrefs.com/site-explorer/overview/v2/prefix/live?target%3Dwww.broadbandsearch.net%252Fblog%252Fmobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1614801047073000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3beWeQSowox42-X4snYT9n\">3,000 backlinks</a>. I'm willing to bet that those backlinks are, in part, due to other companies wanting to use Broadband Search's unique graphs for their own content.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">If you create high-quality images, other companies may want to showcase those images on their own sites — with links back to your business. This means, ultimately, images can have a direct impact on the amount of traffic, leads, and customers you get for your business through your marketing efforts.</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">8. Add images to an existing sitemap.</h3> \n<p>Google <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/image-sitemaps\">suggests adding images to an existing sitemap</a>&nbsp;— or creating a separate sitemap just for images — to help search engines discover your images. In particular, this is helpful for images Google can't find through crawling, such as those accessed via JavaScript forms.</p> \n<p>Here's a <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/image-sitemaps\">sample sitemap</a>, with two images included:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/code%20to%20add%20images%20to%20an%20existing%20sitemap.png?width=1248&amp;name=code%20to%20add%20images%20to%20an%20existing%20sitemap.png\" alt=\"code to add images to an existing sitemap\" width=\"1248\" style=\"width: 1248px;\"></p> \n<p>Fortunately, if you don't want to add images to a sitemap manually, you're in luck — there are tools, such as <a href=\"https://www.angeldigital.marketing/image-sitemap/\">Angeldigital.Marketing</a>&nbsp;(one of the only free ones available!), that will automatically generate an image sitemap once you input a URL.</p> \n<p>Hopefully, you can use these best practices to level up and earn new traffic through search image results pages. Remember, a picture is worth a thousand words ... so just imagine the value of an <em>SEO-optimized</em> picture.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=05aa9467-4eda-4dd6-8b7f-ad9855abfe33&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/05aa9467-4eda-4dd6-8b7f-ad9855abfe33.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fimage-seo&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"cb309a00584a90ba023bce1d7db2aa83","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how%20to%20conduct%20a%20vlookup%20in%20excel%20image%20results%20page.png?width=1774&name=how%20to%20conduct%20a%20vlookup%20in%20excel%20image%20results%20page.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn99@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-54-579_935aa8c37f227a58.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-30-734_ac504860637ee534.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/the%20alt%20text%20of%20popcorn%20family%20pack%20pipsnacks%20product.jpg?width=2534&name=the%20alt%20text%20of%20popcorn%20family%20pack%20pipsnacks%20product.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn39@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-00-323_e18d347b102384ab.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tom%20Hulls%20photography%20portfolio.png?width=1358&name=Tom%20Hulls%20photography%20portfolio.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-55-783_7eedbcbe26e0c408.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mobile%20share%20of%20organic%20search%20visits%20graph.png?width=1802&name=mobile%20share%20of%20organic%20search%20visits%20graph.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn73@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-02-411_b33b5eaae822c83f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/code%20to%20add%20images%20to%20an%20existing%20sitemap.png?width=1248&name=code%20to%20add%20images%20to%20an%20existing%20sitemap.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn2@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-58-621_eae0f22a4ea5fea3.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/05aa9467-4eda-4dd6-8b7f-ad9855abfe33.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn38@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-01-228_339ca67d143927cd.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fimage-seo&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn87@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-00-769_137f82ec96d135ea.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370154},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"Media Buying 101: What It Is and How It Works [+15 Platforms to Use]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-buying","description":"<p>Ever wonder who is behind those <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/banner-ad-clicks?_ga=2.159081978.1709370357.1613508418-1939712723.1613508418\">banner ads </a>on the sites you visit the most? Or the Super Bowl ads we talk about for weeks after they've aired? The answer is media buyers.</p>  \n<p>When a brand gets a marketing budget, a portion of that typically goes to paid advertising. That's where media buying comes in.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Access Now: Free Media Planning Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e.png\"></a></p> \n<p>It doesn't get much buzz in the marketing industry, but this process is responsible for the targeted ads we see today.</p> \n<p>Let's dive into this process of which so many of us are on the receiving end.</p> \n<p>Whether they're watching a TV show or scrolling through a website, media buyers get brands in front of their target market.</p> \n<p>It's not like social media where users come and find you. It's an outbound strategy that is only effective if you have a well thought-out strategy. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rex-gelb-43445b1b/\">Rex Gelb</a>, director of advertising and analytics at HubSpot, says one of the biggest mistakes brands make is not thinking through their marketing goals.</p> \n<p>\"Some ad placements might be good for one set of goals, but bad for another. Let's say you're an airline and your focus is impressions and awareness, rather than an immediate sale, you can buy a placement that is known to get cheap impressions,\" he said.</p> \n<p>Gelb continued,\"Now, let's say you're a CEO who wants to promote a 'letter to our customers.' In this instance, what you'll care about is cheap clicks. Buying cheap impressions, which made sense in the previous example, no longer helps you accomplish your goal.\"</p> \n<p>That's why media planning is such an important step, as it helps you get the most out of your ads.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nowadays, media buying is done in one of two ways:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Direct buy </strong>– Media buyers forge relationships with publishers to negotiate ad inventory, e.g., working with a newspaper to have an ad placed in the upcoming issue.</li> \n <li><strong>Programmatic buy </strong>– The buying process is done using automated technology.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Media Buying vs. Media Planning</h2> \n<p>Media buying and media planning fall into the same category but are two different processes. While media buying focuses on getting the most impressions from the right audience at the lowest cost, media planning focuses on the strategy behind the campaign.</p> \n<p>During the planning phase, you determine what media will be most effective to reach a particular audience. So once media planning is complete, media buying follows. It's also important to note that media planning isn't solely for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising\">advertising</a>, it's for any media a brand puts out there.</p> \n<p>However, in a small to medium-sized business, the job may be done by the same person or team.</p> \n<h2>How Digital Media Buying Works</h2> \n<p>With digital media buying, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/programmatic-advertising-glossary\">programmatic buying</a>, buying impressions is automated. The negotiation still technically happens but it's done at a much quicker rate through open and private marketplaces.</p> \n<p>The traditional approach, on the other hand, involves negotiations and relationship building with publishers.</p> \n<p>There are three components to this automated buying structure:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Demand-side platforms (DSP) </strong>where advertisers and ad agencies set up their campaigns, bid on ad inventory, and optimize their ads based on performance.</li> \n <li><strong>Supply-side platforms (SSP)</strong> where publishers sell their ad inventory. It's the publisher version of the DSP.</li> \n <li><strong>The ad exchange </strong>marketplace where advertisers and publishers buy or sell ad inventory through real-time bidding (RTB).</li> \n</ul> \n<p>RTB is not the only way to purchase impressions, you can also use private marketplaces, in which publishers limit who can participate in the auction. Another option is called programmatic direct, in which ad inventory is sold at a fixed cost per thousand impressions (CPM) with no bidding.</p> \n<p>So what about ad networks? Well those platforms aggregate ad inventory from various publishers and match them to advertisers' needs, serving as intermediaries. Think <a href=\"https://www.google.com/adsense/start/\">Google Adsense</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork\">Facebook Audience Network</a>.</p> \n<p>Digital media buying can be more cost-effective and allow teams to focus on ad performance instead of back-and-forth negotiations. However, with the latest restrictions on cookies and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency\">Apple's AppTrackingTransparency</a> (ATT) rollout on iOS 14, it's unclear how that will affect the media buying space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"With the upcoming release, Apple will be asking all of its users for permission to track when they open an app, and big ad networks like Facebook won't be exempt,\" said Gelb. \"Needless to say, a lot of iOS users are going to opt out, which will have negative implications in terms of targeting and conversion tracking.\"</p> \n<p>\"Nobody knows exactly what the impact will look like yet,\" he added, \"but we, in the industry, are crossing our fingers and hoping for the best.\"</p> \n<h2>Media Buying Tips</h2> \n<h3>1. Strategize.</h3> \n<p>Before you launch your ad campaign, you'll have to figure out a few things.</p> \n<p>The first question is, what's the goal of your campaign? Do you want more website traffic, brand awareness, social engagement? Aligning your team on one goal will help focus your efforts and better track your campaign's success.</p> \n<p>This leads us to key progress indicators (KPIs). You'll need them to monitor your campaign and determine if any adjustments need to be made. Lastly, your campaign will need a budget. If it's a long-running campaign, you may set a daily budget.</p> \n<p>These steps are typically completed during the media planning phase. However, in some cases, media planners are also responsible for buying ads as well.</p> \n<h3>2. Identify your target and where to find them.</h3> \n<p>Your next step is determining who the campaign will target and which networks will be most appropriate to reach them.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say a health-focused vegan dessert company wants to run an ad campaign next quarter and they want to target health-conscious, vegan consumers. The marketing team may want to advertise on YouTube videos with vegan-friendly content, fitness and nutrition websites, or even cooking and recipe pages.</p> \n<p>When buying media, you can target audience by device, location, behaviors, interests, web browser, and more.</p> \n<h3>3. Set up your campaign.</h3> \n<p>This step will vary depending on which media buying platform you are using.</p> \n<p>However, when typically using a DSP, you will input your campaign details, such as campaign type, creative assets, budget, target audiences, and bidding strategies. So, once that process is complete, all there is to do is launch and wait for results to come in.</p> \n<p>If you're taking a direct approach, this will likely be a collaborative process between your team and your publisher's account manager.</p> \n<h3>4. Track the results and optimize.</h3> \n<p>The most exciting (and possibly scariest) part of launching an ad campaign is tracking its performance.</p> \n<p>As soon as it launches, you can start gathering data on how your ads are performing. In this stage, it's important not to make decisions too quickly. You'll want to gather enough data to get a full picture before switching gears.</p> \n<p>Using the same vegan dessert company, let's say they launched an ad campaign through Google's ad network. They are using two static image ads and one video ad. After one week, they notice that the video ad is significantly outperforming the banner ads. The media buyer can decide to reallocate funds to that ad type and placement as it is generating better results.</p> \n<p>A media buyer's job is to maximize ad potential while staying within the budget. As such, if the ad isn't delivering on expectations, adjustments can and should be made during the length of the campaign.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/display-video-360/\">Google Display &amp; Video 360</a></h3> \n<p>Inside the Google Marketing Platform, you'll find Display &amp; Video 360.

And that's why SEO is something marketers should continue to define, and redefine. Here's a brief definition in under 100 words:</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: State of Marketing Report [2020 Version]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>What Is SEO?</h2> \n<p>SEO stands for search engine optimization -- that much has stayed the same. It refers to techniques that help your website rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs). This makes your website more visible to people who are looking for solutions that your brand, product, or service can provide via search engines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing.</p> \n<p>What hasn't stayed the same are the techniques we use to improve our rankings. This has everything to do with the search algorithms that these companies constantly change.</p> \n<p>Here are some other frequently asked questions about this critical practice today.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How Does SEO Work?</h2> \n <p>SEO works by optimizing a website's pages, conducting keyword research, and earning inbound links. You can generally see results of SEO efforts once the webpage has been crawled and indexed by a search engine.</p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>Looking deeper:</strong> There are a ton of ways to improve the SEO of your site pages, though. Search engines look for elements including title tags, keywords, image tags, internal link structure, and inbound links (also known as backlinks). And that's just to name a few.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://app.hubspot.com/l/blog\">HubSpot customers: you can check out the SEO panel in your HubSpot account to see how well you're optimized for those things.</a></p> \n<p>Search engines also look at site structure and design, visitor behavior, and other external, off-site factors to determine how highly ranked your site should be in their SERPs.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What Is an Organic Search?</h2> \n <p>Organic search refers to someone conducting a search through a search engine and clicking on a non-paid result. Organic search is a search marketing channel that can be used as part of inbound marketing to increase website traffic.</p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>Looking deeper:</strong> In present-day SEO, you can't simply include as many keywords as possible to reach the people who are searching for you. In fact, this will actually hurt your website's SEO because search engines will recognize it as keyword stuffing -- or the act of including keywords specifically to rank for that keyword, rather than to answer a person's question.</p> \n<p>Nowadays, you should use your keywords in your content in a way that doesn't feel unnatural or forced. There isn't a magic number -- it all depends on the length of your keyword and article -- but if you feel like you're forcing it, it's better to ignore it and continue writing naturally.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What Is SEO Strategy?</h2> \n <p>An SEO marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan to get more visitors to your website through search engines. Successful SEO includes on-page strategies, which use intent-based keywords; and off-page strategies, which earn inbound links from other websites.</p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>Looking deeper:</strong> Before you create a new site page or blog post, you'll probably be thinking about how to incorporate your keywords into your post. That's alright, but it shouldn't be your only focus -- or even your primary focus. Whenever you create content, your focus should be on the <em>intent</em> of your audience, not how many times you can include a keyword (whether it's long tail or short tail) in your content.</p> \n<p>To satisfy intent and rank well in the long term, build your SEO marketing strategy around <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-strategy\">topics, not keywords</a>. If you do that, you'll find you can naturally optimize for important keywords, anyway. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-questions\">Understanding your target audience</a> (aka buyer personas) and what interests them is key to attracting relevant visitors to your website through search engines.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What Is Organic Traffic?</h2> \n <p>Organic traffic is unpaid traffic that comes from search engines such as Google or Bing. Paid search marketing does not increase your organic traffic numbers, but you can optimize your website using inbound marketing software to gain more visitors.</p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>Looking deeper:</strong> One of the biggest changes in the last decade is the way other user behaviors shape the SERPs a user sees on search engines. And today, social media can have a big impact on your organic traffic trend line. Even just a few years ago, it didn't make a difference who was finding your content through social search. But now SEO takes into account tweets, retweets, Google+ authorship, and other social signals.</p> \n<p>Social search also prioritizes content and people that are connected to you. That could mean through a Facebook friend, Twitter follower, or connection through another social network. Sometimes social search will even prioritize content that has been shared by an influencer. Social search understands that you may be interested in content that your network feels is important to share, and therefore it'll often get surfaced to you.</p> \n<p>This all means when you're thinking about your SEO strategy, you need to think about how your social media strategy fits into the puzzle, too.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What Is Direct Traffic?</h2> \n <p>Direct traffic consists of website visitors that come to your website by typing the URL into their browser, rather than coming from another website, a search engine, or social media.</p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>Looking deeper:</strong> Think of search engine optimization as \"search experience optimization.\" It's not just important for your users to find your website -- it's important for them to stay on your website, interact with your content, and come back later. Direct traffic doesn't just increase your \"page authority\" in the eyes of Google; it creates more opportunities to turn someone, who first discovered you organically, into a customer.</p> \n<p>SEO actually takes into account whether or not your visitors are staying on your website and engaging with other content. If you rank well for a keyword and attract a visitor who isn't relevant, it won't actually help your website.</p> \n<p>Think about your visitors and the content they are looking for more than how many people you can attract to your website.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>The Importance of SEO</h2> \n <p>SEO is important because it helps people find information and discover pages on the world wide web. SEO is especially important for businesses as it ensures they're answering their audience's biggest questions on search engines, while driving traffic to their products and services.</p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>Looking deeper:</strong> In the past, SEO success was measured by whether or not you were ranked high on the first page of Google. But even if you ranked well for a term, does that actually mean you're going to see results?</p> \n<p>Not always. You might rank really well for terms that aren't ideal for your business. So you appear high on search engines, get a ton of traffic, but then your website visitors realize your company isn't what they were looking for. You don't convert customers from this traffic, and ranking high for this particular keyword is essentially fruitless.</p> \n<p>Also, you don't necessarily need to be in the top three slots to be successful. In fact, if you rank well on subsequent pages, you may still have a <a href=\"https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2276184/no-1-position-in-google-gets-33-of-search-traffic-study\">high clickthrough rate</a>, albeit less traffic. That's great news for marketers who can't seem to bring pages into those top slots or off the second page.</p> \n<p>We said it before and we'll say it again: The amount of traffic to your page is less important than how qualified that traffic is.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How Much Does SEO Cost?</h2> \n <p>SEO can cost between $100 and $500 per month if you do it yourself with a keyword research tool. It can cost between $75 and $150 per hour for a consultant, and up to $10,000 per month if you hire a full-service marketing agency. Small businesses generally spend less on SEO than big brands.</p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>Looking deeper:</strong> An SEO cost can mean one of two things: the investment in your organic search strategy, or how much you pay for paid search engine marketing (SEM) services like Google AdWords. If you're paying for a tool, consultant, or marketing agency to help you optimize your web content, your bill can vary wildly with the depth of the services you're receiving.</p> \n<p>Yes, $10,000 sounds scary, but <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/much-seo-cost-277110\">40% of businesses</a> today are actually spending less than $1,000 a month on SEO.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What Is Paid Search Engine Marketing?</h2> \n <p>Paid search engine marketing refers to pay-per-click (PPC) advertising. This enables you to pay a search engine for text ads shown at the top and bottom of search engine results pages after someone conducts a search. It is used to increase website traffic and gain more customers.</p> \n</div> \n<p><strong>Looking deeper:</strong> You can actually pay for top rankings on Google SERPs by registering for a free account on Google AdWords. You'll then select various keywords you'd like to rank under, and pay Google each time a user clicks on your result. This is called PPC search engine marketing, and your ads will be noticeably different in their appearance than the organic results below them.</p> \n<p>The average cost of a paid search campaign on Google can be less than $1 per click, but, naturally, the more popular the keyword, the more you might pay.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>How to Do SEO</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Conduct an audit of your website content.</li> \n  <li>Use keyword research tool to identify the keywords with which people are finding you.</li> \n  <li>Target new keywords you'd like to rank for.</li> \n  <li>Develop new content and optimize existing content.</li> \n  <li>Monitor your website's performance.</li> \n  <li>Purchase inbound marketing or SEO software.</li> \n  <li>Examine the web pages that are performing well.</li> \n  <li>Look for opportunities to earn inbound links from similar websites.</li> \n  <li>Monitor your change in rankings and traffic.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<p>It's still the same thing it was 10 years ago -- a bunch of tactics that, if you employ them, will help you rank better in search engines. It's just the tactics we now use that have changed.

If you keep that goal in mind with your SEO strategy, you'll find your choices pay off, even if you're not totally up to date on every single nuance of search engine algorithms.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhat-is-seo&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png","linkMd5":"df0ec0aaef48ee93f4a2565e6aaf5ec3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-34-687_0a6311d55189482b.webp","destWidth":373,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4265,"destBytes":5992,"author":"rleist@hubspot.com (Rachel Leist)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-34-687_0a6311d55189482b.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn31@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-333_ba6ee21c8b9c368e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fwhat-is-seo&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn93@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-53-126_31962217d5d178ce.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370091},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"A Beginner’s Guide to Web Analytics","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guide-to-web-analytics-traffic-terms","description":"<p>Views, new visitors, returning visitors — they sound similar but these metrics are not the same.

You can track overall traffic, bounce rate, traffic sources, new and returning visitors, time spent on site, and much more.</p> \n<p>The amount of data can be overwhelming at first. That’s why it’s important to identify a few key metrics, particularly as you’re getting started. For example, you might start by focusing on bounce rate on a few key pages on your site. If visitors are quickly bouncing from your homepage, then that indicates they’re not finding the information they’re looking for quickly or easily enough. From there, you can identify possible next steps, like redesigning your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/main-website-navigation-ht\">website navigation</a>.</p> \n<p>Let’s take a closer look at why web analytics is important below.</p> \n<h3>Importance Of Web Analytics</h3> \n<p>Web analytics is critical to the success of your business. It enables you to better understand your site visitors and use those insights to improve the experience on your site. For example, if you discover that the majority of users on your site are using a mobile device, then you can focus on making your website more mobile-friendly.</p> \n<p>Web analytics can also shape your content and SEO strategy. Looking at your top viewed posts, you can begin to identify what types of content and topics perform best with your audience. If you notice how-to WordPress tutorials make up the majority of your top viewed posts, for example, then you might shift and narrow your focus from definition articles about anything web-related to how-to WordPress tutorials. Or maybe you look at your site’s traffic sources and notice that organic and email traffic are your top drivers and paid channels are your lowest. In that case, you might shift resources to invest more in your organic strategy than paid.</p> \n<p>Now that we have an idea of what web analytics is and why it’s important, let’s look at some key metrics you might track to measure progress against — and eventually meet — overarching business objectives, like increasing website traffic, leads, and revenue.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>Before you read on, it's important to note that various analytics tools may have slightly different definitions of the following terms. It's best to consult your particular tool's documentation to understand exactly how each is calculated.</p> \n<h3>Pageviews</h3> \n<p>Pageviews is the total number of times a page was viewed on your site. A pageview (or view) is counted when a page on your site is loaded by a browser. So if a person were to view a page on your site and reload the page in their browser, that would count as two views. If a person viewed one page, viewed a second page on your website, and then returned to the original page, that would count as three views.</p> \n<p>Pageviews can give you an idea how popular a page on your site is —&nbsp;but it’s important to look at in context of other metrics. A page with a high number of views for a post isn’t necessarily popular since a small group of visitors could be responsible for a lot of those views. A high number may also indicate that a page was confusing and required visitors to return to it multiple times.</p> \n<h3>Unique Pageviews</h3> \n<p>Unique pageviews is the total number of times a page was viewed by users in a single session. In other words, a unique pageview aggregates pageviews that are generated by the same user during a session (which we’ll define below). So if a person viewed the same page twice (or more times) during an individual session, unique pageviews would only count that pageview once.</p> \n<p>Since this metric discounts instances in which a user reloads or visits the same page in the same session, unique pageviews help you get a better understanding of how many visitors are viewing pages on your site and how popular individual pages are.</p> \n<h3>Sessions</h3> \n<p>A session is a group of interactions — including not only page views, but activities such as CTA clicks and events — that take place on your website within a given time frame.</p> \n<p>The timeframe of a session varies by web analytics tool. For example, sessions in Google Analytics and HubSpot’s traffic analytics tools last 30 minutes by default. A session ends and a new session starts for a user when either A) there has been 30 minutes of inactivity and the user becomes active again, B) the clock strikes midnight, or C) a user arrives via one traffic source, leaves, and then comes back via a different source.</p> \n<p>That means, if a user lands on your site, leaves, and returns within 30 minutes, Google Analytics and HubSpot will count it as one session, not two. On the other hand, if a user is inactive on your site for 30 minutes or more but then clicks on a CTA or takes another action, Google Analytics and HubSpot will count it as two sessions, not one, even if the user never left your site.</p> \n<h3>New Visitors</h3> \n<p>New visitors — also termed new users, unique visitors, or new visitor sessions, depending on the web analytics tools —&nbsp;is the number of unique visitors on your website.</p> \n<p>As the name implies, a new visitor is an individual who visits your site for the first time. These individuals are identified by a unique identifier. For example, when using HubSpot, the <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/reports/where-do-i-find-my-hubspot-tracking-code\">HubSpot tracking code</a>&nbsp;is installed on your site. Then, visitors on your site are tracked by the cookie placed in their browser by this tracking code.</p> \n<p>Two important notes to keep in mind. A single visitor can have multiple sessions and pageviews on your site. And unique visitors is not an entirely accurate metric. That’s because most web analytics tools use cookies to track visitors, which doesn’t always distinguish new visitors from returning ones (which we’ll define below). For example, if a person visits your site via their mobile phone and then on their personal computer, they'll be counted as new visitors on both occasions.</p> \n<h3>Returning Visitors</h3> \n<p>Returning visitors (or users) is the number of visitors on your website who have visited before. Not all web analytics tools include this metric, but some —&nbsp;including Google Analytics — do. In Google Analytics’s Audience reports, you can look at behaviors to see the ratio of new to returning users on your site.</p> \n<p>Looking at both new and returning visitors metrics are great for getting a sense of how well you're retaining your visitors, and how effective you are in attracting net new visitors at the top of the funnel.</p> \n<p>Again, just keep in mind that this metric won’t be completely accurate if the web analytics tool uses cookies to track visitors.</p> \n<h3>Traffic Sources</h3> \n<p>Traffic sources is a metric that shows where your site visitors are coming from. Like visitor information, this metric is usually collected via the tracking code on your site.</p> \n<p>The number of traffic sources you can track will vary depending on the web analytics tool. HubSpot’s traffic analytics tools tracks multiple categories, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Organic Search</li> \n <li>Referrals</li> \n <li>Organic Social</li> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Paid Search</li> \n <li>Paid Social</li> \n <li>Direct traffic</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Ideally, you want to increase all sources of traffic. But your biggest focus should be organic search, which is traffic that comes from non-paid search results in search engines like Google. That’s because this source has potential to drive huge amounts of traffic to your site. Plus, improving this channel often improves other channels, like referrals and social, as well.</p> \n<h3>Bounce Rate</h3> \n<p>Bounce rate is the percentage of visitors that leave your website after viewing a single page. You can look at bounce rate as a site-wide metric, or a page-level one. If your site’s bounce rate is high, then it might help to identify pages with high average bounce rates.</p> \n<p>At the page level, average bounce rate is the percentage of sessions&nbsp;that started on the page and did not move to another page on your site. A high average bounce rate might indicate there’s a problem with the page’s loading time, or that external links are not opening in a new tab or window, among other reasons.</p> \n<p><em>To learn what actions you can take to reduce bounce rate in WordPress or another platform, check out </em><em><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-reduce-bounce-rate-in-wordpress\">How to Reduce Bounce Rate in WordPress</a></em><em>. </em></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Web Analytics Best Practices</h2> \n<p>Many aspects of web analytics are specific to your business: what metrics you track, how you build out reports, what tools you use. But there are some best practices that can help anyone collect, analyze, and report website data in a more consistent and effective way. Let’s look at a few.</p> \n<h3>1. Pick metrics that align with your business objectives.</h3> \n<p>Focusing on only one or two metrics won’t provide enough insight into how visitors are interacting with your site — but tracking every single metric might provide <em>too</em>&nbsp;much information. To make sure you’re focusing on the right metrics, start by plotting your business objectives. Think: what are the top priorities for your site? Then, think of specific strategies you’ll implement to achieve these objectives, like fixing broken links and images. You’re now ready to identify what metrics will help you track your progress for achieving your goals and ultimately your business objectives.</p> \n<h3>2. Use data to drive decision making.</h3> \n<p>After collecting and reporting your data, figuring out whether or not you met your goals is only the first step. The next —&nbsp;and arguably more important — step is to use that data to test, experiment, and make changes on your site. For example, say you identified some high-value content — like your Services and Pricing page — through user testing and feedback in your web design process, but these pages aren’t getting much traffic. In that case, you might move these navigation links from your footer to your header or implement other changes to make these pages easier to find.</p> \n<h3>3. Don’t limit your focus to traffic.</h3> \n<p>Understanding and reporting traffic data — including pageviews, top traffic sources, and most viewed pages — is important. But it’s just one piece of your website performance. High traffic doesn’t necessarily mean success. If you’re getting millions of pageviews but no conversions, then you’re probably not meeting all your business objectives.</p> \n<h3>4. Always pair data with insights.</h3> \n<p>If you report that your website got one million unique pageviews and four hundred thousand new visitors in a month, that doesn’t mean all that much. Only reporting the numbers provides an incomplete picture of your website performance. It’s essential that you pair this data with insights. If you report that your website got one million unique pageviews, which exceeded last month’s unique pageviews and showed a percent increase year over year, then the data is much more meaningful.</p> \n<h3>5. Look at your data in context.</h3> \n<p>While collecting and analyzing data, think about it in context. What variables or larger forces could be impacting the numbers? For example, seasonality, algorithm updates, and bots can all have a major impact on your traffic and other metrics. Say, a few pages on your site saw major spikes in traffic. These posts weren’t recently updated so you look where this traffic came from. If the traffic mostly came from one country where you usually don’t see much traffic, like <a href=\"https://medium.com/@hCaptcha/which-countries-have-the-most-bot-traffic-2019-dcb399f2c333\">Ukraine, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, or Russia</a>, then this was likely bot traffic. Looking at your data in context can help you better understand, analyze, provide insights, and make informed decisions with your data.</p> \n<h3>6. Share and ask for feedback from stakeholders.</h3> \n<p>You want to provide information to stakeholders in a consistent and understandable way. You also want to ask for information and ideas from these stakeholders. They can provide valuable feedback on how they use the data, what else they want to see or understand about their users or website, and how they think they can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ux-user-experience\">improve the user experience</a>&nbsp;or other issues the data uncovers.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Web Analytics Tools</h2> \n<p>Measuring organizational success requires more than one metric — and more than one tool. Let’s take a look at three web analytics tools you could use together.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/analytics\">HubSpot Marketing Analytics &amp; Dashboard Software</a></h3> \n<p><img alt=\"langing page of HubSpot Marketing Analytics and Dashboard Software \" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Draft%20-%20web%20analytics-1.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=Draft%20-%20web%20analytics-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" /></p> \n<p>With HubSpot’s free marketing analytics and dashboard software, you can measure the performance of all your marketing assets &nbsp;— from website and landing pages, to emails, blog posts, social media accounts, calls-to-action, and more — in one place. You’re able to track the complete customer lifecycle, measure traffic overall or on a page-by-page basis, and add multiple reports to your dashboard so you’re tracking your most critical metrics in one easy-to-access place.</p> \n<p>HubSpot’s free tool is ideal for anyone looking for built-in analytics, reports, and dashboards so they can make smarter, data-driven decisions.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://analytics.google.com\">Google Analytics</a></h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Google Analytics dashboard showing users, sessions, bounce rate, and other web analytic metrics \" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Draft%20-%20web%20analytics.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=Draft%20-%20web%20analytics.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" /></p> \n<p>Used by <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Google-Analytics\">over 28 million websites</a>, Google Analytics is one of the most popular web analytics tools. With this tool, you can track pageviews, unique pageviews, bounce rate, traffic channels, user retention, average session duration, sessions by country, sessions by device, and more. You can also build out reports about your audience, acquisition channels, website performance, and conversions in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-analytics\">Google Analytics</a>.</p> \n<p>Understanding the value, flexibility, and popularity of Google Analytics, some platforms offer unique integrations with this tool. <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/analytics-data/google-analytics-amplifier-222008\">Analytics Amplifier</a>, for example, is a HubSpot app that allows users to match HubSpot customer behaviours — including “hot leads” and “deal amount” — with real-time Google Analytics data.</p> \n<p>The sheer amount of metrics, reports, and integrations that can be tracked or created using Google Analytics can be overwhelming. Users without SEO or technical expertise, like content creators, may find it difficult and prefer an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/best-google-analytics-alternatives\">alternative</a>.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.crazyegg.com/\">Crazy Egg</a></h3> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage of web analytics tool crazyegg\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Draft%20-%20web%20analytics-2.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=Draft%20-%20web%20analytics-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" /></p> \n<p>Used by over 300,000 users, Crazy Egg is a unique web analytics tool that provides heatmaps, scrollmaps, and other visual reports to show you exactly how your visitors are interacting with your site.

This makes Crazy Egg an ideal alternative or supplement to Google Analytics for users interested in conversion optimization.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>For example, Google Analytics offers several APIs that you can use to automate complex reporting and configuration tasks. One such API is the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4\">Google Analytics Reporting API</a>. With this API, you can build custom dashboards to display your Google Analytics data, automate complex reporting tasks to save time (like getting data in two date ranges with a single request), and integrate your GA data with other business applications.</p> \n<p>Another popular example is <a href=\"https://docs.chartbeat.com/cbp/api/real-time-apis\">Chartbeat’s Real-Time API</a>. This API consists of data that is updated every three seconds so you can see how your visitors are interacting with your content in real time. You can use this data to improve audience engagement, inform editorial decisions, and increase readership, which is why Chartbeat is used by bigwig news organizations including <em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;and <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p> \n<p><em>To understand what APIs are and how they work in general, check out </em><em><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/application-programming-interface-api\">The Ultimate Guide to Accessing &amp; Using APIs</a></em><em>.</em></p> \n<h2>Using Web Analytics to Improve Your Website</h2> \n<p>Whether you’re a small business, ecommerce site, or enterprise company, web analytics can help you and your company grow.

In fact, <a href=\"https://buffer.com/state-of-social-2019\">businesses choose Facebook as a channel over YouTube, even for video content</a>.</p> \n<p>In 2018, the HubSpot Academy team didn't take advantage of YouTube, either. But in the latter half of the year, the team feared the major losses in traffic they could face if they didn't hop on board -- so they implemented a strategy that enabled them to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-academy-grew-youtube-subscribers\">grow YouTube subscribers by 25%</a> in just two months. Because YouTube is a search engine, part of that strategy relied on optimizing the videos to increase the chances of discoverability.</p> \n<p>One of the most important tactics for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-seo\">optimizing your YouTube channel</a> is writing descriptive YouTube descriptions.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=0b51489d-5d5c-4054-b30c-86008871e5f1&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: 7 YouTube Video Description Templates [Free Prompts]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0b51489d-5d5c-4054-b30c-86008871e5f1.png\" align=\"middle\"></a> \n<h3>YouTube Channel Description</h3> \n<p>A YouTube channel description is similar to the \"About\" page of a website. In fact, it even appears under the \"About\" tab of your channel's YouTube page.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-channel-description.gif?width=870&amp;name=youtube-channel-description.gif\" alt=\"youtube-channel-description\" width=\"870\" style=\"width: 870px;\">The YouTube channel description is meant to convey to potential viewers what your content is about: the topics you cover, the themes you tackle, and why. You'll not only need to convey <em>what&nbsp;</em>you discuss but also what you bring to the discussion and why they should listen to you. The goal here is to turn a one-time viewer into a long-term subscriber and consumer of your content. You'll be able to add this when <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-a-youtube-channel\">setting up your YouTube channel</a>.</p> \n<p>In addition to its primary goal of turning viewers into subscribers, this text can also be crawled by YouTube and could help your channel get found by people who are looking for channels like yours. With that in mind, be sure to use the terms that you think people would use to search for your content.</p> \n<h3>YouTube Video Description</h3> \n<p>The YouTube&nbsp;<em>video&nbsp;</em>description can be found underneath the viewport of the video itself.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-video-description.jpg?width=650&amp;name=youtube-video-description.jpg\" alt=\"youtube video description underneath video viewport\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px;\">While the YouTube channel description talks about the body of video content that you upload, each video will also need a unique description to increase the likelihood of your video getting found when someone is searching for a particular topic.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In this video, the creator summarizes the question being asked and specifies the audience that the video is meant for. This text will help audiences (and YouTube) understand what the video is about. In addition, it's also prime real estate to include contact information and calls to action.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube-video-description-example.jpg?width=650&amp;name=youtube-video-description-example.jpg\" alt=\"youtube-video-description-example\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p>Ultimately, if you're ready to begin <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/youtube-marketing\">using YouTube to attract and convert an audience</a>, it's critical you optimize your video descriptions for SEO. If you're unsure how to start crafting compelling YouTube descriptions, keep reading -- here, we'll explore various tactics you can employ, and provide templates to ensure you have everything you need to excel on YouTube.</p> \n<h2>How to Create Compelling YouTube Video Descriptions</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-templates?hubs_post-cta=header\">Use YouTube Description Templates [Free Prompts]</a></h3> \n<p>HubSpot has compiled <strong>seven YouTube video description templates</strong> to help your business provide context to your viewers, rank better in search, organize your team, and link out to relevant webpages on your site.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-templates?hubs_post-cta=image&amp;_ga=2.7182455.479289684.1614299805-235880503.1614299805\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Untitled%20design%20(88)-2.png?width=1140&amp;name=Untitled%20design%20(88)-2.png\" alt=\"HubSpot's 7 YouTube Video Description Templates\" width=\"1140\" style=\"width: 1140px;\"></a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-templates?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download These Templates for Free</a></span></p> \n<h3>2. Explain what your video is about.</h3> \n<p>To explore the best tactics for writing YouTube descriptions, I spoke with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricPeters0/\">Eric Peters</a>, a Senior Growth Marketing Manager on HubSpot's Academy team. He told me, \"[YouTube descriptions] is one of the primary ways YouTube knows what your video is about. Include links, additional resources, links to other videos and playlists, etc. Make sure the description box is easy to read.\"</p> \n<p>As Peters notes, explaining your YouTube video and incorporating keywords into your description doesn't just help with SEO rankings -- it also helps with accessibility for people who are deaf and hard of hearing.&nbsp;For that reason, adding closed captions to your videos is an absolute must, too.</p> \n<p>For instance, take a look at one of <a href=\"https://youtube.com/hubspotacademy\">HubSpot Academy's YouTube</a> video descriptions:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/5%20YouTube%20Description%20Templates%20That%20Have%20Helped%20Our%20Videos%20Go%20Viral.png\" alt=\"Transcript for a YouTube Video Description\">\n</div> \n<p>As you can see, a YouTube description is incredibly different from a web page meta description. In a YouTube description, you have the space to go in-depth and explain what your entire video is about, and even link to external resources.</p> \n<p>Peters told me, \"You get 5,000 characters total, so make use of it. A lot of creators use asterisks or all-caps to differentiate titles from body copy because it's all plain text. Consider writing up a text version of the key points from the video, or even copying the transcription of the video into the description.\"</p> \n<h3>3. Include a CTA.</h3> \n<p>Your YouTube description is a fantastic opportunity to ask viewers to continue to engage with your channel or find additional resources that will help them learn more about a topic of interest.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say you create a brief \"How to add filters to Instagram\" YouTube video, but you also have an in-depth, \"How to Use Instagram for Marketing\" blog post -- why not link to it in the description? More than likely, anyone who is watching your Instagram video on YouTube would be equally grateful for the opportunity to learn more via a blog post.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, perhaps you simply want to ask viewers to subscribe, turn on notifications, or share your content with their networks. These are all acceptable CTA's for your description.</p> \n<p>Additionally, it's critical you format your description to ensure you put the most important information first -- as Peters advises, \"The first 200 characters are above the 'more' fold on the description box, so if you want your CTA/link to be seen by the most people, keep it within the first 200 characters.\"</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/5%20YouTube%20Description%20Templates%20That%20Have%20Helped%20Our%20Videos%20Go%20Viral.jpeg\" alt=\"Collapsed YouTube Video Description With Show More Box Highlighted\">\n</div> \n<p>After the first 200 characters, your text will be cut-off, and viewers will need to click \"Show more\" to see the rest -- so it's vital you make your first 200 characters count.</p> \n<h3>4. Add your personality.</h3> \n<p>A YouTube description should be fun, and demonstrate your brand's personality or unique voice to an audience. Unlike more traditional forms of advertising, this is an opportunity for you to instill creativity and humor into your content.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/backlinko\">Brian Dean's YouTube channel</a> is a great example of this -- his YouTube descriptions often mirror the way he speaks. The descriptions are candid and casual, and he makes it feel like he's writing to a friend.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/5%20YouTube%20Description%20Templates%20That%20Have%20Helped%20Our%20Videos%20Go%20Viral-1.png\" alt=\"Brian Dean YouTube Video Description\">\n</div> \n<p>To learn more about using YouTube for marketing purposes, consider checking out HubSpot Academy's comprehensive <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/youtube-marketing\">YouTube Marketing course</a>.</p> \n<h2>YouTube Description Templates</h2> \n<p>Now that we've covered the basics, take a look at a few templates you can use to craft compelling YouTube descriptions today.</p> \n<h3>Templates for Your Channel Description</h3> \n<p>You might create a playful, easy-going channel 'About Me' description, like this one:</p> \n<div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui\"> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__head\">\n  YouTube Channel Description Example\n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__body\"> \n  <p>Hi, I'm [Name]. This is my channel about X, Y, and Z that you can use to grow your business.</p> \n  <p>If you're a marketer who wants to learn X to get [result, i.e. more traffic to your site], subscribe to my channel.</p> \n  <p>My channel publishes videos that focus on X, Y, and Z. If that sounds like it could be helpful for you, please join me!</p> \n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__foot\">\n  &nbsp;\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Alternatively, you can craft a YouTube description that describes what your company does from a third-person point of view, like this one:</p> \n<div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui\"> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__head\">\n  YouTube Channel Description Example\n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__body\"> \n  <p>Company A is the worldwide leader in X, Y, and Z. Since 2010, Company A has been on a mission to [insert company vision or purpose here].</p> \n  <p>To learn more about A, B, C, subscribe to our channel to stay informed.</p> \n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__foot\">\n  &nbsp;\n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>Templates for Your Video Descriptions</h3> \n<p>If you've conducted an internal interview, you might keep your description short-and-sweet to describe your conversation and why it matters to your audience, as well as a CTA:</p> \n<div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui\"> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__head\">\n  YouTube Video Description Example\n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__body\"> \n  <p>Hear how our CEO explains the difference between X and Y, and learn best practices for implementing your own strategy.</p> \n  <p>Learn more about X and Y in our course: www.XY.com</p> \n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__foot\">\n  &nbsp;\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Alternatively, if you want your description to help new viewers find your various channels, try crafting a description like this one:</p> \n<div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui\"> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__head\">\n  YouTube Video Description Example\n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__body\"> \n  <p>Hi there! New to [name of channel]? If so, here's what you need to know -- I like [interests related to channel] a LOT, so I use this channel to explore X, Y, and Z, to help you [desired result for viewer].</p> \n  <p>Where else you can find me:</p> \n  <p>INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/[accountname]</p> \n  <p>TWITTER: http://twitter.com/[accountname]</p> \n  <p>LIFESTYLE CHANNEL: http://www.youtube.com/[accountname]</p> \n  <p>Join our growing community for new videos every Tuesday and Friday!</p> \n  <p>BUSINESS INQUIRIES</p> \n  <p>Please contact [PR representative] at [email or phone number].</p> \n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__foot\">\n  &nbsp;\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Finally, if you want to focus on crafting a description that explains what your video is about and incorporates a keyword description, try this:</p> \n<div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui\"> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__head\">\n  YouTube Video Description Example\n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__body\"> \n  <p>Hey there! This lesson is part of a free online course. Take the full course here: www.company.com/course1</p> \n  <p>Some people are unsure what X is -- at its most basic, X is [brief definition of keyword]. In this video, you'll learn how to X, Y, and Z, to ensure you're able to grow your brand online.</p> \n  <p>Additionally, we'll explain how you can avoid doing A. Sometimes, A is all it takes to lose a customer.</p> \n </div> \n <div class=\"wt-blog__email-ui__foot\">\n  &nbsp;\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Ultimately, YouTube description templates can help you reduce the amount of time it takes to upload and optimize your YouTube videos, getting them out to your audience quickly and with less effort.

Let's explore how to do that, next.</p> \n<p>It's important to note — in this section, we'll explore how to formally promote your event using Facebook advertising features, which means it costs money to run these promotions. If you're looking for cheaper or free alternatives, skip to the next section in this post, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/promote-event-on-facebook#best-ways-promote-facebook-event\">Best Ways to Promote an Event on Facebook</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, take a look at Facebook's instructions if <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/210413455658361\">you're new to creating a Facebook event</a>. You'll need a Facebook event to continue with these steps.</p> \n<p><strong>1. As soon as you've created your event, Facebook will serve you a pop-up that reads, \"Boost Your Online Event\". Click \"Boost Event\" to promote your event to new audiences.</strong></p> \n<p><img alt=\"Facebook's Boost Your Online Event pop-up\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/how%20to%20promote%20event%20on%20FB.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Alternatively, if you clicked away from the pop-up or created the event a while ago, simply return to your company's page and click the \"Promote\" button displayed there:</strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Promote%20button%20on%20homepage%20to%20promote%20an%20event%20copy.jpg?width=1478&amp;name=Promote%20button%20on%20homepage%20to%20promote%20an%20event%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"The Promote button on your company's homepage, which you need to click to find the boost an event tool\" width=\"1478\" style=\"width: 1478px;\" /></p> \n<p><strong>And then click the box that reads, \"Boost an Event\".</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook%20options%20for%20promoting%20a%20business%20page%20copy.jpg?width=1256&amp;name=Facebook%20options%20for%20promoting%20a%20business%20page%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook's &quot;Boost an Event&quot; button\" width=\"1256\" style=\"width: 1256px;\" /></strong><strong>2. Next, fill in the Ad Creative you want to use when you promote the event, including an event description, image, and Ad Category. Here's where you want to use </strong><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising\">advertising best practices</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;to ensure your copy and image attract new audiences when they come across your event.</strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Ad%20creative%20to%20boost%20an%20Event.png?width=470&amp;name=Ad%20creative%20to%20boost%20an%20Event.png\" alt=\"Ad Creative to boost an Event\" width=\"470\" style=\"width: 470px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><strong>3. Once you've filled out the Ad Creative, you'll want to choose the Audience you want to see your event. Plug in certain key audience factors related to your target audience, or consider using </strong><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-lookalike-audiences\">Facebook's lookalike feature</a></strong><strong> to find similar people to those who already follow, Like, and engage with your content online. &nbsp;</strong></img></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%209.14.38%20AM.png?width=494&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%209.14.38%20AM.png\" alt=\"The Audience section of a form when you're filling out an ad on Facebook\" width=\"494\" style=\"width: 494px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></strong><strong>4. Finally, choose the duration for which you want to promote your event. We'd recommend promoting a few weeks before the event, so your audience has time to schedule it into their calendars and even invite friends or colleagues. Additionally, you'll want to choose your budget here, as well.</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%209.14.44%20AM.png?width=510&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-12%20at%209.14.44%20AM.png\" alt=\"The duration and budget section of an ad when you're filling out the ad form on Facebook\" width=\"510\" style=\"width: 510px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></strong><strong>5. Once you've finalized your ad, click \"Boost Event Now\" to ensure your event is shared with new, interested audiences.</strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Button,%20Boost%20Event%20Now,%20youll%20want%20to%20press%20when%20youre%20ready%20to%20boost%20your%20event.png?width=1444&amp;name=Button,%20Boost%20Event%20Now,%20youll%20want%20to%20press%20when%20youre%20ready%20to%20boost%20your%20event.png\" alt=\"The Boost Event Now button on the Ad form, which you'll want to press when you're ready to boost your event\" width=\"1444\" style=\"width: 1444px;\" /></strong>Of course, these steps can help you promote your event through advertising. But if you're on a strict budget, you might not have the resources to officially promote it.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there are a few alternative best practices to promote your event — which I'd recommend doing even if you've officially boosted your event, as well.</p> \n<p>Let's explore those, now.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Best Ways to Promote an Event on Facebook</h2> \n<h3>1. Change your business' page settings so your Events are listed first when people find your business page.</h3> \n<p>When visitors find your business page, they'll see a few tabs at the top, including \"Home\", \"Group\", \"Photos\", etc.</p> \n<p>To increase traffic to your events page, consider re-organizing these tabs so an \"Event\" tab is listed first on your business page.</p> \n<p>To do this, click the \"More\" dropdown on your company page, and then select \"Edit Tabs\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.37.35%20PM-min.png?width=1784&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.37.35%20PM-min.png\" alt=\"The &quot;Edit Tabs&quot; button on your company Facebook page\" width=\"1784\" style=\"width: 1784px;\" /></p> \n<p>Next, drag the \"Events\" tab to the top, right under \"Home\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.37.56%20PM-min.png?width=465&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.37.56%20PM-min.png\" alt=\"The Settings page where you can rearrange the tabs on your Facebook business page\" width=\"465\" style=\"width: 465px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>This is a small detail, but it could go a long way towards encouraging new page visitors to click and view upcoming events. &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. Share and pin your event to the top of your business page.</h3> \n<p>Even though you have a different page for your event invite, there's no reason you shouldn't be broadcasting the event on your business' official Facebook page, as well.</p> \n<p>To do this, share a post highlighting details about your event — including where people can sign up, when it is, and what content you'll cover. Then, right-click the three dots at the top right-hand corner of your Facebook post, and select \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pin to Top of Page</span>\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.47.03%20PM-min.png?width=814&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.47.03%20PM-min.png\" alt=\"The Pin to Top of Page button you'll need to press to keep an event at the top of your Facebook page\" width=\"814\" style=\"width: 814px;\" /></p> \n<p>This is another easy opportunity to promote your event. When both new and existing audiences come across your business page they'll see, front and center, a pinned post about your upcoming event.</p> \n<h3>3. Post a status highlighting the event from your business page.</h3> \n<p>A few days before the event, reach out to your page followers with a quick reminder status. Use images, emojis, and other fun, interactive elements to remind your audience about the upcoming event and increase excitement for it.</p> \n<p>If you can, publishing a short, promotional video could help raise awareness and excitement, as well. For instance, take a look at how <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/contentmarketingvirtualsummit\">Content Marketing Virtual Summit</a> published a short video from one of its webinar speakers, Ellie Hernaman, to remind followers of the upcoming event:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.52.38%20PM-min.png?width=465&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.52.38%20PM-min.png\" alt=\"Content Marketing Virtual Summit's Facebook video highlighting Ellie, a speaker for their Content Marketing Virtual Summit\" width=\"465\" style=\"width: 465px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<h3>4. Optimize your event page for wider reach.</h3> \n<p>If you're going through the trouble of promoting an event page, you'll want to make sure the event page itself is ready to attract and delight new viewers.</p> \n<p>A few small details can go a long way, here. For instance, consider using a unique, original image as your cover photo, as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thehoneypotcompany/events/?ref=page_internal\">The Honey Pot Company did with its Essence Wellness House Atlanta event</a>:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.57.47%20PM-min.png?width=950&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.57.47%20PM-min.png\" alt=\"A Overall Wellness cover photo showcasing the speakers at The Honey Pot Company's Atlanta event\" width=\"950\" style=\"width: 950px;\" /></p> \n<p>Additionally, use relevant tags related to your event — such as \"startup\" and \"technology\" — to ensure the event gets shared and viewed by the right channels.</p> \n<h3>5. Share your event to relevant Facebook groups.</h3> \n<p>If you've created a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-facebook-group\">Facebook group</a> for your business, this could be a good opportunity to broadcast your event to audiences who've already proven an interest in your brand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Additionally, if you're a member of a Facebook group made up of people you believe would <em>truly</em> find an interest in your event, go ahead and share your event there as a member post.</p> \n<p>However, a word of caution: This can easily feel promotional and can backfire, particularly if members feel you're only sharing content related to your own business.</p> \n<p>Instead, you'll want to ensure it's authentic and helpful to the topic at-hand. For instance, if you're part of a Tech Startup Facebook group and your company is hosting a webinar, \"8 Impressive New Tech Startups to Watch\", then by all means — go ahead and post with a quick, \"Hey fellow members, feel free to join this webinar on Tuesday.\"</p> \n<p>Just be careful not to overdo it, particularly if it doesn't feel relevant to the other topics being discussed.</p> \n<h3>6. Copy the link and paste it into an email newsletter, or alternative channels to broadcast it to existing leads.</h3> \n<p>On your event page, you'll see a \"Share\" option (the arrow pointing to the right) — when you click on it, Facebook gives you an option to copy-and-paste a specific URL link, or share to a Page or group:&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.44.23%20PM-min-1.png?width=1432&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.44.23%20PM-min-1.png\" alt=\"The Share button on your Cupcake Decorating Content where you can copy a link to share with others off Facebook\" width=\"1432\" style=\"width: 1432px;\">If you feel many of your prospects and customers engage with your brand outside of Facebook, it could be a good idea to copy-and-paste the URL into other channels and share with engaged followers on other social platforms.</img></p> \n<p>Additionally, you might consider opening your event for \"pre-access\" to an exclusive email subscriber list — like those who've purchased your product or service, or your Blog subscribers — on a \"first come, first serve\" basis. Here's an example of how that might look in practice:&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.46.07%20PM-min.png?width=1034&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-11%20at%2012.46.07%20PM-min.png\" alt=\"An email to Caroline's cupcake customers, broadcasting an upcoming cupcake decorating content with a link to the Facebook event\" width=\"1034\" style=\"width: 1034px;\" /></p> \n<p>Ultimately, it's a good idea to paste the URL into other content channels to expand your reach. For instance, if you have a dedicated Instagram following, you might paste the URL into your Instagram bio.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>7. Ask other businesses or influencers to co-host or sponsor your event so they can share your event with their audiences.</h3> \n<p>One sure-fire opportunity to reach new audiences is by asking another business or influencer in the industry to co-host or sponsor your event.</p> \n<p>This can help you increase the amount of people who hear about your event, and it can also make the event itself more valuable by including unique, original thought leadership content.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.mandmribs.com/\">M&amp;M BBQ</a>, a Boston-based barbecue restaurant, partnered with <a href=\"https://www.dorchesterbrewing.com/\">Dorchester Brewing Company</a> to host events like Sunday brunch and combine its barbecue with Dorchester Brewing Company's popular beer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Recently, Dorchester Brewing Company posted about the event with a link directly to M&amp;M BBQ:&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dorchester%20brewing%20company%20.png?width=447&amp;name=dorchester%20brewing%20company%20.png\" alt=\"Dorchester Brewing Company's event post, highlight M&amp;M BBQ and inviting people to come eat barbecue and taste beers during Sunday brunch in Boston\" width=\"447\" style=\"width: 447px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>This serves two purposes: First, any Facebook followers or customers of DBC might take an interest in M&amp;M BBQ as a result of the Facebook post (or an in-person experience of testing out the barbecue).</p> \n<p>And, second, Dorchester Brewing Company has increased value of its own event by providing its loyal customers with the option to eat delicious barbecue as they test out beers. A win, win.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ultimately, you'll need to figure out which promotional methods work best for your brand, your event, and your audience. Fortunately, the sky's the limit when it comes to promoting an event on Facebook — both on, and off the social network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\"

an online community</a> that allows your audience to connect in a place where they know their interests are shared. This sense of connectedness is more important than ever in a time where more work, communication, and socialization is being done online.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>Online communities are particularly beneficial for businesses because they allow customers to interact with each other in a smaller circle than they could via social media, which increases engagement and brand affinity.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say one of your customers has a very unique problem with your product or service, and posts about it on your forum. That post is much easier to find than it would be on social media, where millions of users are talking about a million different things.</p> \n<p>Even better, maybe another forum user has faced that same problem and can answer their question before your service reps even see it.</p> \n<p>There is an incredible amount of value in reaching and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/how-to-create-a-forum-website\">building your community using a forum</a>.

How? Through the power of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30490/the-qualities-of-a-powerful-word-of-mouth-marketing-strategy.aspx?_ga=2.81138783.993379860.1558305817-1451183703.1557949920\">word-of-mouth marketing</a>. Customers who view themselves as valued members of your community are much more likely to talk about your brand to their friends.</p> \n<p>Here's how you can build a strong community using your forum software.</p> \n<h3>1. Spread the word.</h3> \n<p>Nobody will join your online community if they don't know it exists. Spread the word about your new forum by including CTAs to join your forum in email newsletters or social posts. Ask your brand ambassadors or loyal fans to start posting about the forum, and post content on the forum so when other users join, you already have an established presence on the channel.</p> \n<h3>2. Listen to and check on your community regularly.</h3> \n<p>Reviewing your forum and responding to what your audience has to say is a crucial part of community building. Your customers are far less likely to continue to interact and engage on your forum if they feel as though they are being ignored. Responding to their feedback shows your users that you value their opinions and care about their experiences with your product.</p> \n<p>Additionally, it's your job to make sure everything is running smoothly on your forum.

But if you're not measuring that information against something else, how will you know when you've met the mark or fallen short?</p> \n<p>As they say, what gets measured gets improved. Quantifying your current performance through key performance indicators (KPIs) will give you a framework from which to assess your progress.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png\"></a></p> \n<p>But how do you choose the right KPIs to focus on for your business? The short answer is that it really depends.</p> \n<p>While there isn't a hard-and-fast rule for choosing the proper KPIs, there are a number of factors you should always take into consideration.</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll walk you through some of the factors that influence which KPIs you should focus on and help you hone in on the metrics that matter the most for your business.</p> \n<p>Let's get started.</p> \n<p>One thing to remember about KPIs is that they're meant to measure your most impactful indicators.</p> \n<p>For instance, your social media team may have a ton of data points that can serve as KPIs. However, they should only choose the ones that align with the broader business goals. Let's say it's brand awareness. In this case, follower count, post reach, and impressions will likely be the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-metrics-ceos-cares-about\">social media KPI metrics </a>to measure.</p> \n<p>With that in mind, having KPIs means narrowing your focus on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/marketing-metrics-to-know\">a few vital metrics </a>that will influence your business the most.</p> \n<h2>OKR vs. KPI</h2> \n<p>Objectives and Key Results (OKR) and KPIs are often used interchangeably because both terms refer to goals that are tracked and measured. However, where they differ is intention.</p> \n<p>Put simply, KPIs indicate if your business is hitting its targets. They are often called health metrics as they tell you how the company is doing to meet an objective that's already set.</p> \n<p>OKRs, on the other hand, are broad objectives for your business with the key results that will signify achievement in meeting those objectives. They are aggressive and ambitious goals that speak to the business's big-picture vision.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say a technology company has the objective of becoming one of the top 10 providers in their industry in 2021. Their key results could be:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Acquire 1,000 new customers by Q3.</li> \n <li>Generate 3,000 leads every month.</li> \n <li>Increase annual membership sales by 30%.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While KPIs are ideal for scaling, OKRs are designed for dramatic growth. They're more ambitious and push teams to stretch their capabilities.</p> \n<p>It's also important to note that while KPIs can be the key results in your OKR, the opposite is generally not true.</p> \n<p>For example, your marketing team could have a KPI of 3,000 leads as mentioned in the example above. However, it's unlikely that any department would list the \"Top 10\" goal as their KPI as that speaks to a broader vision and has a more flexible timeline.</p> \n<h2>What is KPI reporting?</h2> \n<p>A KPI report is a visual dashboard used to track your metrics and assess how your team is performing against the targets. You can display your report using charts, graphics, and tables depending on the data you want to display and the needs of your team.</p> \n<p>As a business, you'll likely have data coming in on a daily basis that may or may not relate to your KPIs. Having a reporting tool does a few things, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Allowing you to track your most impactful metrics and filter out irrelevant data</li> \n <li>Making the data easily accessible to decision-makers and collaborators</li> \n <li>Giving you a quick and digestible snapshot of your team's performance</li> \n <li>Aligning everyone on the goals</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>How To Measure KPIs</h3> \n<p>Before you can measure your KPIs, you'll need to determine which metrics to track. This will greatly depend on your goals and your team.</p> \n<p>Once you narrow that down, set your targets. They're usually based on a combination of factors, including historical performance and industry standards.</p> \n<p>You'll also have to answer the who, when, and why. Who is responsible for this KPI? Identify the person on your team who is managing this KPI, so they can be the go-to when addressing roadblocks that may affect performance. They will also be responsible for reporting on progress.</p> \n<p>As for the \"when,\" you'll need to know the timeline to reach these targets. Many businesses set them on a monthly or quarterly basis, but your timeline can be shorter or longer depending on your team.</p> \n<p>Lastly: the why. It's the most important thing to keep in mind when measuring your KPIs. Having your goals clearly identified can help motivate your team and make sure everyone is aligned on the direction you're going in.</p> \n<h2>Types of Key Performance Indicators</h2> \n<p>KPIs can be set on a team basis. Sales' KPIs will be completely different from HR's KPIs. Beyond those differences, there are also variations in the types of indicators you can measure.</p> \n<p>Here are a few of the most common types of KPIs:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>A quantitative KPI </strong>relies on numbers to gauge progress. E.g., \"Sales team to generate 100 sales-qualified leads every month.\"</li> \n <li><strong>A qualitative </strong><strong>KPI </strong>looks at opinion- or feeling-based data. E.g., \"Brand sentiment.\"</li> \n <li><strong>A leading KPI </strong>can predict future performance. E.g., \"Website traffic.\" More traffic can mean more conversions, more leads, and more revenue.</li> \n <li><strong>A lagging KPI </strong>describes a past result. E.g., \"Turnover rate.\"</li> \n <li><strong>An input KPI </strong>measures the assets, time, and resources needed to complete a certain action or project. E.g., \"Employee count, budget.\"</li> \n <li><strong>A process </strong><strong>KPI </strong>assesses efficiency and productivity within the business. E.g., \"Average sales call time.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>KPI Examples</h2> \n<p>Your organization's business model and the industry in which you operate will influence the KPIs you choose.</p> \n<p>For example, a B2B software-as-a-service (SaaS) company might choose to focus on customer acquisition and churn, whereas a brick-and-mortar retail company might focus on sales per square foot or average customer spend.</p> \n<p>Here are a few examples of some industry-standard KPIs:</p> \n<table style=\"border-color: #99acc2; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>SaaS KPIs</strong></p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Professional Service KPIs</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)</li> \n     <li>Churn</li> \n     <li>Cost per acquisition (CPA)</li> \n     <li>Average revenue per retainer</li> \n     <li>Lifetime value (LTV)</li> \n    </ul> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Bookings</li> \n     <li>Utilization</li> \n     <li>Backlog</li> \n     <li>Revenue leakage (<a href=\"http://www.exact.com/downloads/finish/65-whitepapers/276-kpis-for-professional-services/0\">link</a>)</li> \n     <li>Effective billable rate</li> \n    </ul> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Online Media / Publishing KPIs</strong></p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Retail KPIs</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Unique visitors</li> \n     <li>Page views</li> \n     <li>Share ratio</li> \n     <li>Social referral growth</li> \n     <li>Time on site</li> \n    </ul> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Capital expenditure</li> \n     <li>Customer satisfaction</li> \n     <li>Sales per square foot</li> \n     <li>Average customer spend (ACS)</li> \n     <li>Stock turnover</li> \n    </ul> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>While you will most certainly want to consider industry standard KPIs, it is more important that you choose the KPIs that are relevant to your specific company and the goals you are working toward.</p> \n<h2>How To Determine KPIs</h2> \n<h4><strong>Choose KPIs directly related to your business goals.</strong></h4> \n<p>KPIs are quantifiable measurements or data points used to gauge your company's performance relative to a goal. For instance, a KPI could be related to your goal of increasing sales, improving the return on investment of your marketing efforts, or improving customer service.</p> \n<p>What are your company goals? Have you identified any major areas for improvement or optimization? What are the biggest priorities for your management team?</p> \n<p>Answering these questions will bring you one step closer to identifying the right KPIs for your brand.</p> \n<h4><strong>Focus on a few key metrics, rather than a slew of data.</strong></h4> \n<p>As you begin to identify KPIs for your business, less is worth more. Rather than choosing dozens of metrics to measure and report on you should focus on just a few <em>key </em>ones.</p> \n<p>If you track too many KPIs, you might become overwhelmed with the data and lose focus.</p> \n<p>As you can imagine, every company, industry, and business model is different so it is difficult to pinpoint an exact number for the amount of KPIs you should have. However, a good number to aim for is somewhere between two to four KPIs per goal.Enough to get a good sense of where you stand but not too many where there's no priority.</p> \n<h4><strong>Consider your company's stage of growth.</strong></h4> \n<p>Depending on the stage of your company – startup vs. enterprise – certain metrics will be more important than others.</p> \n<p>Early-stage companies typically focus on data related to business model validation while more established organizations focus on metrics like cost per acquisition and customer lifetime value.</p> \n<p>Here are a few examples of potential key performance indicators for companies in various stages of growth:</p> \n<table style=\"border-color: #99acc2; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Pre-Product Market Fit</strong></p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Product Market Fit</strong></p> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Expansion</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Qualitative feedback</li> \n     <li>Customer interviews</li> \n     <li>Awareness</li> \n     <li>Stickiness</li> \n    </ul> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)</li> \n     <li>Renewals</li> \n     <li>Churn</li> \n     <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/customer-satisfaction\">Customer satisfaction</a></li> \n    </ul> </td> \n   <td style=\"border: 1pt solid #808080;\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Cost per acquisition (CPA)</li> \n     <li>Average order size (AOS)</li> \n     <li>Lifetime value (LTV)</li> \n     <li>Number of customers acquired</li> \n    </ul> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<h4><strong>Identify both lagging and leading performance indicators.</strong></h4> \n<p>The difference between lagging and leading indicators is essentially knowing how you did, versus how you are doing. Leading indicators aren't necessarily better than lagging indicators, or vice versa. You should just be aware of the differences between the two.</p> \n<p>Lagging indicators measure the output of something that has already happened. Total sales last month, or the number of new customers or hours of professional services delivered, are examples of lagging indicators. These types of metrics are good for purely measuring results, as they solely focus on outputs.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, leading indicators measure your likelihood of achieving a goal in the future. These serve as predictors of what's to come. Conversion rates, sales opportunity age, and sales rep activity are just a few examples of leading indicators.</p> \n<p>Traditionally most organizations have solely focused on lagging indicators. One of the main reasons for this is they tend to be easy to measure since the events have already happened. For instance, it is very easy to pull a report of the number of customers acquired last quarter.</p> \n<p>But measuring what happened in the past can only be so helpful.</p> \n<p>You can think of leading indicators as business drivers because they come before trends emerge, which can help you identify whether or not you are on track to reaching your goals. If you can identify which leading indicators will impact your future performance you will have a much better shot at success.</p> \n<p>With every business, growth is the goal. KPIs help you track your progress and scale progressively to grow in whichever way that matters to your company.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fchoosing-kpis&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png","linkMd5":"01aa565f6936083b917704853f97bec2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-681_5a38291bbbb54ba3.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5125,"destBytes":6842,"author":"jesse@kulapartners.com (Jesse Mawhinney)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-681_5a38291bbbb54ba3.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-54-880_b69ef96b2d492171.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fchoosing-kpis&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn92@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-54-547_164bcdc1ed74ea71.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370074},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"10 Common Virtual Meeting Mistakes to Avoid, According to Remote HubSpot Employees","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/virtual-meeting-mistakes","description":"<p>Whether it’s with a single client, a large internal team, or external stakeholders, hosting successful, engaging meetings is an art form.</p>  \n<p>It takes skill to know how to simultaneously capture attention, inform, be interactive, and leave a lasting impression — it’s really not an easy feat.</p> \n<p>The prospect of holding a meeting may become even more stressful when the session is online. As meetings are new to the virtual world, there is no roadmap to hosting a successful one.</p> \n<p>However, as nice as it would be, a roadmap is not always the key to success. Sometimes the key can be learning from people who have experience hosting virtual meetings and understanding what they think makes them successful.

Not acknowledging mistakes.</h3> \n<p>Nobody’s perfect.</p> \n<p>Although many people know that, an all-too-common moment in virtual meetings is pushing mistakes under the rug and acting like they haven’t happened. Unfortunately, when everyone is looking at their screen, most people notice mistakes, and ignoring them can create a sense of awkwardness.</p> \n<p>In these moments, it’s important to remember that an increasingly virtual world is new to everyone. We’re all aware that adapting to new processes can be difficult, so of course, there will be unexpected issues.</p> \n<p>Jon Dick, Senior Vice President of Marketing at HubSpot, agrees, and his advice is relatively straightforward: “As the old saying goes, ‘If you can’t hide it, feature it!’ Slides not sharing? Children bursting into the room? Not on mute? Don’t stress out — just laugh, relax, and acknowledge it.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/virtual.png?width=1012&amp;name=virtual.png\" alt=\"quote snippet &quot;As the old saying goes, 'if you can't hide it, feature it!' slides not sharing? children bursting into the room? not on mute? don't stress out — just laugh, relax, and acknowledge it.&quot;\" width=\"1012\" style=\"width: 1012px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>2. No backup plan for faulty technology.</h3> \n<p>A dysfunctional microphone or PowerPoint won’t derail your in-person meeting, but it will effectively shut down a virtual one. Given this, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-ladd/\">Ashley Ladd</a>, Manager on the Diversity, Inclusion, &amp; Belonging team at HubSpot, says that not having a tech backup plan for your virtual meeting is a mistake.</p> \n<p>Ladd says, “Our internet connection is always stable until we need it to be, so having a backup plan ensures flawless execution of your events and less worrying about your connection or having the meeting dropped.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ladd.png?width=1012&amp;name=ladd.png\" alt=\"quote snippet &quot;our internet connection is always stable until we need it to be, so having a backup plan ensures flawless execution.&quot;\" width=\"1012\" style=\"width: 1012px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>She says that your plan B can include things like a designated co-host, teammate, or friend to take over if something goes wrong, or while you troubleshoot any issues: “The worst is when you have to spend time fussing with your connection and it interrupts the flow of your meeting.”</p> \n<h3>3. A lack of discussion and collaboration.</h3> \n<p>One of the greatest aspects of meetings is the collaboration and discussion that stems from audience engagement. Virtual meetings notably make this harder, and they’re often marked by the opposite.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/becca-stamp/\">Becca Stamp</a>, Senior Global Learning and Development Onboarding Specialist at HubSpot, says that a common mistake is not making space for conversation. Her solution is to make a special effort to encourage it: “It’s important to give everyone space to come off mute and contribute throughout the session. Participants can add so much value, both through discussion and chat.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20-%20506x253%20(1).png?width=1012&amp;name=Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20-%20506x253%20(1).png\" alt=\"quote snippet &quot;it's important to give everyone space to come off mute...participants can add so much value, both through discussion and chat.&quot;\" width=\"1012\" style=\"width: 1012px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jill-noonan-6a82926a/\">Jill Noonan</a>, Senior Facilitator at HubSpot, seconds this tip and says: “Create interaction whenever possible. Whether in person or virtual, listening to one person present without any interaction or conversation can be draining for those listening. If you’re presenting in a virtual environment and someone asks a question, open it up for group discussion.”</p> \n<h3>4. Leaving inclusion and accessibility by the wayside.</h3> \n<p>Whether your meeting is in-person or virtual, it’s crucial to be mindful of and prioritize inclusion and accessibility.</p> \n<p>Opt to use <a href=\"https://otter.ai/login\">software that adds captions</a> for speech transcription, write alternative descriptive text of images for screen reading devices, and be mindful of the differing experiences that attendees may have.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminrpereira/\">Ben Pereira</a>, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Program Manager at HubSpot, says that an easy way to show you care about DI&amp;B is to encourage attendees to put pronouns in their profile names. He says, “Add pronouns to your Zoom name as a way of showing up for inclusion during virtual meetings, and encourage your teammates to do so as well.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20-%20506x253%20(1)-1.png?width=594&amp;name=Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20-%20506x253%20(1)-1.png\" alt=\"quote snippet that reads &quot;Add pronouns to your zoom name as a way of showing up for inclusion during virtual meetings, and encourage your teammates to do so as well.&quot;\" width=\"594\" style=\"width: 594px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>5. Trying to multitask.</h3> \n<p>It’s never been easier to join a meeting, and it’s also never been easier to lose focus during a meeting.</p> \n<p>If you’re using a personal computer, it can be especially difficult to stay focused because everything you enjoy is right there in front of you. A quick check of your email can accidentally turn into ten minutes of distractions that take you away from meeting content.</p> \n<p>That’s why a common mistake is, or at least trying, to multitask during meetings. Dick says: “Multitasking during your meetings is a sure-fire way to feel uninformed and unaccomplished at the end of the day.” His solution? Easy — “Mute notifications and close email.”</p> \n<h3>6. Not encouraging speakers and hosts.</h3> \n<p>Don’t assume that someone may be more comfortable during a virtual meeting because they’re not in front of an in-person audience. It can still be just as nerve-wracking to face a screen full of faces as it is to stare at a room full of people.</p> \n<p>However, the support that people receive from attendees during in-person meetings, like applause, can be encouraging and make hosts feel more comfortable. Unfortunately, this support is often missing from virtual meetings.</p> \n<p>Even if you can’t clap, Dick says that it’s still essential to show encouragement virtually, as it can feel strange to present without any human reactions. He says, “Hop in the chat window to cheer people on and encourage them when they’re presenting. It’s encouraging and helps people feel like you’re listening.”</p> \n<h3>7. Leaving no space for networking.</h3> \n<p>As virtual meetings occur on a digital device, attendees have no further interaction with their peers when they end. Stamp says that forgetting about the hallway chat aspect of meetings can be detrimental, as this time often gives people a chance to network, make connections, and decompress.</p> \n<p>She says, about HubSpot employee onboarding, “We have seen incredible value in spending five to ten extra minutes on Zoom at the end of each session. It creates the hallway environment of in-person sessions, and these conversations help us build more community among the cohorts.”</p> \n<h3>8. Being impersonal.</h3> \n<p>You may feel pressure to display a more polished side of yourself during virtual meetings. In some cases, like when business executives speak to their teams, it makes sense and is expected that the experience is more corporate and clean cut.</p> \n<p>However, being too polished can sometimes dehumanize you, which affects relatability between you and your audience.</p> \n<p>Robotic meeting environments can also feel boring and disengaging, which is the opposite of what you want. Noonan’s tip is to display humanity through personalization. She says, “Humanity is extremely important. Knowing when and where to use personal examples or display vulnerability builds trust and shows that we’re all on the same page.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20jill-%20506x253%20(1).png?width=1012&amp;name=Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20jill-%20506x253%20(1).png\" alt=\"quote snippet that reads &quot;knowing when and where to use personal examples or display vulnerability builds trust and shows that we're all on the same page.&quot;\" width=\"1012\" style=\"width: 1012px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>9. Not using the mute button for all it’s worth.</h3> \n<p>Nobody wants to accidentally leave their microphone on so everyone can hear them yell to a roommate or ask a pet to stop making noise. It’s not a huge faux pas, but there are easy ways to avoid this short-lived but all-too-common mistake of not using the mute button for all that it’s worth.</p> \n<p>Pereira says, “When you’re not talking, mute yourself. The mute/unmute can also serve as a signal to indicate you’re ready to contribute and serve a [sic] helpful way for group members to ensure that those who are looking to speak are given the opportunity to be heard.”</p> \n<h3>10. Not having fun.</h3> \n<p>Although hosting can be stressful, Ladd and Stamp say that it’s essential to have fun.</p> \n<p>Ladd recalls a BLACKhub community check-in where attendees played a game called This or That. She says, “We did a Black History Month edition, so our game featured Black leaders in sports, film, entrepreneurship, and more. We had about eight different slides, and it was a fun, quick, and easy way to get everyone interacting and participating.”</p> \n<p>Stamp makes space for these moments during onboarding meetings as well: “Schedule optional coffee, lunch, or afternoon hang-outs to help attendees connect. This gives our new hires a space to get to know each other in an authentic and more personal way.”</p> \n<h2>Virtual Meetings Can Still Be Successful, Engaging, and Fulfilling</h2> \n<p>Although there are quite a few mistakes on this list, they are exactly that — mistakes. They aren’t the end of the world, and nobody will penalize you for them.</p> \n<p>Consider the advice from experienced HubSpotters, and you’ll likely find yourself hosting engaging virtual meetings that are just as impactful as those you can have in-person.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=57b789cd-3ca2-4d6b-b792-77e5b1163125&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Take me to Projects\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/57b789cd-3ca2-4d6b-b792-77e5b1163125.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvirtual-meeting-mistakes&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/52250291-8fed-4fe7-ad28-e6e244e1fcd8.png","linkMd5":"15eb090c1dbd18629878aee2b9dfb524","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-665_e57995fecd8b2257.webp","destWidth":395,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4668,"destBytes":6412,"author":"fneedle@hubspot.com (Flori Needle)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/52250291-8fed-4fe7-ad28-e6e244e1fcd8.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-30-665_e57995fecd8b2257.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/virtual.png?width=1012&name=virtual.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn93@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-50-02-360_c30e353c8d77abfb.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ladd.png?width=1012&name=ladd.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn66@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-50-01-399_bd065c8736601d25.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20-%20506x253%20(1).png?width=1012&name=Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20-%20506x253%20(1).png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn82@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-55-434_ba434454c141eed8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20-%20506x253%20(1)-1.png?width=594&name=Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20-%20506x253%20(1)-1.png":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20jill-%20506x253%20(1).png?width=1012&name=Twitter%20-%20Quotes%20jill-%20506x253%20(1).png":null,"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/57b789cd-3ca2-4d6b-b792-77e5b1163125.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn50@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-55-113_9524aa96f1bc7dcb.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvirtual-meeting-mistakes&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn37@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-52-478_09428e9a4d6b8647.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370029},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"The Beginner’s Guide to Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cost-per-acquisition","description":"<p>In the paid acquisition world, clicks can seem like the holy grail. But if you really think about it, clicks only tell you if people arrive to your content. They don’t reveal whether <a href=\"https://www.marketingshowrunners.com/blog/new-marketing-mandate-hold-attention/\">they stayed or not</a>.</p>  \n<p>But how do you know if your content is engaging and emotionally resonant enough to persuade your audience to stay and ultimately buy your product or service? A metric that’s arguably the most indicative of this is conversions -- if your creative convinced someone to download or even buy something, then it was worth consuming.</p> \n<p>In your advertising campaigns, the best way to measure your content's converting capabilities&nbsp;and, in turn, its resonance is cost per acquisition. Read on to learn more about what exactly it is, the formula for calculating it, how its bidding process works, and some principles for crafting creative and convincing ad copy.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=fd1d8911-635d-4be6-8755-5ab6a332b129&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download&nbsp;Now: Free&nbsp;Marketing Reporting Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/fd1d8911-635d-4be6-8755-5ab6a332b129.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Most acquisition marketers prefer the cost per acquisition pricing model because they can set their definition of an acquisition before they start advertising and only have to pay when their desired acquisition or action happens.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>AdRank is calculated by multiplying your maximum cost per acquisition bid with the quality score of your ad, which is calculated by measuring your page’s relevance to the keyword, user experience, and click-through-rate. This means organizations can’t acquire the top ranking for any keyword they want just because they have the biggest ad budgets. Their content has to be engaging.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-adrank-calculation.jpeg?width=1000&amp;name=google-adrank-calculation.jpeg\" alt=\"Google AdRank calculation\" width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/articles/what-is-google-adwords\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>Google wants to incentivize the best advertisers to advertise the best content on their search engine results pages, so they reward ads that have high quality scores with higher ad rankings and lower cost per acquisition.</p> \n<p>In the same vein, they also want to discourage bad advertisers from advertising bad content, so advertisers with low quality scores will usually only acquire a high ad position if they pay a huge cost per acquisition bid. If they want to pay lower a cost per acquisition bid, they’ll have to settle with stooping at the bottom of the ad rankings.</p> \n<p>To generate as many conversions as possible within the limits of your advertising budget, consider using <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6268632?hl=en\">Google’s target CPA bidding</a>. Target CPA bidding leverages machine learning to analyze your campaign’s historical conversion data, recommend an optimal average target CPA, and automatically optimize all your eligible bids to meet the average target CPA you set for all your campaigns.</p> \n<p>If you use target CPA bidding, some of your conversions may cost more than others because your quality score or the competition in your ad auction might fluctuate, but Google will try its hardest to keep your cost per acquisition as close to your average target CPA as possible.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How to Optimize Your Cost Per Acquisition Costs</h2> \n<p>Since your quality score, which is a metric that measures how positive and relevant of an experience your content provides, is the most influential determinant in securing a top ad ranking and, in turn, generating more conversions, the best way to optimize your cost per acquisition costs is crafting compelling ad and landing page copy.</p> \n<p>When you sit down to write ad or landing page copy, your goal should be to write something so captivating that it can grab the attention of a distracted millennial slouched in front of the TV, with their smartphone in one hand and a slice of pizza in the other.</p> \n<p>So what’s the process for persuading your audience to ignore that pizza, click on your ad, and convert on your landing page? Check out this three-step process for crafting compelling ad and landing page copy.</p> \n<h3>1. Pique your audience’s curiosity</h3> \n<p>A little intrigue goes a long way in marketing. Humans are <a href=\"https://www.verygoodcopy.com/hubspotcom/6-brain-triggers-copywriters-use-to-drive-sales\">biologically driven to investigate our world rather than respond to it</a>. And if you can evoke enough curiosity in your audience so they can’t help but satisfy it, they’ll click on your ad. So don’t reveal too much about your offer -- but make sure to highlight its benefits in a clear and convincing way.</p> \n<h3>2. Sell a feeling</h3> \n<p>Psychology tells us that <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/when-to-sell-with-facts-and-figures-and-when-to-appeal-to-emotions\">emotions drive our behavior, while logic justifies our actions after the fact</a>. Marketing confirms this theory -- humans associate the <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/inside-the-consumer-mind/201302/how-emotions-influence-what-we-buy\">same personality traits with brands as they do with people</a>. Choosing between two alternatives is like choosing your best friend or significant other. The people we decide to live our lives with make us feel something.</p> \n<p>This is also the reason why pitching a product’s features is a lousy attempt at persuasion. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-compelling-copy-tips?_ga=2.168469350.658143849.1557313293-876255941.1530763234\">Features only appeal to the logical part of your brain</a>, which science suggests doesn’t drive action nearly as well as appealing to the emotional part of your brain does. So don’t just get creative with your copy -- get emotional too.</p> \n<h3>3. Design a simple yet convincing landing page.</h3> \n<p>Just because you’ve grabbed someone’s attention with your ad doesn’t mean your work is done. You still need to design a compelling landing page that clearly conveys the value of our offer.</p> \n<p>In order to do this, consider piquing your audience’s curiosity with an intriguing headline and subheading, scrapping any external links from your landing page so visitors can only leave your paid acquisition funnel if they exit the page or convert, and test out video, which can explain the value of your offer in a more engaging way than text can.</p> \n<p>If you want to learn how HubSpot creates <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-templates?_ga=2.168469350.658143849.1557313293-876255941.1530763234\">landing pages that convert at 35% rate</a>, check out this blog post.</p> \n<h3>Instead of chasing clicks, pursue conversions.</h3> \n<p>Marketers will chase vanity metrics until the end of time, and you might feel pressured to do the same, especially when your peers clamor on about their astronomical growth in views or clicks.</p> \n<p>But if you ever feel tempted to jump on that train, remember, in marketing, the goal is to persuade someone to take your desired action. So incentivize your brand to resonate with your audience -- that’s the thing that actually keeps people on your content and prompts them to act. And make conversions, not clicks, your carrot.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3cb695d9-7dc5-4e70-8523-1e330e6bd58a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\" marketing reporting templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3cb695d9-7dc5-4e70-8523-1e330e6bd58a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcost-per-acquisition&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/fd1d8911-635d-4be6-8755-5ab6a332b129.png","linkMd5":"19d345608cd9c75afa7c5398ff8baa75","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-30-595_e209ac0ef6ff3e34.webp","destWidth":476,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4464,"destBytes":7216,"author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/fd1d8911-635d-4be6-8755-5ab6a332b129.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-30-595_e209ac0ef6ff3e34.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/google-adrank-calculation.jpeg?width=1000&name=google-adrank-calculation.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn48@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-53-882_8528b0c79af54327.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3cb695d9-7dc5-4e70-8523-1e330e6bd58a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn18@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-59-525_d6970030134c53c8.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcost-per-acquisition&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn88@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-59-402_dd4bccb141b6148d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425370044},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:30","title":"What is Clubhouse?

And, how do I get in on the action?”</p> \n<p>Below, we’ll explain where Clubhouse came from, what it actually is, and the pros and cons of using it in your marketing strategy.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3dc1dfd9-2cb4-4498-8c57-19dbb5671820&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Download Now: Social Media Trends in 2021 [Free Report]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3dc1dfd9-2cb4-4498-8c57-19dbb5671820.png\"></a></p> \n<p>Clubhouse was launched in March 2020 by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pdavison?lang=en\">Paul Davison</a>, who previously worked at companies including Pinterest and Google, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohanseth/\">Rohan Seth</a>, a former Google engineer. According to a <a href=\"https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices\">post</a>&nbsp;from Davison and Seth, Clubhouse was created after a handful of social media app experiments.</p> \n<p>\"After a lot of iteration in the audio space, we launched Clubhouse in March of last year,\" the <a href=\"https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices\">co-founders wrote</a>. \"Our goal was to build a social experience that felt more human—where instead of posting, you could gather with other people and talk. Our north star was to create something where you could close the app at the end of the session feeling better than you did when you opened it, because you had deepened friendships, met new people, and learned.\"</p> \n<p>Initially, Clubhouse was marketed to top-tier influencers, celebrities, Silicon Valley investors, and industry thought leaders, but recently opened to more general audiences. A few of the app's first <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-clubhouse#:~:text=Drake%20and%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20have%20joined&amp;text=Expect%20to%20hear%20from%20superstars,Ashton%20Kutcher%20and%20Chris%20Rock.\">high-profile users</a>&nbsp;include <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)\">Drake</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thesharkdaymond/status/1352281894663163905\">Daymond John</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L8mI0i4XSA\">Elon Musk</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001856/\">Oprah Winfrey</a>. Early on, these notable users were heard chatting in Rooms related to their interests, hobbies, causes, or industries.</p> \n<p>Despite Clubhouse's exclusivity, it was valued at <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clubhouse-voice/company_financials\">$100 million</a>&nbsp;and received a $12 million investment from <a href=\"https://a16z.com/portfolio/\">Andreessen Horowitz</a>&nbsp;within a year of its launch.</p> \n<p>Most recently, Clubhouse has begun to give access to a larger pool of users by allowing each new member to invite two friends of their own. This has caused the user base to jump from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/style/clubhouse-app-influencers.html#:~:text=Clubhouse%2C%20which%20took%20off%20in,investment%20led%20by%20Andreessen%20Horowitz.\">600,000 active users</a>&nbsp;in December 2020 to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-02-25/clubhouse-clout-land-grab-influencers\">more than 10 million</a>&nbsp;today.</p> \n<p>\"This past week, two million people around the world—musicians, scientists, creators, athletes, comedians, parents, entrepreneurs, stock traders, non-profit leaders, authors, artists, real estate agents, sports fans, and more—came to Clubhouse to talk, learn, laugh, be entertained, meet and connect. It’s the most exciting thing we’ve ever been a part of,\" wrote the <a href=\"https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices\">Clubhouse team</a>&nbsp;in a Jan. 24 blog post.</p> \n<h2>Why Many Marketers Are Just Learning About Clubhouse</h2> \n<p>Just hearing about Clubhouse now? You aren’t alone.</p> \n<p>As mentioned, Clubhouse was initially targeted to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/style/clubhouse-app-influencers.html#:~:text=Clubhouse%2C%20which%20took%20off%20in,investment%20led%20by%20Andreessen%20Horowitz.\">high-profile industry \"elites,\"</a>&nbsp;such as celebrities, CEOs, and top online influencers. For a while, these types of users were the only ones who could send and receive Clubhouse invites. On top of the app’s invite-only nature, it's only <a href=\"https://www.joinclubhouse.com/\">available to iPhone users</a>.</p> \n<p>While Clubhouse's early exclusivity made it interesting and alluring to the every-day social media user, it caused the app's awareness and user-base to grow at a slow but steady pace.</p> \n<p>Now that the app's become more accessible to social media users, it's been getting more awareness online and across news media. At this time, marketers are also starting to wonder if and how they could use Clubhouse -- or something like it -- in their strategy.</p> \n<p>In fact, many professionals, business leaders, and non-profit members can already be heard speaking in Rooms that discuss a topic related to their brand, industry, or mission.</p> \n<p>For example, a recent Room I dropped in on featured a group of lawyers aiming to offer education around patent protection. While this content was intriguing to listeners, it also could have brought each lawyer’s firm more awareness:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Lawyer Room on Clubhouse\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-1.png?width=200&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-1.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 200px;\" title=\"\" width=\"200\"></p> \n<p>Aside from marketers, major social media companies are also trying to take advantage of Clubhouse's audio social media trends.</p> \n<p>Shortly after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-clubhouse-2021-2\">spoke in a Clubhouse Room</a>, the New York Times reported that his social media company <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html\">was allegedly building a similar audio platform</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;just began rolling out Twitter Spaces -- a drop-in audio feature with its app -- to a small group of beta testers.</p> \n<p>At the moment, Clubhouse seems like a promising way to network and build a community online, and its audio social format is already being adopted by competitors. However, in a time where we see a handful of new online platforms each year, is Clubhouse really a game-changer in the social media space? Or is it just another over-hyped app you shouldn't waste your marketing efforts on?</p> \n<p>Below, I'll give a brief description of how the platform works and then weigh the pros and cons of using Clubhouse for marketing.

They’ll also find search, message inbox, calendar, and notification icons in the upper navigation.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-3.png?width=200&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-3.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 200px;\" title=\"\" width=\"200\" alt=\"Clubhouse homepage\"></p> \n<p>When tapping the search or \"Explore\" tab, users can scroll through a feed of suggested Rooms, Clubs, or people to follow. They can also use the search bar to find specific individuals or Clubs. However, it does not seem like users can search for specific Rooms yet.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Clubhouse Explore tab\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-2.png?width=200&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-2.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 200px;\" title=\"\" width=\"200\"></p> \n<p>If users can’t attend a Room when they're surfing the Clubhouse app but would like to drop into one later, they can tap the calendar icon.to see or create their scheduled Rooms.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Clubhouse scheduled room tab\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-4.png?width=200&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-4.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 200px;\" title=\"\" width=\"200\"></p> \n<h3>Clubhouse Rooms</h3> \n<p>Entering a Room is essentially like attending a webinar or Zoom meeting with no video and a partially muted audience.</p> \n<p>Attendees, who can join or leave a Room at any time, enter (or drop-in) as automatically muted listeners. If they'd like to speak or ask questions, they can tap the \"Raise Hand\" icon in the lower right corner of the Room page. Room moderators will then be notified of the hand raise request and can ignore it or unmute the attendee.</p> \n<p>Below is a look at what Clubhouse Rooms look like:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Clubhouse Room\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-26-31-PM.png?width=200&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-26-31-PM.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 200px;\" title=\"\" width=\"200\"></p> \n<p>Visually, attendees of the Room can see only the profile photos and names of current participants, with moderators and speakers appearing at the top of the screen.</p> \n<p>Users and moderators can also add people they follow to a Room by tapping the \"+\" button in the lower navigation. This gives their friends a notification that they've been invited to a Room and enables them to open the app and join it directly.</p> \n<h3>Starting a Room</h3> \n<p>At the bottom of the homepage, users can also tap \"Start a Room\" to launch either a \"Closed\" chat open to specific people only, a \"Social\" chat open to all of a user's following, or an \"Open\" chat that anyone on Clubhouse can drop into.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Starting a clubhouse room\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D.png?width=200&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 200px;\" title=\"\" width=\"200\"></p> \n<p>Users can also tap the nine-dot icon on the lower homepage navigation to have a private audio chat with specific followers who are online.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"clubhouse lower navigation\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-25-13-PM.png?width=400&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-25-13-PM.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 400px;\" title=\"\" width=\"400\"></p> \n<p>Room moderators, who either launched the Room or were assigned to a moderator role after the Room launched, see a similar page that attendees see. However, they also get notifications of new Room attendees and a list of attendees who have raised their hand requesting to speak.</p> \n<p>One interesting thing to note is that a Room only ends when a moderator ends it or when the final moderator leaves it. Additionally, moderators who want to leave a Room without ending it can assign someone else to become a moderator. This means that a Room with multiple moderators can go on for hours or even days.</p> \n<p>Because of how long Rooms last, and the fact that attendees can join or exit whenever they want, you might regularly hear more seasoned Room moderators re-introduce themselves, what they’re discussing, and who else is speaking throughout a Room event.</p> \n<h3>Clubs and Networking</h3> \n<p>Aside from creating Rooms, users can also follow individual profiles of friends, influencers, or thought leaders in their industry.</p> \n<p>They can also join or create Clubs, which are groups of users with interest in specific topics, hobbies, or industries. Take a look at some of the Clubs that appeared when I searched, \"growth marketing.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Growth Marketing Clubs\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-25-58-PM.png?width=400&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-25-58-PM.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 400px;\" title=\"\" width=\"400\"></p> \n<p>Once users join a Club, they can be notified if a Club's manager launches a Room related to its core topic. For example, if I were to join one of the Growth Marketing Clubs shown above, I'd be instantly notified if they hosted a Room on a growth marketing tactic.</p> \n<p><em>Want another example of a club to join? <a href=\"https://www.joinclubhouse.com/club/hubspot-marketing-club\">Check out and follow HubSpot's Marketing Club </a>to be notified about our latest rooms.</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.joinclubhouse.com/club/hubspot-marketing-club\"><em><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-03-29%20at%203.16.56%20PM.png?width=530&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-03-29%20at%203.16.56%20PM.png\" alt=\"HubSpot Marketing Club\" width=\"530\" style=\"width: 530px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></em></a></p> \n<h2>The Pros and Cons of Clubhouse.</h2> \n<h3>Pros of Using Clubhouse</h3> \n<h4>1. Clubhouse could help brands build trust and community.</h4> \n<p>In 2020, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-consumers-changed-brands-this-year?_ga=2.184373603.419613483.1613574184-1359294572.1613574184\">consumers began to favor companies with authentic, trustworthy messaging</a>&nbsp;over big-name companies with decades of brand loyalty. This shift will likely continue through 2021.</p> \n<p>Why? In a time of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-consumers-changed-brands-this-year?_ga=2.184373603.419613483.1613574184-1359294572.1613574184\">financial uncertainty and constant news events</a>, consumers want to know that brands care about their customers and share values with them. While creating a live, uncensored, unscripted Room related to your brand's industry might sound nerve-wracking, it could help some brands seem more authentic and trustworthy.</p> \n<p>\"Clubhouse offers a lot of opportunities for connection with celebrities, a vast variety of people in different industries, and even close friends,\" says Krystal Wu, HubSpot's social media community manager. \"It opens the door for live conversations allowing people to be vulnerable within a community space. This type of connection is unique to deliver audio content with small to large groups of people. Its unscripted content that anyone can be a part of.”</p> \n<p>Brands that use Clubhouse could earn credibility by discussing topics they're experts on. But, they could also earn trust because they've made themselves available to listen and talk candidly with their audiences.</p> \n<h4>2. The app's content is always evolving.</h4> \n<p>While the app initially hosted conversations related to entertainment, business, and technology due to its initial target audience, the audio content on the platform has broadened and evolved</p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/10/black-users-turned-social-app-clubhouse-from-drab-to-fun.html\">CNBC recently reported</a>&nbsp;that some of Clubhouse's most engaging Rooms have been launched by innovative Black creatives who've done heavy experimentation on the platform.</p> \n<p>For example, instead of hosting a chat or discussion, one group of Black performers <a href=\"https://www.the-prestige-magazine.com/2021/01/01/black-creatives-brought-joy-to-the-world-with-lion-king-clubhouse/\">hosted an audio-only production of Disney's \"The Lion King.\"</a>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While there isn't a recording of the Clubhouse performance, led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/noelle-chesnut-whitmore-1b379222/\">Noelle Chesnut Whitmore</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kam_dela?lang=en\">Kam DeLa</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iambomanix/?hl=en\">Bomani X,</a>&nbsp;here's a screenshot from the event, which shows each Room moderator as the character they played:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"The Lion King Room on Clubhouse\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-25-99-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-25-99-PM.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 300px;\" title=\"\" width=\"300\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https://jocksandstilettojill.com/professional-athletes/clubhouse-app-presents-1st-audio-performance-of-the-lion-king/\" style=\"font-size: 9px;\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>\"What started as a random conversation on Clubhouse has scaled to something much greater. We have so many talented people contributing their time and energy to this performance,\" <a href=\"https://www.prlog.org/12851920-lion-king-event-launches-on-clubhouse-app-to-spread-joy-in-the-digital-space.html\">Whitmore said in a press release</a>. \"Our goal is just to spread some joy to people through these events. I never imagined this would get such a huge response.\"</p> \n<p>In another example, a <a href=\"https://loopstore.com/\">cocktail brand called Loop</a>&nbsp;hosted a Room that encouraged participants to have a cocktail and join a casual conversation with no specific topic. While this strategy is less structured, it enables people who want to learn more about the brand or just want to chat with other cocktail drinkers to connect.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-26-63-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-26-63-PM.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 300px;\" title=\"\" width=\"300\"></p> \n<p>Because Clubhouse is fairly new, there aren't major content-related expectations just yet. This means that anyone from any group, industry, non-profit, or brand can experiment with it and learn what's truly engaging to the app's growing audience.</p> \n<h4>3. The app is primed for thought leadership.</h4> \n<p>Clubhouse's user base was built around influencers and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-thought-leadership\">thought leaders</a>. This means that users are likely coming to the app to hear the latest tips, exclusive information, or discussions straight from industry experts.</p> \n<p>For example, the scheduled Room shown below features <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/plp/nar3?utm_source=google_search_b&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=1711534994&amp;utm_content=68048698078&amp;utm_term=coinbase&amp;utm_creative=409186026435&amp;cb_device=c&amp;cb_placement=&amp;cb_country=us&amp;cb_city=open&amp;cb_language=en_us&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1KiBBhCcARIsAPWqoSp23MoI-xsL96keTFSV7Qn3_exrSyCcBznpfnOKNchkT2ugtu-ryUUaApM5EALw_wcB\">Coinbase</a>&nbsp;Co-Founder and&nbsp;CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/barmstrong/\">Brian Armstrong</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Coinbase founder interview\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-25-31-PM.png?width=200&amp;name=What%20is%20Clubhouse%3F%20%5B+Should%20Marketers%20Care%3F%5D-Feb-17-2021-03-03-25-31-PM.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 200px;\" title=\"\" width=\"200\"></p> \n<p>In a Clubhouse Room like the one shown above, users could learn more about a brand like Coinbase and ask its leader questions about the company or its industry. Through Rooms like this, Coinbase and other brands could boost both company awareness and credibility with audiences who listen.</p> \n<h4>4. Audiences want online communities and audio content.</h4> \n<p>In the last year, people who were stuck at home turned to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-consumers-sign-up-for-webinars\">webinars</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=virtual+event+hubspot+blog&amp;oq=virtual+event+hubspot+blog&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30j69i60j69i64l3.5767j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">virtual events</a>, and<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/examples-of-virtual-services\">&nbsp;other online experiences</a>&nbsp;to learn more about their interests, hear from others in their industry, or just feel a sense of connection to people outside of their households.</p> \n<p>But, while virtual events were beneficial for many, most of us eventually dealt with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/protect-mental-health-when-remote?_ga=2.210195792.419613483.1613574184-1359294572.1613574184\">screen fatigue</a>.</p> \n<p>Because too much screentime can be mentally draining, consumers also checked out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/podcast-stats?_ga=2.210195792.419613483.1613574184-1359294572.1613574184\">podcasts</a>&nbsp;or camera-free webinars. Now, these audiences could be primed for Clubhouse's audio-only nature.</p> \n<p>\"Clubhouse’s most appealing quality is that it's a break from the nonstop screen time we all exist in,\" says Kelly Hendrickson, HubSpot social media marketing manager. \"Clubhouse is also a wonderful place to have conversations among niche communities and topics.\"</p> \n<p>And, while consumers are craving personal connections and live content more than ever, many brands are trying to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-leverage-user-generated-content\">build stronger online communities</a>&nbsp;and launch <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/run-successful-virtual-conference?_ga=2.210195792.419613483.1613574184-1359294572.1613574184\">effective digital event strategies</a>.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Clubhouse's audio-only layout could help brands meet and build an engaged community of fans on an interactive, authentic, and live platform.</p> \n<h3>Cons of Clubhouse</h3> \n<h4>1. The app still has limited audiences.</h4> \n<p>Ultimately, one of Clubhouse's biggest brand marketing flaws is also what makes it so intriguing: exclusivity.</p> \n<p>\"I am generally against anything that is invite-only as it creates a culture of 'others',\" Hendrickson says. \"Any time you need to be 'in the know' to have a seat at the table, how can you also be inclusive?\"</p> \n<p>While Clubhouse might pose unique group chat opportunities for community marketers when more people join, the audiences might still be too limited for some marketers at the moment. On top of this, the app is still unavailable to Android users.</p> \n<p>“Clubhouse actually hinders its capabilities because there are many talented potential users out there that are missing out all because they are on Android,” Wu says.</p> \n<p>If you're looking to only create content for the largest audiences possible, you might want to hold off on building a Clubhouse strategy right now. However, if you're only looking to experiment and see if you can reach the audiences it already has, it might be an interesting platform for your team to try.</p> \n<h4>2. Clubhouse could have strong audio-app competition.</h4> \n<p>Facebook and Twitter could be just the first platforms to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html\">create a similar audio drop-in experience</a>. And, while this hints that Clubhouse creators have stumbled upon a platform many social media users want, the big-name competition could also pose concerns about the platform's future.</p> \n<p>For example, if Facebook or another major competitor can create something similar that's less exclusive and allows iPhone and Android users, people might leave Clubhouse for a platform with a larger audience or more credibility in the social media world. If this happens, marketers who invest heavily in a Clubhouse strategy might need to do a sudden pivot.</p> \n<p>While this shouldn't scare you away from testing the platform if you think it's right for your brand, the competition is still important to keep in mind. If you are considering Clubhouse, continue to follow its competitors and determine how you could pivot your strategy to those platforms if your audiences start to flock there instead.</p> \n<h4>3. Clubhouse can feel like an \"unedited podcast.\"</h4> \n<p>\"Another challenge I think brands and individuals will have with Clubhouse is how it feels like an unedited podcast,\" says Hendrickson. \"That means you’re hearing all the great meat, but you also have to listen to the trimmings. It will be interesting to see if long term, people are okay with that in their content.\"</p> \n<p>If you're planning to experiment on Clubhouse, consider practicing a few conversation starters, how you'll enter the call, and determine what you'll do if you run into dead air, boring conversation, or off-topic discussion that draws attention away from your Room's goal.</p> \n<p>Although Rooms are live and unscripted, having a gameplan will help you moderate an effective, higher-quality conversation than users might find in other Rooms.</p> \n<h4>4. Brands could be too vulnerable.</h4> \n<p>Certain generations, like Gen Z,<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">&nbsp;crave authenticity from people and brands they follow</a>&nbsp;on social media. With an app like Clubhouse, brands could create Rooms or Clubs related to their industry that include thought leaders, prospects, and even clients that want to talk with them in a live, unfiltered way.</p> \n<p>However, while Clubhouse's high level of unscripted authenticity has intrigued both marketers and prospective users, it also could put brands in vulnerable positions. Wu describes this as “a balance between good and evil.”</p> \n<p>Within a year of its launch, Clubhouse's live nature has already led to brand-related controversies.</p> \n<p>For example, in February, <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, dropped into a Room with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vladtenev?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Robinhood Markets CEO Vlad Tenev</a>&nbsp;and raised his hand. When he was invited to speak by the Room's moderators, Musk began intensely questioning Tenev and asked him to explain why his stock-trading company <a href=\"https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility\">stopped its users from buying and selling GameStop and other manipulated stocks</a>. You can hear the line of questioning in the video below:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1L8mI0i4XSA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>While Robinhood's CEO remained calm and collected throughout the chat, some brands might not have well-trained speakers who would react as calmly or professionally to this surprising scenario.</p> \n<p>Additionally, although Clubhouse doesn't allow users to record, many either downloaded screen-recording apps or filmed their phones with another video recording device. Because of this, Musk and Tenev's conversation was covered by the media within hours.</p> \n<p>Even though conversations cannot be replayed or recorded in the Clubhouse app itself, marketers on the app must remember that they're live and anything they say could easily be streamed or quoted in seconds. Because of this, Room hosts should prepare themselves so that they can answer both easy and challenging questions from audience members. Moderators should also determine what they'll do or how they'll react if an unmuted audience member says something controversial or unexpected.</p> \n<h2>Is Clubhouse right for you?</h2> \n<p>In its current state, Clubhouse could offer some major awareness and community-building benefits to brands. But, because of how new it is, it also poses some challenges and cons to companies that want to reach the largest audiences possible. Ultimately, while some companies might thrive on it, others might realize that it isn't the best platform for their goals just yet.</p> \n<p>As with any new social media platform, you'll want to spend some time on Clubhouse and see what the app has to offer before putting time and effort into using it.</p> \n<p>At this point, it could be wise to see if one of your friends or colleagues can send you a Clubhouse invite so you can familiarize yourself with the app. If you can't log on, be sure to continue following the news around it.</p> \n<p>As you surf through the app or read Clubhouse news coverage, ask yourself questions like these:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Are topics related to your product or industry widely discussed on the platform?</li> \n <li>Are there any thought leaders or company experts you could host a panel or two with to boost your awareness or credibility on Clubhouse?</li> \n <li>Are our competitors using Clubhouse? And, if so, can we create stronger Room experiences than they can?</li> \n <li>Do you already use marketing strategies that could be adapted to an audio-only platform, such as live video Q&amp;As, webinars, or virtual events?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>With questions like those above, you can determine if you'll be able to create scalable and engaging content for this social media platform.</p> \n<p>Can't get access to Clubhouse just yet? Don't worry. We'll continue to cover it on the HubSpot Blog so you'll be ready when you do.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This blog post was originally published Feb. 17, 2021, but was updated to add more HubSpot

However, when someone lands on HubSpot.com in Germany, a lang tag changes the language on the page itself.</p> \n<p>It might be easier to visualize, so here's a sample lang tag:</p> \n<p><em>&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;</em></p> \n<p>Alternatively, here's a sample hreflang tag:</p> \n<p><em>&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://example.com/\" </em><em style=\"color: inherit; font-size: 1em;\">hreflang=\"en\" /&gt;</em></p> \n<p>Google <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en\">recommends</a> using hreflang when indexing websites that are in different languages.</p> \n<p>Next, let's explore what hreflang tags are used for and how you can use them for your own webpages.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The tag is: rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"x\"</p> \n<p>Hreflang tags allow you to show Google and other search engines the relationship between webpages that are in different languages. For instance, if your tag needs to link to an English-language blog, you'd use the following tag: hreflang=\"en\".</p> \n<p>This is a sample of what a website will look like when it's tagged with an hreflang attribute:</p> \n<p><em>&lt;link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://hubspot.com\" hreflang=\"en-us\"/&gt;</em></p> \n<p>The \"en\" in the first part of the tag refers to the language code, English, and the \"US\" refers to the country code, for the United States.</p> \n<p>Users with an IP address that notifies which language is being used will automatically see a properly tagged webpage, so a hreflang tag is especially helpful if you have a global audience and want to make their user experience delightful.</p> \n<h3>Why Do You Need Hreflang Tags?</h3> \n<p>Ultimately, it's helpful to use hfreflang tags so you can create a better user experience. If a user in Germany searches for HubSpot, we want to make sure the result in the search engine shows our site in German and not in English. Besides a better user experience, this can also help reduce bounce rate and increase conversion rates because you're showing the best version of your site to the right audience.</p> \n<h2>How Do Hreflang Tags Work?</h2> \n<p>To illustrate how hreflang works, let's consider an example. Let's say you make two homepages that are the same, but one is in English (hreflang=\"en\"), and the other's in Spanish (hreflang=\"es\").</p> \n<p>When a user searches for your homepage in Spanish or from a Spanish-language browser, they'll receive the Spanish version of your homepage, as long as it's properly tagged.</p> \n<p>Each language and country has its own hreflang tag. Here's a list of common ones:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">German/Germany: de-de</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">English/USA: en-us</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Irish/Ireland: ga-ie</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Hindi/India: hi-in</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Italian/Italy: it-it</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Japanese/Japan: ja-jp</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Korean/Korea: ko-kp</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Portuguese/Brazil: pt-br</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Russian/Russain Federation: ru-ru</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Chinese (simplified)/China: zh-hans-cn</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Thai/Thailand: th-th</p> \n<p>If you are sharing the same page in different regions, note that it is possible to have multiple hreflang tags on the same page. For instance, if your French website sells to customers in Germany and Spain too, you'll be able to tag your page accordingly in HTML.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that because hrefleg tags are able to be overridden by other SEO options, your page may rank higher in a different language. To avoid this, make sure search engines are equipped with the correct attributes, so they know which language to present your page in.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the point of hreflang tags is to give customers who speak different languages, or who live in different regions of the world, content meant for them. Search engines will give international users the version of the page in their language on the results page.</p> \n<p>If all of this is a little confusing, don't worry. You can use a free Hreflang tag generator so all you need to do is copy and paste the code. Let's look at a few examples below.</p> \n<h2>Hreflang Tags Generator Tools</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.aleydasolis.com/english/international-seo-tools/hreflang-tags-generator/\">The Hreflang Tags Generator Tool</a></h3> \n<p>With this tool, you can generate hreflang tags for your multi-language site. All you need to do is add the URL to your site and choose which language it's in.</p> \n<p>This is a great tool because you can even upload a CSV with up to 50 URLs and can generate the hreflang tag for 50 sites at once.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://geotargetly.com/hreflang-tag-generator-tool\">Geo Targetly</a></h3> \n<p>Geo Targetly is another great hreflang generator tool. It's easy and free to use. All you need to do is input your URL and the language, and then voila.</p> \n<p>While you can't do up to 50 sites at once, this is still a quick, easy-to-use option.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://app.sistrix.com/en/hreflang-generator\">Sistrix</a></h3> \n<p>The Sistrix tool is similar to the other two tools above. All you need to do is input your URL and language and then the tool will generate the code for you.</p> \n<p>Now that you know a little bit more about hreflang tags, let's talk about HTML language tags.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">HTML Language Tag Example</h2> \n<p>HTML language attributes define the language of a webpage. For example, an HTML language tag for an English webpage would look like this:</p> \n<p><em>&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;</em></p> \n<p>Recall that Google doesn't look at HTML language tags, but other search engines might, so it's a good idea to still include them for search engines that don't look at hreflang tags.</p> \n<p>You might also want to use HTML language tags in conjunction with an hreflang tag — they can work together to inform search engines about the content on your webpages. Having both tags tells search engines what language a webpage is in, while directing users from other countries to the appropriate webpage.</p> \n<p>When you're optimizing your content for search engines, it's important to do everything you can to rank on the SERPs. This helps people across the globe find your business.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\"
