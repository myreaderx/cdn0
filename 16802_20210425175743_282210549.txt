The main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) enzyme produced by SARS-CoV-2 was recently demonstrated to be responsible for not only viral reproduction but also impeding host immune responses. The element selenium (Se) plays a vital role in immune functions, both directly and indirectly. Thus, we hypothesised that Se-containing heterocyclic compounds might curb the activity of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>. We performed a molecular docking analysis and found that several of the selected selenocompounds showed potential binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>, especially ethaselen (49), which exhibited a docking score of ���6.7��kcal/mol compared with the ���6.5��kcal/mol score for GC376 (positive control). Drug-likeness calculations suggested that these compounds are biologically active and possess the characteristics of ideal drug candidates. Based on the binding affinity and drug-likeness results, we selected the 16 most effective selenocompounds as potential anti-COVID-19 drug candidates. We also validated the structural integrity and stability of the drug candidate through molecular dynamics simulation. Using further <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">in vitro</span> and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">in vivo</span> experiments, we believe that the targeted compound identified in this study (ethaselen) could pave the way for the development of prospective drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and trigger specific host immune responses.</span>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":16802,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ab3a4e2ff93223b0c76f8adefb201965","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rakib A, Nain Z, Sami S, et al.
