In other words, does the learner like the language, feel confident that he or she can learn it, believe in the method being used etc.? </span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One organization with lots of learners has made an estimate of the time required to learn different languages.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2><b>How Long to Learn a Language According to the FSI</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FSI, US Foreign Service Institute, divides languages into groups of difficulty for speakers of English:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>Group 1:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swahili</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>Group 2:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bulgarian, Burmese, Greek, Hindi, Persian, Urdu</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>Group 3:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amharic, Cambodian, Czech, Finnish, Hebrew, Hungarian, Lao, Polish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><b>Group 4:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<h3><b>The FSI 5 levels of proficiency </b></h3>\n<p><b>Elementary proficiency</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The person is able to satisfy routine travel needs and minimum courtesy requirements.

This is the first level that is useful in real situations. This probably corresponds to B2 on the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">European Framework of Reference.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is what I always aim for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>Full professional proficiency</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The person uses the language fluently and accurately on all levels normally pertinent to professional needs.

Accounting for days off, this equates to two months or three months time. If you only put in five hours a day, it will take twice as long.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us don’t have 10 hours a day to spend, so it will take longer. Furthermore, if we don’t have 10 hours a day, we are better to focus on activities that we like doing and that are easy to organize, like listening and reading, using a system like LingQ, for example. But let’s look at what a 10 hour day of language study might look like.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>If you were to study a language 10 hours a day…</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is ten hours a day reasonable to learn a language? It could be. In order not to burn out, it is important to vary the activities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a sample day:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>8-12:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Alternate </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">listening, reading</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and vocabulary review using LingQ, Anki or some other system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>12-2:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Rest, exercise, lunch, while listening to the language.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>2-3:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Grammar review</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>3-4:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Write</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>4-5:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Talk to an online tutor or with locals if in the country</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>5-7:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Rest</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><b>7-10:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Relaxation in the language, movies, songs, or going out with friends in the language. depending on availability.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To some extent the language needs time to gestate and often things we study today do not click in for months. On the other hand, intensity has its own benefits. I have no doubt that someone following this intense program, or something similar, would achieve </span><b>basic conversational fluency</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in two months for easy languages, and three months for difficult languages.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if you don’t have that much time, I would encourage you to focus on input-based learning, with a lot of listening during dead time, time when you are doing other tasks, washing the dishes, driving your car, walking, working out etc..</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This first stage is important in order to get a grasp of some basic vocabulary and a sense of how the language works. It also gives us the confidence that we can move on to fluency. During this first stage we are curious about the language and willing to listen to the same content over and over. </span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repetitive listening is an excellent way to get used to a new language. Whatever content you listen to, and I recommend point of view stories like the Mini-Stories at LingQ, make sure you also have access to the transcripts so that you can learn the vocabulary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To go from level 2 to level 4, or full professional fluency would take quite a bit longer, perhaps twice as long for easier languages and four times as long for the more difficult languages.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<h2><b>Learning Languages on LingQ to Achieve Fluency Faster</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immersing yourself in a new language doesn’t require you to travel abroad or sign up for an expensive language program. You can find lots of material to listen to and read at home. However, it can be a time-consuming to find interesting content. You will also benefit from an efficient way of looking up new words and phrases and keeping track of them. </span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s why there’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.lingq.com/\">LingQ, a language app that helps you discover and learn from content you love</a>. You can start with the repetitive “mini-stories” and other beginner content and then move on to things of interest to you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can import videos, podcasts, and much more and turn them into interactive lessons. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep all your favorite content stored in one place, easily look up new words, save vocabulary, and review.</span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Learning Languages with Netflix and LingQ\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rw-u_vVx6Is?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LingQ is available for desktop as well as Android and iOS.
