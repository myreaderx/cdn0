All of which will be available on <u>November 5</u> so there's less than a month until you can get your hands on them.</p>\n\n<p>As expected, they're going to be powerful too, with AMD claiming this being their biggest increase in IPC (instructions per cycle/clock) resulting in strong single-thread performance for those games that stick loads into a main thread. For gamers, these are going to be very competitive to Intel. AMD claimed a \"19%\" IPC increase compared with their previous generation of Zen. On top of that, they're claiming a big win on latency reduction between core and cache communication.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3092199661602174242gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3092199661602174242gol1.jpg\" /></a><a data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13858090341602174633gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13858090341602174633gol1.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Above you can see the Ryzen 5900X, Ryzen 5800X and the Ryzen 5600X. However, they had another surprise which is their new top-end Ryzen 5950X which is something of a monster.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21267382031602174703gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21267382031602174703gol1.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>AMD's Mark Papermaster confirmed Ryzen 5000 is using the same 7nm node as before, however it is using a new core layout and new cache topology with design improvements \"across all of the CPU components\". Papermaster mentioned this new layout brings all of the cores onto \"A unified 8-core complex, that accelerates core to core communication that's especially helpful to gaming workloads. That consolidation actually allows every core to directly access the 32MB of L3 cache, that dramatically accelerates workloads that are latency sensitive like gaming\".</p>\n\n<p>What will all that actually translate into when it comes to real-world performance? Well benchmarks will find out soon enough with the November 5 launch.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the main specs sheet to make it easy for you:</p>\n\n<div class=\"scrolling-table\">\n<table class=\"table-stripes-tbody\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>MODEL</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>CORES/</strong><br />\n\t\t\t<strong>THREADS</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>TDP</strong><br />\n\t\t\t<strong>(Watts)</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>BOOST</strong><strong>9</strong><strong>/BASE</strong><br />\n\t\t\t<strong>FREQ.

Zen 4, going by the imagery shown during the event, is due before or during 2022 and that will be moving to a 5nm process.</p>\n\n<p>AMD also teased out the AMD Radeon 6000 which they \"affectionately call\" Big Navi that seems to have stuck as a nickname now. They're saying it's the \"most powerful gaming GPU we have ever built\", well of course they would say that.</p>\n\n<p>We will get more information for the AMD Radeon 6000 series on October 28 with their next planned event.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10898277491602174878gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10898277491602174878gol1.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><em>To help you along a bit for those with JavaScript enabled, we've hooked up AJAX commenting and page turning in the comments so you can keep watching, comment and not have the whole page reload.
