We are excited to announce that the 199 mentoring organizations have selected their students. Here are some notable results from this year’s application period:</div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>6,991 applications submitted by 4,795 students</li><li>Students from 103 countries applied</li><li>1292 students were selected from 69 countries<br /></li></ul><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-476513aa-7fff-75a5-bd85-f6dfdc48b48a\"></span></div>Starting today, participating students will be paired with a mentor to begin planning their projects and milestones. For the next few weeks (May 17–June 7), students will get acquainted with their mentor and start to engage with the project’s open source community. This <a href=\"https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/how-gsoc-works\" target=\"_blank\">Community Bonding</a> period also allows students to familiarize themselves with the languages or tools needed to complete their projects. Coding then begins on June 7th, continuing through the summer until August 16th.  <br /><br />Though applications for GSoC have closed for 2021, there are other ways to pursue your interests in open source projects. Staying connected with the community or reaching out to other organizations is a good first step. Making contact with potential mentors and a software community sets the stage for future opportunities. A great resource is the <a href=\"https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/being-turned-down\" target=\"_blank\">student guide</a>, which has suggestions on what to do if you weren’t selected for this year’s program. It also has a section on ‘Choosing an Organization’ which is helpful whether you would like to connect now with organizations on your own, or decide to apply to GSoC in the future—which we hope you do!<br /><br />Here’s to the 17th year of Google Summer of Code!<br /><br /><i>By Romina Vicente, Project Coordinator for the Google Open Source Programs Office</i><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOpenSourceBlog?a=0qj4yLSm7JA:c538yqbEXJQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOpenSourceBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOpenSourceBlog?a=0qj4yLSm7JA:c538yqbEXJQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOpenSourceBlog?i=0qj4yLSm7JA:c538yqbEXJQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOpenSourceBlog/~4/0qj4yLSm7JA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 May 2021 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":619,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8ZYj3RvGh9c/YJ7FWPn4b0I/AAAAAAAAAt8/nO1Po5LzdIAc2ELON7qR5PRRTd8HDv2vwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/GSoC%2Blogo%2B%25281%2529.jpg","linkMd5":"78b29c8b97a51606eb55a6dff93ae33a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn34@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-58-59-573_bef35dde6de15e6c.webp","destWidth":250,"destHeight":250,"sourceBytes":10569,"destBytes":6670,"author":"Open Source Programs Office","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8ZYj3RvGh9c/YJ7FWPn4b0I/AAAAAAAAAt8/nO1Po5LzdIAc2ELON7qR5PRRTd8HDv2vwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/GSoC%2Blogo%2B%25281%2529.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn34@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-58-59-573_bef35dde6de15e6c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOpenSourceBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn37@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-59-30-115_297b9d3eb9d93cec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOpenSourceBlog?i=0qj4yLSm7JA:c538yqbEXJQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn46@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-59-00-053_c84ba909d431ee3a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOpenSourceBlog/~4/0qj4yLSm7JA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn41@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-59-00-025_395fb6e21ef06975.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436339416}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:58:59","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:58:59","feedId":619,"fetchDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 14:58:59 +0000","fetchMs":17,"handleMs":31,"totalMs":31418,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":25,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af0629e1ae74a27744b4cbd27b40a78e","hostName":"us-023*","requestId":"34e519943ae9443b8eb2d642f65dc97b_619","contentType":"text/xml;
