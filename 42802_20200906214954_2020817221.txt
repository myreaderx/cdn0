line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">For the past couple of years at least there have been increasingly numerous and strident calls for fundamental make-overs of both management and leadership.  People everywhere are clicking into the fact that yesteryear&#8217;s models and ways are less and less effective .. and yet we all labor on whilst yelling &#8220;change .. change, or die .. etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 13.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">World-renowned organizational effectiveness guru Gary Hamel set out the fundamental challenge(s) in his 2007 book &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.garyhamel.com/doc/future_of_management.pdf\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #0019e4;\">The Future of Management</span></a>&#8220;.  Others, such as John Hagel and John Seeley Brown&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.edgeperspectives.com/pop.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #0019e4;\">The Power of Pull</span></a>&#8220;, have weighed in with equally sharp and challenging premises and theories.  All of these pieces signal an urgent need to innovate and adapt to a new set of conditions .. conditions which are rapidly on their way to becoming ubiquitous and/or expected by the generations entering or approaching their chapter-of-life in the workplace.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 13.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">It sometimes feels like this is only the next round or wave of coming to terms with rumblings and dynamics that began back in the &#8217;60&#8217;s and &#8217;80&#8217;s.  After all, we began hearing about the critical need for empowerment, continuous learning, flexibility, agility and resilience at least two decades ago.  Most of the pioneering work in these areas came from the soft-and-squishy (or seen to be that way) world of Organizational Development (OD), from people like Eric Trist, Fred Emery, Bill Passmore, Marv Weisbord, Peter Block, Charles Handy, Meg Wheatley and many many others.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 13.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">As the years have passed since these pioneers first addressed the human issues in organizational structures and processes derived from engineering and efficiency principles, various elements of their thinking and practices have inexorably found their way into managing processes and people.  I suggest that this is entirely understandable as the increasing frequency and intensity of complicated and complex organizational activities have grown over time, and along with the evolution of peoples&#8217; expectations about work and meaning in a modern era.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 13.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial; color: #666666;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">My premise is that management innovation is available  from that world of organizational development, as it&#8217;s principles and dynamics are closely aligned to Hamel’s suggestion that “</span><em>activities will still need to be coordinated, individual efforts aligned, objectives decided upon, knowledge disseminated, and resources allocated, but increasingly this work will be distributed out to the periphery</em><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>“</em>.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 13.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\"><strong>The New Context Demands New Principles</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">What was yesterday called Enterprise 2.0 and today is called &#8220;Social Business&#8221; can be seen as the emergent stage of the intersection of significant advances in information technology, management science applied to business process, the analysis and control of operational activities AND the interaction and participation of people with information, opinions and knowledge to share.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">These forces and factors are converging in today’s workplaces, wherein a continuous flow of information is the rule rather than the exception.  Thus, it’s essential to cast a critical eye on the fundamental assumptions of work design and how work is managed. The core assumptions embodied in widely-used methodologies today still present work as  &#8221;static sets of tasks and knowledge arranged in specific constellations on an organization chart&#8221; (see all major job evaluation methodologies for more detail).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">It’s getting clearer and clearer today that the capabilities and dynamics of what started in the consumer realm as social software … those funny things called blogs, and wikis, and widgets stitched together into and by web services … are finding (and have found) their ways into the workplace.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">That they have migrated to the workplace makes sense.  People have always  (at work) been creating and building up “..<span style=\"color: #666666;\">.<em> knowledge through exchanging information, talking and arguing and pointing out other ideas and sources of information and ways to do things</em>.</span>” Such services and tools and the reasons for which people use them are the means by which general human activity (purposeful and otherwise) translates to the online environment.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">So, as stated at the outset, it seems clear that we&#8217;re situated in a more interactive, less static environment.  Whether we like it or not, we are  passing from an era in which things were assumed to be controllable (able to be deconstructed and then assembled into a clear, linear, always replicable and thus static form) to an era characterized by a continuous  flow of information.  Because it feeds the conduct of organizations large and small, it is a flow that necessarily demands to be interpreted and shaped into useful inputs and outputs.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">The methodologies still in use today generally did not foresee working with networked information flows, and thus the way work is designed and managed does not really address how it could or should be managed.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">We need to revisit the fundamental principles of work design AND the basic rules used to configure hierarchical organizations in which the primary assumption is that knowledge is put to use in a vertical chain of decision-making.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\"><strong>Both Horizontal and Vertical</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">Horizontal flows of information and peoples&#8217; engagement have already been put to work in a range of early Enterprise 2.0 and Social Business experiments.  But let&#8217;s be honest .. how these will work, or not, is to date less than clear.  There&#8217;s an enormous amount of inertia and habit to overcome, all whilst confronting continuously turbulent conditions seasoned with healthy helpings of ambiguity .. about economics, governance and peoples&#8217; collective capabilities to adapt.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">Hierarchy is not disappearing from the organizational landscape .. nor should it. It&#8217;s an useful construct for clarifying decision-making and accountability, and I believe it will come to co-exist with the core dynamics of networked people and information &#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.wirearchy.com\">&#8220;a dynamic two-way flow of power and authority based on knowledge, trust, credibility and a focus on results&#8221;</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">.. which, incidentally, is a fundamental aspect of all the &#8216;democratization&#8217; (<em>it&#8217;s probably too early to yet call it that, but let&#8217;s do so for the time being</em>) we are witnessing in the recent uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East.  Would that our western governments and organizations watch and learn as they embark on the renewal of leadership and management in the 21st Century.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">The implications are huge, will demand significant effort and responsibility on the part of all individuals, and may lead to very different ways of working and being in and of the world.</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Arial;\">But clearly, we must evolve &#8230; what we have been doing looks less and less likely to be as effective as necessary in the rapidly-approaching future.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a
