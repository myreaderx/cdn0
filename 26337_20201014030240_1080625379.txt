Here's what has happened since.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to catch up first, here are the previous posts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stuartkhall.com/posts/an-app-store-experiment\">Part 1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stuartkhall.com/posts/an-app-store-experiment-part-2\">Part 2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stuartkhall.com/posts/an-app-store-experiment-part-3\">Part 3</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>More IAPs</h3>\n\n<p>Part 3 left off where I had just submitted an update with some extra workouts as in app purchases.</p>\n\n<p>By March everyone was over their new years resolutions (Unfortunately mine finished on January 1).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+4/downloads.png\" alt=\"Downloads\" /></p>\n\n<p>Ignoring the spikes (I'll explain them in a bit), downloads returned to where they were leading up to the silly season, between 2k and 2.5k a day.</p>\n\n<p>Adding the new IAPs had almost zero impact on the original Pro upgrade (staying around $50-60 profit a day), but they did help to lift daily revenue to around $70 - $80 profit a day. Around a 40% increase in profits compared to late last year with similar download numbers, not bad.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+4/cumulative.png\" alt=\"Cumulative\" /></p>\n\n<p>If we break it down individually you can see the Pro upgrade was still the major income stream, but the workouts help supplement it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+4/profit.png\" alt=\"Profit\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Educational Downloads</h3>\n\n<p>The big spikes you saw above were educational downloads, 25k, 25k and 5k. I believe it is part of <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/education/it/vpp/\">Apple's education program</a>. I love the thought of entire schools out there doing the 7 Minute Workout. If you know any of the school please reach out to me.</p>\n\n<h3>All The Things</h3>\n\n<p>One thing I had noticed in a number of apps with IAP is their top download was an option to buy everything, forever.</p>\n\n<p>So I tried it (this is Australian pricing, US it's $4.99 / $1.99).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+4/allthethings.png\" alt=\"All The Things\" /></p>\n\n<p>And people seemed to like it:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+4/allthethingssales.png\" alt=\"All The Things Sales\" /></p>\n\n<p>Except it's meant the other in app purchases have taken a nose dive. But overall profit is up to around $145 per day for the first week or so. Update spike or long term trend? I guess we'll see by Part 5.</p>\n\n<h3>Reviews &amp; Feedback</h3>\n\n<p>One problem I've always had is after an update is the reviews reset and I am stuck back at square one.</p>\n\n<p>I recently launched <a href=\"https://appbot.co/appbotx/getstarted\">AppbotX</a> to help developers get app better app reviews and communicate with their customers.</p>\n\n<p>I put in the FAQs, Feedback, Notifications and Review Prompt from the service.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the FAQs general support has dropped from ~2 a day to 1 in a week.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/appbot-assets/blog/7-minute-case-study/FAQs.png\" alt=\"FAQs\" /></p>\n\n<p>I put the review prompt after a positive interaction, in this case when they finish a workout.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/appbot-assets/blog/7-minute-case-study/prompt-1.png\" alt=\"Prompt\" /></p>\n\n<p>If they like the app it asks them to leave a review:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/appbot-assets/blog/7-minute-case-study/prompt-2.png\" alt=\"Review\" /></p>\n\n<p>Otherwise it asks for feedback:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/appbot-assets/blog/7-minute-case-study/prompt-3.png\" alt=\"Feedback\" /></p>\n\n<p>The results are awesome, here's the current reviews on the US App Store:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+4/usreviews.png\" alt=\"US Reviews\" /></p>\n\n<p>And here is an example of some of the reviews <a href=\"http://appbot.co\">Appbot</a> sent through in it's daily digest.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/appbot-assets/blog/7-minute-case-study/reviews.png\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/appbot-assets/blog/7-minute-case-study/reviews.png\" alt=\"Reviews\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I've also received great feedback, 80% of which can be grouped into two things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of people want an abs workout.</li>\n<li>They want an easier way to review how to do each exercise during the workout.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>I may be a little (a lot) biased, but you should check out <a href=\"https://appbot.co/appbotx/getstarted\">AppbotX</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Indie Development</h3>\n\n<p>Much has been written about being an indie developer on the App Store recently, with not much of it positive.</p>\n\n<p>I think this experiment has shown us a few really important things.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Go with pricing models that are being proven to work.</li>\n<li>As much as we all hate it, market is more important than product (but both are extremely important).</li>\n<li>SEO and ASO are extremely important, and often overlooked.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>I been doing a bunch of consulting recently where I go through apps for developers and give them feedback on how to improve their downloads. Many of these apps are getting only a handful of downloads a day. They have the same thing in common, they have done no work on SEO/ASO and if you look at their App Store page you'd have no idea what their app does.</p>\n\n<p>You know how much development work you put into the app? Put at least half that again into your communication, visiblity and story.</p>\n\n<h3>The Stats</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1.95m downloads.</li>\n<li>5.5m updates.</li>\n<li>$60k in revenue.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>What's Next?</h3>\n\n<p>Next I want to experiment with the pricing of All The Things, are people willing to pay more? I'll also add an abs workout and better prompting based on the AppbotX feedback.</p>\n\n<p>What to know what happens next?
