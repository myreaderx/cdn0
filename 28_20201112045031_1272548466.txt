I recently changed the starter here. They told me $780 first, as a student couldn&#39;t afford that. It&#39;s 1/5 value of my car. They brought it down to $700 with an $30 oil change value which I initially appreciated it as I borrowed some money from my friend and couldn&#39;t come up with more. I thought that was a good deal as they &#34;helped&#34; me, I made some phone calls after I agreed to change and guess what was quoted $580 at express oil\" title=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"414\"/> </div> <h3> 2. </h3> <div> <img class='event-item-lol-image' src='https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9570537216/hF838B8E1/found-an-even-less-expensive-remanufactured-unit-but-had-wait-90-mins-delivery-declined-again-b' id='_r_a_9570537216' alt=\"Text - We got your car in immediately ahead of all appointments.

If we breakdown the cost, $700.00 less sales tax (S45.79), less intake manifold gasket ($54.99). less oil change ($24.95) and less disposal fees ($5.00), your NEW starter actually cost you $589.27.
