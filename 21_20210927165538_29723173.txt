The DC Comics character was somewhat unknown to the general public at the time, but Johnson was poised to change that with an appearance <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/567670/shazam-deleted-scene-thrones/\">as the villain in \"Shazam!\"</a> Plans changed. Now, we're about to see Johnson in a full-on \"Black Adam\" movie, which is set to grace our screens next summer.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This movie has been a long time coming, but it has finally been filmed, and it's in the can awaiting the eyeballs of eager audience members across the globe. We're here to get fans ready by providing the necessary information ahead of the superhero flick's release next year. Here is what you need to know about \"Black Adam.\"</p><h2>Black Adam Release Date And Where You Can Watch It</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/black-adam-release-date-cast-and-more/black-adam-release-date-and-where-you-can-watch-it-1632760497.jpg\" /><p>\"Black Adam\" is currently set to hit theaters on July 29, 2022. It is expected to be an exclusive theatrical release, meaning those who want to smell what The Rock is cooking in his first superhero role will need to head to a theater in order to do so. It will be at least 45 days before it is made available on streaming.</p><h2>What Is Black Adam?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/black-adam-release-date-cast-and-more/what-is-black-adam-1632760497.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Black Adam\" is the latest DC Comics film adaptation from Warner Bros. It centers on the character of the same name who has, historically speaking, been a villain. Most notably, a major nemesis of Shazam. Originally, Dwayne Johnson was attached to the role, more than a decade ago, in a villain capacity for the \"Shazam!\" movie. Instead, it was eventually decided he should get his own movie first. Johnson has consistently billed this version of the character as <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/581272/black-adam-image/\">an anti-hero, not a villain</a>.</p><h2>Black Adam Director, Crew, And More</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/black-adam-release-date-cast-and-more/black-adam-director-crew-and-more-1632760497.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Black Adam\" is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (\"Jungle Cruise\"). Rory Haines (\"The Mauritanian\"), Sohrab Noshirvani (\"Informer\"), and Adam Sztykiel (\"Rampage\") wrote the script. Lawrence Sher (\"Joker\") serves as cinematographer. Beau Flynn, Danny Garcia, and Hiram Garcia are on board as producers, with Walter Hamada, Dwayne Johnson, Eric McLeod, and Scott Sheldon serving as executive producers.</p><h2>Black Adam Cast</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/black-adam-release-date-cast-and-more/black-adam-cast-1632760497.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson leads the cast of \"Black Adam\" in the title role. Joining him as the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/576156/black-adam-first-look-dc-fandome/\">Justice Society</a> are Aldis Hodge (Hawkman), Noah Centineo (Atom Smasher), Quintessa Swindell (Cyclone), and Pierce Brosnan (Doctor Fate). Sarah Shahi is also set to play Adrianna Tomaz, with \"Aladdin\" star Marwan Kenzari in a mystery role, though he is said to be playing the villain.</p><h2>Black Adam Trailer And Synopsis</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/N73oTiIIJe0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p dir=\"ltr\">While we don't have any actual footage from the movie just yet, an animated teaser was released during DC FanDome in 2020.

The trailer has been screening in 35mm in select repertory theaters, and now, it's online, so we can all see it and start crossing off the days on our calendar until December.</p><p>As we previously <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/580605/new-paul-thomas-anderson-movie-release-date/\">reported</a>, the ninth Paul Thomas Anderson film follows \"a high school student becoming an actor in the 1970s.\" After several period pieces, \"Licorice Pizza\" sees Anderson returning to \"Boogie Nights\" territory. The setting is the San Fernando Valley, where \"Boogie Nights\" and other early films of his like \"Magnolia\" and \"Punch-Drunk Love\" were set.</p><p>Some of the names attached to \"Licorice Pizza\" are Bradley Cooper, Benny Safdie, Cooper Hoffman, and Alana Haim. Cooper and Safdie are both filmmakers in their own right, with Cooper having helmed \"A Star Is Born\" and Safdie being one half of the Safdie brothers (\"Good Times,\" \"Uncut Gems.\") Hoffman is the son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anderson's frequent collaborator, and Haim is one third of the band Haim.</p><p>There can sometimes be a gap of up to five years between Anderson movies, with his filmography leap-frogging from 2002 to 2007 to 2012. But he hasn't been idle since 2017, having directed music videos for Haim and the short film, or \"one-reeler,\" \"Anima,\" which accompanied Thom Yorke's album of the same name.</p><p>Check out the trailer for \"Licorice Pizza\" below.</p><h2>Licorice Pizza Trailer</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ofnXPwUPENo\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>This time, it's been four years since Anderson's last feature film, \"Phantom Thread,\" which racked up six Oscar nominations and won for Best Costume Design (only too fitting for a film about a dressmaker named Woodcock). \"Licorice Pizza\" originally went by the working title of \"Soggy Bottom,\" which sounds like a reference to the Soggy Bottom Boys, the fictional band led by George Clooney in \"O Brother Where Art Thou?'\" Maybe Anderson is a fan of their music (\"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,\" anyone?) or maybe he's still sore over \"There Will Be Blood\" losing Best Picture, Director, etc. to the Coen Brothers at the 80th Academy Awards.</p><p>Referring to their film, \"No Country for Old Men,\" which beat his film, he once told a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/movies/awardsseason/23bagg.html\">New York Times</a> writer, \"You really think that movie was better than ours? C'mon, do you really believe that?\"</p><p>The title of \"There Will Be Blood,\" released in 2007, itself sounded like a reference to the tagline of \"Saw 2,\" released in 2005. Anderson is obviously a cineliterate dude, much more so than any of us, probably. (He also once said to the same New York Times writer, \"You know you don't know a thing about movies.\") So maybe he's just coincidentally arriving at these titles or maybe he wanted to reclaim such phrases from obscurity.</p><p>\"Licorice Pizza\" isn't just a mood; it's a <a href=\"https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/licorice-pizza-paul-thomas-anderson/\">reference to a defunct chain of record stores</a> in Southern California, which took its name from a joke about unsuccessful records being sold as licorice pizza. Anderson's new film, \"Licorice Pizza,\" is scheduled to land in theaters on November 26, 2021.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/589412/the-11-greatest-paul-thomas-anderson-scenes/\">The 11 Greatest Paul Thomas Anderson Scenes</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/605544/licorice-pizza-trailer-director-paul-thomas-anderson-returns-to-the-1970s/\">Licorice Pizza Trailer: Director Paul Thomas Anderson Returns to the 1970s</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eDKnmdylDVI:N2WgfZ_IndU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eDKnmdylDVI:N2WgfZ_IndU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eDKnmdylDVI:N2WgfZ_IndU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eDKnmdylDVI:N2WgfZ_IndU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eDKnmdylDVI:N2WgfZ_IndU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eDKnmdylDVI:N2WgfZ_IndU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eDKnmdylDVI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:05:12 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/licorice-pizza-trailer-director-paul-thomas-anderson-returns-to-the-1970s/intro-1632755759.jpg","linkMd5":"b30a21d8edf6b11e395fcb2bc4c905ad","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-26-173_7ab4b7265a443ac6.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":61102,"destBytes":19292,"author":"Joshua Meyer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/licorice-pizza-trailer-director-paul-thomas-anderson-returns-to-the-1970s/intro-1632755759.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-26-173_7ab4b7265a443ac6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn61@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-33-580_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eDKnmdylDVI:N2WgfZ_IndU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn55@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-30-724_de2b5db15a8fe028.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-29-655_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eDKnmdylDVI:N2WgfZ_IndU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn8@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-30-290_23419fe1d226d6d6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eDKnmdylDVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-30-266_5f5502d6753582e0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761709735},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","title":"Ozark Season 4 First Look: The Byrdes Have Blood On Their Hands (And Everywhere Else)","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/616271/ozark-season-4-first-look-the-byrdes-have-blood-on-their-hands-and-everywhere-else/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ozark-season-4-first-look-the-byrdes-have-blood-on-their-hands-and-everywhere-else/intro-1632758182.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Not for the first time in their lives, the Byrdes are covered in blood. A few years ago, this would've been unthinkable for the suburban power couple, back when life was all about raising their kids and trying to find joy in their passionless marriage. But \"Ozark\" is now approaching its fourth season and things have gotten considerably more exciting for Wendy (Laura Linney) and Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman). Their marriage is a lot of things, but boring isn't one of them.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Anyway, who needs PTA meetings when you can be the guest of honor at a cartel leader's cool mansion party? Don't let the blood fool you, the Byrdes are having a blast! See for yourself, in our first look at \"Ozark\" season 4.</p><h2>Ozark Season 4 First Look</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/V2FG-KIgX2o\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p dir=\"ltr\">Move to the Ozarks, they said, your family will be safe there. Turns out you shouldn't take advice that encourages money laundering, who would've thought? One drastic decision made four seasons prior led the Byrdes to where they are now, cleaning blood from their hair with shaking hands. \"Ozark '' has consistently ramped up the stakes for the family and since this is the fourth and final season, their situation has never been more dire.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You might remember that last season saw them travel to Mexico at Cartel leader Omar Navarro's (Felix Solis) request, to attend his son's second baptism. They arrive with cartel lawyer Helen Pierce (Janet McTeer) and to both their shock and ours, Navarro immediately has her shot and killed. And as we now see, the blood splatter got pretty far. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This first look shows them understandably shaken as they attempt to wash the blood from their face. Wendy is especially affected, trembling as she pushes a rag into Marty's hand for help. It would almost be a tender moment if it wasn't blood he was wiping from her face. Plus, in typical Marty fashion, he already seems to be compartmentalizing, his face hiding his emotions. The scene ends on an ominous note, with someone entering the room and sadly, it'll be quite a while before we know who.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Season 4 of \"Ozark\" is expected to be supersized, coming in two parts that add up to 14 episodes. Both parts premiere in 2022, but no official release date has been confirmed.</p><h2>What's To Come In Season 4</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/ozark-season-4-first-look-the-byrdes-have-blood-on-their-hands-and-everywhere-else/whats-to-come-in-season-4-1632757820.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Marty and Wendy are way past being considered good or even decent people. The Byrdes are deep in the trenches now, having a direct relationship with Navarro and having wrecked many lives to save their own. Sure, they're in much deeper than they ever planned to be, and some of it was simply rolling with the punches and clinging to survival, but this also demanded a lot of awful and very conscious decisions on their part. So by no means are they blameless, but it's still hard not to root for their survival. And even if your resentment for them is getting overwhelming, remember everyone else involved in their mess: most notably, their kids, Jonah (Skylar Gaertner) and Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz), and their protege, Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As a refresher, season 3 concluded with the death of Helen Pierce and Navarro's embrace of the Byrdes as his new partners. Covered in blood and shaken at their core, the couple can do nothing but accept this new relationship and all of its many, many risks. Elsewhere, another powerful alliance was made as Ruth severed herself from the Byrdes and joined up with Darlene's (Lisa Emery) heroin operation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"> The biggest bombshell of the season was Wendy's role in her brother Ben's (Tom Pelphrey) death. Given he had just began a relationship with Ruth, she was especially devastated by his loss. Making matters worse, Wendy tried to direct blame back on to Ruth for releasing Ben from the hospital where she had him committed. After discovering that Wendy made no attempt to save Ben, Ruth quits working for the Byrdes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Also enraged by this discovery is poor, young Jonah. After fitting the puzzle pieces together, the kid has realized the darkness behind his parents. Adding to the list of issues for season 4 is the mysterious and perceptive FBI agent Maya Miller (Jessica Frances Dukes), who the Byrdes promised to have under control.

Meanwhile, new additions include Jani Zhao, Indya Moore, and Vincent Regan. Zhao's part is the character created specifically for the movie – someone named Stingray. We don't know if Stingray is friend or foe just yet, but the name sounds ominous enough that I'm inclined to think this is a new villain.

Park is reprising his role as Dr. Stephen Shin, who briefly appeared in the first film. During a post-credit scene, we saw Shin had joined forces with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Zhao will be playing Stingray, a character created specifically for the film. Moore is playing DC character Karshon, who in the <a href=\"https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Karshon_(New_Earth)\">comics</a> is \"a freak result of a radioactive explosion that evolved a regular tiger shark into a super-humanoid with a highly developed brain while retaining his ruthless predatory instincts.\" Yes, that's right: it looks like we're getting yet another walking, talking shark-person to follow in the footsteps (finsteps?) of King Shark from \"The Suicide Squad.\" And Regan will play \"Atlan, the ancient ruler of Atlantis who caused the city to sink into the sea.\" Atlan appeared briefly in flashbacks in the first film, where the character was played by Graham McTavish.</p><h2>Aquaman 2</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-expands-cast-and-adds-mysterious-new-character-stingray/aquaman-2-1632754207.jpg\" /><p>\"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\" hails from director James Wan, who helmed the first movie. While we don't have many plot details just yet, we know that Jason Momoa is back Arthur Curry AKA Aquaman, Amber Heard returns as Mera, and Patrick Wilson is once again playing the Ocean Master. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is back as well, playing villain Black Manta. I know not everyone agrees with me on this, but I firmly believe \"Aquaman\" is the best DCEU movie. It's big, it's colorful, it's silly – and it's fun. There was a moment where an octopus played the drums! How can you not love that? Look for \"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom\" in theaters on December 16, 2022. </p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/581632/aquaman-2-title-aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom/\">'Aquaman' Sequel Titled 'Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom' – Here's What That Could Mean</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/616152/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-expands-cast-and-adds-mysterious-new-character-stingray/\">Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom Expands Cast And Adds Mysterious New Character Stingray</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74vrV1dZZig:sHGRGh63rac:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74vrV1dZZig:sHGRGh63rac:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74vrV1dZZig:sHGRGh63rac:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74vrV1dZZig:sHGRGh63rac:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74vrV1dZZig:sHGRGh63rac:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74vrV1dZZig:sHGRGh63rac:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/74vrV1dZZig\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:56:09 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-expands-cast-and-adds-mysterious-new-character-stingray/intro-1632752657.jpg","linkMd5":"f8d313ea1375aad9d8052efdd7e17dc4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn16@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-24-384_44a817c29a269321.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":132330,"destBytes":52366,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-expands-cast-and-adds-mysterious-new-character-stingray/intro-1632752657.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn16@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-24-384_44a817c29a269321.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-expands-cast-and-adds-mysterious-new-character-stingray/new-and-returning-characters-1632754207.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn36@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-29-259_c590f94e5ffc556e.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-expands-cast-and-adds-mysterious-new-character-stingray/aquaman-2-1632754207.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn55@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-29-597_04174f4370330798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn61@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-33-580_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74vrV1dZZig:sHGRGh63rac:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn20@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-29-234_c50606c787971d6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-29-655_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74vrV1dZZig:sHGRGh63rac:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-33-380_036d87c1735ca822.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/74vrV1dZZig":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn3@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-29-171_0fba31e9955e2611.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761709735},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","title":"Bridgerton Season 2 Clip: How About Some More Period Romance?","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/616360/bridgerton-season-2-clip-how-about-some-more-period-romance/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/bridgerton-season-2-clip-how-about-some-more-period-romance/intro-1632759810.jpg\" /><p>Netflix packed a lot into its Tudum event over the weekend, and \"Bridgerton\" fans weren't left wanting. The streaming platform released a clip from the highly anticipated second season of the Shondaland show, where we see the eldest Bridgerton, Anthony (Jonathan Bailey), get dressed down by the witty Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley).</p><p>We already knew that season 2 of \"Bridgerton\" would focus on Anthony's travails in love now that Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) and Simon Basset (Regé-Jean Page) are happily wed. This clip makes it all-but-certain that Kate will be the one to become romantically entangled with Anthony, though it's clear she won't be won over by him so easily.</p><p>See for yourself how handily Kate dresses down Anthony, who appears to still hold his boorish views about what a wife should be.</p><h2>Bridgerton Season 2 Clip</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YX7j0TjkxPE\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>Ouch! Kate didn't hold back in what she thinks about the Bridgeton Viscount. Anthony, however, seems smitten, and I'm sure things will smolder between them as the season unfolds. We'll be seeing a lot of Anthony, and perhaps none of Phoebe and Simon, as the series will focus on one Bridgerton sibling per season. Season 2 is Anthony's year, so we'll be seeing him in a variety of romantic exploits as the episodes unfurl.</p><p>Need a refresher on the premise of the show? Here's the official synopsis:</p><blockquote><em>Based on Julia Quinn's best-selling series of novels, \"Bridgerton\", is set in the sexy, lavish and </em><em>competitive world of Regency London high society. From the glittering ballrooms of Mayfair to the aristocratic palaces of Park Lane and beyond, the series unveils a seductive, sumptuous world replete with intricate rules and dramatic power struggles, where no one is truly ever on steady ground. At the heart of the show is the powerful Bridgerton family. Comprised of eight close-knit siblings, this funny, witty, daring and clever group must navigate the upper ten thousand's marriage mart in search of romance, adventure and love.</em></blockquote><p>Season 2 also includes some new cast members. In addition to <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/579411/bridgerton-season-2-cast-simone-ashley/\">Ashley taking on the role of Kate Sharma</a>, Charithra Chandran (\"Alex Rider\") will play her sister Edwina, who wants nothing but a true love match. Shelley Conn (\"Liar\") will play Kate's mother, Mary, and Earl's daughter, who married a tradesman and had to face the \"scandal\" that came with it. Calam Lynch is also in season 2 playing Theo Sharpe, and Rupert Young (\"Dear Evan Hansen\") will play Jack, an enigmatic character who apparently has a connection to one of its most notable families.</p><p>Season 2 of \"Bridgerton\" is set to premiere some time in 2022.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/580472/bridgerton-season-3-and-4-ordered-by-netflix/\">'Bridgerton' Season 3 And 4 Ordered By Netflix, Which Knows A Cultural Phenomenon When It Sees One</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/616360/bridgerton-season-2-clip-how-about-some-more-period-romance/\">Bridgerton Season 2 Clip: How About Some More Period Romance?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bkf-vt7vsW0:843ZFPE-T2Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bkf-vt7vsW0:843ZFPE-T2Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bkf-vt7vsW0:843ZFPE-T2Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bkf-vt7vsW0:843ZFPE-T2Q:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=bkf-vt7vsW0:843ZFPE-T2Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bkf-vt7vsW0:843ZFPE-T2Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/bkf-vt7vsW0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:28:48 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/bridgerton-season-2-clip-how-about-some-more-period-romance/intro-1632759810.jpg","linkMd5":"ab23cbfba05f16358ae3a69ceb66ea8c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn18@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-26-016_08769015b1de963b.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":177860,"destBytes":69342,"author":"Vanessa Armstrong","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/bridgerton-season-2-clip-how-about-some-more-period-romance/intro-1632759810.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn18@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-26-016_08769015b1de963b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn61@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-33-580_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bkf-vt7vsW0:843ZFPE-T2Q:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-34-688_66055937e1aed271.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-29-655_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=bkf-vt7vsW0:843ZFPE-T2Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn48@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-30-266_81402edec7612cee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/bkf-vt7vsW0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn60@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-29-204_120b32150f3d8243.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761709735},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","title":"Don't Look Up Clip: Meryl Streep Puts A Positive Spin On The End Of The World","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/616242/dont-look-up-clip-meryl-streep-puts-a-positive-spin-on-the-end-of-the-world/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dont-look-up-clip-meryl-streep-puts-a-positive-spin-on-the-end-of-the-world/intro-1632756890.jpg\" /><p>Netflix released the first teaser trailer for \"Don't Look Up\" <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/598040/dont-look-up-trailer-leonardo-dicaprio-and-jennifer-lawrence-try-to-warn-us-about-the-end-of-the-world/\">just a couple weeks ago</a>, but thanks to their recent Tudum hype event for upcoming movies and TV shows, we have a new clip from the apocalyptic satire about a comet that is on a collision course with Earth. Just as we saw in the trailer, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence are scientists trying to warn the government, led by Meryl Streep as the President of the United States, about this forthcoming disaster. This new clip plays out the scene a little longer as the President and her Chief of Staff (Jonah Hill) try to downplay the severity of this upcoming tragedy, despite the statistical certainty of it actually happening. </p><h2>Don't Look Up Clip</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Op_v2PHDn-0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>Even though DiCaprio and Lawrence exhaustingly try to explain just how serious this situation is, with a 99.78% chance of this comet actually hitting Earth, President Orlean and her Chief of Staff (who also happens to be her son) try to put a positive spin on the numbers. If this is how the government reacts when they have six months before the comet hits Earth, just imagine how much worse things are going to get as the comet gets closer. </p><p>Director Adam McKay leaned into satire a bit with his Oscar-nominated biopic about former Vice President Dick Cheney, but here he's going full tilt. This has the tone of \"Veep\"  mixed with \"Dr. Strangelove,\" and it's clear that McKay isn't going to be subtle about his commentary on how the government and the 24-hour news cycle deals with disasters. However, can mocking the system last for the length of a feature film without becoming exhausting, like a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch that goes on for too long? Perhaps that's the point, because dealing with all of this in real life every single day is truly life-draining. </p><p>\"Don't Look Up\" has an all-star cast that also includes Mark Rylance (\"The Trial of the Chicago 7\"), Tyler Perry (\"Gone Girl\"), Ron Perlman (\"Hellboy\"), Timothée Chalamet (\"Dune\"), Cate Blanchett (\"Carol\"), Matthew Perry (\"Friends\"), Chris Evans (\"Knives Out\"), Melanie Lynskey (\"They Came Together\"), Michael Chiklis (\"The Shield\"), Himesh Patel (\"Yesterday\"), recording artist Ariana Grande, and many more.</p><p>Here's the official synopsis for \"Don't Look Up,\" coming to Netflix on December 24, 2021:</p><blockquote>Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence), an astronomy grad student, and her professor Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) make an astounding discovery of a comet orbiting within the solar system. The problem — it's on a direct collision course with Earth. The other problem? No one really seems to care. Turns out warning mankind about a planet-killer the size of Mount Everest is an inconvenient fact to navigate. With the help of Dr. Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan), Kate and Randall embark on a media tour that takes them from the office of an indifferent President Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her sycophantic son and Chief of Staff, Jason (Jonah Hill), to the airwaves of The Daily Rip, an upbeat morning show hosted by Brie (Cate Blanchett) and Jack (Tyler Perry). With only six months until the comet makes impact, managing the 24-hour news cycle and gaining the attention of the social media obsessed public before it's too late proves shockingly comical — what will it take to get the world to just look up?!</blockquote><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/598040/dont-look-up-trailer-leonardo-dicaprio-and-jennifer-lawrence-try-to-warn-us-about-the-end-of-the-world/\">Don't Look Up Trailer: Leonardo DiCaprio And Jennifer Lawrence Try To Warn Us About The End Of The World</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/616242/dont-look-up-clip-meryl-streep-puts-a-positive-spin-on-the-end-of-the-world/\">Don't Look Up Clip: Meryl Streep Puts A Positive Spin On The End Of The World</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=e9epBxKWVww:AAjFAfk5WHo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=e9epBxKWVww:AAjFAfk5WHo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=e9epBxKWVww:AAjFAfk5WHo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=e9epBxKWVww:AAjFAfk5WHo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=e9epBxKWVww:AAjFAfk5WHo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=e9epBxKWVww:AAjFAfk5WHo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/e9epBxKWVww\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:40:27 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dont-look-up-clip-meryl-streep-puts-a-positive-spin-on-the-end-of-the-world/intro-1632756890.jpg","linkMd5":"953d7932f800bb1f47b0e1e8c83053d2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-11-075_d6d9052c74a8b9fe.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":98916,"destBytes":22140,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dont-look-up-clip-meryl-streep-puts-a-positive-spin-on-the-end-of-the-world/intro-1632756890.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-11-075_d6d9052c74a8b9fe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn61@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-33-580_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=e9epBxKWVww:AAjFAfk5WHo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn7@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-29-695_83739700c37b0e1f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-29-655_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=e9epBxKWVww:AAjFAfk5WHo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn23@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-29-243_26ef3488b2e0e90b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/e9epBxKWVww":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn92@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-29-144_e0312b734ce8bab7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761709735},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","title":"Paul Thomas Anderson's Licorice Pizza Gets Its First Official Poster","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/616334/paul-thomas-andersons-licorice-pizza-gets-its-first-official-poster/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/paul-thomas-andersons-licorice-pizza-gets-its-first-official-poster/intro-1632759394.jpg\" /><p>Paul Thomas Anderson's ninth film, \"Licorice Pizza,\" now has <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/605544/licorice-pizza-trailer-director-paul-thomas-anderson-returns-to-the-1970s/\">a trailer</a> and a poster. The movie follows a high school student <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/580605/new-paul-thomas-anderson-movie-release-date/\">trying to become an actor</a> in California in the 1970s and stars Bradley Cooper, Benny Safdie, Alana Haim (of the band Haim), and Cooper Hoffman (Yes, the son of the late, brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman, who frequently collaborated with Anderson).</p><h2>A Poster That's Pure '70s Nostalgia</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/uploads/embed/embed-6151e4f5336bb.jpg\" width=\"538\" height=\"190\" /><p>It's great to see Anderson working in the 1970s again. Many of us discovered him through \"Boogie Nights,\" so the vibe of \"Licorice Pizza\" feels like a homecoming. The title \"Licorice Pizza\" is a reference to a now-defunct chain of record stores in Southern California. They took their name from a joke about unsuccessful records being sold as licorice pizza.</p><p>The trailer and poster set Hoffman and Haim as the leads in this romantic-looking coming-of-age drama. In the trailer, they flirt, they argue, and they seem to be close. The poster shows Hoffman leaning against a car, looking at Haim with a smile on his face. She's got her hands on her hips and her shirt reads \"You've come a long way, baby,\" making her look like the ultimate '70s cool girl.</p><h2>What Is Licorice Pizza About?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/paul-thomas-andersons-licorice-pizza-gets-its-first-official-poster/what-is-licorice-pizza-about-1632759394.jpg\" /><p>While there isn't a detailed synopsis for \"Licorice Pizza\" yet, maybe we don't really need one. Anderson's movies tend to be more experiences than direct storytelling, and traditional loglines can never really do them justice anyway. What we <em>can </em>tell is that Haim and Hoffman's characters have a special relationship, and their time together will shape the rest of their lives. The movie should be a delicious hit of nostalgia for everyone who grew up in the 1970s, and should give the rest of us a little taste of a different time. </p><p>Anderson's direction is always stellar, and he works with some of the best actors in the business. Safdie and Cooper are both filmmakers in their own right: Cooper directed \"A Star is Born,\" while Safdie is one half of the renowned Safdie Brothers (\"Good Time,\" \"Uncut Gems\"). Hoffman's son looks quite a bit like him and likely has some of his father's incredible acting talent, and we all know Haim can sing at the very least. If she acts as well as she sings... Well, this could be a total home-run for Anderson and everyone involved.</p><p>\"Licorice Pizza\" is set to hit theaters on November 26, 2021. </p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/589412/the-11-greatest-paul-thomas-anderson-scenes/\">The 11 Greatest Paul Thomas Anderson Scenes</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/616334/paul-thomas-andersons-licorice-pizza-gets-its-first-official-poster/\">Paul Thomas Anderson's Licorice Pizza Gets Its First Official Poster</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fqk_hg33WiY:W9w5MndZpjs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fqk_hg33WiY:W9w5MndZpjs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fqk_hg33WiY:W9w5MndZpjs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fqk_hg33WiY:W9w5MndZpjs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fqk_hg33WiY:W9w5MndZpjs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fqk_hg33WiY:W9w5MndZpjs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fqk_hg33WiY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:22:07 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/paul-thomas-andersons-licorice-pizza-gets-its-first-official-poster/intro-1632759394.jpg","linkMd5":"0f3db272b37620e4c1cdd27543fae07a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn11@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-10-020_83ed0bc25b5a37e7.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":101982,"destBytes":38368,"author":"Danielle Ryan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/paul-thomas-andersons-licorice-pizza-gets-its-first-official-poster/intro-1632759394.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn11@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-10-020_83ed0bc25b5a37e7.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/uploads/embed/embed-6151e4f5336bb.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn88@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-29-298_60b81afdbf5de95c.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/paul-thomas-andersons-licorice-pizza-gets-its-first-official-poster/what-is-licorice-pizza-about-1632759394.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn38@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-35-704_8941a68decc886f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn61@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-33-580_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fqk_hg33WiY:W9w5MndZpjs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn12@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-29-724_8c929d26bc398b29.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-29-655_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fqk_hg33WiY:W9w5MndZpjs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn95@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-29-252_9756b02a6491476b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fqk_hg33WiY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn51@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-34-282_f4e6a16083abb25c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761709735},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","title":"William Shatner To Be Shot Into Space (Don't Worry, He's Coming Back)","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/616319/william-shatner-to-be-shot-into-space-dont-worry-hes-coming-back/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/william-shatner-to-be-shot-into-space-dont-worry-hes-coming-back/intro-1632758897.jpg\" /><p>William Shatner: actor, pop culture icon, and part-time Thanksgiving spokesperson <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cLOgwRkRVl8\">warning of the pervasive dangers of turkey fryers</a>.

Next month, Shatner is reportedly set to catch a ride with billionaire and private sector space explorer Jeff Bezos, becoming the oldest person to ever reach orbit in a demonstration of Bezos' flight capabilities -- and a celebration of both Shatner and the lasting influence of Gene Roddenberry's vision of \"Star Trek.\"</p><h2>Shatner In Space</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/william-shatner-to-be-shot-into-space-dont-worry-hes-coming-back/shatner-in-space-1632758897.jpg\" /><p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/608767/russia-wins-the-movie-space-race-will-make-first-film-shot-off-planet/\">Tom Cruise and the Russian film industry</a> aren't the only ones getting a chance to blast off into space these days.</p><p>With NASA increasingly looking towards privately-funded businesses for assistance in getting astronauts and equipment into orbit, yet another space race of sorts has rapidly begun to brew between billionaire entrepreneurs such as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Richard Branson. While Musk's SpaceX company has far outpaced its rivals in terms of gaining lucrative government contracts and providing test-proven, reusable rockets for NASA's repeated use, and Branson is more focused on prestigious commercial flights, Bezos' Blue Origin has been trying to close the gap by making short suborbital flights (<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/historic-virgin-galactic-flight-reminds-us-that-space-1831084081\">there are debates</a> on whether these trips truly constitute reaching the limits of \"space\" or not) and bringing wealthy guests along for the ride.</p><p>The latest visitor will be none other than William Shatner, according to TMZ (<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/william-shatner-90-set-to-fly-into-space-with-jeff-bezos-blue-origin?ref=scroll\">via the Daily Beast</a>). Lasting only around 15 minutes, the flight will reportedly be the focus of a documentary special that Shatner and his people have been shopping around to various platforms, such as Discovery. This won't be the first flight for this particular rocket, as it recently <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/the-dickhead-has-landed-1847326120\">brought Bezos himself to the boundaries of space</a> in July of this year. No price tag has been revealed just yet, as the highly in-demand tickets for seats on these exclusive flights have regularly reached into the range of tens of millions of dollars. The crew who will be flying with the actor is also currently unknown, although it is tempting to imagine Shatner channeling his inner Captain James T. Kirk and barking orders at an overworked but distinctive collection of bridge crew members on the USS Enterprise. To whoever will be joining him: just make sure you don't try and do any mediocre impressions of him as Kirk. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xw-1C8DsufE\">Seriously, trust me on this</a>.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/606094/the-greatest-science-fiction-movies-of-the-21st-century/\">The 14 Greatest Science Fiction Movies Of The 21st Century</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/616319/william-shatner-to-be-shot-into-space-dont-worry-hes-coming-back/\">William Shatner To Be Shot Into Space (Don't Worry, He's Coming Back)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DbEjEUAfKxA:kuh7S5ZRw04:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DbEjEUAfKxA:kuh7S5ZRw04:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DbEjEUAfKxA:kuh7S5ZRw04:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DbEjEUAfKxA:kuh7S5ZRw04:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=DbEjEUAfKxA:kuh7S5ZRw04:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DbEjEUAfKxA:kuh7S5ZRw04:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DbEjEUAfKxA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:09:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/william-shatner-to-be-shot-into-space-dont-worry-hes-coming-back/intro-1632758897.jpg","linkMd5":"2091335892b248d4b05c8b7050543362","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn6@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-09-997_d2906deb21b55bf3.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":61351,"destBytes":23830,"author":"Jeremy Mathai","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/william-shatner-to-be-shot-into-space-dont-worry-hes-coming-back/intro-1632758897.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn6@2020_4/2021/09/27/16-55-09-997_d2906deb21b55bf3.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/william-shatner-to-be-shot-into-space-dont-worry-hes-coming-back/shatner-in-space-1632758897.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-29-158_225efcaa4cc5efaa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn61@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-33-580_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DbEjEUAfKxA:kuh7S5ZRw04:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn96@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-33-647_e77422320cef33cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-29-655_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=DbEjEUAfKxA:kuh7S5ZRw04:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn12@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-32-121_e14b5f0ef5880b70.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/DbEjEUAfKxA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn43@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-29-628_2a889f9568af06ce.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761709736},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","title":"Riddick 4 Is 'Closer Than You Think,' According To Vin Diesel","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/616256/riddick-4-is-closer-than-you-think-according-to-vin-diesel/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/riddick-4-is-closer-than-you-think-according-to-vin-diesel/intro-1632757466.jpg\" /><p>The Riddick franchise is a lot like its main character: rough around the edges, complex, hard to pin down and, most importantly, a survivor. Case in point, star Vin Diesel's recent <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CUOM00vMlzR/\">Instagram</a> post where he continues to bang the drum for a supposedly forthcoming new installment in the series after an already 8-year gap and counting:</p><blockquote>Incredible meeting today, thanks team you know who you are... Let's just say Furia maybe closer than you think. #Riddick</blockquote><p>After decent returns compared to a moderate budget on 2013's \"Riddick,\" not to mention strong home video sales, Universal began talks with Diesel and series director David Twohy in 2014 for a fourth go around, to be titled \"Riddick 4: Furya.\" Aiming for an R-rating like the first and third installments, \"Furya\" promises to take the title rogue on a trip down memory lane as he finally returns to his home planet alongside Katee Sackhoff's mercenary Dahl. A spin-off TV series titled \"Merc City\" is also in the works, but there's been little update beyond Diesel's little social media teases. </p><h2>A Furious History</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/riddick-4-is-closer-than-you-think-according-to-vin-diesel/a-furious-history-1632757466.jpg\" /><p>The first Riddick film, \"Pitch Black,\" proved a sleeper hit in 2000, and along with \"The Fast and the Furious\" helped propel Diesel to stardom. But something about the character's \"man without a country\" backstory appealed to Diesel, and he and Twohy conspired to turn Riddick's journey into a sci-fi epic in the same mythologically rich vein as \"Lord of the Rings,\" with \"Pitch Black\" as its mere \"The Hobbit\"-esque appetizer. They mapped out a trilogy of expensive sequels starting with the $100-million-plus budgeted 2004 flick \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" and its animated counterpart \"The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury.\" Unfortunately, rich world-building did not a franchise make, and the bloated PG-13 film inexplicably co-starring Judi Dench sank at the box office. </p><p>But Diesel and Twohy were undeterred, and rather than giving up on their plans for more movies, they devised to take a back-to-basics approach to the third film \"Riddick,\" a scrappier monster-vs-ensemble movie more in the \"Pitch Black\" vein but with some of the vaster threads of \"Chronicles\" continued, including Karl Urban's Necromonger Vaako. With a modest $38 million budget, \"Riddick\" is barely-contained ambition that nearly didn't make it through production, with crews complaining of missing paychecks, the filmmakers <a href=\"https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/chronicles-riddick-sequel-beats-budget-problems.html\">getting locked out of their studio</a>, and Diesel having to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/vin-diesel-risked-all-riddick-617586/\">leverage his own house</a> to see it completed.</p><p>Having visited the set of \"Riddick\" while it lensed in Montreal in 2012, I can personally attest that Diesel is intensely passionate about this franchise. He even got a happy glint in his eye when I pointed out a crown on his Necromonger uniform (barely visible in the film) was the same one that Linus Roache's secret Furyan named Purifier in \"Chronicles\" had worn. Diesel had insisted on that detail himself, over Twohy's protest, and it's that kind of passion that makes me believe that a fourth film will happen, even if Vin has to climb a jagged cliff with a knife between his teeth to do it.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/614656/awesome-sci-fi-movies-that-never-got-sequels/\">12 Awesome Sci-Fi Movies That Never Got Sequels</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/616256/riddick-4-is-closer-than-you-think-according-to-vin-diesel/\">Riddick 4 is 'Closer Than You Think,' According to Vin Diesel</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZPDInypHW9U:_UAtIH5zxD0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZPDInypHW9U:_UAtIH5zxD0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZPDInypHW9U:_UAtIH5zxD0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZPDInypHW9U:_UAtIH5zxD0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ZPDInypHW9U:_UAtIH5zxD0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZPDInypHW9U:_UAtIH5zxD0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ZPDInypHW9U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:46:24 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/riddick-4-is-closer-than-you-think-according-to-vin-diesel/intro-1632757466.jpg","linkMd5":"25652b34bb9c48f4d148d174411f0295","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn25@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-24-197_d446d966436501ee.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":81410,"destBytes":32984,"author":"Max Evry","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/riddick-4-is-closer-than-you-think-according-to-vin-diesel/intro-1632757466.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn25@2020_3/2021/09/27/16-55-24-197_d446d966436501ee.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/riddick-4-is-closer-than-you-think-according-to-vin-diesel/a-furious-history-1632757466.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn58@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-29-331_4845d06855c34511.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn61@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-33-580_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZPDInypHW9U:_UAtIH5zxD0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_2/2021/09/27/16-55-31-366_1f2996106c29e59b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_5/2021/09/27/16-55-29-655_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ZPDInypHW9U:_UAtIH5zxD0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn48@2020_1/2021/09/27/16-55-29-350_47957609ee138d30.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ZPDInypHW9U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn76@2020_6/2021/09/27/16-55-35-616_a193592c5fc53b38.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1632761709735},{"createdTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","updatedTime":"2021-09-28 00:55:09","title":"George Clooney And Brad Pitt To Reunite In New Film For Spider-Man Director Jon Watts","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/616153/george-clooney-and-brad-pitt-to-reunite-in-new-film-for-spider-man-director-jon-watts/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/george-clooney-and-brad-pitt-to-reunite-in-new-film-for-spider-man-director-jon-watts/intro-1632754295.jpg\" /><p>Always vote with your wallet, folks. In recent years, mainstream moviegoing audiences have seemed to indicate a general preference for consistent and reliable franchises over the appeal of genuine movie stars who used to be able to put butts in seats with their names alone. However, that's not stopping studios from trying to get their hands on the latest project featuring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, who will be reuniting on-screen for the first time since 2007. Director Jon Watts, who has gained prominence through the MCU \"Spider-Man\" movies, will helm this new movie that has reportedly become the epicenter of an intense bidding war. Maybe there's still a hint of Old Hollywood within the current industry, after all!</p><h2>High Watt-Age</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/george-clooney-and-brad-pitt-to-reunite-in-new-film-for-spider-man-director-jon-watts/high-watt-age-1632754295.jpg\" /><p>The early 2000s don't seem <em>that</em> long ago, but the days when an excellent \"Ocean's Eleven\" remake could launch a trilogy of movies that gained box office success on the strength of its star-studded cast alone just might be over -- even if the pandemic hadn't hit and completely upended moviegoing habits even further. That's why this latest news feels like such an unexpected throwback. According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/george-clooney-brad-pitt-jon-watts-movie-package-sends-studios-streamers-bidding-war-1235020609/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, no less a group of hopefuls than Sony, Lionsgate, Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Annapurna, Universal, MGM, and Warner Bros. are among the studios (and streamers) attempting to outbid each other for the rights to distribute this buzzy new film.</p><p>Starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt and directed by \"Spider-Man: Homecoming,\" \"Far From Home,\" and \"No Way Home\" filmmaker Jon Watts, little else is known about the plot of the movie other than the report describing it as following \"two lone wolf fixers assigned to the same job.\" That description immediately calls to mind another Clooney-starring vehicle in \"Michael Clayton,\" which similarly focused on Clooney as a \"fixer\" for wealthy and high-profile clients. While that must-watch 2007 film was written and directed by Tony Gilroy, Watts is the perhaps surprising choice to write, direct, and produce this new original movie. Watts' early film \"Cop Car\" certainly showed promise, impressing Sony and Marvel enough to hand over the reins for their crown jewel Spider-Man series, but it's also fair to say that Watts' strengths as a storyteller were somewhat hampered by the constrictions of blockbuster filmmaking on such a large scale.</p><p>Watts' next project will be \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" and he also has Marvel's \"Fantastic Four\" reboot on his busy schedule, so it remains to be seen when exactly he'll be able to tackle this project as well. Suffice to say, however, I might be looking forward to this one far more than any of his superhero movie projects.
