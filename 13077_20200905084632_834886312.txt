[Watch]","link":"https://bloody-disgusting.com/?p=3628700","description":"<p>Hello out there all you loyal viewers!</p>\n<p>We hope everyone is doing well and performing their civic duties in every form and fashion. Today we have a couple shorts that embody both the approaching Halloween season and the isolation of the past six months in various forms. I like to think these couple of creature features are manifestations of all of our fears in 2020, lurking in the shadows, just waiting for the right time to pounce.</p>\n<p>The first one up is called <em><strong>The House on the Lake</strong></em>, coming from director <strong>Damien Kazan</strong>. Here, we have a story of a young woman at home alone in a seemingly isolated woodland area right on the lake. What could possibly go wrong? I&#8217;ll tell you what can go wrong. While going to the bathroom you start hearing strange knocks on the door, at your most vulnerable state. I love the tension building in this very simple &#8220;go check on the strange noises&#8221; horror trope.  We&#8217;ve seen it a million times before. However, sometimes it&#8217;s about how you do it, rather than what you did. The lighting and camera setups do a great job of telling the story in this one.</p>\n<p>The second short we have for you this month comes from director <strong>Timothy Troy</strong>, entitled <em><strong>Ding Dong</strong></em>. No, it&#8217;s not what you think&#8230;the popular chocolatey, cream-filled treat some of us spent time stuffing down our gullets during quarantine. I&#8217;m talking about the sound a doorbell makes when we&#8217;re all alone in our house trying to get into bed, scaring us half to death. That&#8217;s exactly what happens in this vignette. Poor Alexis just wants to get some damn sleep, but that just isn&#8217;t possible with someone ringing your doorbell every two minutes. Is it just the neighborhood kids screwing around? Or is it something far more sinister? I guess you&#8217;ll have to watch and find out.</p>\n<p>Stay safe out there, folks. Fall is approaching and it&#8217;s our time to shine. So get out your pumpkin-scented candles and big sweaters and cozy up to a good horror movie. We&#8217;ll do our part and offer up some appetizing options.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Dominick DeLuca</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='740' height='417' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/R89NW7CetHs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bloody-disgusting.com/wod\">World of Death</a> is the web series that fans of independent horror have been waiting for.

Fans of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cherry Falls</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will have spotted the movie on a two-for-one DVD. However, this dark comedy has slipped through the cracks and isn&#8217;t easy to come by. John Ritter plays a desperate real estate agent hoping to make a sale, or else more than his job will be at stake. Unfortunately, he&#8217;s done in by his own misguided strategy of showing his clients murder houses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of the final story &#8220;Come to Granny,&#8221; no one was technically killed in the Goodwins&#8217; home. Still, the owners have since moved on because of a local spate of deaths that involved their son. This suburban slasher was likely inspired by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eyes of Laura Mars</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seeing as the teen protagonist shares an unexplained psychic link with a serial killer nicknamed the Granny Killer. All in all, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terror Tract</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an entertaining look at disturbia.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><b><i>From a Whisper to a Scream</i></b><b> (1987) — &#8220;Stanley&#8221;</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3630555\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3630549/30-standout-segments-underseen-horror-anthology-movies/attachment/from-a-whisper-to-a-scream-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream.jpg?fit=1200%2C600&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream.jpg?fit=300%2C150&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream.jpg?fit=740%2C370&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3630555\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream.jpg?resize=740%2C370&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream.jpg?resize=300%2C150&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-a-Whisper-to-a-Scream.jpg?resize=768%2C384&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Offspring</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a Whisper to a Scream</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> boasts a distinguished cast that includes Vincent Price, Susan Tyrrell, and Cameron Mitchell.

One of their film&#8217;s highlights, &#8220;Dash Away All&#8221; centers around a father and husband whose last-minute Christmas shopping lands him in a life-or-death situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The story&#8217;s mythos is intriguing, and the main character is sympathetic.

Mattotti, who is known for his renowned color work and enigmatic designs, draws us in with breathing scenery and imaged disquietude.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><b><i>Nightmares</i></b><b> (1983) — &#8220;Terror in Topanga&#8221;</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nightmares.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3630563\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3630549/30-standout-segments-underseen-horror-anthology-movies/attachment/nightmares-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nightmares.jpg?fit=1200%2C600&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Nightmares\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nightmares.jpg?fit=300%2C150&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nightmares.jpg?fit=740%2C370&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3630563\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nightmares.jpg?resize=740%2C370&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nightmares.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nightmares.jpg?resize=300%2C150&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nightmares.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nightmares.jpg?resize=768%2C384&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The four stories presented here were intended to be part of an unnamed pilot for NBC before they became </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightmares</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Self-contained stories in any given anthology is comparatively easy, whereas a movie like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fantastic Theater</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has to tread carefully. What&#8217;s even more difficult is having multiple directors in charge — there&#8217;s always the risk of clashing styles and voices. The three directors in this South Korean film, on the other hand, do a commendable job of keeping everything coherent from a narrative standpoint.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fantastic Theater </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(also known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short!

Unfortunately, the prescription she takes home is for a werewolf, and he&#8217;s decided to pay Granny a visit.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><b><i>The Illustrated Man: </i></b><b>(1969) — &#8220;The Veldt&#8221;</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Illustrated-Man.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3630583\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3630549/30-standout-segments-underseen-horror-anthology-movies/attachment/illustrated-man/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Illustrated-Man.jpg?fit=1200%2C600&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Illustrated-Man\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Illustrated-Man.jpg?fit=300%2C150&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Illustrated-Man.jpg?fit=740%2C370&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3630583\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Illustrated-Man.jpg?resize=740%2C370&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Illustrated-Man.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Illustrated-Man.jpg?resize=300%2C150&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Illustrated-Man.jpg?resize=1024%2C512&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Illustrated-Man.jpg?resize=768%2C384&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ray Bradbury&#8217;s book of the same name is the basis for this divisive adaptation.

Known for his detailed and macabre illustrations, Umezu is also adept at emphasizing raw human emotions in the presence of horror.  His ability to capture freeze frames of intense inwardness — those deep, heightened feelings that surface upon seeing something so unspeakable — is nothing short of brilliant.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Curse of Kazuo Umezu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a straight-to-video anthology featuring two standalone stories. Although each one is positively crude-looking by today&#8217;s standards, the artwork has a lot of character to it. &#8220;What Will the Video Camera Reveal&#8221; includes a vampiric, tentacle-faced demon, and &#8220;The Haunted Mansion&#8221; has four girls exploring a sinister old house. Neither short will disappoint fans of anime horror, but the timeless appeal of the second tale is hard to resist.</span></p>\n<img

PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Switch versions of <em>DOOM Eternal</em> are also planned for release.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Unbelievably happy to announce that I am indeed working on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DOOM?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DOOM</a> Eternal, The Ancient Gods DLC music with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLevyMusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DavidLevyMusic</a> !<br />\nBuckle up! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>Trailer:<a href=\"https://t.co/dOVucf9D4d\">https://t.co/dOVucf9D4d</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RtK1UMdlNk\">pic.twitter.com/RtK1UMdlNk</a></p>\n<p>— Andrew Hulshult (@AndrewHulshult) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewHulshult/status/1301544395729186818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/B5_FCNS-PwY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 20:50:06 +0000","feedId":13077,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png","linkMd5":"cc9daa19a4ca81fab8ab3a6217603fa9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-45-26-015_818413be4c4fbce7.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":620,"destBytes":1362,"author":"Mike Wilson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-45-26-015_818413be4c4fbce7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/B5_FCNS-PwY":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295525717},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","title":"Rob Zombie’s ‘Halloween’ and ‘Halloween II’ Soundtracks Coming to Vinyl Via Waxwork Records","link":"https://bloody-disgusting.com/?p=3630391","description":"<p>For the first time ever, the original motion picture soundtracks for <strong>Rob Zombie</strong>&#8216;s<strong><em> Halloween</em></strong> and<strong><em> Halloween II</em> </strong>release on vinyl this Halloween season, via <strong>Waxwork Records</strong>!</p>\n<p>For <em>Halloween</em>, the deluxe double LP features score cues by composer Tyler Bates, select dialogue from the movie, and soundtrack songs including tracks by Alice Cooper, The Misfits, Blue Öyster Cult, Nazareth, Peter Frampton, Kiss, Iggy Pop, and more.

Peter had been struggling with depression for many years choosing to live a very private life. In the prime of his life, Peter was incredibly talented. Funny, clever, an accomplished musician (man, could he play the banjo), a wonderful actor and a brilliant comedian. His timing was impeccable and his ability to take an idea and turn it into an entertaining routine was his gift.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But Peter was more than that. He was kind and generous and supportive and would do anything for you,&#8221; Siegel continues. &#8220;He was tough too. He always stood up for what he believed in. He was a perfectionist and at times those moments were difficult to handle. But he was honest, protective and caring. I was fortunate to have worked side by side on stage (me on his left, he on my right in perfect harmony) with him for 16 years and even more fortunate to have been his friend for 38 years and learn what a true friendship can be. I will never forget the laughs we shared, the success we had and the tears we cried together. From now and for the rest of my life whenever I look to my right I will see my friend, my brother, my partner enjoying the hell out of life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Siegel adds, &#8220;<strong>If you or someone you know is suffering from depression please, please, please don&#8217;t be afraid or embarrassed to talk to someone. If you live in the UK please call the suicide prevention hotline 116 123.

Pete will forever be in our hearts and his memory will live on. Our condolences to his family and brother in life, Michael Siegel. Depression is real and a serious illness. If you suffer from depression, don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out and ask for help.

didn&#8217;t take long. <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3627952/lovecraftian-digital-board-game-october-night-games-turns-kickstarter-will-arrive-steam-october-15/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Announced two weeks ago</a>, October Night Games&#8217; digital board game of the same name has met its Kickstarter funding goal of €5,000. Every little bit helps, as they say, and there are still <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/octobernightgames/october-night-games/posts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plenty of stretch goals to hit.</a></p>\n<p>On top of that, the devs have revealed a new demo that <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1334580/October_Night_Games/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you can download today</a>. The demo will offers up a unique mode in the Dream Quest: </p>\n<p>You summon Nyarlathotep to pass a trial for the Great Game. As a result, the Crawling Chaos plunges you into a dream indistinguishable from reality, where you find yourself in a small town with five other players. As in the base game, you search for ingredients and perform rituals. However, in Dream Quest mode, you only have 15 nights until the moon dies. During this time, you need to figure out who is in your team and who is in the enemy team. Only by choosing the right allies, you can prove yourself worthy to participate in the Halloween full moon ritual and wake up.</p>\n<p>Unlike the base game, you&#8217;ll only have access to three characters (The Werewolf, The Mad Monk, and Madame Mandilip with her dolls) and three familiars (the guide dog, the pathfinder cat, and the wise owl). The devs are planning updates for the demo, so stay tuned for that.</p>\n<p><em>October Night Games</em> is scheduled for an October 15th release on Steam.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/jCj4iTSlFbE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 13:32:04 +0000","feedId":13077,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5fde347607439414493441f6fc0fa418","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mike Wilson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/jCj4iTSlFbE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn49@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-45-59-258_60d80c5a4e42db37.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295525722},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","title":"LEGO and Universal Monsters Join Forces for Black & White Frankenstein BrickHeadz Toy!","link":"https://bloody-disgusting.com/?p=3630524","description":"<p>For the first time ever, <strong>LEGO</strong> is headed into the world of the <strong>Universal Monsters</strong> with a <strong>Frankenstein</strong> BrickHeadz toy this Halloween season, previewed by <a href=\"https://www.brothers-brick.com/2020/09/01/lego-reveals-new-universal-monsters-license-with-brickheadz-40422-frankenstein-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Brothers Brick</a>.</p>\n<p>The 108-piece set depicts Frankenstein&#8217;s monster in all his black &#38; white glory, and it could be an indication that many more Universal Monsters LEGO products are on the way.</p>\n<p>The buildable toy, we assume, will be released this Halloween season.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brothers-brick.com/2020/09/01/lego-reveals-new-universal-monsters-license-with-brickheadz-40422-frankenstein-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Head over to The Brothers Brick to learn more and check out an image gallery.</a></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">LEGO reveals new Universal Monsters license with BrickHeadz 40422 Frankenstein [Review] <a href=\"https://t.co/7cQO9KJN1J\">https://t.co/7cQO9KJN1J</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/g9U9fCUK5o\">pic.twitter.com/g9U9fCUK5o</a></p>\n<p>— LEGO Darth Vader (@LegoDarthVader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LegoDarthVader/status/1300774437789331457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 1, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/FW09X17acco\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 14:37:04 +0000","feedId":13077,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6f43a299df1d2cf87013d38c75a785f8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"John Squires","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/FW09X17acco":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn9@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-45-57-909_a57a3dc08b1ddb4c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295525718},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","title":"Knife-Hand Chucky from ‘Child’s Play 2’ Joins Mezco’s Line of Talking Mega Scale Figures","link":"https://bloody-disgusting.com/?p=3630249","description":"<p>One of the best final acts in a horror franchise sequel can be found in <strong><em>Child&#8217;s Play 2</em></strong>, with Andy and Chucky battling it out in the Good Guys factory. Before being melted into a pile of Garbage Pail Kids-looking goo, Chucky first has his hand ripped clean off. Of course, being the crafty little monster that he is, he quickly finds a new hand in the form of a knife.</p>\n<p>Chucky&#8217;s knife-hand look from <em>Child&#8217;s Play 2</em> has been captured with a couple different toys in recent years, and the latest is an MDS Mega Scale talking figure from <strong>Mezco</strong>!</p>\n<p>Chucky is the first MDS Mega Scale figure to have an interchangeable appendage! His right hand can hold his butcher knife accessory or it can be swapped out for his infamous knife hand.</p>\n<p>The ‘Lakeshore Strangler’ features all-new head sculpt depicting a bloody-nosed, menacing expression after realizing his soul is forever trapped in the body of a doll. Depress the button discretely hidden on his back to hear Chucky speak a total of 7 phrases including &#8220;Alright kid, fun’s over” and “Can&#8217;t keep a good guy down”.</p>\n<p>Sporting his signature ‘Good Guys’ overalls and stripped shirt, Chucky features 11 points of articulation, his trademark orange hair, and realistic glass-like eyes.</p>\n<p>The MDS Mega Scale Talking Menacing Chucky stands 15” tall and comes packaged in a collector-friendly, film-inspired window box.</p>\n<p><a

On top of ushering the famous monsters of Universal’s horror heyday back into the public eye, resurrecting the likes of Frankenstein, Dracula and the Mummy in vivid color, the studio invited performers like Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Ingrid Pitt and so many more to step into the genre limelight. Spanning a library housing over 300 films, Hammer Studios is a key part of horror history that until recently has been far too difficult to track down.</i></p>\n<p><i>In late 2018, Shout Factory’s Scream Factory line began to focus on bringing Hammer’s titles to disc in the US, finally making many of the studio’s underseen gems available in packages that offered great visuals as well as insightful accompanying features. Over the course of this column, I will focus on these releases, gauging the films in context of the Hammer Studio story as well as analyzing the merits of the release. It’s time to highlight the power, impact and influence of Hammer Studios and ignite new conversation surrounding some forgotten classics.</i></p>\n<p>Welcome to the <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/tag/hammer-factory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Hammer Factory</strong></a>. This month we dissect <strong><em>The Plague of the Zombies</em></strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>The Context</b></p>\n<p>In the back half of 1965, Hammer Studios struck up a partnership with 20th Century Fox that would lead to financing for several of their key properties and secondary films. The pitch was to quickly and efficiently produce a series of double features with an assembly line approach, utilizing much of the same sets, props and crew, generating less expensive films without having to sacrifice the built in marketability of Hammer’s output.</p>\n<p>The first four properties in this deal were produced back to back and then split up into headlining A-style films and accompanying B-level titles. <i>Dracula: Prince of Darkness</i> (1966) and <i>Rasputin the Mad Monk</i> (1966) both starred Christopher Lee and were made as the primary features while <i>The Plague of the Zombies</i> (1966) and <i>The Reptile</i> (1966) were filmed together as the secondary pictures for their respective pairings. All were made at breakneck speed, often with less than one week in between production schedules, leading to months of grueling work for the cast and crew.</p>\n<p>While most of the advertising was allocated to the A-titles, the B-features offered an exciting sense of originality and discovery that something like <i>Dracula: Prince of Darkness </i>sacrificed in lieu of the familiar. Of particular note was <i>The Plague of the Zombies,</i> which dealt in creatures that had been deemed too gruesome to join Universal Studios’ roster of classic monsters several years prior. <strong>Anthony Hinds</strong> and<strong> Peter Bryan</strong>, originally behind the Universal pitch, instead brought the idea to Hammer. As longtime collaborators, the studio was more than willing to give this particular brand of “gruesome” a try, especially given that an American studio was footing the bill.</p>\n<p>The set was a somewhat contentious one, Hammer bringing on trusted director <strong>John Gilling</strong> who was known for his brashness, savage temper and adeptness with marrying the storytelling with the technical side of filmmaking. Somewhat notorious with the cast and crew, he was considered someone who would get the job done, on time and on budget. At the same time, respected actor <strong>André Morell</strong> was brought in to play the lead and wore his immediate and unforgiving distaste for his co-star <strong>Diane Clare</strong> on his sleeve throughout the whole of the production. There’s even some thought that when production wrapped, Morell himself was a factor in why all of Diane Clare’s dialogue was dubbed by <strong>Olive Gregg</strong> without the actress’ knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p>Ultimately the film delivered a frightening, gothic spin on the zombie mythos. With a class based sense of social commentary, it foreshadowed much of the stylistic shifts that would soon be occurring in the genre. Employing chilling effects, rich production design and a discordantly eerie score by <strong>James Bernard</strong>, the picture wowed audiences and created a lasting impression.</p>\n<p>A film which operated several years ahead of its time, <i>The Plague of the Zombies’ </i>influence is as present in the genre today as it was in the flesh-eating glut of films which would come in the wake of George A. Romero’s breakout masterpiece <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> (1968) just two years later. But unlike <i>The</i> <i>Plague of the Zombies</i>, <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> would go on to change the genre and, ironically, provide the first concrete hint that Hammer’s relevance in the marketplace just might have an expiration date.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>The Film</b></p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='740' height='417' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxjH83cVvUg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p><i>“Do you believe in life after death, Miss Forbes?”</i></p>\n<p>Men pound ritualistically on drums as two robed figures wearing druidic masks approach a candlelit altar. The score hammers discordantly while the men exchange a small totem, carved to look like a coffin, containing a doll crudely crafted out of clay. Concurrently, a woman awakens in her bed, somewhere far away from the dank cave of dark rites, terrified and bleeding from a wrapped wound on her wrist. Back in the cave, one of the men removes a bottle of what appears to be blood and pours it on the doll, ceremoniously observing his efforts with power and pride.</p>\n<p>Right from the start,<i> The Plague of the Zombies </i>offers a more modern approach to engaging its audience, allowing a glimpse at what might normally play as a late event in the second act. As it is, with its bombastic score and arresting imagery, the sequence unseats expectations and establishes a unique and earthy aesthetic that serves as a contrast to the gothic manors and rustic taverns one might be accustomed to in Hammer’s oeuvre.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that <i>Plague</i> has any shortage of manors or taverns. Far from it. The film absolutely abides by the tropes of its gothic horror lineage, it simply injects the proceedings with a healthy dose of West Indies Voodoo. As a result, the film offers a sense of seriousness and class that intermingles with a level of grotesquery and horror normally reserved for what might be perceived as a more crude production.</p>\n<p>The film follows Sir James Forbes and his daughter Sylvia (Morell and Clare, respectively) as they travel at the behest of Forbes’ former pupil Peter, played by <strong>Brook Williams</strong>, to a small Cornish village under siege by a mystifying plague. As the town’s physician, Peter is under scrutiny from the community and his own conscience, desperate to discover the source of and solution to the town’s fatalistic dilemma.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3630422\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3630407/plague-zombies-delivered-frightening-gothic-spin-zombie-mythos-hammer-factory/attachment/plague-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?fit=1363%2C699&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1363,699\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"plague 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?fit=300%2C154&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?fit=740%2C379&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3630422\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?resize=740%2C380&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"380\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?w=1363&#38;ssl=1 1363w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?resize=300%2C154&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?resize=1024%2C525&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?resize=768%2C394&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>Despite rumors of André Morell’s distaste for his onscreen daughter Diane Clare, the two exhibit a friendly dynamic that makes their interactions a joy to watch and provides authenticity to their relationship. A classically trained actor, Morell brings gravitas and intensity to the title role, carrying the narrative’s ideological transition from science to superstition with subtlety and impact.</p>\n<p>Although her lines were dubbed over, Diane Clare fares well in the role of curious daughter and concerned friend, although she is mostly relegated to the frightened and eventually brainwashed victim. Brook Williams’ Peter, on the other hand, is distracting to say the least. Requiring heavy emotional output and empathy, I am sad to report that Williams generates neither. Instead, he comes across as huffy and stilted, easily the picture’s weakest link.</p>\n<p>The story sets itself up as a multi-tiered whodunnit, pitting Morell’s Forbes’ scientifically driven mind against the inexplicable nature of disappearing bodies and sightings of corpses roaming the moors at night. Opposite Morell is <strong>John Carson</strong> as Squire Clive Hamilton, acting as the spiritual and financial leader of the village. Carson delivers an understated and yet authoritative masterclass in villainy, which is apparent from the very beginning, despite the protagonists’ ignorance. The film makes no qualms about informing the viewer of its villain’s true intent, presenting the in-story mystery as less of a twisty draw and more of a straight-forward narrative device.</p>\n<p>The frame is lush and beautifully photographed, aside from some rather poorly processed day-for-night sequences, and the effects are well realized. The film contains one of Hammer’s more famous moments of terror when a screeching zombie appears in the night, carrying the corpse of a young woman, but it would be reductive to only mention that over the zombie makeup at large. One scene in particular, involving the undead rising from their graves in the darkness, hands and faces emerging from the grainy earth, feels as effective and relevant to modern day zombie features as most anything made post <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3630424\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3630407/plague-zombies-delivered-frightening-gothic-spin-zombie-mythos-hammer-factory/attachment/plague-of-the-zombies-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?fit=1178%2C645&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1178,645\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"plague of the zombies 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?fit=300%2C164&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?fit=740%2C405&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3630424\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?resize=740%2C405&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?w=1178&#38;ssl=1 1178w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?resize=300%2C164&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?resize=1024%2C561&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?resize=768%2C421&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are of course differences between these zombies and the ones George A. Romero would popularize several years later. The deceased exhibit more vampire-like tendencies than their slavish origins suggest in Voodoo mythos. For example, when Sylvia’s friend Alice, in a consistently scene-stealing performance by <strong>Jacqueline Pearce</strong>, rises from the grave, she moves wearing a wide, devilish grin, suggesting a seductive spell that feels undeniably vampiric.</p>\n<p>The film is not without its flaws. The depiction of the natives drumming madly in the caves is insensitive, somewhat thoughtless and painfully dated. The plot doesn’t always quite add up, which is most glaringly apparent in Hamilton’s inexplicable masterplan to kidnap Sylvia and turn her into a zombie. Still, its inventive take on what was considered a relatively boorish monster at the time allowed the filmmakers to tell a frightening story layered with working class commentary, lending meaning where there might otherwise have only been mild entertainment.</p>\n<p>The movie is fun, frightening and undeniably potent, standing as one of Hammer’s best efforts. It feels fresh despite being beholden to recycled sets and genre tropes, offering up its blood and gore with a social message condemning the elite aristocrats Hammer movies so often served up. Its story plays out remarkably similar to the original <i>Dracula</i> tale, both in plot and character, bringing with it a level of class and contemporary awareness that elevated it far beyond its second-tier classification.</p>\n<p>It’s a rumination on belief, both logical and otherwise, and the overwhelming conviction those under its influence are subject to. Like the pounding of ritualistic drums as they resound through a hollowed out cave, <i>The Plague of Zombies</i> resonates long beyond its brisk runtime, aiding the genre on its path to resurrecting the dead for many years to come.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>The Special Features</b></p>\n<p><i>Previously released by Studiocanal in 2012 on Region B blu-ray in the UK, this version comes equipped with the same studio master. Meticulously restored by Pinewood studios, the transfer is clean and detailed. Colors pop and textures are lifelike and engaging. The ported over DTS-HD Master Mono track honors the power of the film’s striking score while still allowing for clarity in dialogue and sound effects, making for a captivating experience overall.</i></p>\n<p><b>Audio Commentary, by Filmmaker Constantine Nasr, Film Historian Steve Haberman and Writer/Producer Ted Newsome</b></p>\n<p><i>(New)</i></p>\n<p>No strangers to Scream Factory’s Hammer line, Constantine Nasr and Steve Haberman return once again, this time with Ted Newsome in tow, to provide their own thoughtful insight regarding the production, players and impact of <i>The Plague of the Zombies</i>.</p>\n<p>They discuss the thematics of the story and its influences, likening it to the Corman-Poe cycle from earlier in the decade as well as looking at the Val Lewton approach it occasionally adopts. They discuss the controversial tactics but undeniable effectiveness of director John Gilling, while also touching on André Morrell’s dislike of Diane Clare and her subsequent re-voicing, suggesting that it may not have been bad acting so much as it was her modern feel which didn’t quite fit the production.</p>\n<p>The historians talk at length about the egregious day for night shooting, calling out that the issue is more with the lab timing and not so much the filmmaker, while still giving kudos to the sequential makeup effects and overall EC Comics feels of the zombies in the picture. They go on to discuss how William Lustig plucked the film from obscurity years ago, licensing it for DVD in the States and the struggles of making forgotten films available for discovery once more.</p>\n<p>It’s a fun and informative track by people who have nothing but respect and admiration for the film. It deepens the personality of the production and is an enjoyable way to further explore the forgotten genre classic.</p>\n<p><b>Audio Commentary, by Author Troy Howarth</b></p>\n<p><i>(</i><i>New</i>)</p>\n<p>The disc also offers a second new commentary track, this time by author and Hammer aficionado Troy Howarth. He provides an incredibly informative, detailed account of the production, the actors and their histories as well as the timeline of the film’s conception through its realization.</p>\n<p>He covers much of the same information as the previous commentary, going deeper into how similar the story is to Bram Stoker’s <i>Dracula</i>. He views the film with an honest eye, making his displeasure with the day for night shooting abundantly clear and laying into Brook Williams performance. He discusses the fascinating dichotomy between the different types of religion and beliefs on display in the film and praises the filmmaking techniques, analyzing the cinematography with the same level of detail he does the performances and anecdotal history of the production.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the track is a tad dry and a little too encyclopedic when it comes to the filmography of even the smallest onscreen performers, but for fans of the film it is utterly fascinating and his dissection of how the story parallels <i>Dracula</i> is worth the listen alone.</p>\n<p><b>World of Hammer: “Mummies, Werewolves &#38; The Living Dead” (24:55)</b></p>\n<p>(<i>1990, Hammer Film Productions Ltd</i>)</p>\n<p>An episode of Hammer’s TV series, narrated by Oliver Reed. The show was a clip and compilation block that briefly summarized the plots and events from some of the studio&#8217;s most famous films.</p>\n<p>This particular episode primarily contains clips from <i>The Curse of the Mummy’s Tomb</i> (1964), <i>Captain Clegg</i> (1962), <i>Curse of the Werewolf</i> (1961) and <i>The Plague of the Zombies</i>. While offering nothing new, there is a certain wholesome charm to seeing Alice’s decapitation edited with Oliver Reed voiceover in 4&#215;3 standard definition. It reminds of a time when these films were infinitely less available, showing the somewhat lost value of episodes such as this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3630425\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3630407/plague-zombies-delivered-frightening-gothic-spin-zombie-mythos-hammer-factory/attachment/plague-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?fit=1358%2C689&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1358,689\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"plague 5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?fit=300%2C152&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?fit=740%2C376&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3630425\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?resize=740%2C375&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?w=1358&#38;ssl=1 1358w, https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?resize=300%2C152&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?resize=1024%2C520&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?resize=768%2C390&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><b>Raising the Dead: The Making of the Plague of Zombies (35:27)</b></p>\n<p>(<i>2012, Directed by Marcus Hearn, Produced by Studiocanal</i>)</p>\n<p>A series of interviews featuring actor John Carson, actress Jacqueline Pearce, actor Mark Gatiss and film historians Marcus Hearn, Jonathan Rigby and more discussing the making of <i>The Plague of the Zombies</i>.</p>\n<p>Covering everything from John Carson’s frustration that Hammer is what he’s remembered for to the film’s journey from Universal films pitch in 1963 to 20th Century Fox co-produced <i>Dracula: Prince of Darkness</i> B-picture in 1966. The historians offer thoughtful analysis, praising the film’s originality and use of Voodoo zombies in quaint Cornwall while the actors provide charming reminiscence. Jacqueline Pierce in particular livens things up, describing her excitement at seeing herself on the big screen for the first time with <i>Plague </i>and her claustrophobic struggles when making the plaster head for her decapitation scene.</p>\n<p>One of the more fascinating elements of this feature is the time it spends on the film’s restoration. The negative had been badly damaged over time and here they show the excruciating energy and effort Pinewood Studios took to reconstruct the torn and scratched negative, frame by frame.</p>\n<p>While it runs a little long considering it’s mostly comprised of talking heads, it’s an illuminating look at the film. It provides a bite-sized explanation and study of the picture for those who might be interested while not being interested enough to commit to one or both of the commentaries.</p>\n<p><b>Restoration Comparison (3:37)</b></p>\n<p>(<i>2012, Produced by Studiocanal</i>)</p>\n<p>A before and after comparison reel showcasing the amount of depth, color and detail regained by the efforts at Pinewood Studios. Shots of the exterior of the house, the characters conversing and the burning visage of the abandoned tin mine highlight pops, scratches, flickering and skin tone affectations all brought to life in the process of restoring the film. Even giant tears in the frame are corrected here in this incredibly compelling testament to an essential operation oft overlooked by physical media fans.</p>\n<p><b>Theatrical Trailers (7:25)</b></p>\n<p>Three trailers are presented here. The first and second are incredibly similar, the words DRUMS and VOODOO flying at the screen atop the emboldened word TERROR. In classic Hammer fashion, they are laden with hyperbole and far too much plot description, announcing: <i>no corpse can remain at peace in this village of the undead… this land of the zombies!</i></p>\n<p>The third and final trailer focuses on the <i>Dracula: Prince of Darkness</i> double feature. After a minute on Christopher Lee’s returning count, it announces: PLUS — UN DEATH. The second half plays out like the first two trailers, only this time going farther and revealing the final shots of the movie whilst announcing the big reveal of the villain’s master plan.</p>\n<p>The real highlight is seeing the oddly sexist targeted advertisement for boys and girls to get their free Dracula Fangs and Zombie Eyes respectively, as though the two things are gender specific. Not only is it fun to see the emphasis placed on such a gimmick, it shows that Hammer was well aware of the age groups their salacious cinema tended to attract.</p>\n<p><b>Still Gallery (7:10)</b></p>\n<p>Production photography, lobby cards, headshots, glamour shots, candid moments of the cast, crew and effects work and more! Also fun to see are the various posters and advertisements for the stand alone feature and accompanying double bill, spanning the world over. An entertaining slideshow for fans of the film and Hammer alike.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Final Thoughts</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3630427\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3630407/plague-zombies-delivered-frightening-gothic-spin-zombie-mythos-hammer-factory/attachment/plagye-zombies/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?fit=1200%2C720&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"plagye zombies\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?fit=300%2C180&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?fit=740%2C444&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3630427\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?resize=740%2C444&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?resize=300%2C180&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?resize=1024%2C614&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?resize=768%2C461&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?resize=1000%2C600&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?resize=590%2C354&#38;ssl=1 590w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?resize=400%2C240&#38;ssl=1 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><i>The Plague of the Zombies </i>was a bit of an afterthought, a secondary draw to a far more important headliner. It had neither the stars most associated with Hammer nor the types of recognizable monsters or terrors the studio had spent years basing their image on. It was an oddity, a risk mitigated by the fact that the funding was on 20th Century Fox’s dime and, frankly, it didn’t need to perform— <i>Dracula</i> did.</p>\n<p>Beginning as a failed pitch for a larger studio, the project hung in limbo for years before finally coming to fruition. By the time it reached John Gilling, it had undergone multiple rewrites and budget shifts, landing as a project that Hammer believed in while not being so invested that they cared to micromanage the production. Add in the casting of acclaimed British actor André Morell and the project began to take impressive shape.</p>\n<p>The result was a uniquely original film, despite its typical conceit of an unlikely aged man of prominence investigating some supernatural goings on in a small, secluded town. The effects are fantastic and the zombies themselves truly horrific, alluding to the evolution of the silver screen monster often more associated with the films of the 70s and 80s. It leans on canted angle graveyard shots and lumbering, dead-eyed ghouls just as much as any<i> Of the Dead</i> knock-off well before those films existed to pilfer from in the first place, deserving all the credit and respect that statement should afford.</p>\n<p>Once again, Scream Factory<i> </i>presents a worthy release of an all too under-seen gem. Porting over the great transfer and features found on the 2012 Studiocanal release and commissioning two additional commentary tracks, the release offers the most comprehensive look at the film yet put to disc.</p>\n<p>Who knows if George A. Romero saw this ahead of creating his living dead masterwork. Regardless, I think it’s safe to say that even if Hammer couldn’t keep up with the changing landscape of horror cinema in the coming decade, the studio’s legacy lives in films like <i>The</i> <i>Plague of the Zombies. </i>It’s a history that<i> </i>remains intact and influential, resurrected in its successors and alive in the genre, suggesting that relevance sometimes runs much deeper than ticket sales.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3630415\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3630407/plague-zombies-delivered-frightening-gothic-spin-zombie-mythos-hammer-factory/attachment/plague-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?fit=1193%2C1500&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1193,1500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"plague\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?fit=239%2C300&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?fit=740%2C931&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3630415\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?resize=740%2C930&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"930\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?w=1193&#38;ssl=1 1193w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?resize=239%2C300&#38;ssl=1 239w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?resize=814%2C1024&#38;ssl=1 814w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?resize=768%2C966&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/iBAlkTwcCDM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:03:27 +0000","feedId":13077,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?resize=740%2C380&ssl=1","linkMd5":"6f282b24e2825efb1f84be3d348507b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn1@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-45-25-875_8d959073351fc696.webp","destWidth":740,"destHeight":380,"sourceBytes":6512,"destBytes":6512,"author":"Paul Farrell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-1.png?resize=740%2C380&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn1@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-45-25-875_8d959073351fc696.webp","https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-of-the-zombies-1.png?resize=740%2C405&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn77@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-46-09-392_278e00890696ff32.webp","https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague-5.png?resize=740%2C375&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn39@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-46-00-026_6c07734364b7d294.webp","https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plagye-zombies.png?resize=740%2C444&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn18@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-45-58-387_515b74630fbb1b36.webp","https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/plague.jpg?resize=740%2C930&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn72@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-45-59-852_69070d601f190b33.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/iBAlkTwcCDM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn48@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-45-59-876_91c4de9eccfaac01.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295525721},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","title":"Keith David Shares First Look at NECA’s Upcoming Figure of Frank from ‘They Live’","link":"https://bloody-disgusting.com/?p=3630603","description":"<p>Last year, <strong>NECA</strong> released a set of two retro-style figures based on John Carpenter’s <strong><em>They Live</em></strong>, both depicting the film’s alien invaders, with an upcoming figure of Roddy Piper&#8217;s John Nada shown off at Toy Fair earlier this year.

Worshipers of the alien gods release psychic energy into the universe that is meant to feed and eventually resurrect their fallen deities. This psychic force also has the unfortunate side effect of attracting demons, who eventually corrupt each island — until a new alternate reality is birthed by the Council. Problem is, the Council has been murdered, and Paradise hangs in the balance. </p>\n<p>This is where you come in. Summoned from exile, “investigation freak” Lady Love Dies must now find the culprit from several suspects. You must gather evidence and build a case against your suspect.

The odds of a robber breaking into your home is a lot higher than, say, encountering a rampaging werewolf. Because the genre has long since capitalized on this fear, fans have grown somewhat desensitized to home invasion thrillers. While the invasion of one’s home remains a prevalent anxiety in modern society, it’s still hard to get excited about a well-worn concept if it doesn’t offer any new angle or subversion. While </span><strong><em>The Owners</em></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> doesn’t attempt to break the mold, it instead opts for a peculiar brand of insanity to complement the violence.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Based on the graphic novel </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Une Nuit de Pleine lune</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> by Hermann and Yves H., </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Owners</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> opens with a trio of unsavory characters sitting in a trash-filled car, scoping out a large estate in a countryside. As soon as the owners leave, they break in, ransack the place but come up empty. Mary (<strong>Maisie Williams</strong>), a girlfriend hoping to get her car back to head into work, is an unintentional accomplice. Her boyfriend and his friends opt to wait inside for the owners to come home. They find out that they picked the wrong people to mess with. Naturally, it escalates into a night of violence no one saw coming.</span></p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"3628297\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/the-owners_9/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THE-OWNERS_9.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;2.8&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;ILCE-9&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;1559154582&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;77&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;6400&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0.004&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;1&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"THE OWNERS_9\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THE-OWNERS_9.jpg?fit=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THE-OWNERS_9.jpg?fit=740%2C494&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-3628297\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THE-OWNERS_9.jpg?resize=740%2C494&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THE-OWNERS_9.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THE-OWNERS_9.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THE-OWNERS_9.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/THE-OWNERS_9.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The comparisons to </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Don’t Breathe</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> will be inevitable; a plot of unlikable characters breaking into the home of unassuming, elderly homeowners seems eerily similar, after all. Beyond that, </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Owners</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> takes a very different approach. The film never bothers any attempt to provide rooting interest for any of its characters. Mary’s boyfriend, Nathan (<strong>Ian Kenny</strong>), barely shows the smallest glimpses of humanity among a string of terrible, mean-spirited decisions. His pal Terry (<strong>Andrew Ellis</strong>) shows reticence at causing harm, but it’s overshadowed by his man-baby persona and creepy obsession with Mary. The worst among them is thug Gaz (<strong>Jake Curran</strong>), a nasty human through and through. Mary’s by far the most likable of the group, but even she is prone to making reprehensible choices. This is the type of thriller that decides to wedge in unnecessary character devices like a pregnancy to engender audience sympathy. In other words, there’s no redemption in any of our leads, making it difficult to invest in what happens to them.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Luckily, director/writer <strong>Julius Berg</strong> and his co-writer <strong>Mathieu Gompel</strong> offer some reprieve in the form of brutal violence and a pair of eccentric homeowners. <strong>Sylvester McCoy</strong>’s Dr. Huggins is a scene-chewing foil who&#8217;s making the most of a dour story. Wife Ellen Huggins (<strong>Rita Tushingham</strong>) might be even loonier than her counterpart, injecting welcome manic energy and unpredictability to how this night plays out. There&#8217;s torture and death aplenty, and it’s delightfully gory. If anything upstages McCoy’s bonkers portrayal of an equally bonkers character, it’s <strong>Scarlett O’Connell</strong>’s (</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Girl with All the Gifts</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">) makeup design. It’s so good you wish there were more heinous characters injected into the mix, simply so you could watch them die in gruesome ways, too.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Berg does an excellent job highlighting the kills and moments of excruciating mayhem, but beyond that, </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Owners</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> is a fairly standard thriller without any frills. That is, save for a third act aspect ratio change that ultimately adds nothing to the conversation.

So what&#8217;s in it for horror gamers? Well, considering that we&#8217;re still waiting on Paradox&#8217;s other big game in <strong><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em></strong>, <em>Crusader Kings III</em> might be able to tide you over with a little help from a group of modders known for their past total conversions.</p>\n<p>The Princes of Darkness Mod, which is part of the officially-sanctioned World of Darkness fan works known as the Dark Pack, is the successor mod to Princes of Darkness for <strong><em>Crusader Kings II</em></strong>. The mod is an overhaul of the base game, aimed at bringing the World of Darkness into life in <em>Crusader Kings III</em>. As such, it revamps gameplay concepts, and uses the extensive lore of its world to present a radically different all-around experience.</p>\n<p>Everything has been tweaked. For starters, you play as a vampire. You won&#8217;t die of old age or disease, but pesky things like being put to the torch or losing your head will get you killed. As such, succession is a lesser, but still present, concern for you. Marriages can&#8217;t produce children, so they are mostly a political tool.</p>\n<p>Religions, a core part of the gameplay, represent the core philosophical tenets of your character. It also helps you to not fall to the Beast, a literal manifestation of your inner monstrosity. Being unable to do so causes your character to become a feral wight, resulting in his abdication. You can find out more about the changes in the mod via its <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2216659254\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Steam page</a>, where you can also download the mod.</p>\n<p>If you like what you see (and experience), you can also choose to toss a few bucks at the mod team&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/princesofdarkness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Patreon page</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Crusader Kings III</em> is out now on Steam. <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is due out on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and PC in 2021.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/BnJA_ZDn92U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 17:25:11 +0000","feedId":13077,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"587f35cdbe1cc764411d5f5009cb44b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mike Wilson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/BnJA_ZDn92U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-45-59-913_5c3c0632bdf9d217.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295525717},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","title":"New Decade, New Rules: The Pandemic Gives Horror a Chance to Rewrite the Rules","link":"https://bloody-disgusting.com/?p=3630058","description":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does anyone even remember we’re in a new decade? Feels weird to say since it seems like we’re living several years in the span of a few months and, being completely honest with ourselves, 2020 waved the white flag. We get it. A once in a lifetime pandemic tends to have that effect. With that in mind, what will horror look like for the next ten years? Historically, it takes a while for a decade of horror to truly define itself, something often determined by real-world events. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saw</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hostel</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> didn’t drop until 2004 and 2005, respectively, but became the epitome of early 2000s horror. Before that, ‘90s horror didn’t find its voice until 1996 with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scream</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scream</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which turns 25 next year, famously outlined the rules for surviving a horror flick. What was true then is still true today: you pay for your transgressions no matter how big or small. Characters walk into rooms they shouldn’t, open doors that should stay closed, and play around with forces beyond their control just for a couple of laughs. And every time, without fail, something bad happens. Horror films reinforce our cause and effect belief system, giving us a bit of a false sense of comfort when the final body drops. But living through a pandemic changes every single rule. Many are suffering due to no fault of their own, and there’s no plan coming and no hero ready to burst through the door to save the day.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>The 2020s should explore what it means to be helpless. How it feels to follow the rules and get nothing but an icy embrace in return. </strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, horror needs to look inward, examine the rules, and rewrite them. How does that look in some of the most famous subgenres of the last decade? Glad you asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re in the age of small gatherings only consisting of friends and family; people we trust with our lives because we believe they value their own. Plus, those are the rules. Since pandemics have a way of making you think twice when that doorbell rings, the external threat of the bad guys in home invasion movies like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’re Next</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Strangers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would have no appeal. Instead, the internal threat from anyone in those small gatherings becomes the new fear. There’s no need for forced entry because we willingly let them inside when they come rapping at our door, greeting us with a smile and the warmth of familiarity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or worse, the tormentor could be a family member who lives under the same roof as the main character(s) and wants nothing more than to see them suffer. The movie becomes a metaphor for what we’re going through and makes our safe spaces anything but. It speaks to the fact that a virus can live in our loved ones and we never really know how safe we are. But ultimately, it’s a lot scarier knowing the people we trust with our lives can just as easily decide we’re as disposable as a napkin. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3622624\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3622624\" data-attachment-id=\"3622624\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3622623/shudder-sets-zoom-themed-host-july-30th-release/attachment/host-shudder/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?fit=1920%2C910&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1920,910\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"HOST-Shudder\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?fit=300%2C142&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?fit=740%2C350&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3622624\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?resize=740%2C351&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?w=1920&#38;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?resize=300%2C142&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?resize=1024%2C485&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?resize=768%2C364&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?resize=1536%2C728&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?w=1480&#38;ssl=1 1480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-3622624\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shudder&#8217;s &#8216;Host&#8217;</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps no other subgenre is more of a slave to its rules than found footage flicks. Safe to say we now have a little more empathy for the annoying person who won’t drop the camera. We’re all trying to make sense of the world in any way we can, and for the most part, that means sharing our madness with others. To say nothing of it being the only way some of us can communicate with the outside world. Because of all of that, plus the fact TikTok and Instagram are now essentially appendages, a found footage movie in 2023 will have a completely different subtext than one from 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scariest thing about these movies, besides whatever is doing the haunting, should be that the refusal to film and share is what will get these characters killed. No matter what happens, no matter how bad it is, no matter how ridiculous and absurd the situation gets, they must keep rolling. The movie itself demands they keep going, the entity wants all that attention, and the characters can’t live without feeding the beast. We, the audience, demand the cameras stay on as well. Our societal pressures to share and create content gave birth to new rules. If it’s not on social media, then it didn’t happen at all. If you say you were terrorized by a demon and didn’t stream it for the world to see, then you’re probably lying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re told if we follow the rules and do the things we’re supposed to do to be thought of as good, upstanding citizens, those charged with protecting us will do so. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Crazies</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and any of the 100 or so </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purge</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> movies refute that idea by portraying government as women and men who magically appear whenever trouble arises. Monster on their block? Here come the suits. When an experiment goes wrong and affects an entire town? Suits send in the military. Sky-high crime rate? Suits implement legal murder and thin the herd. Pandemic? Well, they at least try. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>But our reality is the flip side of that dynamic. Corruption is worse when combined with incompetence. The people in charge have no clue how to fix anything and don&#8217;t even know where to start.</strong> </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This decade should deal with the scariness of ineptitude. Instead of seeing suits and military fatigues when that monster comes, characters get nothing. When a bomb is misplaced or a chemical experiment goes south, not even containment is an option because there are no options. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3630298\" style=\"width: 1787px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?ssl=1\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3630298\" data-attachment-id=\"3630298\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3630058/new-decade-new-rules-pandemic-gives-horror-chance-rewrite-rules/attachment/beach-house/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?fit=1777%2C934&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1777,934\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Beach-House\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?fit=300%2C158&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?fit=740%2C389&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3630298\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?resize=740%2C389&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?w=1777&#38;ssl=1 1777w, https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?resize=300%2C158&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&#38;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?resize=768%2C404&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?resize=1536%2C807&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?w=1480&#38;ssl=1 1480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-3630298\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8216;The Beach House&#8217;</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being abandoned sucks. Being abandoned because the person or people in charge can’t handle the problem sucks even more. There is a specific trauma that event elicits; it’s one horror rarely explores but certainly should. That stress can result in people hurting themselves, hurting the ones around them, drowning in despair, or an entire society living out scenes from <em>The Shining</em>. These films can examine our relationship with institutions meant to protect us and what it’s like watching a group of people slowly descend into nihilism all because they followed the rules and were completely misled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 is the year a particular brand of scary movie broke the fourth wall. How can we ever go back to the typical ghosts, goblins, and strangers at our door? We know what lurks around the corner, which doors not to open, how many seconds it takes for that jump scare, and where that apparition will pop up. To paraphrase the tagline of an underrated entry in the <em>Scream</em> series, it’s a new decade, and it’s time for new rules. </span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/3bMRxy3si_8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 19:35:47 +0000","feedId":13077,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?resize=740%2C351&ssl=1","linkMd5":"cf5952ff81e7e0593f3da8c93611d2ac","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn7@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-45-25-864_0dfd98ef34ad4046.webp","destWidth":740,"destHeight":351,"sourceBytes":17772,"destBytes":17772,"author":"Marcus Shorter","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HOST-Shudder.jpg?resize=740%2C351&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn7@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-45-25-864_0dfd98ef34ad4046.webp","https://i2.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Beach-House.jpg?resize=740%2C389&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn62@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-45-59-372_96a61a18b1461ea2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/3bMRxy3si_8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn62@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-46-00-763_f6e0819ed523ae7f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295525723},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","title":"New ‘Abyssal Spider’ Trailer Actually Reveals One of the Aquatic Spiders This Time [Video]","link":"https://bloody-disgusting.com/?p=3630530","description":"<p>We told you about director<strong> Joe Chien</strong>‘s creature feature <strong><em>Abyssal Spider</em></strong> just last month, which features a massive big bad in the form of a water-dwelling spider-monster.</p>\n<p>It would seem that there are aqua spiders both big and bigger in the film, though none of them were actually shown off in the original trailer.

Footage","link":"https://bloody-disgusting.com/?p=3630358","description":"<p>As is typical of most <strong>Scream Factory</strong> releases, their upcoming <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/home-video/3630231/scream-factory-fully-details-friday-13th-collection-blu-ray-release-uncut-gore-footage-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><i>Friday the 13th</i></strong> Blu-ray set</a> appears to be absolutely stacked with special features. In addition to the gorgeous box artwork and enticing bonuses that were unveiled a few months back (uncut <i>Jason Goes to Hell</i> on Blu!!!), a number of other supplements in this loaded collection were detailed yesterday in a comprehensive look at what this set will include. And while it surely would have been an eye-raising must-have for both <i>Friday</i> fans and physical media enthusiasts based on the numerous extras on display (commentaries, 4K scans, featurettes, marketing materials and more!), there is one particular included treat that will have longtime fans frothing at the mouth…</p>\n<p><strong><i>Friday</i><em> the 13th Part</em> <i>2</i>. Uncut. Gore. Footage.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s right, Scream Factory has unearthed this long sought after <i>F13</i> grail and will be presenting it on disc for the first time. Though they’ve cautioned that the footage is sourced from a vintage VHS tape, these deleted clips will surely be the biggest draw for <i>Friday</i> fans who likely never expected to lay eyes on clips long thought to be forever lost. Scream Factory further noted that the extra gore sequences will be presented as a standalone supplement, rather than being reintegrated into a cut of the film.</p>\n<p>So what will these long-excised clips feature, anyway? Well, according to missing films authority <a href=\"https://lostmediaarchive.fandom.com/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_2_(lost_uncensored_scenes_from_slasher_film;_1981)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lost Media Archive</a>, the theatrical cut of <i>Friday the 13th Part 2</i> that we all know and love was shorn of 48 seconds of footage, which constituted the following:</p>\n<p>1) a bloodier ice pick death for Alice</p>\n<p>2) a longer, more gruesome wire death for Crazy Ralph</p>\n<p>3) bloodier deaths for the police officer (via claw hammer) and Scott (who gets his throat slashed in a more explicit manner)</p>\n<p>4) an alternate version of Mark’s death, featuring a brief moment with Jason’s machete going into his face</p>\n<p>5) an alternate final shot of Pamela’s severed head opening her eyes just before the credits hit (given that this isn’t exactly a gore shot, one wonders if it will be included)</p>\n<p>6) finally, there is the “Jeff and Sandra” scene. Or, as Scream Factory put it in a release, “THAT Jeff and Sandra” scene. An impalement sequence which finds both characters run through by Jason at once, this graphic footage was cut from the film, even though a still of this gory death made its way into Fango and the back cover of an early VHS release.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is another facet of the Jeff and Sandra scene which is more than a little unsavory. Preceding their deaths, Jeff and Sandra have sex &#8211; a moment which depicts Sandra in a full frontal nude scene. That shouldn’t be too terribly shocking, except for the fact that Sandra actor Marta Kober was underage, being only seventeen years old at the time of filming. Once this fact was discovered by Paramount, they ordered the footage to be removed from the film. Whether or not this sequence will be included on the Blu-ray is yet to be seen &#8211; though, if one guy’s opinion here matters, I really hope it never sees the light of day. That footage should remain lost.</p>\n<p>So how exactly was all of this footage unearthed? <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/1387381511510552/posts/2576516205930404/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In a Facebook post by bonus content producer Samuelson Studios</a>, owner Edwin Samuelson recounts the events that led to the discovery of the missing footage. Playing a hunch, Samuelson contacted <i>F13 Part 2</i> FX artist Carl Fullerton, who had reportedly showed the uncut footage to fellow FX legend Greg Nicotero. Indeed, it turned out that Fullerton <i>was</i> in possession of the footage, all saved to a nearly four decade old VHS tape. This revelation was followed by a coordinated effort to retrieve the precious clips, with Samuelson, <i>F13 Part 2</i> actor Bill Randolph, Samuelson’s co-producer and <i>Crystal Lake Memories</i> author Peter Bracke, and Scream Factory’s Cliff MacMillan and Jeff Nelson all lending a hand to shepherd the footage along to its safe transfer to digital. There’s far more to the process than that (including the videotape being baked!), so make certain to hit that link and check out a pretty fascinating story.</p>\n<p>In addition to this adventure, Samuelson notes that “several minutes” were originally trimmed from the film, so it’s possible that we’ll see even more footage than we could hope to expect based on the previous reports.</p>\n<p>In any case, no matter its condition, the length of the scenes, or the ultimate contents therein, what’s certain is that this unearthed footage will be absolutely essential viewing for <i>Friday</i> fans, and is surely the cherry on top of an already exemplary-looking set. I don’t know about the rest of you, but October 13th can’t get here soon enough.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-attachment-id=\"3623349\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/home-video/3623333/scream-factory-fully-details-octobers-16-disc-friday-13th-blu-ray-collection/attachment/friday-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?fit=1462%2C1744&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1462,1744\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"friday\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?fit=251%2C300&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?fit=740%2C883&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3623349\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?resize=740%2C883&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"883\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?w=1462&#38;ssl=1 1462w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?resize=251%2C300&#38;ssl=1 251w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?resize=858%2C1024&#38;ssl=1 858w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?resize=768%2C916&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?resize=1288%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/_J9mkKldhHg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 14:07:45 +0000","feedId":13077,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?resize=740%2C883&ssl=1","linkMd5":"b9690aea1ac0b4e94351bb2e0e56684c","destWidth":740,"destHeight":883,"sourceBytes":112838,"destBytes":112838,"author":"Jason Jenkins","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/friday.jpg?resize=740%2C883&ssl=1":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BloodyDisgusting/~4/_J9mkKldhHg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn30@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-46-00-564_e46d2e51af5cdc4c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295525722},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:45:25","title":"‘The Batman’ Writer Will Direct Sci-fi Thriller ‘Mother/Android’ Starring Chloe Grace Moretz","link":"https://bloody-disgusting.com/?p=3630478","description":"<p>Fresh off writing <em>The Batman</em> for Warner Bros/DC, we&#8217;ve learned via <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-batman-writer-mattson-tomlin-chole-grace-moretz-team-for-sci-fi-tale-mother-andriod-exclusive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">THR</a> tonight that <strong>Mattson Tomlin</strong> has set up his feature directorial debut, a sci-fi/thriller titled <strong><em>Mother/Android</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><em>The Batman</em> director <strong>Matt Reeves</strong> will produce, with <strong>Chloe Grace Moretz</strong> starring.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Moretz is set to star as Georgia who, with her boyfriend Sam, goes on a treacherous journey to escape their country, which is caught in an unexpected war with artificial intelligence.

Naturally, the police have no leads. It&#8217;s hardly the first time a corpse has shown up with missing body parts in the small town of Smith&#8217;s Hollow. When Lauren begins having visions of a monster in the woods, she realizes it&#8217;s up to her to stop it. The closer she gets to answers, though, the more she realizes that there&#8217;s something seriously wrong with her town. Creepy small towns that are rotten to the core and a creature in the woods make perfect ingredients for a good Halloween read.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Beauty of Horror: Haunt this Journal</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> by Alan Robert</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> </span>(releases Sept 8)</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"3630297\" data-permalink=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/books/3630285/bloody-disgustings-2020-halloween-reading-guide/attachment/haunt-this-journal/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?fit=1400%2C2118&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1400,2118\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Haunt this Journal\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?fit=198%2C300&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?fit=677%2C1024&#38;ssl=1\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3630297\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?resize=700%2C1059&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1059\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?resize=677%2C1024&#38;ssl=1 677w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?resize=198%2C300&#38;ssl=1 198w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?resize=768%2C1162&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?resize=1015%2C1536&#38;ssl=1 1015w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?resize=1354%2C2048&#38;ssl=1 1354w, https://i1.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Haunt-this-Journal.jpg?w=1400&#38;ssl=1 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For those not into the idea of taking on novels for Halloween, the only reading required here is the instructions.

I really loved the idea of making something graphic, but also quite haunting, and as a fan of the franchise I think we successfully created pieces authentic to both films, but also entirely
