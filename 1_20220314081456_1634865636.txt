On Friday, Sony’s Entertainment unit blocked Russian users from accessing its Crunchyroll anime streaming service and said it would halt the home entertainment release of films like <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home </em>within Russia, according to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/sony-pictures-russia-spider-man-no-way-home-crunchyroll-1235202319/\"><em>Variety</em></a><em>. </em>The company had previously said it <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/02/morbius-russia-release-pulled-sony-marvel-1234962304/\">would not release</a> its upcoming slate of theatrical films in the country.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>“We stand with many businesses around the world who have now paused their business operations in Russia, and in support of the humanitarian efforts currently underway in Ukraine and the surrounding region,” Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra said in an email obtained by the outlet.

Facebook’s parent company is cutting its free laundry and dry-cleaning service and pushing back dinnertime to a later hour, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/technology/facebook-meta-perks.html\"><ins>reported</ins></a> the <em>New York Times</em>. It’s a change in response to the new hybrid work schedule at Meta, where most employees will still be working from home at least a few days of week. Fewer time in the office equals fewer office perks, or at least that’s the logic of Meta leadership. But for many employees at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-gives-group-admins-new-tools-to-block-misinformation-170034622.html\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/russia-will-cut-off-access-to-instagram-174726879.html\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-physical-stores-reality-labs-products-101802202.html\">Reality Labs</a> and other Meta companies, it’s an unwelcome hassle at what is normally a grueling work environment.</p><p>“As we return to the office, we’ve adjusted on-site services and amenities to better reflect the needs of our hybrid workforce,” a Meta spokesperson wrote in a statement to the <em>Times</em>.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meta will also begin serving dinner at 6:30 pm PT, a full half-hour after the last shuttle departs campus. Meaning that employees will have to choose between a free meal <em>or</em> a free ride home. Decisions, decisions! While some Meta employees interviewed by <em>NYT</em> are unhappy about the change, many others have seen such perks as a ploy to keep employees working <a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/technology/meta-facebook-not-a-so-cool-place-to-work-anymore\">long hours</a>.&#160;</p><p>Tech companies are famous for providing <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/business-insider/11-incredible-benefits-silicon-valley-tech-companies-offer-amazon-apple.html\"><ins>incredible office perks</ins></a> to compensate for a strenuous workload, such as free meals, laundry, fitness classes, backup childcare and more. But a shift to a hybrid work environment means fewer employees will be in need of these things. To Meta’s credit, the company is fattening up annual employee wellness stipends — from $700 to $3000 per year — to account for the change.</p><p>At least for Meta’s Mountain View employees, free, unlimited food was already a thing of the past. After Google and Meta’s free, round-the-clock food service for employees left local businesses in the dust, the city passed an ordinance that <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/tech/2018/8/2/17640904/facebook-cafeteria-free-food-mountain-view-menlo-park-google-headquarters\"><ins>banned</ins></a> tech companies from offering unlimited free food.

This likely won’t surprise anyone who’s gotten behind the wheel recently. A <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/energy/us-gas-prices-hours-work/index.html\">rapid spike</a> in crude oil and gas prices due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made paying anywhere from $50 to $80 to fill a tank the norm.</p><p>“We know that prices have been going up across the economy, so we’ve done our best to help drivers and couriers without placing too much additional burden on consumers. Over the coming weeks we plan to listen closely to feedback from consumers, couriers and drivers. We’ll also continue to track gas price movements to determine if we need to make additional changes,” wrote Uber spokesperson Liza Winship on the company’s website.</p><p>Uber’s fuel surcharge will vary by state and by the amount of miles driven. For Uber rides, the fuel surcharge will be anywhere between $0.45 to $0.55 per trip. For Uber Eats deliveries, the fee will be between $0.35 to $0.45 per trip. The company says the additional fee will go straight to Uber drivers, who pay for mileage out of their own pockets. The policy won’t apply at all in New York City, where drivers have a pay floor and the majority of delivery drivers are on bikes.</p><p>Interestingly enough, riders will have to pay the fuel surcharge even if they&#39;re riding in an EV. According to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973474/uber-temporary-fuel-surcharge-fee-ev\"><em>The Verge</em></a>, Uber hopes this will be an additional incentive for drivers to switch to electric vehicles.

A video of his arrest was also posted on the channel, along with a photo that accuses him of &#34;distributing fake anti-Russian information.&#34; Belarus played a key role in the invasion of Ukraine by hosting Russian troops, which deployed from the country when the attacks began.&#160;</p><p>As <em>The Verge</em> notes, it&#39;s unclear what exactly Bernstein is being charged with and which of his edits broke Russia&#39;s fake news law.

You also learn that there’s a great need for evidence to be gathered before the twin evils of memory and self-deception color the narratives. Just as important, however, are secondary sources which can collate all of that testimony, to pick out the truth, or at least a working theory about what went on.</p><p>Take WeWork, a startup that leases office space to individuals and small businesses with an emphasis on fancy design and an open bar. As Scott Galloway once said, “they’re renting f*cking desks,” but wound up inexplicably deemed to be worth $47 billion. Now, you might be wondering how exactly that came to be, but it’s not a question that Apple TV’s <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/gb/show/wecrashed/umc.cmc.6qw605uv2rwbzutk2p2fsgvq9?ctx_brand=tvs.sbd.4000&#38;ign-itscg=MC_20000&#38;ign-itsct=atvp_brand_omd&#38;mttn3pid=Google%20AdWords&#38;mttnagencyid=a5e&#38;mttncc=UK&#38;mttnsiteid=143238&#38;mttnsubad=-585412674905-c&#38;mttnsubkw=142473721388__TSpVved6_&#38;mttnsubplmnt=\"><em>WeCrashed</em></a> can answer. It can, in excruciating detail, lead you through the chronology of what happened, but <em>why</em> it happened remains frustratingly out of reach.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The series, adapted from the Wondery podcast of the same name, charts the rise and rise of Israeli entrepreneur Adam Neumann (Jared Leto). It charts Neumann’s life, from his stumbles at business school, meeting Miguel McKelvey (Kyle Marvin) and his future wife, Rebekah Paltrow (Anne Hathaway). Neumann and McKelvey launch Green Desk, a Brooklyn-based co-working company that they sell in order to repeat the feat in Manhattan under the name WeWork. Which, unlike Green Desk, makes a fairly sizable dent in the rarified world of investment banking and tech investments.</p><p>As usual, Apple asked critics not to spoil the details of the show. I can, however, safely recommend that you read the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeWork\"><ins>Wikipedia</ins></a> article to find out exactly what happened, which is a far more efficient and enjoyable way to spend your time. Suffice to say, a company deemed to be more valuable than the GDP of some countries winds up not being worth that much and some venture capital funds have to spend extra cash to clean up the error of their initial investment.</p><p>Unfortunately, the show’s biggest failure is that the above description is pretty much the level of stakes we’re expected to care about. The second is that a story that might have made a fairly breezy movie of the week on HBO drags on well beyond anyone’s tolerance to enjoy it. Third, and worst of all, is that it’s really hard to spend that much time in the company of Adam and Rebekah Neumann. Now, there are plenty of films and TV series that feature unlikeable yet compelling sociopaths as their lead characters, including the recently released <em>Inventing Anna</em>. And if<em> WeCrashed</em> had a more cohesive central thesis, or a clear-eyed view of these characters, then they might have been able to make the characters in any way compelling or pleasant. To say that spending eight hours in their company is a chore is a spectacular understatement.</p><p>Despite its never-ending running time, <em>WeCrashed</em> glosses over a fair number of details from the WeWork narrative. The Ballardian WeLive residential concept, which was detailed in Hulu’s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hulu-wework-documentary-adam-neumann-170036642.html\"><ins>WeWork documentary from last year</ins></a>, never gets a mention. More troublingly, the show glosses over the corporate culture of<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/12/17969190/wework-lawsuit-sexual-assault-harassment-retaliation\"><ins> hard drinking</ins></a> and, reportedly, inter-office sexual assault that were <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/12/tech/wework-sexual-harassment/index.html\"><ins>widely</ins></a><a href=\"https://www.hrdive.com/news/wework-hit-with-3-suits-alleging-race-discrimination-sexual-harassment/581507/\"><ins>detailed</ins></a> at the time. The only time this is ever looked at, it’s as a montage showing people taking their turns with each other in a supply closet between rounds of drinks. And, because of how the show frames Adam as our, uh, <em>hero</em>, it almost celebrates the times he himself uses drinking (and bullying) to get his own way with would-be business partners.&#160;</p><div id=\"b9150b5eda05481b81450ca8e280935d\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The funny thing about us getting a lot of these biopics so soon after events happen is that I don’t think production companies actually give a fuck if people are bored by the story. They’re banking on people hate watching.</p>— petty mayonnaise (@NuuYawkerr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NuuYawkerr/status/1499734017171722245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 4, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>It’s interesting, to me, that <em>WeCrashed</em> seems to not have a clear idea of what sort of show it wants to be. If it wanted to portray the Neumanns as well-meaning ingenues out of their depth and manipulated by wider forces, it could have sanded off their rougher edges. If it wanted to make them the villains, it would have taken the sort of villain-as-hero perspective you’d find in a Martin Scorsese movie. But instead it sits in a middle ground, with silly gag bits sprinkled around what is otherwise a fairly po-faced prestige drama.</p><p>I will say, too, that viewers will notice that all of the people who backed and enabled Neumann are rarely treated critically. The people who wrote the checks, fed the beast and then threw a tantrum when it didn’t make a huge profit are always presented as well-meaning. This soft touch certainly extends toward <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayoshi_Son\"><ins>Masayoshi Son</ins></a>, CEO of Softbank and head of Softbank’s Vision Fund. Softbank, if you recall, was Apple’s iPhone launch carrier in Japan, owns part of T-Mobile in the US and, most crucially, currently owns ARM, which licenses the technology that powers Apple Silicon. Sure depicting him <em>at all</em> is something of a risk, but he’s never presented as a fool, nor is it suggested that he was duped into investing in WeWork in the first place.</p><p>There are a couple of moments where a character is able to point at what’s unfolding in wide-eyed disbelief. But those are few and far between, again, maybe because it’s hard – yet – to see if WeWork is a success or a failure. It did go public, eventually, as part of a SPAC, and while it’s still a loss-making company, it may eventually rebound. It’s clear that you can’t pull, or land, a punch if you don’t know where your target is going to be in two or three years from now. If this story, for whatever reason, gets remade in the 2050’s, I bet it’ll be a lot more interesting than the one I’ve just sat through.</p><p>I have a sneaking suspicion that the <em>WeCrashed’s</em> creators were aiming for a show on the level of <em>Succession</em>. Unfortunately, while it does focus on “complex characters who are unlikeable worrying over their ownership stake of a company,” this feels more like a <em>Billions</em> knock-off. And not a good one at that.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 22:30:29 +0000","feedId":1,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ee145094b69d6bb097e8dbc1e5ddc353","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Daniel Cooper","publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245664870},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:24","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:24","title":"Apple stops selling LG's $1,299 UltraFine 5K Display","link":"https://www.engadget.com/apple-stops-selling-lg-27-inch-ultrafine-5k-display-175514496.html?src=rss","description":"<p>Days after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-discontinues-27-inch-imac-195702069.html\"><ins>discontinuing the 27-inch iMac</ins></a>, Apple has also stopped selling one of LG’s UltraFine displays.

Reprinted by permission of Counterpoint Press.</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><hr><p>When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Kefauver\">Estes Kefauver</a> died in 1963, he was writing a book about monopoly power called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Few-Hands-Monopoly-Power-America/dp/B0006BM498\"><em>In a Few Hands</em></a>. Early into Reagan’s first term, the industry must have been tempted to publish a gloating retort titled <em>In a Few Years</em>. Between 1979 and 1981, the drug companies did more than break the stalemate of the 1960s and ’70s — they smashed it wide open. <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/senate-bill/1250\">Stevenson-Wydler</a> and <a href=\"https://research.wisc.edu/bayhdole/\">Bayh-Dole</a> replaced the Kennedy policy with a functioning framework for the high-speed transfer of public science into private hands. As the full machinery was built out, the industry-funded echo chamber piped a constant flow of memes into the culture: patents alone drive innovation... R&#38;D requires monopoly pricing... progress and American competitiveness depend on it... there is no other way...</p><p>In December 1981, the drug companies celebrated another long-sought victory when Congress created a federal court devoted to settling patent disputes. Previously, patent disputes were heard in the districts where they originated. The problem, from industry’s perspective, was the presence of so many staunch New Deal judges in key regions like New York’s Second Circuit. These lifetime judges often understood patent challenges not as threats to property rights, but as opportunities to enforce antitrust law. Local circuit judges appointed by Republicans could also be dangerously old-fashioned in their interpretations of the “novelty” standard. By contrast, the judges on the new patent court, named the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, were appointed by the president. Reagan stuffed its bench with corporate patent lawyers and conservative legal scholars influenced by the Johnny Appleseed of the Law and Economics movement, Robert Bork. Prior to 1982, federal district judges rejected around two-thirds of patent claims; the Court of Appeals has since decided two-thirds of all cases in favor of patent claims. Reagan’s first appointee, Pauline Newman, was the former lead patent counsel for the chemical firm FMC.</p><p>The Supreme Court also contributed to the industry’s 1979–1981 run of wins. When Reagan entered office, one of the great scientific-legal unknowns involved the patentability of modified genes. Similar to the uncertainty around the postwar antibiotics market—settled in the industry’s favor by the 1952 Patents Act — the uncertainty threatened the monopoly dreams of the emergent biotechnology sector. The U.S. Patent Office was against patenting modified genes. In 1979, its officers twice rejected an attempt by a General Electric microbiologist to patent a modified bacterium invented to assist in oil spill cleanups. The GE scientist, Ananda Chakrabarty, sued the Patent Office, and in the winter of 1980 Diamond v. Chakrabarty landed before the Supreme Court. In a 5–4 decision written by Warren Burger, the Court overruled the U.S. Patent Office and ruled that modified genes were patentable, as was “anything under the sun that is made by man.” The decision was greeted with audible exhales by the players in the Bayh-Dole alliance. “Chakrabarty was the game changer that provided academic entrepreneurs and venture capitalists the protection they were waiting for,” says economist Öner Tulum. “It paved the way for a more expansive commercialization of science.”</p><p>But the industry knew better than to relax. It understood that political victories could be impermanent and fragile, and it had the scar tissue to prove it. Uniquely profitable, uniquely hated, and thus uniquely vulnerable — the companies could not afford to forget that their fantastic postwar wealth and power depended on the maintenance of artificial monopolies resting on dubious if not indefensible ethical and economic arguments that were rejected by every other country on earth. In the United States, home to their biggest profit margins, danger lurked behind every corner in the form of the next crusading senator eager to train years of unwanted attention on these facts. Not even Bayh-Dole, that precious newborn legislation, could be taken for granted. This mode of permanent crisis was validated by the return of a familiar menace in the early 1980s. Of all things, it was the generics industry, an old but weak enemy of the patent-based drug companies, that reappeared and threatened to ruin their celebration of achieving dominance over every corner of medical research and the billions of public dollars flowing through it.</p><p>***</p><p>As late as the 1930s, there was no “generic” drug industry to speak of. There were only big drug companies and small ones, some with stature, others obscure. They both sold products that were, in the parlance of ethical medicine, “nonproprietary.” To be listed in the United States Pharmacopeia and National Formulary, the official bibles of prescribable medicines, drugs could only carry scientific names; the essential properties of a good scientific name, according to the first edition of the Pharmacopeia, were “expressiveness, brevity, and dissimilarity.” The naming of drugs and medicines formed the other half of the patent taboo: branding a drug evidenced the same knavishness and greed as monopolizing one. The rules of “ethical marketing” did permit products to include an institutional affiliation—Parke-Davis Cannabis Indica Extract, or Squibb Digitalis Tincture—but the names of the medicines themselves (cannabis, digitalis) did not vary. “The generic name emerged as a parallel form of social property belonging to all that resisted commodification and thereby came to occupy a central place in debates about monopoly rights,” writes Joseph Gabriel.</p><p>As with patents on scientific medicine, the Germans gave the U.S. drug industry early instruction in the use of trademarks to entrench market control. Hoechst and Bayer broke every rule of so-called ethical marketing, aggressively advertising their breakthrough drugs under trademarks like Aspirin, Heroin, and Novocain. The idea was to twine these names and the things they described in the public mind so tightly, the brand name would secure a de facto monopoly long after the patent expired.</p><p>The strategy worked, but the German firms did not reap the benefits. The wartime Office of Alien Property redistributed the German patents and trademarks among domestic firms who produced competing versions of aspirin, creating the first “branded generic.” During the patent taboo’s extended death rattle of the interwar years, more U.S. companies waded into the use of original trademarks to suppress competition. As they experimented with German tactics to avoid “genericide” — the loss of markets after patent expiration — they were enabled by court decisions that transformed trademarks into forms of hard property, similar to the way patents were reconceived in the 1830s.</p><p>After World War II, branding and monopoly formed the two-valve heart of a post-ethical growth strategy. The industry’s incredible postwar success — between 1939 and 1959, drug profits soared from $300 million to $2.3 billion — was fueled in large part by expanding the German playbook. While branding monopolies with trade names, the industry initiated campaigns to ruin the reputations of scientifically identical but competing products. The goal was the “scandalization” of generic drugs, writes historian Jeremy Greene. The drug companies “worked methodically to moralize and sensationalize generic dispensing as a dangerous and subversive practice. Dispensing a non-branded product in place of a brand-name product was cast as ‘counterfeiting’; the act of substituting a cheaper version of a drug at the pharmacy was described as ‘beguilement,’ ‘connivance,’ ‘misrepresentation,’ ‘fraudulent,’ ‘unethical’ and ‘immoral.’”</p><p>As with patenting, it was the drug companies that dragged organized medicine with them into the post-ethical future. As late as 1955, the AMA’s Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry maintained a ban on advertisements for branded products in its Journal. That changed the year Equanil hit the market, opening the age of branded prescription drugs as a leading source of income for medical journals and associations. “Clinical journals and newer ‘throwaway’ promotional media now teemed with advertisements for Terramycin, Premarin, and Diuril rather than oxytetracycline (Pfizer), conjugated equine estrogens (Wyeth) or chlorothiazide (Merck),” writes Greene. In 1909, only one in ten prescription drugs carried a brand name. By 1969, the ratio had flipped, with only one in ten marketed under its scientific name. In another echo of the patent controversy, the rise of marketing and branded drugs produced division and resistance. By the mid-1950s, an alliance of so-called nomenclature reformers arose to decry trademarks as unscientific handmaidens of monopoly and call for a return to the use of scientific names. These reformers — doctors, pharmacists, labor leaders — made regular appearances before the Kefauver committee beginning in 1959. Their testimony on how the industry used trademarks to suppress competition informed a section in Kefauver’s original bill requiring doctors to use scientific names in all prescriptions. The proposed law reflected the norms that reigned during ethical medicine’s heyday, and would have allowed doctors to recommend firms, but not their branded products. Like most of Kefauver’s core proposals, however, the generic clause was excised. The only trademark-related reform in the final Kefauver-Harris Amendments placed limits on companies’ ability to rebrand and market old medicines as new breakthroughs.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 16:30:04 +0000","feedId":1,"bgimg":"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/58d46bf0-9f02-11ec-af2f-71c50c4a1d9a","linkMd5":"3cd29ecca15b2213e123c906ba68c8ca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-14-26-226_9df27a3ee0c7c924.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":2114,"sourceBytes":510876,"destBytes":138462,"author":"Andrew Tarantola","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/58d46bf0-9f02-11ec-af2f-71c50c4a1d9a":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-14-26-226_9df27a3ee0c7c924.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245664873},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:24","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:24","title":"'Dead Space' remake arrives early 2023","link":"https://www.engadget.com/dead-space-remake-release-date-202523015.html?src=rss","description":"<p>Motive and EA finally have a release window for their <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dead-space-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc-180518562.html\"><em>Dead Space</em> remake</a>.

Spotify—which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/17/spotify-acquires-online-music-studio-soundtrap/\">acquired</a> Soundtrap back in 2017— is now offering a <a href=\"https://www.soundtrap.com/\"><ins>bundle</ins></a> with Spotify Premium and Soundtrap for $16.99 a month.

Given that Spotify Premium is $9.99 a month and both Soundtrap plans cost $11.99 per month each, this is a solid deal for those who subscribe to both.</p><p>The bundle will give creators access to unlimited projects, more than 19,000 loops, sound effects, live transcripts and autotune. Podcasters also have the ability to publish their podcasts from Soundtrap directly to Spotify, instead of using a podcast hosting service like Buzzsprout or Podbean. The live transcript can serve as a guide for editing, which is likely to be a timesaver.&#160;</p><span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But there’s a big drawback to Soundtrap if you’re planning on also publishing on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher or another podcasting service. Soundtrap won’t generate an RSS feed for each episode, which you will need to publish your podcast outside of Spotify. If you want to do that, you&#39;ll need to download each podcast episode as an audio file and then re-upload them onto a <a href=\"https://www.adamenfroy.com/podcast-hosting\"><ins>third-party podcast hosting service</ins></a>.</p><p>All told, Soundtrap’s suite of podcasting and music editing tools is ideal for creators who need an easy, simplified option for making music and podcasts.

Notably, this puts Hulu + Live TV&#39;s DVR functionality on par with YouTube TV and makes the pricing far more competitive, at $70 per month versus the $80 you needed to roughly match the feature set. There are still reasons you might pick YouTube&#39;s offering over Hulu&#39;s (a slightly lower $65 price and some sports networks), but the gap is now considerably narrower.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 19:00:49 +0000","feedId":1,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4356b5c232c457710dfbc6b6c6884321","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jon Fingas","publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245664861},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:24","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:24","title":"Apple reportedly isn't planning to release a new 27-inch iMac","link":"https://www.engadget.com/apple-reported-no-new-27-inch-imac-150553644.html?src=rss","description":"<p>Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-discontinues-27-inch-imac-195702069.html\">discontinued</a> the 27-inch iMac when it launched the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-studio-184309872.html\">Mac Studio</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-studio-display-185619355.html\">5K Studio Display</a>, but <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/30/imac-pro-comeback-m1-max-pro-design/\">reports</a> that came out earlier this year suggested that a replacement was in the works.
