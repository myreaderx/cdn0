Replica Sets allow you to offload reads, as long as your application can tolerate eventual consistency.  Additionally, replica sets allow you to offload your backups to a secondary.  Another important feature to know about Replica Sets is that only one member of the Replica Set can accept client writes at a time; if you want multiple nodes to accept writes, then you should look into <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/\">sharded clusters</a>.  There are some tradeoffs with replica sets that you should also be aware of; when reading from a secondary, depending on your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/read-preference/\">read preference</a>, you may be reading stale data or data that hasn’t been acknowledged by all members of the replica set.</p>\n<h2>3) Backups</h2>\n<p>Backups are just as important with MongoDB as they were with any other database.  There are tools like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/\">mongodump</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoexport/\">mongoexport</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb/index.html\">Percona Backup for MongoDB</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/\">Ops Manager</a> (Enterprise Edition only) that support Point In Time Recovery, Oplog backups, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server-for-mongodb/LATEST/hot-backup.html#:~:text=Percona%20Server%20for%20MongoDB%20includes,notable%20performance%20and%20operating%20degradation.\">Hot Backups</a>, and full and incremental Backups.  As mentioned, backups can be run from any node in your replica set.  The best practice is to run your backup from a secondary node so you don’t put unnecessary pressure on your primary node.   In addition to the above methods, you can also take snapshots of your data, and this is possible as long as you pause writes to the node that you’re snapshotting before freezing the file system to ensure a consistent snapshot of your MongoDB database.</p>\n<h2>4) Indexes Are Just as Important</h2>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/\">Indexes</a> are just as important for MongoDB as they are with relational databases.  Just like with relational databases, indexes can help speed up your queries by reducing the size of data that your query returns thus speeding up query performance.  Indexes also help your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/ensure-indexes-fit-ram/\">working set</a> more easily fit into memory.  Pay attention to the query patterns and look for full collection scans in your logfiles to know where there are queries that could benefit from an index.  In addition to that, make sure that you follow the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.alexbevi.com/blog/2020/05/16/optimizing-mongodb-compound-indexes-the-equality-sort-range-esr-rule/\">ESR rule</a> when creating your indexes and examining your query patterns.  Just like relational databases, indexes aren’t free, as MongoDB has to update indexes every time there’s an insert, delete or update, so make sure your indexes are being used and aren’t unnecessarily slowing down your writes.</p>\n<h2>5) Whenever Possible, Working Set &#60; RAM</h2>\n<p>As with any database, fitting your data into RAM will allow for faster reads than from disk.  MongoDB is no different.  Knowing how much data MongoDB has to read in for your queries can help you determine how much RAM you should allocate to your database.  For example, if your query requires a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-working-set\">working set</a> that is 50 GB and you only have 32 GB of RAM allocated to the Wired Tiger Cache, MongoDB is going to constantly read in more of the working set from disk and page it out to make room for the additional data, and this will lead to slower query performance and a system that is constantly using all of its available memory for its cache.  Conversely, if you have a 50 GB working set and 100 GB of RAM for your Wired Tiger cache, the working set will fit completely into memory and as long as other data doesn’t page it out of the cache, MongoDB should serve reads much faster as it will all be in memory.</p>\n<p>Avoiding reads from disk is not always possible or practical.  To assess how many reads you’re doing from disk, you can use commands like db.serverStatus() or measure it with tools like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a>.  Be sure your filesystem uses the MongoDB recommended XFS file system and whenever possible, uses Solid-State Drives (SSD’s) to speed up disk performance.   Because of database workloads, you should also make sure to provision enough IOPS for your database servers to try and avoid disk bottlenecks as much as possible.   Multiple cored systems will also tend to work better as this allows faster checkpointing for the Wired Tiger storage engine, but you will still be reliant on going as fast as the disks can take you.</p>\n<h3>Takeaways:</h3>\n<p>While MongoDB is easy to get started with and has a lower barrier to entry, just like any other database there are some key things that you, as a DBA, should consider before deploying MongoDB.   We’ve covered enabling authentication and authorization to ensure you have a secure deployment.  We&#8217;ve also covered deploying replica sets to ensure high availability, backups to ensure your data stays safe, the importance of indexes to your query performance and having sufficient memory to cover your queries, and what to do if you don’t. We hope this helps you have a better idea of how to deploy MongoDB and to be able to support it better.  Thanks for reading!</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 13:08:58 +0000","feedId":11,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"625c3b820789ba6c1b1ad7edc38b6619","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mike Grayson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Before-Deploying-MongoDB-200x112.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn7@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-44-34-406_48bcfdd787b63e27.webp","https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Before-Deploying-MongoDB-300x168.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn4@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-44-34-568_e1cf01b2d8b5c6f1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673658},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"Announcing pg_stat_monitor Tech Preview: Get Better Insights Into Query Performance in PostgreSQL","link":"https://www.percona.com/blog/?p=72029","description":"<img width=\"200\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pg_stat_monitor-Better-Insights-Query-Performance-in-PostgreSQL-200x112.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"pg_stat_monitor Better Insights Query Performance in PostgreSQL\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pg_stat_monitor-Better-Insights-Query-Performance-in-PostgreSQL-200x112.png 200w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pg_stat_monitor-Better-Insights-Query-Performance-in-PostgreSQL-300x168.png 300w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pg_stat_monitor-Better-Insights-Query-Performance-in-PostgreSQL-1024x572.png 1024w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pg_stat_monitor-Better-Insights-Query-Performance-in-PostgreSQL-367x205.png 367w, https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pg_stat_monitor-Better-Insights-Query-Performance-in-PostgreSQL.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /><p>I am very passionate about database observability, and I believe query performance observability is the most important insight you can get in your database.  Why? Because if you look from an application developer’s point of view, once a database is provisioned and you can connect to it, responding to your queries promptly and correctly is essentially all that you need from the database. This applies both to the databases which you deploy on-prem or in cloud-based DBaaS offerings.</p>\n<p>PostgreSQL has a fantastic extension for capturing query performance called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pg_stat_statements</a> which captures a lot of query execution details; however, it did not capture all the details we wanted to capture in order to provide deep query performance insights in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management\">Percona Monitoring and Management</a>. So, we developed a new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor\">pg_stat_monitor</a> plugin which has slightly different design goals and usage patterns, while providing everything you&#8217;re used to from pg_stat_statements, and more.</p>\n<p>At this point, pg_stat_monitor is released as a separate project from Percona, so it is easier for us to experiment with new approaches and ideas. At the same time, we’re very much looking forward to working with the PostgreSQL community to see if there are any features that have enough consensus to be incorporated into pg_stat_statements, too.</p>\n<h2>pg_stat_monitor Differences<b></b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Time Bucketing</strong>: Instead of supplying one set of ever-increasing counts, pg_stat_monitor computes stats for a configured number of time intervals. This allows for much better data accuracy, especially in the case of high resolution or unreliable network.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-Dimensional grouping</strong>:  While pg_stat_statements groups counters by (userid, dbid, queryid),  pg_stat_monitor uses (userid, clientip, dbid, queryid). This allows you to drill down into the performance of queries coming from particular client addresses, which we at Percona have found to be very valuable in a number of cases.</li>\n<li><strong>Capture Actual Parameters in the Queries</strong>:  pg_stat_monitor allows you to choose if you want to see queries with placeholders for parameters or actual query examples.  We found having the full query example is very helpful, as you can run EXPLAIN on it or easily play with modifying the query to make it run better, as well as making communication about the query clearer when discussing with other DBAs and application developers.</li>\n<li><strong>Store Information about tables accessed by statement</strong>: This allows us to identify all queries which accessed a given table easily.  Such an approach is more reliable than parsing queries to extract such information.</li>\n<li><strong>Response time distribution histogram</strong>:  While min/max/avg query execution statistics are great, especially when computed over a short time bucket, they are hard to understand when trying to look at them for a long period of time. For this reason, we have added a query response time histogram which can offer better insights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to note that we are able to achieve these additional features while having performance overhead comparable to the original pg_stat_statements extension.</p>\n<h2>pg_stat_monitor Planned Features</h2>\n<p>There are a number of features we want to implement but have not yet figured out how to achieve them with the PostgreSQL extension (and if it is possible at all without patching PostgreSQL code). If you have ideas on how to achieve any of these, let us know.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Capturing All the Queries</strong>:  Capture all queries (not only successful queries) so the queries which terminated with errors are not missed (or require another data source to capture). Once we have this, we can measure performance for successful and failed queries separately, so that an elevated failure rate can be seen as a different signal than different query performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Errors and Warnings Histogram</strong>:  Not all queries succeed and when they fail you really want to know why. We would like to see not only the number of times a given query failed but what the cause of failure was. The same query may fail due to a permission error or foreign key violation which requires an entirely different action to remediate.  It is also very helpful to know which query triggers particular warnings.</li>\n<li><strong>Accurate Wait Event Attribution to Queries</strong>:  For a given query type it would be great to see where its response time comes from. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#WAIT-EVENT-TABLE\">Wait Events</a> is one way to capture this and currently, query attribution can be done through a high-frequency sampling of the pg_stat_activity table. However, it is not accurate and not scalable with a large number of active backends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor\">pg_stat_monitor  </a>is now available as a Technical Preview and we’re releasing it to get feedback from the community on what we’re doing right and what we should do differently before we release pg_stat_monitor as a generally available version to be supported for years to come.
