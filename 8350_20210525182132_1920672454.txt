We’re happy to be here (virtually) with you again and are excited to share with you all the great new features and tools we’ve built on the <A href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft Teams platform</A> that you can use to <A href=\"https://aka.ms/M365atBuild2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">build the next generation of collaborative apps for hybrid work</A>. We’ve got everything from new features enabling richer meeting scenarios to how admins can empower better app adoption to new Teams app store experiences to drive better user engagement. We can’t wait to see the new collaborative experiences you can create with these!</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<H2>Collaborative apps: A new class of apps centered on collaboration</H2>\n<P>Over the last year, the needs of customers changed dramatically as we shifted to remote and now hybrid work. Those needs moved towards collaboration versus individual productivity and desire for synchronous and asynchronous modes of collaboration. Microsoft Teams was built with the very purpose of enabling collaboration, and so a net new creative and economic opportunity has risen for developers to build the next generation of applications where collaboration is at the core. We call this new class of apps - collaborative apps. Learn more about our vision of collaborative apps built on the Microsoft Cloud at the <A href=\"https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/cc59edb2-5b9b-44f3-b72c-00b6a201192d?source=sessions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technical keynote session led by Jeff Teper</A> and at the <A href=\"https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/1c424246-f216-4c03-97ce-4bdce97fd75f?source=sessions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Into Focus’ session with Rajesh Jha</A>.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<H2>Better meetings, chats, and collaboration experiences for the hybrid workplace</H2>\n<P>Collaboration remains top of mind for every organization and will be critical as we navigate the new way of work in a hybrid workplace. Here are some of the new features that you can use to build rich collaboration experiences.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>Shared stage integration available in preview</STRONG><BR />You can now build apps that enable real-time, multi-user collaboration experiences by extending the “main stage” of a Teams meeting. This will enable users to add an app and share it with other attendees to provide in-the-moment collaboration – such as scenarios involving whiteboarding, design, project boards, and more. <A href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/apps-in-teams-meetings/create-apps-for-teams-meetings?tabs=dotnet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Check out our docs to learn how to get started</A>.</P>\n<P><IMG src=\"https://cdn.techcommunity.microsoft.com/assets/MicrosoftTeams/Shared%20Stage%20GIF.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Visual demonstrating an app utilizing shared stage\" width=\"990\" /></P>\n<P><EM><FONT size=\"2\">App utilizing shared stage</FONT></EM></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><STRONG>New meeting event APIs available in preview</STRONG><BR />More meeting event APIs are now available (in preview) like that you can utilize to integrate a broad breadth of meeting scenarios.
