The tubes are typically needed when there&#8217;s excess fluid in the middle ear and to address chronic ear infections. The tubes help to prevent this fluid build-up but require placement under general anesthesia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>General anesthesia can be distressing for children and parents, and <a href=\"https://www.hummingbirdeartubes.com/\">Preceptis Medical</a>, a medtech company based in Minnesota, has developed an in-office solution for ear tube placement that requires only a local anesthetic. The Hummingbird device allows an ENT surgeon to place an ear tube in a single pass, and provides a convenient and less expensive option for ear tube placement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A multicenter study recently investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the approach, and the results were published in journal <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lio2.533\"><em>Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology</em></a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Medgadget</em> had the opportunity to speak with Steve Anderson, Preceptis Medical&#8217;s CEO, about the Hummingbird and the latest study results.     </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Conn Hastings, Medgadget: Please give us an overview of ear tubes and the reason they are inserted.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Anderson-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511381\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Anderson-1.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Anderson-1-265x300.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve Anderson, Preceptis Medical:</strong> Ear tubes, also called tympanostomy tubes (TT), are the primary surgical treatment option for children that have persistent fluid buildup in their middle ear and/or chronic middle ear infections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If left untreated, these infections can lead to hearing loss that can result in delayed speech development and poor school performance. During the procedure, tiny cylinders are implanted to create an airway that ventilates the middle ear and prevents the accumulation of fluids behind the eardrum. The tubes usually fall out on their own six to twelve months after the procedure and the holes will heal on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: What are the limitations associated with how the tubes are currently inserted?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong><strong>:</strong> Approximately one million children undergo ear tube procedures annually in an operating room in the United States alone. These procedures are done under general anesthesia due to the surgical limitations and pain associated with using standard instruments to treat children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ear tube procedures conducted in an operating room can be traumatic for both children and parents well before the procedure begins and after it ends. Preoperative fasting to avoid reactions to general anesthesia can increase the child’s anxiety about the procedure. It is also estimated that 57% of children experience post-general anesthetic delirium symptoms, such as restlessness, agitation, thrashing, crying or moaning, and disorientation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hummingbird-device.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511384\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hummingbird-device.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hummingbird-device-300x97.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hummingbird-device-768x248.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Please give us an overview of the Hummingbird device, and how it works.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong><strong>:</strong> The FDA-cleared Hummingbird Tympanostomy Tube System (TTS) is a breakthrough pediatric technology that reduces surgical trauma for patients and enables safe and efficient in-office ear tube placement for children. The Hummingbird is proven to eliminate the need for general anesthesia with 99% procedure success in the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hummingbird TTS allows ENT surgeons to provide parents and their children a safe, convenient, and less expensive option for pediatric ear tube procedures by eliminating the need for general anesthesia and an operating room.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ear-tube-placed-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511390\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ear-tube-placed-1.jpg 384w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ear-tube-placed-1-300x255.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hummingbird creates an incision and places an ear tube in one single pass. The device combines the separate steps and tools for making an incision, positioning the ear tube, and placing the tube using standard instruments required for traditional procedures. Using the Hummingbird, an incision is made using the cutting sheath at the tip of the device and the tube is placed by scrolling back on the slider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Hummingbird, ear tube procedures are completed right in the comfort of the doctor’s office using only a topical anesthetic to numb the eardrum. The office-based procedure takes about five minutes, and parents can stay in the room with their child to provide further comfort. Children recover quickly and can return to normal activities immediately following the procedure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Hummingbird® TTS Product Animation\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RIFYx2M4xIk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: How was the device conceived and designed? What inspired Preceptis Medical to develop such a solution?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong><strong>:</strong> Preceptis Medical was founded by parents, including a pediatric anesthesiologist, who wanted to design products focused on improving the lives of children. The founders understood the stress and costs associated with putting young children to sleep for surgery. They developed the Hummingbird in partnership with leading pediatric ENTs to simplify ear tube procedures while reducing the risks associated with the use of general anesthesia in children. The company’s goal is to broaden the options available to ENTs and parents, focusing on the safety and comfort of the child, while reducing healthcare costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Is the device easy to use? Does it require much training before a clinician can use it?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong><strong>:</strong> The device was designed collaboratively with pediatric ENTs to be straightforward for ENT surgeons to learn to use. Surgeons are trained on the Hummingbird in the comfort of their office on a simulated head model. The surgeons are then observed over a series of in vivo cases to complete the certification requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The device’s simplicity is a key reason why interest from both surgeons and parents has been very strong, further reinforcing the unmet need and desire for alternative options to procedures performed in the operating room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Please give us an overview of your recent published study assessing the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the approach.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steve Anderson:</strong> Results from a prospective, multicenter study assessing in-office pediatric ear tube placement using the Hummingbird were recently published in<em> <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/lio2.533\">Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology</a></em>. The study showed that ear tube placement with the Hummingbird device in awake young children using only a topical anesthetic was safe, successful, and well tolerated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study enrolled 211 children age 6–24 months who were treated at 10 sites by 13 ENT investigators. TT placement was successfully and safely completed in the office setting in 99% of cases for this age group, with a median intraoperative procedure time of fewer than five minutes for bilateral TT placement. Tolerability of the procedure was validated by assessments from the ENT surgeons and their staff members, as well as procedure reviews from independent clinicians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, a survey showed that 97% of parents with children treated with the Hummingbird would recommend the procedure to other parents. Further, the American Academy of Otolaryngology released a<a href=\"https://www.entnet.org/content/placement-tubes-pediatric-patients-while-awake\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.entnet.org/content/placement-tubes-pediatric-patients-while-awake\">Position Statement</a> supporting in-office TT placement in appropriate children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the results of the study, strong interest from ENT surgeons, and favorable feedback from parents, Preceptis believes that in-office ear tube procedures may become the standard of care for pediatric ear tube placement.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/divider-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511379\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://www.hummingbirdeartubes.com/\">Hummingbird TTS product page&#8230;</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=cukhKE09EXM:YLssqTGPAgc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=cukhKE09EXM:YLssqTGPAgc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=cukhKE09EXM:YLssqTGPAgc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=cukhKE09EXM:YLssqTGPAgc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/cukhKE09EXM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 14:53:11 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hummingbird-inside.jpg","linkMd5":"7b43042d89ae116961cc76993fb84cc3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn12@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-17-780_686186fd5d74bf67.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":218971,"destBytes":28654,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hummingbird-inside.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn12@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-17-780_686186fd5d74bf67.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Anderson-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn33@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-51-676_e4a5de9502754cb7.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hummingbird-device.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn66@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-52-181_cb58d073341a5857.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ear-tube-placed-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-51-568_ee8448fe3b357395.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/divider-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn76@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-485_b63573c0474c4dd8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-450_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-452_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=cukhKE09EXM:YLssqTGPAgc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn96@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-749_46b9ef9dadecba33.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/cukhKE09EXM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn30@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-51-589_241ae3b1c9212f3a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425341480},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","title":"Quick and Easy CRISPR-Based COVID Test","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511367","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-paper-test.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511425\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-paper-test.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-paper-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-paper-test-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) have developed an easy to perform CRISPR-based COVID-19 test that takes only 30 minutes for the results to come in. The test, which involves dipping a paper strip into a mixture containing a nasal sample, is unaffected by new variants of the virus, and could be useful for rapid testing performed by non-specialists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Viruses are very smart. They can mutate, edit, or shuffle their genetic material, meaning diagnostic tests may fail to catch them. Hence, we spent considerable effort developing a robust and sensitive test that can catch the viruses even when they change their genetic sequences,” said Tan Meng How, a researcher involved in the study, via an NTU press release. “In addition, frequent testing is essential for helping to break the transmission of viruses within populations, so we have developed our tests to be rapid and affordable, making them deployable in resource-poor settings.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New COVID-19 variants have been on people’s minds as vaccination programs roll out in many countries. Such new variants could lead to false negatives in certain diagnostic tests, inspiring this new test that is reportedly unaffected by genetic mutations within the virus. Other benefits include its rapid test time (30 minutes), low cost, and ease of use. The test does not require RNA purification, unlike the current gold standard PCR test, and can be performed with crude nasal samples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Called the Variant Nucleotide Guard (VaNGuard), the technology relies on the CRISPR system to recognize specific segments of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material and cut them out, using guide RNAs to recognize the sequences of interest. Once this has occurred, the snipped fragments start to glow, and this light can be detected using a microplate reader. &#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Combining two or more guide RNAs with the enzyme enAsCas12a ensures that if one of the guide RNAs fails to guide it to the correct segment of the virus because of a mutation, the other guide RNA can still &#8216;rescue&#8217; this mismatch,&#8221; said Tan Meng How. “If the virus is present, the molecule will glow. If not, it means the virus is not present to cause the hyper-activation of the molecular scissors.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers have incorporated the technology into an easy-to-use paper strip. To perform the test, a user mixes a crude nasopharyngeal sample with a reaction mix in a test tube, and then dips the paper strip into the tube. If only one band appears on the strip, the virus is not present, but two bands indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See an NTU Singapore video about the technology:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Team of scientists led by NTU Singapore develops test that detects COVID-19 even when it mutates\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cX9XxhgxxdQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Nature Communications</em>: <a href=\"https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/CorpComms2/Releases/NR2021/NR_210329_COVID-19%20Vanguard%20test/Vanguard%20test.pdf\">An engineered CRISPR-Cas12a variant and DNA-RNA hybrid guides enable robust and rapid COVID-19 testing</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=3393dded-9428-4bbd-8e15-f89a7984acd1\">NTU Singapore</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=uCpyiS6qLFc:pVOO0aJ7Cuc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=uCpyiS6qLFc:pVOO0aJ7Cuc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=uCpyiS6qLFc:pVOO0aJ7Cuc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=uCpyiS6qLFc:pVOO0aJ7Cuc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/uCpyiS6qLFc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 17:11:11 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-paper-test.jpg","linkMd5":"7442c07aa0f528e91ac7c592e3a1f32f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-11-293_58d5ccf973d86fb2.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":513,"sourceBytes":127494,"destBytes":16258,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-paper-test.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-11-293_58d5ccf973d86fb2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-450_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-452_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=uCpyiS6qLFc:pVOO0aJ7Cuc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-556_98e789d8665670d8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/uCpyiS6qLFc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn64@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-525_d892a8a9ffb83204.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425341465},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","title":"Micro-Aneurysm-On-A-Chip to Model Vascular Disease","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511136","description":"<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"alignright size-large\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aneurysm-on-a-chip.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511278\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aneurysm-on-a-chip.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aneurysm-on-a-chip-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aneurysm-on-a-chip-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>An international research collaboration, including teams from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), Brown University, and MIT, has developed an AI platform that can assess blood flow characteristics through microvasculature.

With this platform, we can now gain important mechanical information and insights into disease evolution mechanisms that were previously very cumbersome to extract.”</p> \n<p>To validate the AI platform, the researchers tested it using a chip that mimicked the micro-aneurysms that can occur in the diabetic eye, and modeled small, intermediate, and large aneurysms. The system successfully extrapolated a variety of blood flow parameters following imaging of the chip in full flow, including shear stress, speed, and pressure. This technology may be useful in diagnosing and monitoring real-life micro-aneurysms using images taken of such phenomena.</p> \n<p>“We tested our platform on microaneurysms, the earliest symptom of diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age diabetic patients globally,” said George Karniadakis, another researcher involved in the study. “Our ultimate goal is to use the platform in clinical settings for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis and prognosis as well as in other diseases involving impaired blood flow.” &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Suresh and Karniadakis hope that their technology may also be useful in diagnosing and monitoring other vascular disorders, and the system could be tested or trained using other microfluidic devices that mimic a variety of vascular issues.</p> \n<p>See a video about the technology below.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> \n  <iframe title=\"NTU, Brown and MIT scientists develop AI platform to assess blood vessel anomalies and eye disease\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUqQLTzr1FI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Study in <em>Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences</em>: <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511136/doi:%2010.1073/pnas.2100697118\">Artificial intelligence velocimetry and microaneurysm-on-a-chip for three-dimensional analysis of blood flow in physiology and disease</a></p> \n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=d0148cc3-59c5-4097-af0f-e3630cdf0063\">NTU Singapore</a></p> \n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8-->\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=MktsfhmtYqo:EV24rvj0-Pc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=MktsfhmtYqo:EV24rvj0-Pc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=MktsfhmtYqo:EV24rvj0-Pc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=MktsfhmtYqo:EV24rvj0-Pc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/MktsfhmtYqo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:50:15 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aneurysm-on-a-chip.jpg","linkMd5":"a815b8cd3136241a161157c3a78dd2dd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn39@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-17-985_f279b4888a43ae7c.webp","destWidth":466,"destHeight":466,"sourceBytes":195306,"destBytes":30734,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aneurysm-on-a-chip.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn39@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-17-985_f279b4888a43ae7c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-450_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-452_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=MktsfhmtYqo:EV24rvj0-Pc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-51-482_dbd18a1f80a0cdd7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/MktsfhmtYqo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn90@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-532_b0142b9dbd250483.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425341470},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","title":"Lab-Generated Heart Valves Grow Inside Body","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511065","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/valves-grow-in-body.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511075\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/valves-grow-in-body.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/valves-grow-in-body-300x269.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a tissue-engineered heart valve replacement that can grow within a patient. The breakthrough could allow children with congenital heart defects to avoid repeated surgeries to replace heart valves that they have outgrown. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create the valves, the researchers cultured donor cells in a fibrin gel within a bioreactor, allowing them to deposit a collagen matrix. They then removed the donor cells from the valve constructs before implanting them into lambs, where endogenous cells populated the valves and enabled them to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, children with heart defects who require a heart valve replacement typically receive one made using animal tissues that have been chemically treated. Such valves can malfunction because of calcification and cause significant inconvenience for their recipients as they don’t grow along with the heart. This means that a child may undergo as many as five open-heart surgeries to replace the valve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest technology has the potential to change this<em> status quo</em>. The researchers created new valves using donor cells that they seeded into a fibrin gel. They then cultured cells with growth nutrients in a bioreactor for a prolonged period, during which time the cells deposited a collagen matrix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a detergent, the researchers then removed the cells from the collagen construct, leaving an acellular tubular material that does not provoke an immune reaction. Fashioning the tubes into a closed ring with leaflets, the team created a heart valve replacement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a very short video showing the valve being repeatedly activated:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Pulse duplicator testing of the tri-tube heart valve\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zpRbFsAVofA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have tested their technology in lambs. When implanted into the pulmonary artery, the valves became populated by cells from the lamb, and grew over the space of one year to become the same size as a physiologically normal valve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We knew from previous studies that the engineered tubes have the capacity to regenerate and grow in a growing lamb model, but the biggest challenge was how to maintain leaflet function in a growing valved conduit that goes through 40 million cycles in a year,&#8221; said Zeeshan Syedain, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;When we saw how well the valves functioned for an entire year from young lamb to adult sheep, it was very exciting.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an echocardiogram of the valve after implantation into a sheep:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Echocardiogram testing of the tri-tube heart valve\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rme9CZgRgsg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a huge step forward in pediatric heart research,&#8221; said Robert Tranquillo, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;This is the first demonstration that a valve implanted into a large animal model, in our case a lamb, can grow with the animal into adulthood. We have a way to go yet, but this puts us much farther down the path to future clinical trials in children. We are excited and optimistic about the possibility of this actually becoming a reality in years to come.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>: <a href=\"https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/13/585/eabb7225\">Pediatric tri-tube valved conduits made from fibroblast-produced extracellular matrix evaluated over 52 weeks in growing lambs</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/lab-created-heart-valves-can-grow-recipient\">University of Minnesota</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=8vPnXI94DXM:wpGzgDqDk_4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=8vPnXI94DXM:wpGzgDqDk_4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=8vPnXI94DXM:wpGzgDqDk_4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=8vPnXI94DXM:wpGzgDqDk_4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/8vPnXI94DXM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 15:45:48 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/valves-grow-in-body.jpg","linkMd5":"a52c85cd12ea10d4f73053572219b31e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn31@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-14-616_9adcb477f2c4973b.webp","destWidth":466,"destHeight":418,"sourceBytes":195250,"destBytes":35646,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/valves-grow-in-body.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn31@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-14-616_9adcb477f2c4973b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-450_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-452_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=8vPnXI94DXM:wpGzgDqDk_4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn87@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-548_aca9143bb5f11720.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/8vPnXI94DXM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn7@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-457_111d034ef83b5b8b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425341475},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","title":"Polymer Technologies for Tissue Repair: Interview with Christophe Bancel, TISSIUM CEO","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1510835","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/poly-gel-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1510856\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/poly-gel-2.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/poly-gel-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/poly-gel-2-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tissium.com/\">TISSIUM</a>, a Paris-based medtech firm, has been named a French Tech 120 company for the 2021 program.

French Tech 120 is a program designed to support late-stage French startups that have the potential to become global leaders across a variety of technology verticals. A total of 120 companies are chosen to participate each year, and this will be TISSIUM’s second year in the program, which is being driven by the French government. Through this program, companies will have unlimited access to services in support of international development, funding, go-to-market needs and government-related issues—this support can come from government services or participating partner agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other advantage with this program is the opportunity we have to connect with other startups at a similar stage of growth, and facing similar challenges—we’re of course already acquainted with a lot of our peers but this offers another chance for collaboration and shared experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><strong><em>Please give us an overview of TISSIUM and its mission.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Christophe Bancel:</strong> Our mission at TISSIUM is to reinvent body repair and tissue repair following surgical procedures, and really change the thinking about these functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the most common methods being used to promote tissue repair are fundamentally traumatic to tissue that is affected. As an example, surgical sutures using a needle or staples, tacks and screws haven’t seen much innovation over the last decades, so the trauma triggered by the action is nearly the same as it was when the method was invented decades ago, and they were not invented for body repair, but by craftsmen using inert materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At TISSIUM, we are seeking to introduce truly atraumatic tissue repair—we want to change the process fundamentally, move it away from mechanical engineering and closer to human biology by designing reconstruction methods that support the body’s own repair patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><strong><em>How do your polymer technologies improve on existing treatment solutions or address unmet needs?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/poly-material.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1510854\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/poly-material.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/poly-material-231x300.jpg 231w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Christophe Bancel:</strong> As I mentioned, we are seeking to restore the form and function of damaged tissue by supporting the body’s pattern of repair, so we have developed a unique solution that combines a platform of proprietary, biomorphic, programmable polymers with tailored delivery and activation solutions, specifically designed for each procedure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of our devices or application methods require sutures, nails or bolts. Instead, our material is designed to be fixed to or seamlessly integrated into or around a patient’s tissues. And in application, using novel surgical techniques in open surgery, as well as with laparoscopic or eventually robotic approaches, our polymers allow for atraumatic procedures. Additionally, the polymer can be used in high resolution 3D printing for use as a guide or scaffold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential here is immense, it can be applied to a wide range of situations such as repairing nerves to solving phantom limb pain, or atraumatic hernia repair and the market is wide open here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><strong><em>Are the polymers and associated delivery devices easy for surgeons to use?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Christophe Bancel:</strong> Yes, we have created a system that can be incorporated smoothly into a surgeon’s established routine. We have developed a proprietary manufacturing process, and we designed and built our own manufacturing plant. The plant is ISO 13485:2016 certified and it can handle commercial capacity&#8211; it’s here that we produce ready-to-use, fully aseptic pre-filled syringes that are leveraged across our portfolio of devices, in association to dedicated devices specific to each procedure into a fully integrated solution. The syringes dispense the polymers and then they are activated and ‘set’ on-demand after a few seconds of exposure to a visible blue light.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/capsule-poly.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1510857\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/capsule-poly.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/capsule-poly-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/capsule-poly-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Please give us an overview of the applications for your products and the disease states they are useful in treating.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Christophe Bancel:</strong> The first markets we will focus on are sutureless peripheral nerve repair, atraumatic hernia repair, and high-pressure cardiovascular sealing &#8211; for each of these areas, we have already developed and industrialized products.

As the name suggests, this isn’t caused by alcohol abuse, but risk factors such as type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol play a role. At present, the standard technique to assess the liver for its fat content is to obtain a biopsy. This isn’t much fun for the patient, so a less invasive approach would be welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Lipid distribution in the liver provides crucial information for diagnosing fatty liver-associated liver diseases including cancer, and therefore, a noninvasive, label-free, quantitative modality is needed,&#8221; said Kyohei Okubo, a researcher involved in the study. “We have developed a method to visualize the distribution of lipids in the liver using a near-infrared spectral imaging technique that incorporates machine learning.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, researchers have used near-infrared hyperspectral imaging to image atherosclerotic plaques in the blood vessels of rabbits, and so these Japanese researchers hypothesized that it might be useful to assess the distribution of fatty acids in the liver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team tested the technique with mice that ate a normal diet or a high-fat diet, and were able to visualize the lipid distribution throughout their livers. They could even generate maps that showed the gradients of lipid density. A technique called the Folch extraction method helped the researchers to quantitatively measure the actual lipid content of each liver, and they found that their measurements obtained using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging correlated closely with these values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results suggest that the technique may be valuable in assessing suspected fatty liver in human patients, without the need for biopsy. For their study, the researchers imaged the mouse livers after they were removed from the mice, but it may be possible to image the liver <em>in situ</em>, minimally invasively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Biomedical Optics Express</em>: <a href=\"https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-12-2-823&#38;id=446511\">Visualization of quantitative lipid distribution in mouse liver through near-infrared hyperspectral imaging</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.tus.ac.jp/en/mediarelations/archive/20210324_1516.html\">Tokyo University of Science</a> &#160;</p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=ku4bRQJNO8U:VGVUv_2-60E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=ku4bRQJNO8U:VGVUv_2-60E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=ku4bRQJNO8U:VGVUv_2-60E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=ku4bRQJNO8U:VGVUv_2-60E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/ku4bRQJNO8U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 17:56:48 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/liver-content.jpg","linkMd5":"a0699f667fa663e5762ac1b3ddd5922e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-20-631_862140d51d05a79b.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":433,"sourceBytes":314360,"destBytes":68244,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/liver-content.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-20-631_862140d51d05a79b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-450_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-452_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=ku4bRQJNO8U:VGVUv_2-60E:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn82@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-51-735_9c37d1e28fdb6517.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/ku4bRQJNO8U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-582_c5c41336599c909e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425341471},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","title":"Mussel Protein Bioglue to Seal Fistulas Inside Body","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511195","description":"\n<p>Researchers at Pohang University of Science &#38; Technology in Korea have developed a bioglue, containing a mussel adhesive protein and hyaluronic acid, that can seal fistulas within the body. It works even on fistulas present in particularly challenging areas, such as the wall of the bladder. The researchers delivered the glue using a thin syringe, and showed that it could plug fistulas in the bladder walls of pigs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/imWIMBA.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511283\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/imWIMBA.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/imWIMBA-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/imWIMBA-768x343.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fistulas are abnormal openings between spaces in the body, such as between the bladder and surrounding organs and structures, including the intestine and vagina. Fistulas in the bladder can have a variety of complications, including urine leakage and fecal incontinence. The condition can be difficult to treat, and current solutions include suturing the opening, which can be hampered by the inaccessibility of the fistula. Moreover, the repeated expansion and contraction of the bladder wall can damage the sutured fistula and prevent healing. These issues have inspired these Korean researchers to develop a minimally invasive alternative in the form of a bioglue that can be delivered using a thin needle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Vesico-vaginal fistula is a disorder difficult to treat and it significantly impacts the patient&#8217;s quality of life,&#8221; said Professor Seokho Kang, a researcher involved in the study, in a press release. &#8220;We expect the newly developed treatment method to be applicable to minimally-invasive surgical methods such as robotic surgery and endoscopic surgery as well as open surgeries in the future based on its excellent water-immiscibility and underwater adhesion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The glue contains the mussel adhesive protein used by mussels to anchor themselves in place and catechol-conjugated hyaluronic acid. The glue demonstrates thixotropic properties, meaning that it is viscous at rest, but its viscosity decreases when shear force is applied, meaning that it can be syringed. It is also immiscible in water, and so can be applied even in very wet environments, such as the bladder. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have tested the technology in pigs with fistulas, and found that the material successfully plugged the holes over a sustained period, and adapted well to the expansion and contraction of the bladder wall. The glue biodegrades over time, allowing the fistula to heal itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have confirmed the mussel adhesive protein – a technology that originated in Korea – as an effective vesico-vaginal fistula treatment method by applying it to an actual vesico-vaginal fistula of a large animal model,&#8221; added Professor Hyung Joon Cha, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;It is anticipated to be successfully applicable to fistulas and perforations in other similar environments.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Acta Biomaterialia</em>: <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S174270612100132X?via%3Dihub\">Preclinical evaluation of a regenerative immiscible bioglue for vesico-vaginal fistula</a> &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://postech.ac.kr/eng/sealing-fistulas-with-regenerative-water-immiscible-bioglue/?pageds=1&#38;k=&#38;c=\">Pohang University of Science &#38; Technology</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=LWB9Cjyhw6c:fFUNHrwBLRw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=LWB9Cjyhw6c:fFUNHrwBLRw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=LWB9Cjyhw6c:fFUNHrwBLRw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=LWB9Cjyhw6c:fFUNHrwBLRw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/LWB9Cjyhw6c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 15:21:14 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/imWIMBA.jpg","linkMd5":"72d919daa729006f6dc65d513bf87942","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn28@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-02-599_796faeb2380d34b4.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":344,"sourceBytes":185893,"destBytes":36976,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/imWIMBA.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn28@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-02-599_796faeb2380d34b4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-450_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-452_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=LWB9Cjyhw6c:fFUNHrwBLRw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn73@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-648_89738dffd19d838d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/LWB9Cjyhw6c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-618_a5e5eca7bf0363be.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425341468},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","title":"Electrodiagnosis of Ocular Diseases Using Sensor-Enabled Contacts","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1510935","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/monitoring-contact-lens.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1510937\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/monitoring-contact-lens.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/monitoring-contact-lens-300x239.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/monitoring-contact-lens-768x612.jpg 768w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/monitoring-contact-lens-100x80.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Electroretinography is a common technique for diagnosing and following up on eye conditions such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. To perform an electroretinography exam, a device is placed against the eye that projects light onto it and measures the resulting electrical signals that are generated by the retina. Commercial electroretinography devices are rigid and require electrodes, often in the form of a hard contact lens, to touch the eye or the bulbar conjunctiva just underneath. This is irritating and unpleasant, and often requires general anesthesia or sedation to be administered, in addition to topical anesthesia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now researchers at Purdue University have unveiled a soft contact lens that is easy on the eye, provides superior electroretinography signal recordings, and that can be manufactured out of existing soft contacts. “This technology will be greatly beneficial to the painless diagnosis or early detection of many ocular diseases including glaucoma,” said Chi Hwan Lee, the lead scientist behind the new device, in a Purdue announcement. “Since the first conceptual invention by Leonardo da Vinci, there has been a great desire to utilize contact lenses for eye-wearable biomedical platforms.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology is possible thanks to developments in flexible electronics and a new way to print the sensor components, using wet adhesive bonding, onto a soft contact lens. While the new development aims to improve how electroretinograms are performed, other types of sensors should be able to be attached to contact lenses to provide additional capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This technology will allow doctors and scientists to better understand spontaneous retinal activity with significantly improved accuracy, reliability and user comfort,” added Pete Kollbaum, director of the Borish Center for Ophthalmic Research and an associate professor of optometry at Indiana University, who is leading clinical trials evaluating the new device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open access study in <em>Nature Communications</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21916-8\">All-printed stretchable corneal sensor on soft contact lenses for noninvasive and painless ocular electrodiagnosis</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q1/soft-contact-lenses-eyed-as-new-solutions-to-monitor-ocular-diseases.html\">Purdue</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=-U76TnKIw10:FPjqq5emAa0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=-U76TnKIw10:FPjqq5emAa0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=-U76TnKIw10:FPjqq5emAa0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=-U76TnKIw10:FPjqq5emAa0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/-U76TnKIw10\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 19:09:35 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/monitoring-contact-lens.jpg","linkMd5":"9ad581566cf3f21a1884f5230b7b0e97","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn8@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-12-106_6a270d4d1ad6d3e5.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":614,"sourceBytes":387681,"destBytes":28756,"author":"Medgadget Editors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/monitoring-contact-lens.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn8@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-12-106_6a270d4d1ad6d3e5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-450_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-452_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=-U76TnKIw10:FPjqq5emAa0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn57@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-693_144485aa153728c3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/-U76TnKIw10":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn80@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-525_47ca08f10ecc928d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425341475},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","title":"Hope, Resilience & Healing in the COVID-19 Era: A Virtual Conference Report","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511326","description":"\n<p>Well-being and health cannot solely rely upon symptomatic treatment. In fact, “good health” cannot be truly achieved unless the root causes of dis-eases are addressed. Even more ideal is the approach of preventative and integrative medicine, in which lifestyle and behavior changes are made holistically, in conjunction with any necessary treatments, such that balance and health can be achieved in parallel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From March 24 to 27th, some of the world’s foremost integrative health and medicine practitioners gathered for a virtual conference entitled “Hope, Resilience and Healing in the COVID-19 Era.” During the conference, healthcare professionals and experts shared their unique perspectives on challenges and best practices in treating the physical, mental, and emotional health aspects of COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-conference.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511397\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-conference.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-conference-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-conference-768x312.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured in this three-day virtual conference were multidisciplinary folks, consisting of integrative medicine clinicians and researchers working on the frontlines. A few of the panelists included Deepak Chopra, Shamini Jain, Adam Blanning, Patrick Hanaway, Brad Jacobs, Wayne Jonas, Joe Pizzorno, Beverly Rubik, Lise Van Susteren, Cassie Vieten, Tabatha Parker, and Mimi Guarneri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topics covered included:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Finding balance in a time of COVID-19 (led by Deepak Chopra, MD and Mimi Guarneri, MD, FACC, ABOIM)</li><li>Long-hauler syndrome and healing in a post-Covid world</li><li>How healthcare providers can balance allopathic (or conventional) and integrative medicine practices in treating COVID patients</li><li>How does the isolation of a pandemic impact patient outcomes? How do integrative medicine practitioners, who have always considered social, mental and emotional aspects of health, adjust?</li><li>The contributions of anthroposophic medicine to the integrative treatment of COVID-19 patients</li><li>Well-being, immunity and resilience: tips for thriving in the new normal</li><li>Nutritional interventions for immune health&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</li><li>The psychological toll of pandemic stress</li><li>A functional medicine approach to COVID-19</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the world has spent its time in lockdown over the past year, and while technology has helped facilitate interactions between estranged friends and family (and even strangers), the long-term effects of being in this unnatural state of society have started to appear. Many unique technological solutions in terms of medical treatments and diagnostics have also been developed over the past year to directly aid in physical health, but that is only one aspect of the picture. Mental, emotional, and spiritual health are the other aspects &#8211; these matters are just as, or even more important than physical health in many cases, especially because we will continue to see the impacts of COVID-19 extending beyond physical health and recovery for years to come. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we really appreciated about this conference was its focus on exploring ways to enhance quality of life holistically, through hope, integrative medicine, and supportive care. Of note, the conference topics specifically did not involve the vaccine or any related recommendations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 treatments were shared by physicians and scientists who have done their homework on available peer-reviewed, scientific literature. It was very eye-opening to hear about various treatments beneficial to patients in a holistic sense, as well as other anecdotal lived experiences without the usual news filter, since this was intended for a selected audience. It’s great to see a forum where a mix of modern, scientific medicine can be combined with traditional and integrative medicine approaches in a refreshing, down-to-earth way &#8211; the questions at hand really are: what can we do as individuals? What can we do as a healthcare community? What can we do as fellow human beings for one another? How can spirituality and humanism help heal the world? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many scientific studies supporting the benefits of mental health and general well-being directly on immunity, and it’s important that the psychological toll and stress of the pandemic are also being addressed in patients. As one example of an integrative medicine approach, Deepak Chopra took conference attendees through a guided meditation &#8211; these sorts of exercises can help in finding balance for all kinds of populations. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/divider-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511404\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about the conference and speakers <a href=\"https://aihm.org/conference/\">here</a>.&#160;</p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=IxHUNx7o-ZU:2brGhBabfzM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=IxHUNx7o-ZU:2brGhBabfzM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=IxHUNx7o-ZU:2brGhBabfzM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=IxHUNx7o-ZU:2brGhBabfzM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/IxHUNx7o-ZU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 20:02:01 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-conference.jpg","linkMd5":"3df729a0913cc9590136d7bca11c72dd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn3@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-49-025_6be4d90571e6b94e.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":313,"sourceBytes":210346,"destBytes":32884,"author":"Alice Ferng","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid-conference.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn3@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-49-025_6be4d90571e6b94e.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/divider-5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn67@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-51-538_ce9c1af865a37300.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-450_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-452_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=IxHUNx7o-ZU:2brGhBabfzM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn22@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-51-483_e32f6f9c17095437.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/IxHUNx7o-ZU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn19@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-636_5817a0187a2fa54d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425341467},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","title":"Ultrasound Technology to Decode Brain Activity for Brain Machine Interfaces","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511127","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ultrasound-of-brain.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511130\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ultrasound-of-brain.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ultrasound-of-brain-300x235.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ultrasound-of-brain-768x602.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Caltech have developed a non-invasive functional ultrasound system that can detect brain activity by listening to tiny changes in blood flow within the brain. The system could provide a viable alternative to invasive electrodes that are implanted into the brain for brain machine interfaces, such as those used in prosthetics. So far, the system can detect the brain activity corresponding to a specific body movement in non-human primates, before the movement occurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brain machine interfaces hold significant promise for those with paralysis in controlling a variety of assistive technologies, such as wheelchairs and prosthetic devices. However, the need to implant electrodes in the brain may give many pause for thought. This latest study has shown that functional ultrasound may be a viable alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Invasive forms of brain-machine interfaces can already give movement back to those who have lost it due to neurological injury or disease,&#8221; said Sumner Norman, a researcher involved in the study, in a Caltech announcement. &#8220;Unfortunately, only a select few with the most severe paralysis are eligible and willing to have electrodes implanted into their brain. Functional ultrasound is an incredibly exciting new method to record detailed brain activity without damaging brain tissue. We pushed the limits of ultrasound neuroimaging and were thrilled that it could predict movement. What&#8217;s most exciting is that functional ultrasound is a young technique with huge potential – this is just our first step in bringing high performance, less invasive BMI to more people.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UltraSonicMapping-med.width-450-1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511132\"/><figcaption>Details of the vasculature in the non-human primate brain, imaged using functional ultrasound.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The new technique involves implanting a small ultrasound-transparent window in the skull (<a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2021/02/clear-cranial-implant-allows-ultrasound-imaging-of-brain-interview-with-ceo-of-longeviti-neuro-solutions.html\">here&#8217;s an example</a>), which is significantly less invasive than directly implanted electrodes. The ultrasound signals can then non-invasively pass into the brain and identify increases in blood flow in specific brain regions. So far, the technology has been tested in its potential to help decode intentions to move in non-human primates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The first milestone was to show that ultrasound could capture brain signals related to the thought of planning a physical movement,&#8221; said David Maresca, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;Functional ultrasound imaging manages to record these signals with 10 times more sensitivity and better resolution than functional MRI. This finding is at the core of the success of brain-machine interfacing based on functional ultrasound.&#8221; &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Neuron</em>: <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(21)00151-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627321001513%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">Single-trial decoding of movement intentions using functional ultrasound neuroimaging</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/reading-minds-with-ultrasound-a-less-invasive-technique-to-decode-the-brains-intentions\">Caltech</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=lA8Z4cNjYtg:Rf2lP30O0Mw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=lA8Z4cNjYtg:Rf2lP30O0Mw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=lA8Z4cNjYtg:Rf2lP30O0Mw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=lA8Z4cNjYtg:Rf2lP30O0Mw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/lA8Z4cNjYtg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 15:36:53 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ultrasound-of-brain.jpg","linkMd5":"5ecad0d00be582699b14c824b0abb180","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-05-126_e326e4d2df216cf5.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":604,"sourceBytes":224309,"destBytes":39504,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ultrasound-of-brain.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-49-05-126_e326e4d2df216cf5.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UltraSonicMapping-med.width-450-1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn28@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-49-54-068_45db7509aea2f77d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-51-450_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-49-51-452_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=lA8Z4cNjYtg:Rf2lP30O0Mw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-51-592_46fd61d8636325c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/lA8Z4cNjYtg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn52@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-04-230_b54969b87544f9dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425341479},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:01","title":"Medical Robotics and The Future of Surgery: Interview with Tracy Accardi, VP of R&D for Medtronic Surgical Robotics","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1510555","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/touchsurgery.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1510765\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/touchsurgery.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/touchsurgery-300x172.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/touchsurgery-768x440.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Medtronic has been a key player in the minimally invasive surgery space for the last few decades, and has made great strides more<a href=\"https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/robotic-assisted-surgery/surgical-robotics.html?sfdcid=7014O000001JF3G&#38;cid=PPC:GOOG:%2Bmedtronic%20%2Brobot%20%2Bsurgery:ras-hugo&#38;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6PD3BRDPARIsAN8pHuEi-RD4q0BtjD1JfF9qpKS6LPROYTPJY9rZkVbi3x4h4hpkyPQukYAaAnt_EALw_wcB\"> recently in robotic surgery</a> with last year’s acquisition of Digital Surgery.

And I look for a challenge in any opportunity that I go after because I get a lot of satisfaction in making challenging things happen. I came into the surgical robotics team about two years ago, and I think through every opportunity very carefully, and it was just really compelling to me to think about Medtronic with its strengths in the instrumentation side for laparoscopy. Combining that knowledge with customer relationships in a soft tissue robot could meet some of the needs that are not being met by other soft tissue robots in the space today. So it was all about the opportunity and the challenge for me with something that I knew would be hard to accomplish and take a lot of work, but that would have a big impact.<br><br><strong><em>Medgadget: I also love those seemingly impossible problems – those are always the most fun to tackle and solve. Can you elaborate on some of the biggest challenges that people think can&#8217;t be conquered in soft tissue robotics?<br></em></strong><br><strong>Ms. Accardi: </strong>Well, if you look at robotic surgery today, we have less than 3% of surgeries around the world being done with the assistance of robots. And digging into why that&#8217;s true, you come out with some very clear challenges and opportunities around Cost of Ownership, around modularity or flexibility, ability to swap rooms, or ability to quickly turn rooms over so that robots can have a higher level of utilization. And I think those two barriers (modularity and flexibility) were things that we set out from the very beginning to accomplish as a part of our design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, we think that hospitals use the robotic system about once a day, and we set out from the very beginning to design a robot that would enable more value and ability to help patients. So we&#8217;re very excited about what our modular design will bring to that equation for cost, access, and ability to utilize the equipment. And then we&#8217;re building on a really strong reputation and customer satisfaction that we&#8217;ve experienced on the instrumentation side to make our instruments in the robotic space a very comfortable transition for someone who&#8217;s used us in lap.<br><br><strong><em>Medgadget: How do you pick which modules you&#8217;re going to build and how do you prioritize that? What&#8217;s your design process like?<br></em></strong><br><strong>Ms. Accardi: </strong>It starts with interviewing hundreds and hundreds of physicians and hospital executives to understand what their challenges are. And then we kind of break it down into questions such as: “What&#8217;s driving the wrong behaviors today?” “Why is it so difficult to change a room over between patients?” “How could you look at ways to make that process better?” So we go into detail in each of the areas that we identified through the interviews, and it all starts with a very customer centric design process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve made sure to talk to people that use robotics today, and those that haven&#8217;t yet. And we have asked ones that haven&#8217;t yet: why not yet and what are the obstacles that you perceive? And we came out with a few key design elements. One was around flexibility; we wanted a design that would be modular &#8211; when I say modular, I mean, components within the system that can be used or exchanged with other components. For example, we have four robotic arm carts that can be used in any combination. And they can be used in both robotically assisted surgeries as well as laparoscopic surgeries, which we thought was really important. It&#8217;s a system that can be upgraded over time, so that you know that you are buying something that will continue to add value over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we heard loud and clearly that we needed to stay compatible with the trusted surgical instrumentation portfolio that we already offer. We also heard from a lot of surgeons about the cognitive loading that happens in robotic surgery, the amount of energy that a surgeon has to put into understanding everything that&#8217;s going on. So we&#8217;ve looked at ways to incorporate analytics that can inform decision making for them and make it easier for them to provide a standard of care that&#8217;s consistent between surgeons and surgeries, so that access to quality care is possible for all the patients involved. Then we also heard very strongly that hospitals and physicians were looking for partnerships here, and not to be a vendor-supplier kind of relationship, but instead, to really get in and understand how they can optimize system utilization and how we can help them with ongoing training. Whether it&#8217;s training at the beginning, or ongoing with different staff members going in and out of the operating room (OR), so we&#8217;ve built a team with a dedicated field engineer as well as systems specialists that will really be there to partner with the surgeons and use the robot.<br><br><strong><em>Medgadget: I&#8217;m curious to learn how you managed the cognitive load of surgeons and how you reduced that load – are there metrics that you use? How do you model these issues?<br></em></strong><br><strong>Ms. Accardi:</strong> So a large part of this comes in through the work that we&#8217;re doing with our <a href=\"https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/robotic-assisted-surgery/digital-surgery.html\">Digital Surgery</a> teammates &#8211; Digital Surgery being a company that we acquired about a year ago that I&#8217;ve integrated into the surgical robotics team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They understand an awful lot about how procedure steps flow, and different amounts of times that different users might bend in different steps, and potentially even different orders that surgeons might do procedural steps in. They&#8217;re then able to use that information to help surgeons understand how they could be potentially more efficient by looking at how others are doing the same procedure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with sharing the information that the surgeons are gathering in each of their surgeries, they can compare notes with each other and drive some conversations about that. We see the ability to use analytics to do things like indicating critical structures. Don&#8217;t go here, there&#8217;s a large nerve bundle there, or make sure you&#8217;re seeing everything within your field of view. And even using some general coaching through the robot to help avoid putting instruments where they shouldn&#8217;t be, you&#8217;re having them be energized when they shouldn&#8217;t be in the surgical field. So there are a lot of ways to just use the multitude of information that&#8217;s available, and understand which procedure sets have the best outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ras-platform.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1510766\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ras-platform.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ras-platform-300x173.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ras-platform-768x443.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget</em></strong><em><strong>: It’s pretty clear AI will play a big role in RAS and the future of med tech – can you elaborate more on this from your perspective?</strong></em><br><br><strong>Ms. Accardi: </strong>Yes, AI has a major role in robotic assisted surgery. I think a robotic system without AI obviously has value on its own, but when you can combine the AI with the robotic system, it&#8217;s really a force multiplier. I get really excited about solutions that can provide information that&#8217;s either not visible currently or knowable even to the user that could reduce or eliminate unwarranted variability or human error, and over time on it, maybe even automate certain decisions or tasks so that there&#8217;s less for the surgeon to have to think about. We think, at Medtronic, that data analytics and AI will continue to help streamline our processes for clinicians and standardize the quality of care. Like I mentioned, we see this already with the touch surgery enterprise platform that we launched last year with Digital Surgery. And I think you&#8217;ll see us continue to share digital and AI technologies with both our laparoscopic and future robotic solutions. The goal is to lower per procedure costs, while increasing patient access to care and reducing variability – those three things just fit really well when you have all the data that the digital Touch Surgery Enterprise platform can combine along with the algorithms that we&#8217;re developing.<br><br><strong><em>Medgadget: Can you please tell me more about the surgery enterprise system?<br></em></strong><br><strong>Ms. Accardi:</strong> As a high-level explanation, I should say is that it&#8217;s a very easy to use our surgical video capture solution that&#8217;s paired with a computer and then connected to the cloud. And it automatically generates the data and analytics about procedure time. It takes account of the instruments the surgeon uses and offers valuable insights with built in AI that anonymizes any sensitive frames so you don&#8217;t have to worry about that. And it gives surgeons at the office the ability to upload surgical videos automatically broken down into the procedure, and then they can either put that directly on their phone or into their computer in minutes. It was developed by the team at Digital Surgery, and by participation in cooperation with a number of surgeons that were trying to do it the old fashioned way, if you want to say it that way, you know, they either recorded the whole video and then had to break it down and anonymize it themselves, or they had to find some convoluted USB drive way to move it from one place to another, and all that that entails. So this has been on the market now since around September and the early adopters of Touch Surgery Enterprise tells us it&#8217;s transformational, that it&#8217;s really helping them to improve or efficiency and is very valuable in training. It&#8217;s actually even a patient engagement opportunity, because patients can see what the surgery that they&#8217;re going to be experienced could look like ahead of time, and for some people, that&#8217;s really reassuring. For me, that&#8217;s the kind of thing I like to be able to see before, but not everybody might want to do that. But it&#8217;s just really great to see the training and patient engagement impacts with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: What is your vision for Medtronic’s long-term future in surgical robotics? What’s possible?<br></em></strong><br><strong>Ms. Accardi: </strong>I personally very much believe in the concept that an ideal robot can be thought of today with an eye toward an ideal robot of tomorrow. So in other words, I feel like it&#8217;s going to be a big transition – an evolution that we make. It&#8217;s really critical to design systems that can add value and solve the problems we have now. And while we&#8217;re doing that, getting that in the hands of our surgeons and being used on patients around the world that will be gathering information and learning from the machine – the non-clinical data, the clinical data, and all the things that we&#8217;ll be able to leverage for future solutions. So I think we&#8217;ll see a progression through different levels of automation on non-clinical tasks taking place during and around the surgery, while automation of clinical tasks at any level will probably take a little bit longer and coming along and will be highly dependent on both the rate at which the necessary surgical data can be collected and repetitiveness of the task. I think as long as we keep an eye on those and continue to collect the data that will help us improve the algorithms, then I think that the whole future of surgical robotics will be very much driven by the surgeons and the patient needs and the confidence that they develop in this kind of solution. So, I think that surgical robotics will continue to enable access to better care, and I mostly think about that by reducing variability and having better outcomes. Ultimately, it can be at a lower overall total cost of ownership. But I think, you know, bottom line, one day we won&#8217;t say robotic surgery, we&#8217;ll just say “surgery,” and it won&#8217;t seem like a big divide between the two spaces. I look forward to that day.<br><br><strong><em>Medgadget: Let’s say in the next 10 years we solve the issues you’ve highlighted and perfect the robotic solutions &#8211; what do you envision the role of the surgeon being then?<br></em></strong><br><strong>Ms. Accardi:</strong> You know, I think that&#8217;s a great question. And I get that question a lot. I think that first, I think it&#8217;s a much longer timeframe than 10 years. So we&#8217;re at “Nirvana” &#8211; but I also think that it will be: we&#8217;ll have done it right when everything we can do to simplify the process for the patient and the physician has been accomplished and outcomes are really strong. I personally believe there will always be a surgeon paired with a robot, and I think there will always be a role for the surgeon to account for the variability between patients, the things that can happen that haven&#8217;t happened before and need an immediate kind of triage to make better. I do not see in any way a replacement in the soft tissue space of surgeons, I just think that it&#8217;ll always be a very strong partnership.<br><br><strong>Medgadget: Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to add or emphasize?<br></strong><br><strong>Ms. Accardi: </strong>I want to go back to the comment that I made at the very beginning when I was talking about even why I decided to join Medtronic on this mission. Medtronic has been the global leader in minimally invasive surgery for a long time for decades. I had other opportunities, I&#8217;ll just say, and I couldn&#8217;t be at another company when there exists so strongly the critical part Medtronic plays on the instrumentation side and a new offering that includes resources for the mission to do a robot in parallel. I&#8217;m super excited about bringing all of that together in the surgical robotics space and expanding quality care. So I just wanted to stress that again, because it&#8217;s why I get excited about what I do every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img
