The idea is that you’d subscribe to xCloud and be able to stream a huge library of games to a number of different devices, including mobile devices complete with <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/04/xcloud-touch-controls-gears-5-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-launch/\">custom virtual controls</a> and controller support. So if you’re guts-deep in <em>Gears of War 5</em> on your Xbox or PC, you could seamlessly transition to playing on your mobile device when you were out and about and all your progress would carry over. With Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/04/project-xcloud-release-date-launch-country-list-games-android-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/\">recent announcement</a> that xCloud would be bundled up with their excellent Game Pass Ultimate subscription service, this was shaping up to be a huge breakthrough in the types of gaming experiences that would be offered to mobile device owners. Sadly, this sort of thing flies against Apple’s App Store guidelines, and so just yesterday Microsoft <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/05/microsoft-ends-xcloud-on-ios/\">officially ended</a> the xCloud iOS beta test prematurely and announced that they’d be focusing solely on supporting Android for the service’s launch on September 15th. </p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KCtXJUekyo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>That decision has certainly soured a number of iOS device owners, including yours truly. Well today Apple has spoken out about the matter and states that the main point of contention for allowing the Game Pass app into the App Store is that Apple requires that each individual game be reviewed by them prior to being available in the store. Here is an official statement that Apple <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8\">provided to BusinessInsider</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> “The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.\"</p> \n <p>“Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.\"</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>It’s kind of hard to not laugh out loud at the above statement, given the sort of things that have snuck through Apple’s approval process over the years, and given how profoundly unevenly those guidelines are applied to different developers. I do understand their point of view, but to not be willing to find some sort of solution for something like xCloud or Google’s Stadia, which is also not allowed on iOS, just seems incredibly shortsighted.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270630\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270501\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7D196781-A674-4BCB-B2BA-180DE8E7F204.jpeg 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7D196781-A674-4BCB-B2BA-180DE8E7F204-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7D196781-A674-4BCB-B2BA-180DE8E7F204-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7D196781-A674-4BCB-B2BA-180DE8E7F204-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Development costs in the console and PC space are ballooning out of control, and users don’t seem very receptive to paying more per game to make up for those increased costs. Some titles on next gen consoles will be selling for $70 instead of the normal $60 (and $50 the gen before that), but in reality they probably should be selling for $100 or more due to how expensive they are to make nowadays, and oftentimes a game’s base cost + DLC + Season Pass type stuff does end up in the over $100 range. But when you can pay $15 a month for access to more than 100 games on xCloud, which you can also seamlessly play across a variety of different platforms, it seems like a no brainer compared to the old way of buying games individually. I really think this will be the future of gaming, and Apple is going to be left behind if they don’t find some sort of solution for things like xCloud.</p> \n<p>Oh, and if you’re wondering why Apple requires that they approve every game for xCloud but they don’t subject every show or movie to an approval process for a service like Netflix, BusinessInsider thought of that too and asked Apple about it. Their answer is that it’s the choice of medium, and that movies and shows are passive entertainment while video games are fully interactive entertainment. And that… makes a difference, I guess?</p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270630\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1147\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270490\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/96FEAE15-626A-4F6F-B096-B8B585F89DE7.jpeg 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/96FEAE15-626A-4F6F-B096-B8B585F89DE7-300x168.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/96FEAE15-626A-4F6F-B096-B8B585F89DE7-768x430.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/96FEAE15-626A-4F6F-B096-B8B585F89DE7-1024x574.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>I do find it interesting that Apple mentions using a web browser as a way to reach iOS users without going through the App Store. Web browsers have come an incredibly long way and are capable of much more than just browsing the web, so I could see it being possible to stream xCloud games through a browser on your iOS device. The problem is that I know for a fact that the experience wouldn’t be as good as a dedicated app, otherwise we’d all just access everything on our devices through the web browser. But at least it would be something.</p> \n<p>For their part, Microsoft still desires to have xCloud available on iOS someday, and states: “It’s our ambition to scale cloud gaming through Xbox Game Pass available on all devices, but we have nothing further to share at this time regarding iOS.\" Hopefully this does get resolved somehow in the future, but in the meantime, xCloud and Game Pass are going to be major parts of my gaming future and without support for iOS I’m now in the market for an Android device.</p> \n<p>[via <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8\">BusinessInsider</a>]</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 23:28:08 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7D196781-A674-4BCB-B2BA-180DE8E7F204.jpeg","linkMd5":"4d7fab99b7eeb39b623463beaf8156d2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_3/2020-08-10/1597037886499_2e5b354540610f6e.webp","author":"Jared Nelson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270630":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-10 13:37:26","updatedTime":"2020-08-10 13:37:26","title":"Facebook’s ‘Facebook Gaming’ App Has Finally Launched on iOS without Games due to App Store Policies","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270654","description":"<p><a class=\"app-icon\" href=\"/games/facebook-gaming\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;\"><img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1496439256/100x100bb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a> If the <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/05/microsoft-ends-xcloud-on-ios/\">last few days</a> of Apple’s <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/06/apples-statement-regarding-xcloud-on-ios/\">App Store policies</a> and Microsoft’s xCloud weren’t enough for Apple, even Facebook has called out the company’s policies today with the release of its gaming app. Facebook’s <em>Facebook Gaming</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1496439256?mt=8\">(Free)</a> app has finally launched on iOS after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FacebookGaming/status/1291708749808197633\">months of rejections</a> without any games included. The <em>Facebook Gaming</em> app allows users to watch streams and play games on Android. On iOS, the mini games aren’t included thanks to Apple’s App Store policies. These games are also included in the <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2017/05/02/facebook-messenger-games-go-global-with-more-than-50-games-available/\">main Facebook apps like Messenger</a> but have been buried in the iOS apps for years according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios\">statements made by Facebook to The Verge</a>. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270654\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-270659\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/B544C71E-8D99-46E1-B582-877E2F9AB090.png 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/B544C71E-8D99-46E1-B582-877E2F9AB090-300x169.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/B544C71E-8D99-46E1-B582-877E2F9AB090-768x432.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/B544C71E-8D99-46E1-B582-877E2F9AB090-1024x576.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Facebook even tried to use Apple’s new appeal process for <em>Facebook Gaming</em> but didn’t receive a response as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios\">confirmed to The Verge</a>. After months of rejections, Facebook removed the actual games from <em>Facebook Gaming</em> and only release it as an app for watching streams like <em>Twitch</em>.

Apple’s <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/06/apples-statement-regarding-xcloud-on-ios/\">statement to Business Insider</a> is hilarious given some of the kinds of games and apps the company approves.

It ended up being a busier day than I expected, and I think I’ll be going home late tonight as a result. Oh well! We’ve got a few news bits for you before we get into the big list of new releases for the day. There’s also a decent number of sales to check out, though that will obviously get bigger in the next few hours. Let’s have a look!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>Surprise! ‘Pikmin 3 Deluxe’ Hits Switch October 30th</strong></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aSSQ0Z6eDhU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>Well, would you look at that? We finally have another first-party game on the schedule. It’s<em> Pikmin 3 Deluxe</em>, a fancy port of the Wii U game. It includes all of the DLC, some added story content, a bunch of new options, and more. The game will launch on October 30th for $59.99, which is probably fine since somewhere around twenty-five people bought it on the Wii U back in the day. Less than fine? Nintendo has delisted the Wii U version from its eShop alongside this announcement, so you can no longer buy a digital copy for $20 on that dearly departed system. I mean, I get it, but I really dislike it when Nintendo does that. Oh well, Hallowe’en <em>Pikmin</em> ho!</p> \n<p><strong>The Next ‘Tetris 99’ Maximus Cup Brings Back Some Faves</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270590\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tetris99maximus16th.jpg 1024w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tetris99maximus16th-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tetris99maximus16th-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Wow, is it time for yet another new Maximus Cup event in <em>Tetris 99</em>? But… there are no new games to promote! Worry not, friends: this one is a catch-up event. The 16th Maximus Cup event is called Second Chance Edition, and it runs from Friday August 14th to Saturday August 22nd. A week is a lot longer than previous Maximus Cup events, but there’s a good reason. You see, this event is your chance to earn three themes from previous events: <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>, and <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>. Moreover, it only takes 50 event points this time instead of 100. <em>Animal Crossing</em> kicks off the event, running from the 14th to the 16th.<em> Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> picks up from there, running through the 19th. <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> caps it off, taking the reins from the 20th to the 22nd. And for those of us who <em>already</em> have those themes? I, uh, guess we can take the time off?</p> \n<p><strong>‘King of Fighters R-2’ and ‘Samurai Shodown! 2’ Arrive Tomorrow</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270591\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2title.jpg 1200w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2title-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2title-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2title-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>The next two NEOGEO Pocket Color releases from SNK will arrive on the eShop tomorrow. <em>King of Fighters R-2</em> is a pocket-sized version of SNK’s famous fighting series, and is being re-released for the first time since its initial launch on the company’s ill-fated handheld. <em>Samurai Shodown! 2</em> was already available on the Switch through select pre-orders of the new<em> Samurai Shodown</em> game, but will now be available for anyone to buy. Assuming the games follow in the footsteps of <em>Gals’ Fighters</em>, they’ll cost $7.99 apiece. Do the <em>Metal Slug</em> games next, please!</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Swimsanity! ($24.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270592\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/swimsanity.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/swimsanity-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/swimsanity-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/swimsanity-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Lots of multiplayer games coming out today. This is one of those ones you really shouldn’t play solo, but support for both local and online multiplayer at least makes it easier to find someone to play with. Anyway, this is a side-scrolling action game of sorts where you’re generally being chased by a giant creature of some kind and need to defeat it while avoiding other hazards. There are multiple modes of play that slightly alter the rules, but the core action doesn’t change that much. It’s surprisingly fun and quite tense, though it’s really hard to make any progress when you’re playing alone. Up to four players can join in, but even have a second player makes a big difference. I like it a fair bit. Perhaps you will too.</p> \n<h3><strong>Drink More Glurp ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270593\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/drinkmoreglurp.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/drinkmoreglurp-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/drinkmoreglurp-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/drinkmoreglurp-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>If there’s one thing Switch players love, it’s multiplayer games with weird characters who control awkwardly and flail around in amusing ways. Up to twenty, I repeat twenty, players can get in on this one locally, enjoying some silly alien interpretations of human sports where sponsors will cut in at any moment despite the chaos it may cause. You control each character’s arms using the sticks of the controller and need to move around that way. There is a single-player challenge mode for whenever you don’t have anyone around to play with, but the heart of the game is in gathering a group and enjoying the laughs that ensue. Ten bucks seems like a good price for what it offers. This recommendation has been brought to you by Glurp ™.</p> \n<h3><strong>Arcade Archives Circus Charlie ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270594\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arcadearchivescircuscharlie.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arcadearchivescircuscharlie-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arcadearchivescircuscharlie-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Konami’s 1984 release<em> Circus Charlie</em> joins the<em> Arcade Archives</em> line-up, bringing its circus-themed action to the Switch with the usual Hamster quality. It offers a few different types of events, and while it’s a bit thin on gameplay depth it still has some fans out there. Personally, I really strongly dislike circus settings, so I’ll be keeping as far away from this game as I always have. But it’s cool to see some of the lesser-known Konami games getting done. It gives me hope we’ll see some really deep cuts in the future.</p> \n<h3><strong>Titan Glory ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270595\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/titanglory.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/titanglory-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/titanglory-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/titanglory-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>I’ll give Atypical Games this much: they create some real lookers for such low-priced affairs. This is their latest, and it’s also available on mobile for the same price. It’s a mech combat game where you need to upgrade and unlock 12 different mechs and head into battles in order to win tournaments and take home cash prizes. Surprisingly, the game has support for up to twelve players via online multiplayer. There are six different arenas to battle in, and a fair number of weapons to pick and choose from. I’m not sure how deep it is relative to other mech combat games, but it’s five dollars. Not sure how much you really ought to expect at that price.</p> \n<h3><strong>Memory Lane ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270596\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/memorylane.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/memorylane-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/memorylane-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/memorylane-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Aw heck, it’s… wait, it’s <em>not</em> Sabec. <em>Hunh</em>. Okay, <em>well</em>. You remember those memory matching games where you flip over two cards and try to find matching pairs? You probably played this as a kid, maybe in school when the teacher had a hangover and couldn’t be bothered to come up with a better activity to fill the lesson time with. <em>Cough</em>. Anyway, that’s this game! There are four different card sets to choose from! Over 150 cards in total! A bit of trivia! You could probably buy a real set of cards for around the same price as this and could, you know, use them for other games! <em>The exclamation mark key on my keyboard is stuck right now!!!</em></p> \n<h3><strong>Crowdy Farm Rush ($5.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270597\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crowdyfarmrush.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crowdyfarmrush-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crowdyfarmrush-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/crowdyfarmrush-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Okay, fixed the keyboard. The <em>Crowdy Farm</em> saga continues in this epic action-puzzler. Guide animals to their homes by drawing a path, but be careful they don’t collide with each other. There are more than 100 levels to play, with each one throwing a more difficult mix of animals to manage at you. Somehow up to four players can join in via local multiplayer, if you feel like making things ten times more difficult. If this sounds a lot like the mobile classic <em>Flight Control,</em> you’re not far from the truth. But this one has pigs and chickens instead of airplanes and helicopters, so advantage:<em> Crowdy Farm</em>.</p> \n<h3><strong>KukkoroDays ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270598\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kukkorodays.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kukkorodays-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kukkorodays-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kukkorodays-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>The latest in Qureate’s line of slightly fetish-y visual novels sees you playing a schlub who lives in Japan’s Akihabara district, home to some of the biggest geeks and nerds in the world. Your everyday life is thrown into disarray one day when a magic circle appears in your apartment and an injured female knight comes out of it. Her name is Cattleya and I’ve got <em>absolutely no</em> <em>jokes</em> to make about any part of that name and its potential correlation to her chest size. Anyway, until she finds a way home, you’re stuck with her. Hilarity ensues as this fish out of water learns to love the new world she’s in. Will she ever figure out how to get home? And if she does… will she <em>want</em> to? Eight bucks will give you the answer. By the way, ‘<em>Kukkoro</em>‘ refers to a cliche in Japanese manga/anime where a prideful female knight is captured by the enemy and utters the phrase “<em>k-kill me</em>\" for reasons we can’t discuss on a family website. This kind of situation excites some people.</p> \n<h3><strong>112th Seed ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270599\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/112thseed.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/112thseed-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/112thseed-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/112thseed-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>A small-sized puzzle platformer at a reasonably low price,<em> 112th Seed</em> tasks you with taking control of a little seed who is trying to save what remains of humanity. It’s all about food, you see. The Earth has reached a point where food has become so scarce that most of humanity has died off. Scientists plant 112 new types of seeds and put themselves into cryogenic slumber, hoping at least some of them will sprout. The first 111 don’t. You play as the 112th. There are more than 70 levels to play through, and if you’ve been around the block in this genre before very little of this will be new to you. Lots of block pushing, for example. But it sprinkles in new ideas as you go, and while it doesn’t do anything amazingly special, it’s fine.</p> \n<h3><strong>Frontline Zed ($11.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270600\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/frontlinezed.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/frontlinezed-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/frontlinezed-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/frontlinezed-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Oh boy, <em>another</em> mediocre zombie game. How… how <em>thrilling</em>. It’s more or less a game where you need to fend off zombie attacks at night and rebuild/upgrade during the day. I think it’s an homage to an old Flash game called <em>The Last Stand</em>, truth be told. Or maybe something <em>less</em> kind than an homage. In any case, it gets old really fast. Once you figure out what you need to do, you can repeat your strategy again and again until you either reach the end of the game or the end of your patience. Tired theme, tired gameplay concept, weak execution. No thanks.</p> \n<h3><strong>Instant Sports Summer Games ($24.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270601\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/instantsportssummergames.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/instantsportssummergames-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/instantsportssummergames-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/instantsportssummergames-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>I can’t tell if this is a completely different game from <em>Instant Sports</em> or just an expanded version of it, but one thing is for sure: this was originally planned to coincide with the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo. There are eleven different sports in this one, including the relay race, high jump, javelin throw, bowling, soccer, and more. Please note that this game is <em>not</em> supported in handheld mode, so if you have a Switch Lite and want this for some reason, you’re out of luck. Up to eight players can join in via local multiplayer, but there’s no online play. Honestly at this price you’re better off spending the extra money to get <em>Mario &amp; Sonic</em>, it’s about a billion times better.</p> \n<h3><strong>Alphadia Genesis ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270603\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alphadiagenesis.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alphadiagenesis-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alphadiagenesis-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/alphadiagenesis-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em>Alphadia Genesis</em> does… what most other KEMCO-published games do, actually. Back when it debuted on mobile, this one was a bit of a head-turner thanks to it being the first KEMCO release with 3D battle graphics. Well, it’s less impressive here and now, but it is still a decent enough JRPG. You’ve got your usual orphaned protagonist and mysterious girl who has lost her memories, and an overall progression line so consistent and familiar that you could set your watch to it. I think fifteen bucks is a <em>little</em> high for what you get here, particularly given you could grab a far better Square Enix classic for around the same price, but it may be worth picking up with a deep discount one day.</p> \n<h3><strong>Aery – Broken Memories ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270604\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aerybrokenmemories.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aerybrokenmemories-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aerybrokenmemories-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aerybrokenmemories-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em>Aery – Broken Memories</em> is the follow-up to<em> Aery – Little Bird Adventure</em>, and it looks to deliver more of the same in a whole new set of circumstances. You once again play as a bird, who this time enters the mind of another person to help them come out of a coma. You’ll explore their memories, seeking out shards in order to get to know them and what is troubling them. It’s safe to say that if you liked the original game, you’ll probably enjoy this one as well. The new environments look very interesting, and the flying seems to be as good as it was in the previous game.</p> \n<h3><strong>Clan N ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270606\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/clann.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/clann-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/clann-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/clann-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This one is a top-down hack-and-slash brawler for up to four players in both local and online multiplayer. There are different ninja-style characters to play as, and seven fairly large levels to battle your way through. With plenty of enemies and some big bosses to bash, this will help scratch the action itch for those in need. There are some mini-games you can unlock as well. My beef with this game is in how stunningly repetitive it gets thanks to how long the levels are, how little visual variety each one contains, and how limited your attack options are. Those are easy enough flaws to gloss over if you’re playing with others, but as a single-player experience it feels like a total grind. Apparently an update is on the way that will allow you to play shorter versions of the stages, which would help a lot.</p> \n<h3><strong>Cruel Bands Career ($3.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270607\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cruelbandscareer.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cruelbandscareer-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cruelbandscareer-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cruelbandscareer-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>While the most immediately striking thing about this game is its unique art style, the actual gameplay is surprisingly mundane. This is essentially a lane-based castle defense game, except the castle is the stage, the defenders are your band members, and the attackers are fans going wild. Each band member has their own abilities, and you can upgrade them as you go along. There are bosses to battle and special helpers to recruit, adding a bit of variety to the works. It’s a quirky one all-around, and the low price makes it easy to take a chance on if you like the look of it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Ultra Foodmess ($3.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270608\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultrafoodmess.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultrafoodmess-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultrafoodmess-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ultrafoodmess-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>If you’re looking for a low-cost party game to play with your friends or family locally, this is going to be your pick for the day. There are eleven different game modes, each with slightly different goals and mechanics. Up to four players can compete, and if there aren’t any humans around you can always have a go at the AI. The player characters are all food items, and there are quite a few different ones to choose from. You’ll be able to unlock more as you go, too. I don’t know. It doesn’t look like the greatest thing ever, but for four bucks it’s pretty hard to complain.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Some interesting sales have already popped up at the time of writing, including a nice deal on<em> Nights of Azure 2</em> and its DLC, discounts on <em>Crashlands</em> and <em>Levelhead</em> from the folks at Butterscotch Shenanigans, and some sales on the <em>Princess Maker</em> games. There’s very little in the outbox to worry about, though you may want to grab <em>All-Star Fruit Racing</em> as long as you don’t mind lengthy loading times. It will probably not be that cheap again for a long while.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270611\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nightsofazure2.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nightsofazure2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nightsofazure2-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nightsofazure2-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em><strong>Nights of Azure 2</strong></em> ($29.99 from $59.99 until 8/19)<br> <em><strong>Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends</strong></em> ($27.99 from $39.99 until 8/19)<br> <em><strong>Crashlands</strong> </em>($11.99 from $14.99 until 8/10)<br> <em><strong>Levelhead</strong> </em>($15.99 from $19.99 until 8/10)<br> <em><strong>Broken Lines</strong></em> ($17.49 from $24.99 until 8/12)<br> <em><strong>Snooker 19</strong></em> ($13.99 from $34.99 until 8/25)<br> <em><strong>eCrossminton</strong> </em>($9.89 from $14.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Demon’s Rise</strong></em> ($4.19 from $6.99 until 8/19)<br> <em><strong>Sky Ride</strong></em> ($0.99 from $7.00 until 8/27)<br> <em><strong>Spartan</strong> </em>($1.19 from $3.99 until 8/26)<br> <em><strong>Nekopara Vol. 1</strong></em> ($8.99 from $14.99 until 8/20)<br> <em><strong>Nekopara Vol. 2</strong></em> ($8.99 from $14.99 until 8/20)<br> <em><strong>Nekopara Vol. 3</strong></em> ($8.99 from $14.99 until 8/20)<br> <em><strong>Miles &amp; Kilo</strong> </em>($1.59 from $7.99 until 8/27)<br> <em><strong>Flip Over Frog</strong> </em>($0.99 from $7.50 until 8/27)</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270621\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270588\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/quarantinecircular.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/quarantinecircular-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/quarantinecircular-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/quarantinecircular-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"><br> <em><strong>Quarantine Circular</strong></em> ($4.79 from $5.99 until 8/27)<br> <em><strong>MachiKnights</strong> </em>($8.99 from $14.99 until 8/20)<br> <em><strong>Wonder Boy Returns</strong> </em>($8.99 from $14.99 until 8/20)<br> <em><strong>Goonya Fighter</strong></em> ($0.99 from $24.99 until 8/27)<br> <em><strong>Cyber Protocol</strong></em> ($1.09 from $9.99 until 8/13)<br> <em><strong>Amazing Brick Breaker</strong></em> ($1.49 from $4.99 until 8/20)<br> <em><strong>Sacred Stones</strong></em> ($4.99 from $9.99 until 8/20)<br> <em><strong>Princess Maker Go!Go!

We’ve also got complete lists of incoming and outgoing sales, with great games like <em>Cat Quest</em>, <em>Iconoclasts</em>, and <em>Super Hydorah</em> getting nice discounts. No news section today, but the only major news at the time of writing was the announcement that indie darling <em>Braid</em> will be making its way to the platform. Let’s get to the new stuff!</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Piczle Lines DX Bundle ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270645\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/piczlelinesdxbundle.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/piczlelinesdxbundle-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/piczlelinesdxbundle-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/piczlelinesdxbundle-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Hey friend, do you like <em>Slitherlink/Pathpix-</em>style logic puzzles? Do you like… saving money? Have you somehow not bought <em>Piczle Lines DX</em> and <em>Piczle Lines DX 500 More Puzzles</em> yet? If the answer to all three of those is “yes\", have I got a bundle for you. It packs in both of the aforementioned titles, offering a five dollar savings over buying them separately. You get a stupendous 1,100 puzzles to solve, offering something like a couple hundred hours of enjoyment. The wild thing is that if you grab this bundle during the launch sale, you can get it for a mere ten bucks. If you’re reading this after the launch sale, be sure to check on the prices of the individual games just to make sure this bundle’s price is still in your favor.</p> \n<h3><strong>King of Fighters R-2 ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270646\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kingoffightersr2-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>One of the earlier fighting games for the NEOGEO Pocket Color, <em>King of Fighters R-2</em> nevertheless remains a very enjoyable fighting game with lots to offer. There are 14 characters available initially, with a further 11 variants that you’ll unlock through play. Since it’s roughly based on King of Fighters ’98, you can expect a good selection of the more popular characters from that title. The gameplay is fun, and Code Mystics have done a lovely job with the interface and options, even going so far as to allow you to play using touch controls on an on-screen NEOGEO Pocket Color.</p> \n<h3><strong>Samurai Shodown! 2 ($7.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270647\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/samuraishodown2ngpc.jpg 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/samuraishodown2ngpc-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/samuraishodown2ngpc-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The other NEOGEO Pocket Color release today was actually already made available before on the Switch as a pre-order bonus for the new <em>Samurai Shodown</em>. What’s neat about this one is that it’s a bite-sized adaptation of <em>Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage,</em> featuring all but one of the characters from that game. On top of that, it adds Charlotte and Yagyu Jubei. Since SNK probably isn’t going to release ports of Hyper NEOGEO 64 games anytime soon, this is your best chance for getting some of the experience of playing one of the lesser-known<em> Samurai Shodown</em> titles. There are fifteen characters to choose from here, and Code Mystics has done a fine job of bringing the game to the Switch with lots of options.</p> \n<h3><strong>RogueCube ($4.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270648\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/roguecube.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/roguecube-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/roguecube-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/roguecube-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This is basically the poor man’s <em>Enter the Gungeon</em>. You can play through the campaign either solo or with friends via local multiplayer, or head into a competitive battle with those same friends. The characters are all cubes, and the levels are procedurally generated, so there’s the title taken care of. You get three different cube characters to choose from initially, with several more available once you unlock them. There are 37 weapons ranging from swords to bazookas with a whole lot in between, and 11 different levels to rampage through. Not bad at all for five dollars, to be honest.</p> \n<h3><strong>Retro Arcade Shooter – Attack from Pluto ($5.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270649\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/retroarcadeshooterattackfrompluto.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/retroarcadeshooterattackfrompluto-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/retroarcadeshooterattackfrompluto-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/retroarcadeshooterattackfrompluto-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This game claims to offer three classic arcade shoot-em-up games in one, but there isn’t quite as much variety as you would hope given a statement like that. There are horizontal and vertical shoot-em-up stages in here, with the latter being a bit better than the former. Still, nothing in here is really all that well-made relative to other shooters around the same price on the Switch. I can’t see any reason why someone would bother playing this over roughly 73 other shoot-em-ups on the platform, but every game is someone’s favorite. Some games stretch my belief in that more than others, though.</p> \n<h3><strong>City Bus Driving Simulator ($11.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270650\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/citybusdrivingsimulator.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/citybusdrivingsimulator-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/citybusdrivingsimulator-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/citybusdrivingsimulator-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Yeah, it’s another one of these. Like the several games similar to it that have released on Switch over the last couple of months,<em> City Bus Driving Simulator</em> is a port of a free-to-play mobile game that largely hangs its hat on letting you drive a variety of vehicles in an urban environment. There are missions to complete and free-roam mode for when you just want to cruise around in a school bus. There are twelve different buses in all that you’ll be driving, and the game claims it uses a fun and realistic driving model, which seems to me to be a cake that you cannot have and also eat when it comes to buses. Well, someone is buying these things. If it’s you, here’s another one.</p> \n<h3><strong>Wordify ($2.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270651\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270644\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wordify.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wordify-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wordify-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wordify-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Well, it’s hard to mess up a word game. And this one isn’t going to break that rule. You’re given a bunch of letters and need to fit them onto the crossword layout such that the words work. You get 250 of these puzzles for your three bucks, and there are ten different color themes so that you can change things up visually now and then. You can play using buttons or touch controls, with the latter being a bit more comfortable to use. Not a bad choice if you enjoy word games and don’t want to spend too much money today.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Hey, there’s the big list of new sales I was expecting when I went home last night. Plenty of great games in there, with some highlights including excellent prices on the <em>Cat Quest</em> games, a very rare sale on the full line of <em>Picross</em> titles, and huge discounts on the <em>Secret Files</em> adventure games. There’s plenty of fun games to be had at nice prices, so make sure you have a good look through the list. By contrast, there’s very little in the way of expiring sales this weekend. Feel free to blow your allowance on the new stuff.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-268393\"

Beyond a few surprise announcements, it was a bit of a quiet week. Next week should be a <em>little</em> better, but not a <em>lot</em> better. At least as far as new releases go, anyway. I do expect a big summer sale to kick off at some point in the next few weeks, but that’s just a hunch. Well, we’ll make the best of it anyway. There’s always the backlog, after all. I hope you all have a great weekend, and as always, thanks for reading!</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 18:59:15
