This milestone release of Game Tools from the Android Studio team meets game developers where they are; AGDE adds Android as a platform target to Microsoft Visual Studio, making it easier to target Android with existing multi-platform Visual Studio game projects. </p> <p> AGDE is part of the Android Game Development Kit, which includes both libraries and tools that support making great games on Android. AGDE is best suited for game developers that develop primarily on Microsoft Windows using Visual Studio to write C/C++ code. Game developers that do not fall under these criteria, but are using C/C++, should use <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio\">Android Studio</a> to develop for Android. </p> <p> Alongside the release of AGDE 2021.1, we recently published case studies on how our partners, <a href=\"https://android.devsite.corp.google.com/stories/games/epic-agde\">Epic Games</a> and <a href=\"https://android.devsite.corp.google.com/stories/games/ea-agde\">Electronic Arts</a> found success using AGDE. </p> <p> We built AGDE as part of our effort to address game developers facing issues in targeting Android with their cross-platform workflows. At the top of the list of issues was developers’ preference to remain in a single IDE instead of maintaining multiple projects for different platforms. AGDE enables this for game developers using Visual Studio by removing the need to switch between IDEs when switching between platforms. In addition, we wanted to solve pain points around existing Visual Studio tools for Android that are often dated or suffer from integration issues. Our team is committed to having AGDE support the latest versions of the Android SDK, and NDK as well as providing updated tools easily accessible from Visual Studio. Finally, we wanted to bring you quick access to some of the most useful Android Studio capabilities, built into AGDE. Therefore, we invested in creating seamless integrations to our most popular tools, such as Studio profilers, logcat, and the Android SDK and device manager. Overall, these features are designed to make you more productive in your day-to-day game development workflow. </p> \n  <center> \n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHI7y5SbDdQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n  </center> <h2>Build with AGDE</h2> <p> After <a href=\"http://g.co/android/extension\">downloading</a> and installing AGDE in a Visual Studio project, you can treat Android development as you would any other platform. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>AGDE integrates with MSBuild to compile and link C++ code for Android. <li>Project build settings are configured using the standard Visual Studio property system. After the MSBuild process, AGDE uses Gradle to complete the build and package the project. This Gradle stage can be used to integrate Android libraries containing Java or Kotlin code into the final application bundle. <li>The Android SDK manager provides access to additional tools and frameworks to assist with building Android games. <li>The Android Virtual Device (AVD) manager allows you to launch directly into emulator snapshots so that you can have a repeatable test environment. </li> </li></li></li>\n  </ul> <br> <h2>Debug with AGDE</h2> <p> AGDE supports deploying to, running on, and debugging with both an Android emulator and a physical device. Debug sessions run inside Visual Studio, using its standard interface for breakpoints, tracing and variable inspection. </p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>AGDE interfaces with LLDB for debugging support. <li>Register views, and disassembly of native code allow you to set a breakpoint, and step right into the disassembly of your OpenGL. The assembly view shows the assembly in-line with the current C++, allowing you to step into or over each instruction as they are executed. This is useful for building context and understanding what is running on your device. \n      <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n       <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jRppUg6uHX0/YOdoZvq_mBI/AAAAAAAAKdE/0HNTbZ6yzMUgBeFvW_U-P3nHws5uU2SZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/AGDE%2BBLOG%2B1.gif\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"gif demonstrating AGDE supports deploying to, running on, and debugging with both an Android emulator and a physical device.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1036\" data-original-width=\"1552\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jRppUg6uHX0/YOdoZvq_mBI/AAAAAAAAKdE/0HNTbZ6yzMUgBeFvW_U-P3nHws5uU2SZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/AGDE%2BBLOG%2B1.gif\" /></a>\n      </div> <li>The memory view shows the current values within a block of memory. As we step through the running game, AGDE in Visual Studio automatically highlights the areas of memory that have changed. In the screenshot below we show where in memory the view matrix has changed, as indicated by the red text. <li>Sometimes when debugging isn’t enough to figure out what is going on, we know that having access to the logs can be helpful to dig deeper. The logcat tool allows for searching and filtering logs to pinpoint exactly the data you want. </li></li></li></li>\n   </ul> <h2>Profile with AGDE</h2> <p> AGDE integrates with a standalone version of Android Studio Profilers. This profiler can be launched from Visual Studio and attached to a running game session. </p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>The Android Studio Profilers display real time usage statistics for CPU, memory, network, and energy. <li>We added support for native memory sampling. Now you can better understand where your memory is going and how to optimize your game for a broader reach of devices.</li> </li>\n   </ul> \n   <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n    <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OOCef2zRZI8/YOdpKS2jzSI/AAAAAAAAKdM/IH2Tp25FqO8vr7bjGJjfr4NYDfSRB4pVQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ADGE%2BBLOG%2B2.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"gif demonstrating how AGDE integrates with a standalone version of Android Studio Profilers.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"915\" data-original-width=\"1600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OOCef2zRZI8/YOdpKS2jzSI/AAAAAAAAKdM/IH2Tp25FqO8vr7bjGJjfr4NYDfSRB4pVQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ADGE%2BBLOG%2B2.png\" /></a>\n   </div> <h2>Integrations</h2> <p> We know everyone has a unique build setup and there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution. That is why we are investing in making AGDE compatible with various tools commonly used by game developers. </p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>We partnered with Epic Games to integrate with Unreal Engine (UE 4.26.1+) to provide a seamless Android experience for Unreal Engine game developers. <li>We are working with Sony Distributed Build System (SN-DBS) to enable SN-DBS users to leverage the power of distributed builds for Android with AGDE (coming soon) <li>AGDE is compatible with Incredibuild, a distributed build tool. </li></li></li>\n   </ul> <h2>Getting started</h2> <p> Download <a href=\"http://g.co/android/extension#download\">AGDE 2021.1</a> and see our <a href=\"http://g.co/android/extension\">documentation </a>for additional details. To help you get to know AGDE quickly, we put together a few samples that demonstrate different ways you can use AGDE to configure your project. </p> <p> Visual Studio IntelliSense features are compatible with AGDE. All current Android CPU architectures are supported: both ARM and Intel in 32-bit and 64-bit. </p> <p> We appreciate any feedback on things you like, and issues or features you would like to see.

How do you make the most of this opportunity? </p> <h2><strong>The concept of quality reach</strong></h2> <p> The foundations for your game’s (or app’s) success on Google Play are its <strong>reach</strong> and its <strong>quality</strong>: </p> \n    <ul> \n     <li><strong>Reach:</strong> Can a player access your game? <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Does the player experience good quality when playing your game? </li> </li> \n    </ul> <p> To unlock the opportunity for any single user on Google Play, you need <strong>both</strong>: every user must be able to access your game, AND have a good technical experience when playing it. </p> <p> This is the ideal state of <strong>quality reach</strong>. </p> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/I0qoOnU5O4I/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F_N2sKwayw8/YOi4w9idjgI/AAAAAAAAQvw/fcGUdAB82Kc8Ag4cwKquFQX1OJ6PAhm3ACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-07-09%2Bat%2B4.59.25%2BPM.png \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YGhph7EgqT8/YKMbWIAO4UI/AAAAAAAAQjM/nOffYqFRx-8n6Sc7uUk1fpmqpFEHUf9egCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F_N2sKwayw8/YOi4w9idjgI/AAAAAAAAQvw/fcGUdAB82Kc8Ag4cwKquFQX1OJ6PAhm3ACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-07-09%2Bat%2B4.59.25%2BPM.png \" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n    </center> <h2><strong>Why quality reach is foundational to your game’s success</strong></h2> <p> When you have quality reach, your game development, marketing budgets, and growth strategy can be lined up to reinforce each other, because you acquire users for whom your game performs well, and your engagement and retention strategies have higher ROI for users with good experiences. </p> <p> If you have <strong>poor quality reach</strong>, you can inadvertently acquire users whom you will not be able to engage and retain. Any spend to acquire these users is likely to be wasted. But the bigger problem is that poor quality reach <strong>makes it harder for you to acquire users for whom your game does perform well</strong>, since Android vitals and user ratings may affect your game’s discoverability and conversion in the Play store. </p> <p> Another scenario to keep an eye on is missed reach. Unlike poor quality reach, it may not hurt your ability to acquire users who <em>can </em>access and enjoy your game. However it still limits your game’s scale and possibly also its ROI. </p> <h2><strong>How you achieve quality reach</strong></h2> <p> There are three types of decisions that determine your quality reach: </p> \n    <ul> \n     <li><strong>Devices: </strong>the device specs you build for and target <li><strong>Geographies:</strong> the countries, languages or localization you offer <li><strong>Testing and optimization:</strong> what you plan for and prioritize during development and pre-launch </li> </li></li> \n    </ul> <p> You make these decisions when you develop and publish a game for the first time, and you continue to make them with every new release over the lifecycle of your game. You also need to think about these decisions outside your release cycle, since the Play ecosystem is constantly changing, which means your quality reach will also change over time, even if you do nothing. </p> <p> However these decisions can be very hard. They require you to answer, or predict the answers to, two questions: </p> \n    <ol> \n     <li>Where are my users? <li>Where are my issues? </li> </li> \n    </ol> <p> These questions are challenging because of the scale and diversity of users on Google Play, both technically and geographically. Not only that, but these decisions may be made at different points in time, across both business and technical teams. How do you get them to line up? </p> <h2><strong>How Reach and devices can help</strong></h2> <p> We’re launching a new tool in Play Console called Reach and devices to help with these challenges. Reach and devices is a data and insights tool that helps you to plan for quality reach, by helping you <strong>understand or predict the distribution of your users and your issues across the Google Play ecosystem</strong>. </p> <p> Reach and devices takes data about your app and its peers and presents it in new ways, to help you answer these questions. It also makes it easier to get all the relevant teams in your organisation on the same page. </p> \n    <center> \n     <a
