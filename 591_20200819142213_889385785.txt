{"code":1,"isDone":false,"toInsertArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 22:18:05","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 22:18:05","title":"Ride easy with new biking features in Google Maps","link":"https://blog.google/products/maps/ride-easy-new-biking-features-google-maps/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>People across the world are opting to hop on their bikes—especially with summer arriving in many parts of the world and more people looking for safer ways to get around. Since February, requests for cycling directions in Google Maps have jumped by 69 percent—hitting an all-time high last month. Whether people are hitting the road to get their heart pumping or commute safely during COVID-19, we’re making it easier for cyclists everywhere to get on their own bike or a shared one. </p><p> Ten years ago, we <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/biking-directions-added-to-google-maps.html\">introduced</a> biking directions in Google Maps. Now it’s available in nearly 30 countries around the world and millions of people use it every day. As biking habits change, especially as things evolve with COVID-19, we’re constantly updating this information to help you uncover the most reliable bike route.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Raise the (handle)bar on biking routes  </h3><p>To give you the most up-to-date bike route, we use a combination of machine learning, complex algorithms and our understanding of real-world conditions based on imagery and data from government authorities and community contributions. We also consider various forms of bike lanes and nearby streets that might be less friendly for your two wheels (like tunnels, stairs and poor surface conditions) so you can have the best and smoothest biking route. You can also see how flat or steep your route will be, so you’ll know if you’re in for an easy breezy ride or one that will really get the heart pumping. </p><p>However, the best route can always change and we are hard at work to reflect new information. For instance, due to COVID-19, many cities are adding and widening bike lanes to encourage cycling and accommodate more riders. We’re already working to integrate hundreds of thousands of new bike lanes in the coming months. Local government agencies can provide this data through our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mapcontentpartners/answer/9359574?hl=en\">Geo Data Upload tool</a> to have their latest bike lane information reflected in Google Maps. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Gear up for new docked bikeshare directions in 10 cities</h3><p>As more people choose to cycle, they’re buying new bikes, fixing up old ones and turning to bike sharing options. In fact, worldwide search interest for “bike repair near me” hit an all-time high this month—more than double what it was last year. </p><p>For riders opting to use bike sharing, we’re rolling out more detailed information. Over the last several years, we’ve <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/travel-last-mile-google-maps-and-lime/\">launched</a> a dockless bike and scooter integration with Lime in more than 100 cities and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/real-time-bikeshare-information-google-map/\">introduced</a> real-time docked bikeshare information to help travellers in select cities locate bike sharing stations and real-time availability. With bikeshare providers seeing sharp increases in usage during COVID-19, it’s even more important to quickly and easily check how many bikes are available at the station you’re headed toward and if there are docks available to drop off your bike near your destination. </p><p>Starting today, when you look up biking directions, you’ll see end-to-end directions that include docked bikeshare information. Steps will include detailed walking directions to bikeshare stations near your starting point along with live bike availability, turn-by-turn cycling directions to the bikeshare station closest to your destination with live dock availability, and, finally, walking directions from there to your final destination. And, for some cities, Maps will show you links to open the relevant bikeshare app to book and unlock the bike.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"docked-bike-full.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/docked-bike-full.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>New docked bikeshare directions coming to 10 cities.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Rolling out over the coming weeks, you’ll find docked bikeshare directions in these 10 cities, thanks to our partnership with <a href=\"https://www.itoworld.com/\">Ito World</a>and bikeshare partners around the world.

It’s a deeply frustrating experience I’ve had many times since <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/wheelchair-users-google-maps/\">becoming a wheelchair user</a> in 2009. And it’s an experience all too familiar to the <a href=\"https://www.wheelchairfoundation.org/fth/analysis-of-wheelchair-need/\">130 million wheelchair users</a> worldwide and the more than <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html\">30 million Americans</a> who have difficulty using stairs.</p><p>So imagine instead being able to “know before you go” whether a destination is wheelchair accessible, just as effortlessly as looking up the address. In recognition of <a href=\"https://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/\">Global Accessibility Awareness Day</a>, we’re announcing a new Google Maps feature that does just that.</p><p>People can now turn on an “Accessible Places” feature to have wheelchair accessibility information more prominently displayed in Google Maps. When Accessible Places is switched on, a wheelchair icon will indicate an accessible entrance and you’ll be able to see if a place has accessible seating, restrooms or parking. If it’s confirmed that a place does not have an accessible entrance, we’ll show that information on Maps as well.</p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-video\"><div class=\"h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><div class=\"h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--12 \"><div class=\"article-module article-video \"><figure><a class=\"h-c-video h-c-video--marquee \" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile=\"true\" data-glue-modal-trigger=\"uni-modal--oWsAMwJ-ks-\" href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=-oWsAMwJ-ks\"><div class=\"article-video__aspect-image\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2020-05-20_at_7.49.47_PM.max-1000x1000.png);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Video explaining how Accessible Places benefits everyone who uses wheels.</span></div><svg class=\"h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#mi-youtube-icon\"></use></svg></a></figure></div></div></div></div><div class=\"h-c-modal--video uni-video-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n        \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n        \"category\": \"video tracking\",\n        \"label\": \" - https://youtube.com/watch?v=-oWsAMwJ-ks\"\n      }' data-glue-modal=\"uni-modal--oWsAMwJ-ks-\" data-glue-modal-close-label=\"Close Dialog\"><a class=\"glue-yt-video \" data-glue-yt-video-autoplay=\"true\" data-glue-yt-video-height=\"99%\" data-glue-yt-video-listeners=\"videoTrackerCtrl.listenerMap\" data-glue-yt-video-vid=\"-oWsAMwJ-ks\" data-glue-yt-video-width=\"100%\" href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=-oWsAMwJ-ks\" ng-cloak=\"\"></a></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Better maps for everyone, whether you walk or roll</h3><p>Today, Google Maps has wheelchair accessibility information for more than 15 million places around the world. That number has more than doubled since <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/building-map-everyone/\">2017</a> thanks to the dedication of more than 120 million <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/localguides/howto\">Local Guides</a>and others who’ve responded to <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/better-world-wheels-google-maps/\">our call to share accessibility information</a>. In total, this community has contributed more than 500 million wheelchair accessibility updates to Google Maps. Store owners have also helped, using Google My Business to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/7298639?hl=en\">add accessibility information</a> for their business profiles to help users needing stair-free access find them on Google Maps and Search.</p><br/><p>With this feature “rollout”, it’s easier to find and contribute wheelchair accessibility information to Google Maps. That benefits everyone, from those of us using wheelchairs and parents pushing strollers to older adults with tired legs and people hauling heavy items. And in this time of COVID-19, it’s especially important to know before you go so that you won’t be stranded outside that pharmacy, grocery or restaurant.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \"><img alt=\"How to contribute accessibility information to Google Maps\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Accessible_Places_Contribute_UI.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption h-c-page\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Anyone can contribute accessibility information to Google Maps</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>To get wheelchair accessibility information more prominently displayed in Google Maps, update your app to the latest version, go to Settings, select “Accessibility,” and turn on “Accessible Places.” The feature is available on both Android and iOS. </p><p>We’re also rolling out an update that allows people using iOS devices to more easily contribute accessibility information, joining the millions of Android users who have been sharing this type of information on Maps. <a href=\"https://www.localguidesconnect.com/t5/General-Discussion/How-to-answer-accessibility-questions-on-Google-Maps/td-p/26\">This guide</a> has tips for rating accessibility, in case you’re not sure what counts as being “accessible.” We invite everyone to switch on Accessible Places and contribute accessibility information to help people in your community.</p><p></p><h3>A Maps milestone, built on a movement</h3><p>This launch is a milestone in our journey to build a better, more helpful map for everyone, which includes recent efforts to help people find accessible <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/building-map-everyone/\">places</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/introducing-wheelchair-accessible-routes-transit-navigation/\">transit routes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/better-maps-for-people-with-vision-impairments/\">walking directions</a>. Our work wouldn’t be possible without the decades of advocacy from those who have fought for equal access for people with disabilities.
