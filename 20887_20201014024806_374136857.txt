However, a sound hazard assessment was so far hampered\r\nby uncertainties and a low comparability of test results. The reason for the low comparability is a\r\nhigh variation in the (1) type of NM tested with regard to raw material, size and shape and (2)\r\nprocedures before and during the toxicity testing. This calls for tailored, nanomaterial-specific\r\nprotocols. Here, a structured approach is proposed, intended to lead to test protocols not only\r\ntailored to specific types of nanomaterials, but also to respective test system for toxicity\r\ntesting. There are existing standards on single procedures involving nanomaterials, however, not all\r\nrelevant procedures are covered by standards. Hence, our approach offers a detailed way of weighting\r\nseveral plausible alternatives for e.g. sample preparation, in order to decide on the procedure most\r\nmeaningful f...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":20887,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e5a514753b7067e7443d903c6ac9f737","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Annegret Potthoff, Mirco Weil, Tobias Meißner and Dana Kühnel","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602643686744}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:48:06","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:48:06","feedId":20887,"fetchDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 02:48:06 +0000","fetchMs":28007,"handleMs":5,"totalMs":28014,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"6adc9ee180e15d93daf6364a5c318f90","hostName":"us-009*","requestId":"a7b3343bb46440d48fc570d9074fa499_20887","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:23:37","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:11:41","id":20887,"name":"Science and Technology of Advanced Materials - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1468-6996/?rss=1","subscriber":159,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn17@2020_3/2020/09/06/20-11-41-263_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Science and Technology of Advanced Materials","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602643658731,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":28008,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":5,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
