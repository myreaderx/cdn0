The surge is intense and diffuse. Hospitalizations are up 40 percent over the last two weeks alone, and they’re rising in every region of the country.</p>\n<p>Seventeen states are now at record-breaking numbers of hospitalizations, with states in the Midwest hit the hardest. In North Dakota, hospitals are <a href=\"https://www.grandforksherald.com/newsmd/coronavirus/6753876-With-North-Dakota-hospitals-at-100-capacity-Burgum-announces-COVID-positive-nurses-can-stay-at-work\">at 100 percent capacity</a>. On Monday, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum announced that the state has amended a health order to now allow nurses who are infected with the coronavirus to keep working in hospitals as long as they show no symptoms. The move is aimed at alleviating strain on hospital staff who are being overwhelmed by the influx of patients. The governor added that the state is also looking to hire emergency medical technicians and paramedics to run COVID-19 testing operations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722614#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722614&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=szU9nAW6FJc:drR84yHs6CY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=szU9nAW6FJc:drR84yHs6CY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=szU9nAW6FJc:drR84yHs6CY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=szU9nAW6FJc:drR84yHs6CY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=szU9nAW6FJc:drR84yHs6CY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=szU9nAW6FJc:drR84yHs6CY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 18:30:35 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229569906-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"79d56591135d66cf1b5c50d1d6153819","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-09-132_58e13cc38a86afad.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":81486,"destBytes":40176,"author":"Beth Mole","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229569906-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-09-132_58e13cc38a86afad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=szU9nAW6FJc:drR84yHs6CY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn74@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-31-07-762_6f89eb7168cd87e4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=szU9nAW6FJc:drR84yHs6CY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn2@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-557_63711c6125b181fd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-653_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-580_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375005932},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","title":"Cruise line resumed voyages in Caribbean.

That's about 13 percent of the 53 passengers on board. Five of the cases are all part of the same traveling party. The remaining two are a husband and wife, not traveling with the five other cases. All of the cases came to light after a member of the party of five developed symptoms and tested positive on Wednesday. This prompted the ship to go into lockdown and begin testing all 119 on board. So far, all other passengers and crew on board have tested negative.</p>\n<p>Sloan reports that the seven infected passengers will be moved from the ship to an isolation facility in Barbados. The remaining passengers who have tested negative might be able to leave the ship later Friday or Saturday and board flights back to their home countries. The 53 passengers include 37 Americans, as well as passengers from the UK, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Germany, according to Sloan.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 11/12/2020 9:20pm EST:</strong> Earlier this evening, the ship's captain, Torbjorn Lund, announced the possibility of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CruiseLog/status/1327036561049985029\">sixth case</a> in a person who was not in the same traveling group as the five other cases. Lund said that the latest case was detected by a rapid test done on board, and crew were awaiting results of testing done by Barbados officials to confirm the case. If the positive test is confirmed, it would suggest that the coronavirus has spread beyond the initial cluster on the ship. The cruise reporter on the ship, Gene Sloan, said officials were now discussing plans for people who have tested negative to disembark. Sloan noted that his rapid test on the ship was negative, and he's awaiting results from testing done by Barbados officials, which are expected early Friday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722954#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722954&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=bnkdzumeSCs:gtDS9P4O5Dk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=bnkdzumeSCs:gtDS9P4O5Dk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=bnkdzumeSCs:gtDS9P4O5Dk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=bnkdzumeSCs:gtDS9P4O5Dk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=bnkdzumeSCs:gtDS9P4O5Dk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=bnkdzumeSCs:gtDS9P4O5Dk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 19:30:14 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1227918070-800x546.jpg","linkMd5":"97e8a29a9eef7306a6579741d5ab8244","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn41@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-06-110_4a2b6507af32c828.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":546,"sourceBytes":71565,"destBytes":47442,"author":"Beth Mole","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1227918070-800x546.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn41@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-06-110_4a2b6507af32c828.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=bnkdzumeSCs:gtDS9P4O5Dk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn86@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-744_d160db7dc0efd199.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=bnkdzumeSCs:gtDS9P4O5Dk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn20@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-31-07-665_23ace21e4ffe0ea3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-653_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-580_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375005932},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","title":"Rocket Report: SpaceX set for second crew launch, Chinese firm reaches orbit","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722902","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284593599-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"A rocket leaves a trail of flame and smoke as it lifts off.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284593599.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"683\" data-width=\"1024\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> China's new carrier rocket CERES-1, developed by the Beijing-based high-tech company Galactic Energy, blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on November 7, 2020.

Yet not all foams are understood because they don’t seem to obey the model that explains most of the rest. Understanding these atypical foams is important, because they often apply in the food-processing and petrochemical industries. So having <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.178002\">a new paper</a> that tells us what allows these foams to survive may be of more than academic interest.</p>\n<h2>Foaming with cause</h2>\n<p>Foams and froths form when two different liquids are mixed with a gas such as air. But not all liquid combinations will allow a foam to form, no matter how hard you beat it—I’m looking at you, experimental dark chocolate meringues. While a foam is actually a rather complex beast, the basic physics is not too difficult.</p>\n<p>A foam is basically a set of air bubbles, enclosed by thin films that form a self-supporting network. The thin films are subject to two competing forces. The liquid trapped in the interface slowly drains away due to gravity. This causes the layer enclosing the air to thin, which will lead to the eventual collapse of the foam. But the loss of fluid is often slowed (or even entirely prevented) by two factors.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1720239#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1720239&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=dyECiQoHNWE:LpROMlkOgBs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=dyECiQoHNWE:LpROMlkOgBs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=dyECiQoHNWE:LpROMlkOgBs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=dyECiQoHNWE:LpROMlkOgBs:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=dyECiQoHNWE:LpROMlkOgBs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=dyECiQoHNWE:LpROMlkOgBs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 12:15:04 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2766738859_e30270b6e0_k-800x536.jpg","linkMd5":"d187570d2443a677e84c3da56984eed4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn24@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-06-373_0ebd9483bf3fd59b.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":536,"sourceBytes":50395,"destBytes":21004,"author":"Chris Lee","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2766738859_e30270b6e0_k-800x536.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn24@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-06-373_0ebd9483bf3fd59b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=dyECiQoHNWE:LpROMlkOgBs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn10@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-31-07-582_bf9550040561041b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=dyECiQoHNWE:LpROMlkOgBs:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn89@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-824_b08f2ea6f0251c89.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-653_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-580_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375005933},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","title":"We’ll need more than one vaccine to beat the pandemic","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723217","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1223516517-800x517.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up photograph of a gloved hand holding a tiny bottle of clear liquid.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1223516517.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"2736\" data-width=\"4232\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> A medical worker holds a bottle of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University that is being tested in a trial in Soweto, South Africa.

Yes, new infections have hit an all-time high in the United States, and, yes, cities and states around the world are walking back their reopenings. But Pfizer says it has results from a massive clinical trial showing that its vaccine against the disease works, and works well. The release touted “a vaccine efficacy rate above 90 percent,” and it announced the company’s intention to seek from the US Food and Drug Administration an authorization to start giving people shots. The company’s ready to make 50 million doses this year and 1.3 billion doses in 2021.</p>\n<p>That’s an ember of hope, but it’s sitting under a bucket of cold water, ready to pour. The Pfizer vaccine is finicky—hard to make, transport, and deliver. Because of desperate need, it’s in short supply even before it becomes available—1.3 billion doses is several billion short of what the world needs. The press release wasn’t peer-reviewed science, and it lacked critical details about how the vaccine works, and on whom. Even the simple fact of this vaccine’s existence, some analysts have argued, might jeopardize the testing and success of potentially better vaccines down the line, a case of the imperfect being the enemy of the good.</p>\n<p>Before the ember dies out completely, here’s a theory: No. The Pfizer vaccine’s imperfections make it a perfect prime mover, because if it works as well as the company says, it’ll help people now and require research into more, better, different vaccines for later. All the things nobody knows about the Pfizer vaccine mean that the door is wide open. “Whether its effects are durable, whether it’s effective in the elderly, whether it has safety issues, the cold chain issues, the ability to have access,” says Wayne Koff, president and CEO of the nonprofit Human Vaccines Project, “all that points to the need for a number of vaccines.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723217#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723217&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hQnJpZCwMXs:J6R-lx36i_Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hQnJpZCwMXs:J6R-lx36i_Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hQnJpZCwMXs:J6R-lx36i_Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hQnJpZCwMXs:J6R-lx36i_Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hQnJpZCwMXs:J6R-lx36i_Q:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hQnJpZCwMXs:J6R-lx36i_Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 12:17:06 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1223516517-800x517.jpg","linkMd5":"705013de08d384ce9da939866282058a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn28@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-06-320_5ddbfb6bc3c49c29.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":517,"sourceBytes":49342,"destBytes":20892,"author":"WIRED","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1223516517-800x517.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn28@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-06-320_5ddbfb6bc3c49c29.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hQnJpZCwMXs:J6R-lx36i_Q:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn78@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-31-09-612_7dec7cce3e4b93f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hQnJpZCwMXs:J6R-lx36i_Q:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn5@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-756_113047f16161a8ea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-653_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-580_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375005932},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","title":"Relativity’s 3D-printed engine has completed a mission duty cycle test-firing","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1720234","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"video\"><div class=\"wrapper\" style=\"display:block\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"980\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iWYaRpeLhrU?start=0&#38;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></div><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">Full-duration test of Aeon 1 rocket engine. </p></div>\n<p>Relativity Space said Monday that the company has successfully completed a full-duration test-firing of its Aeon 1 rocket engine, running it at full power for 187 seconds.</p>\n<p>The test at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi took place with all of the engine's key components—including turbopumps, injector, and combustion chamber—operating in a flight-like configuration.

The trade-off for this toll is the avoidance of death, severe illness, overloading of healthcare systems, etc. And the lockdowns are meant to be temporary; once infection rates drop sufficiently, then less draconian control measures (like social distancing, limiting gatherings, and mask use) can keep the infection rates low.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723005#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723005&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=ck7qvOjNQI4:YfvYBe8i-3M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=ck7qvOjNQI4:YfvYBe8i-3M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=ck7qvOjNQI4:YfvYBe8i-3M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=ck7qvOjNQI4:YfvYBe8i-3M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=ck7qvOjNQI4:YfvYBe8i-3M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=ck7qvOjNQI4:YfvYBe8i-3M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 11:45:59 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229592560-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"773bb94bea42612ffba5201d5f795db9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn12@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-06-147_ac8ccb4b0763862e.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":53520,"destBytes":34632,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229592560-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn12@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-06-147_ac8ccb4b0763862e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=ck7qvOjNQI4:YfvYBe8i-3M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn53@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-31-07-755_400c0898d6f89779.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=ck7qvOjNQI4:YfvYBe8i-3M:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn11@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-31-07-617_182f4ced7e2c8883.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-653_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-580_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375005932},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","title":"Hurricanes might not be losing steam as fast as they used to","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722656","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/eta_goes_2020308_lrg-800x572.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite photo of hurricane entering Gulf of Mexico.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/eta_goes_2020308_lrg.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1529\" data-width=\"2140\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Hurricane Eta on November 3 of this year.

Projections indicate increased intensity among the strongest storms, for example, and increases in rainfall and storm surge are unavoidable consequences of warmer air holding more moisture and sea level rise, respectively.</p>\n<p>But a new study by Lin Li and Pinaki Chakraborty at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University focuses on a less-than-obvious question: what happens to hurricanes <em>after landfall</em> in a warming world? Once a storm moves over land, it loses the water vapor from warm ocean waters that fuel it, so it rapidly weakens. The total damage done depends in part on how quickly it weakens.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers examined a data set of all North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes between 1967 and 2018. The primary metric they were interested in was the rate the hurricane lost strength over the first 24 hours after landfall. Strength “decays” on an exponential curve, so they boiled this down to a mathematical parameter for decay time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722656#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722656&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=g5mT5WAzBb0:O5gGbamsUMU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=g5mT5WAzBb0:O5gGbamsUMU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=g5mT5WAzBb0:O5gGbamsUMU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=g5mT5WAzBb0:O5gGbamsUMU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=g5mT5WAzBb0:O5gGbamsUMU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=g5mT5WAzBb0:O5gGbamsUMU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:35:10 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/eta_goes_2020308_lrg-800x572.jpg","linkMd5":"5309e4db39a42559346cb1b14e2675ee","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn20@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-06-169_b9119bdc8d076ccc.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":572,"sourceBytes":160999,"destBytes":103860,"author":"Scott K.

The 1,000- to 1,200-year-old ship was probably the grave of a local king or jarl, and it once lay beneath a monumental burial mound. A 2018 ground-penetrating radar survey of a site called Gjellestad, on the fertile coastal plain of Vikiletta, revealed the buried ship.</p>\n<p>The Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research, or NIKU, announced the ship find in 2018, and it announced earlier in 2020 that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/archaeologists-in-norway-are-about-to-dig-up-a-viking-ship/\">excavations would begin over the summer</a> to save the vessel from wood-eating fungus. NIKU archaeologist Lars Gustavsen and his colleagues’ recent study is the first academic publication of the survey results, and it includes the previously announced Gjellestad ship burial as well as the other ancient tombs and buildings. In the recently published paper, the radar images reveal the ghosts of an ancient landscape surrounding the royal tomb: farmhouses, a feasting hall, and centuries of burial mounds.</p>\n<p>Altogether, the buried structures suggest that over several centuries, from at least 500 BCE to 1000 CE, an ordinary coastal farming settlement somehow grew into an important seat of power on the cusp of the Viking Age.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723256#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723256&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=VfH8aL0-yWI:RE_AGYUFRgE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=VfH8aL0-yWI:RE_AGYUFRgE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=VfH8aL0-yWI:RE_AGYUFRgE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=VfH8aL0-yWI:RE_AGYUFRgE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=VfH8aL0-yWI:RE_AGYUFRgE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=VfH8aL0-yWI:RE_AGYUFRgE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 13:15:02 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/radarmap-800x427.png","linkMd5":"7c5e6ae782c9c94732ccb6aea6130f53","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-31-06-535_1232597e3fc33385.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":427,"sourceBytes":360361,"destBytes":49176,"author":"Kiona N.

This may bring to mind coal-mining communities in places like Kentucky and West Virginia, but it’s also playing out across the Navajo and Hopi lands in Arizona and New Mexico.</p>\n<p>There are several coal plants located in or near the Navajo Nation, fed by associated coal mines, and staffed by Navajo and Hopi workers—a major source of jobs. Of these, the Navajo Generating Station and Kayenta mine has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/us/politics/trump-coal-industry.html\">already shuttered</a>, while the Cholla Power Plant is shutting down over the next few years. The Four Corners plant in New Mexico has seen its planned 2031 retirement date accelerated.</p>\n\n<p>There are several reasons for this. Older coal plants have been retiring across the US as the economics favor cheaper natural gas and renewables. Additionally, the electric utility Arizona Public Service (APS), which owns part of each of these three plants, had a change in leadership at the beginning of the year. New CEO Jeff Guldner announced a plan for the utility to reach zero emissions by 2050, with 45 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030. That was a shocking reversal considering that APS spent nearly $40 million to fight a 2018 ballot proposition that would have required 50 percent renewables by 2030.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722287#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722287&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=NyKqVB2Xb1c:83KV-SL6Up8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=NyKqVB2Xb1c:83KV-SL6Up8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=NyKqVB2Xb1c:83KV-SL6Up8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=NyKqVB2Xb1c:83KV-SL6Up8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=NyKqVB2Xb1c:83KV-SL6Up8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=NyKqVB2Xb1c:83KV-SL6Up8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 20:45:33 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kayenta_train_bill_morrow-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"97a21188aa43ba317d2ab1ae766ae76e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn40@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-06-342_1fb6c4d819614b5c.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":78776,"destBytes":76046,"author":"Scott K.

The big challenge the mission will face is that any liquid water is likely to be far below Europa's icy surface. At best, we can hope for some indication of what's going on based on the composition of any material trapped in the ice itself or the possible <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/12/like-enceladus-europa-might-erupt-jets-of-water/\">presence of geysers</a> that release bits of its interior to space.</p>\n<p>That makes understanding the sorts of remote sensing that might be possible critical. And, to that end, some NASA scientists have looked into how ice behaves in Jupiter's high-radiation environment. The scientists found out that Europa's ice probably glows in the dark, and that glow may carry some information about what's present in the ice.</p>\n<h2>Let there be light</h2>\n<p>The mechanism that can make Europa's ice glow is a bit like what's used by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklight_poster\">black light poster</a>. There, light outside of the visible wavelengths excites molecules that then release the energy at wavelengths we can see. In the case of Europa, the excitation energy doesn't come from light, but that energy is indirectly powered by Jupiter's magnetic fields. These fields pick up charged particles liberated by the planet itself (or one of its moons) and accelerate them. (Much of the material in Jupiter's high-radiation areas was expelled into space by volcanoes on its moon Io.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1721695#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1721695&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=SzCHKsTOOO0:B7IEmdpDZeQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=SzCHKsTOOO0:B7IEmdpDZeQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=SzCHKsTOOO0:B7IEmdpDZeQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=SzCHKsTOOO0:B7IEmdpDZeQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=SzCHKsTOOO0:B7IEmdpDZeQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=SzCHKsTOOO0:B7IEmdpDZeQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 11:45:27 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/clipper1-800x531.jpg","linkMd5":"14b0a8089aac621ac1779a7027ea962f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn34@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-06-368_b07d9c8534eac267.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":531,"sourceBytes":78930,"destBytes":58880,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/clipper1-800x531.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn34@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-06-368_b07d9c8534eac267.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=SzCHKsTOOO0:B7IEmdpDZeQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn68@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-31-08-435_a0b60b3ac9c0f9b4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=SzCHKsTOOO0:B7IEmdpDZeQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn21@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-31-07-589_0beb9736df0e445d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-653_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-580_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375005932},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","title":"Here’s everything you need to know about Pfizer’s positive vaccine news","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1721584","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229552106-800x572.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wears a facemask as she walks by the Pfizer world headquarters in New York on November 9, 2020.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229552106.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1656\" data-width=\"2318\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> A woman wears a facemask as she walks by the Pfizer world headquarters in New York on November 9, 2020.

But it wasn’t until the 19th century that scientists began to believe it was an impact basin. From the ground, it’s difficult to assess that it's a crater. The thing is just too big to take in all at once. Yet the cluster of temples in the center of Ramgarh suggests ancient cultures recognized there was something special about the place, even if they had no way of knowing it was formed by a rock from outer space. Examining the effects of meteorites is always scientific, but it’s often spiritual, too, and it’s the tension between those two disciplines that drives <em>Fireball.</em></p>\n<p>Written and directed by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/07/warner-herzog-lo-and-behold\">Werner Herzog</a>, the documentary aims to make sense of extraterrestrial geology, to trace all the ways meteorites have made impressions far beyond the edges of any individual crater. Herzog and his co-director, Cambridge University volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer, interview boffins geeking out over meteorites in their lab, of course, but also a jazz musician prowling for micrometeorites on the rooftops of Oslo, an indigenous painter chronicling otherworldly stories in the outback of Australia, and a Jesuit priest keeping vigil over a meteorite collection in a secluded European observatory. “Every stone has its own separate story,” Herzog says.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723198#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723198&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Rijt3DwXQW0:-JCkFR6JnqQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Rijt3DwXQW0:-JCkFR6JnqQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Rijt3DwXQW0:-JCkFR6JnqQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Rijt3DwXQW0:-JCkFR6JnqQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Rijt3DwXQW0:-JCkFR6JnqQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=Rijt3DwXQW0:-JCkFR6JnqQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 12:01:59 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Culture_FIREBALL-1-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"2f04ba90b9f7ff402bdfe1746e2925c4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn25@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-06-322_526cd8755ec91375.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":27083,"destBytes":8418,"author":"WIRED","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Culture_FIREBALL-1-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn25@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-06-322_526cd8755ec91375.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Rijt3DwXQW0:-JCkFR6JnqQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn81@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-31-07-589_e698ece11225e902.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=Rijt3DwXQW0:-JCkFR6JnqQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn17@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-576_1bf18572df51a161.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-653_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-580_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375005933},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","title":"In a nightmare year, Victor Glover is on the verge of living his dream","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722791","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NHQ201808030008_large-800x479.jpg\" alt=\"A man in a NASA jumpsuit strikes a victorious pose in front of a US flag.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NHQ201808030008_large.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1150\" data-width=\"1920\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> NASA announced in August 2018 that Victor Glover would be flying aboard the first operational Crew Dragon mission to the International Space Station.

But it has become increasingly clear that we can spread it to a large number of species, and a subset of those species are then able to pass it on to others. If those species are able to pass it back to humans, it adds to the risk posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. That's because it provides a route for new infections that avoids all of the means we're using to try to control the virus's spread between humans. And there's also the chance that the virus's reproduction within an animal species would select for a mutation that would make the virus more dangerous to humans.</p>\n<p>While we've already found the virus in cats and dogs, the big risk so far has turned out to be an unexpected source: mink. As early as August, it was clear that the virus was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/coronavirus-creeps-into-us-mink-farms-unusually-larger-numbers-dead/\">killing lots of the animals</a> on US mink farms. Earlier this month, the discovery that the virus had spread back from mink to humans caused Denmark to decide to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/mink-variant-of-coronavirus-spreads-to-humans-in-denmark-full-cull-planned/\">cull its entire population</a> of mink. Now, with some people on edge because of that drastic action, we have a report that provides detailed tracing of the virus' spread between mink and humans, providing us a better sense of the risks involved.</p>\n\n<h2>There and back again</h2>\n<p>The work was done in the Netherlands, which also hosts a substantial number of mink farms. The new paper, written by public health and veterinary officials, is essentially the equivalent of a contact-tracing report done for mink. It uses a combination of diagnostics to identify people and animals that have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2, whole genome sequencing to understand the source of those infections, and interviews (limited to the humans) to help determine any actions that might influence the virus's spread.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722350#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1722350&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=otNUWOB2Q1c:NuA4v9m8iTQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=otNUWOB2Q1c:NuA4v9m8iTQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=otNUWOB2Q1c:NuA4v9m8iTQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=otNUWOB2Q1c:NuA4v9m8iTQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=otNUWOB2Q1c:NuA4v9m8iTQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=otNUWOB2Q1c:NuA4v9m8iTQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 22:41:14 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1094509372_d620ca388e_h-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"89af5af59bcf0742ecfae9313b850975","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn21@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-06-341_c20eb45f0e9eacb5.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":71100,"destBytes":39012,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1094509372_d620ca388e_h-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn21@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-06-341_c20eb45f0e9eacb5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=otNUWOB2Q1c:NuA4v9m8iTQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn60@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-31-08-259_c5b83899a06df1c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=otNUWOB2Q1c:NuA4v9m8iTQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn54@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-587_ceb5f0940e588d50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-653_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-580_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375005933},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","title":"Historical detectives discover more first editions of Isaac Newton’s Principia","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1719607","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newtonTOP-800x532.jpg\" alt=\"A copy of Isaac Newton's &#60;em&#62;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&#60;/em&#62;, one of the most important scientific works ever written, housed at the Science Museum Library and Archives in Swindon, England.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newtonTOP.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"798\" data-width=\"1200\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> A copy of Isaac Newton's <em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>, one of the most important scientific works ever written, housed at the Science Museum Library and Archives in Swindon, England.

The famed 18th-century mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange described it as \"the greatest production of a human mind.\" Science historians have long debated just how many copies were produced during the book's first print run.</p>\n<p>Thanks to two intrepid researchers who <a href=\"https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/hundreds-copies-newtons-emprincipiaem-found-new-census\">spent more than a decade</a> scouring records and archives across the globe, it now seems there could be more than twice as many surviving first editions as the long-accepted prior best estimates. They described the findings of their census in <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00033790.2020.1808700\">a new paper</a> published in the journal Annals of Science.</p>\n<p>As a young man, Newton attended Cambridge University, earning his undergraduate degree in science and math in 1665. His graduate studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the plague in Cambridge. Students and professors alike fled the city, and Newton returned home for the ensuing year, until the danger had passed. In that one year, he laid the groundwork for revolutionary ideas that would change the course of scientific history.<!--adbreak--></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1719607#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1719607&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=azjNIg3TjYM:q7xTQ8Miv6M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=azjNIg3TjYM:q7xTQ8Miv6M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=azjNIg3TjYM:q7xTQ8Miv6M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=azjNIg3TjYM:q7xTQ8Miv6M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=azjNIg3TjYM:q7xTQ8Miv6M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=azjNIg3TjYM:q7xTQ8Miv6M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 18:59:34 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newtonTOP-800x532.jpg","linkMd5":"f8532bbc50be24058ec98f7d4ac30d4d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn38@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-06-169_d967af3a725be788.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":532,"sourceBytes":48552,"destBytes":37148,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newtonTOP-800x532.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn38@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-06-169_d967af3a725be788.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=azjNIg3TjYM:q7xTQ8Miv6M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn66@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-576_2b7f150fbb0b5349.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=azjNIg3TjYM:q7xTQ8Miv6M:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn31@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-568_b5ef2ac4793550bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn98@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-31-07-653_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-31-07-580_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375005933}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:05","feedId":45,"fetchDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 17:30:05 +0000","fetchMs":37,"handleMs":439,"totalMs":65145,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"135b586132fb35cbb1669fe09384b6b7","hostName":"us-008*","requestId":"c877b7c356df43f6b43ae845be606085_45","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":750562,"bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":20,"articlesImgsTotal":62,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":61,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":1,"myreaderx8":2,"myreaderx7":2,"myreaderx15":2,"myreaderx16":2,"myreaderx6":2,"myreaderx4":3,"myreaderx10":2,"myreaderx32":2,"myreaderx11":2,"myreaderx33":3,"myreaderx3":2,"myreaderx2":2,"myreaderx12":2,"myreaderx1":2,"myreaderx13":2,"myreaderx30":3,"myreaderx31":2,"myreaderx18":2,"myreaderx19":2,"myreaderx":2,"myreaderx25":2,"myreaderx27":2,"myreaderx21":3,"myreaderx22":2,"myreaderx23":1,"myreaderx24":3,"myreaderx5oss":2,"myreaderx29":2},"failGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":1}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:41","id":45,"name":"Science – Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/science","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn40@2020_1/2020/09/01/01-23-39-453_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
