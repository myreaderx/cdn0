Shadows of Brimstone is a game where you start in a Wild West frontier town, and from there take a group of heroes to nearby mines to explore and battle monsters. From the basic flow of the game, scenarios being played out on cardboard tiles, co-op PvE gameplay of group against \"AI\" monsters, it might appear that Shadows of Brimstone is a very similar game to Gloomhaven. But in fact it is a good example of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4geNOJlutY\" target=\"_blank\">the great \"Euro\" vs. \"Ameritrash\" divide</a>. (Sorry, I didn't invent that term.)<div><br /></div><div>Of course, no classification is ever perfect. Shadows of Brimstone has some characteristics of a Euro game, for example it being co-op instead of confrontational. Gloomhaven has some characteristics of an Ameritrash game, for example the miniatures for the heroes. Still, the first thing you see when you open a Shadows of Brimstone box is lots and lots of miniatures which you have to assemble yourself (which is one thing I hate, because I am not good at this), but more importantly for gameplay, lots of dice.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is where you can really tell that Shadows of Brimstone is more an Ameritrash game, and Gloomhaven more of a Euro game: There is a lot more randomness in Shadows of Brimstone. For example in Shadows of Brimstone the scenario dungeon is created randomly while you play: You move to the edge of one tile, and draw a card to determine the next tile, and roll a dice to determine the exit of that tile. In Gloomhaven, the complete shape of the scenario dungeon, and the number and type of monsters in it, are usually pre-determined in the scenario book. (In fact, I kind of disliked scenario #2 in Gloomhaven, because of boss abilities that could randomly end up overwhelming you with monsters if you were unlucky.)</div><div><br /></div><div>Even more importantly, movement and combat is a lot more random in Shadows of Brimstone, where you mostly use dice to determine everything. If you roll 1d6 to determine how many spaces you will move this turn, you don't get much control. In Gloomhaven you decide which cards to play this turn, so you have a pretty good idea how many spaces you are going to move. Even the basic combat modifier deck has 16 cards out of 20 that just modify your attack between +1 and -1, which is a lot more reliable and predictable than a d6 roll. In Gloomhaven you plan how you want your move to go, and there is a significant chance that it works as planned, and a smaller chance that it works out somewhat differently, because a monster drew a very fast initiative card, or you drew a rare \"attack failed\" card.</div><div><br /></div><div>I like games to have a bit of randomness, like Gloomhaven, but not to be too random. I like Gloomhaven combat, because it makes me think, and allows me to plan ahead. Player skill has a bigger role in Gloomhaven because of that, rather than luck. Over the past decades, a lot of genres of games have moved away from too much randomness. Even Dungeons &amp; Dragons in 5th edition is a lot less random than previous editions, due to the game design concept known as <a href=\"https://olddungeonmaster.com/2014/08/30/bounded-accuracy/\" target=\"_blank\">bounded accuracy</a>. Deckbuilding in games like Magic the Gathering are all about reducing randomness. In Gloomhaven, a part of character advancement is changing the attack modification deck to make it more reliable. I don't want to take it too far, and play a game like chess in which there is no randomness at all. But too much randomness makes planning obsolete, and thus makes player skill obsolete.</div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><a href=\"http://tobolds.blogspot.com/\">Tobold's Blog</a></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ToboldsBlog/~4/HAg3eKdMbqA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 09:06:00 +0000","feedId":50769,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"cddef218806e836d6dbd2c003fd4bb67","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Tobold","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ToboldsBlog/~4/HAg3eKdMbqA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn23@2020_6/2020/11/16/01-19-04-759_31fce6b25977d892.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605489487473}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 09:18:07","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 09:18:07","feedId":50769,"fetchDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 01:18:07 +0000","fetchMs":1928,"handleMs":8,"totalMs":60280,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":25,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"649c417ce44ee5dd84e136a61274e5e4","hostName":"us-015*","requestId":"41c22ce09cc84d728b47de845cf4deac_50769","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":72,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx6":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:57:54","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:16:06","id":50769,"name":"Tobold's Blog","url":"http://tobolds.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default","subscriber":63,"website":null,"icon":"http://tobolds.blogspot.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn86@2020_5/2020/09/06/22-16-05-127_452d6f0d503dcc4a.ico","description":"A blog about MMORPG ( Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games ) and other games I'm currently playing.
