So after years of development, Android is launching Nearby Share, a platform to enable reliable and easy sharing across thousands of Android phone models and billions of people.</p><p>Nearby Share is rolling out to Android 6.0+ phones today, making it easier to instantly share files, links, pictures and more with people around you, all while protecting your privacy. </p><br/><h4>Easily share content both online and offline</h4><p>When you just want to quickly share something with a friend or someone nearby, it can be a hassle to open your messages, find a contact and then find the file you’d like to attach. Nearby Share allows you to cut down on that time with simple taps and see a list of devices in your proximity with which you can share content. Once you select the receiver, they will be notified with the option to either accept or decline the file. Nearby Share then automatically chooses the best protocol for fast and easy sharing using Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, WebRTC or peer-to-peer WiFi — allowing you to share even when you’re fully offline.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"ASL_Nearby_Share_Creative_V07.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/ASL_Nearby_Share_Creative_V07.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h4>Safely share and receive files with those around you</h4><p>Nearby Share was built with privacy at its core, so you can share and receive files with peace of mind. Now you don’t have to worry about exchanging contact information, because Nearby Share allows you to both send and receive files anonymously. It also allows you to adjust your privacy settings from your phone’s Quick Settings at any time. You can be “hidden,” visible to “some contacts” or visible to “all contacts,” so you never receive files that you didn’t ask for.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"Nearby_Pixel_Shell_Settings-03.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Nearby_Pixel_Shell_Settings-03.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h4>Works smoothly with Chromebooks</h4><p>In the coming months, Nearby Share will work with Chromebooks so you can swiftly share files between an Android phone and a Chromebook, and vice versa.
