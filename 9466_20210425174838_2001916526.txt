From booking an online yoga class to ordering takeout from your favorite restaurant —Google Maps is a powerful sidekick that lets you accomplish tasks all throughout your day. Today, we have new tools in collaboration with Google Pay to help you get more done when you’re on the go: the ability to pay for street parking and transit fares right from Google Maps, without ever taking out your wallet. </p><br/><p><b>Keep it clean and easy</b>  🧼 🖐️</p><br/><p>These days, people are upping their hand sanitizing game and avoiding touching public surfaces as much as possible. Thanks to an integration with parking solutions providers Passport and ParkMobile, you can now easily pay your meter right from driving navigation in Maps, and avoid touching the meter altogether. Simply tap on the “Pay for Parking” button that appears as you near your destination. Then enter your meter number, the amount of time you want to park for, and tap “Pay.” Need to add more time to your meter? Easily extend your parking session with just a few taps.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"pay for parking\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Pay_for_parking_maps_gif.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Pay for parking right from Google Maps</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p><b>Save time and grab a ride</b> 🚌🏃</p><br/><p>We’re expanding the ability to pay for transit fares from Maps for over 80 transit agencies around the world. Now you'll be able to plan your trip, buy your fare, and start riding without needing to toggle between multiple apps. You can understand how to pay in advance and even get your fare ready to go before you arrive at the station - which is helpful when you’re not sure what payment options a transit agency supports. When you get transit directions, you’ll see the option to pay with your phone with the credit or debit cards already linked to your Google Pay account. And in places like the San Francisco Bay Area, you’ll also be able to buy a digital Clipper card directly from Google Maps. Once you’ve purchased your fare, all you need to do is tap your phone on the reader or show your digital ticket to breeze on board.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \"><img alt=\"pay for transit\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/MapBanner_01_1.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption h-c-page\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Plan a trip, purchase a fare, and start riding - all from Google Maps.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>No matter how you’re getting around these days, Google Maps can help you get there effortlessly. Pay for parking starts rolling out today on Android in 400+ cities in the U.S, (including Boston, Cincinnati, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Washington D.C, and more) with iOS coming soon.
