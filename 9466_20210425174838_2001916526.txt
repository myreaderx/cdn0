Now you'll be able to plan your trip, buy your fare, and start riding without needing to toggle between multiple apps. You can understand how to pay in advance and even get your fare ready to go before you arrive at the station - which is helpful when you‚Äôre not sure what payment options a transit agency supports. When you get transit directions, you‚Äôll see the option to pay with your phone with the credit or debit cards already linked to your Google Pay account. And in places like the San Francisco Bay Area, you‚Äôll also be able to buy a digital Clipper card directly from Google Maps. Once you‚Äôve purchased your fare, all you need to do is tap your phone on the reader or show your digital ticket to breeze on board.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \"><img alt=\"pay for transit\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/MapBanner_01_1.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption h-c-page\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Plan a trip, purchase a fare, and start riding - all from Google Maps.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>No matter how you‚Äôre getting around these days, Google Maps can help you get there effortlessly.¬†Pay for parking starts rolling out today on Android in 400+ cities in the U.S, (including Boston, Cincinnati, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Washington D.C, and more) with iOS coming soon.
