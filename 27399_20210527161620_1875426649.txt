For example when presenting an analysis to colleagues over a video call. Or teaching a topic and make sure the audience focuses on the content of the notebook.</p><p>The goal of the RetroLab project is to offer an interface with a retro look and feel, similar to the Classic Notebook, while leveraging the efforts put in the development of JupyterLab itself and its extension system.</p><p>Technically speaking RetroLab <strong>remixes</strong> many of the existing plugins for JupyterLab (notebook, toolbar, terminals) and reassembles them in a different way. It also supports <em>prebuilt</em> third-party extensions using the new distribution system added in JupyterLab 3.0. That way, many extensions built for JupyterLab will also be compatible with RetroLab.</p><p>JupyterLab itself is also built as a set of extensions and plugins. The JupyterLab extension system makes it very convenient to create new distributions from a subset of plugins.</p><p>Let’s have a look at some of features available in RetroLab.</p><h3>Notebooks, Files and Terminal</h3><p>RetroLab supports Notebooks, Files and Terminals.</p><p>Notebooks can be created using the File Browser, the menu items and the command palette.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YNXP-hnVMyrpRjDwMyFBtA.gif\" /><figcaption>Working in a notebook with RetroLab</figcaption></figure><p>The File Browser provides convenient buttons to quickly create new notebooks, files and terminals.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BZPRD5veN5Fwm81rCD2ZNQ.gif\" /><figcaption>Creating a new Terminal</figcaption></figure><p>Long time users of the Classic Notebook will already have noticed that activities are opened in new browser tabs by default. This provides an alternative way to manage workflows. Users who prefer to manage everything within a single browser tab might want to stick to the JupyterLab default interface.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KejsZJ1Vq82_ncEGjN6zdA.gif\" /><figcaption>Open in a new Browser Tab by default</figcaption></figure><h3>Zen Mode</h3><p>RetroLab also offers a zen mode to quickly switch to full screen and hide the top area. Very useful to focus on a single notebook, and also during presentations or screen sharing sessions!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q-cGj8z0kw7sbMl_D6y34Q.png\" /><figcaption>Zen Mode</figcaption></figure><h3>Support for existing JupyterLab prebuilt extensions</h3><p>One of the main features in JupyterLab 3.0 is the new extension distribution system, which makes it possible to distribute extensions as <em>prebuilt extensions. </em>Prebuilt extensions do not require users to rebuild JupyterLab or have <a href=\"https://nodejs.org\">Node.js</a> installed.</p><p>Since prebuilt extensions are loaded dynamically, they can also be leveraged in RetroLab without any extra step!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kdj9uNSXmZVOzDVM_qKjxQ.gif\" /><figcaption>Installing a new JupyterLab extension and using it in RetroLab</figcaption></figure><p><em>Note to developers: most of the time your extension will be compatible with RetroLab without changing anything. However it is good practice to think about the different types of JupyterLab distributions when developing the extension. For example some services and shell areas are not available in RetroLab: no left, right and bottom area, the main area supports adding only one widget…</em></p><h3>Command Palette</h3><p>RetroLab includes a command palette, just like in JupyterLab.</p><p>Hit Ctrl-Shift-C or Accel-Shift-C to activate it. Or via the menu with View &#62; Activate Command Palette.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7k57aBOevLbtRDvCBWEWkw.gif\" /><figcaption>Using the command palette to restart the kernel</figcaption></figure><h3>Themes</h3><p>RetroLab also supports Dark Mode! 🕶️</p><p>In fact, it supports any other themes distributed as prebuilt extensions for JupyterLab 3.0.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RlEcR2gqeFdzM-0Vbrrm1g.gif\" /><figcaption>Switching between the light and dark built-in themes</figcaption></figure><p>For an even more retro look, you might want to start retrolab with the --retro-logo flag:</p><pre>jupyter retro --retro-logo</pre><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*GMPUEw-wPbSgc_3q.png\" /><figcaption>The RetroLab logo with the JupyterLab Miami Nights Theme</figcaption></figure><h3>Compact View on Mobile Devices</h3><p>RetroLab automatically switches to a more compact layout on mobile devices, making it convenient to run code on the go.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/541/1*w5BYbWktaFxHWKd-stlQGg.gif\" /><figcaption>Compact layout by default on mobile devices</figcaption></figure><h3>Next-gen JupyterLab features</h3><p>Since RetroLab reuses many components from JupyterLab as-is, it automatically inherits many of the improvements and cool new features being developed upstream.</p><p>With the latest <a href=\"https://github.com/jtpio/retrolab/releases/tag/0.3.0a0\">prerelease</a> for RetroLab, folks can collaborate using RetroLab, JupyterLab or even JupyterLab in Simple Mode.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jJQM60b76hELGDQxWcRbNA.gif\" /><figcaption>Real Time Collaboration with RetroLab and JupyterLab</figcaption></figure><h3>Installation</h3><p>To install RetroLab with pip:</p><pre>pip install retrolab</pre><p>With <a href=\"https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba\">mamba</a>:</p><pre>mamba install -c conda-forge retrolab</pre><p>With <a href=\"https://docs.conda.io/\">conda</a>:</p><pre>conda install -c conda-forge retrolab</pre><p>To try the prerelease with support for real time collaboration:</p><pre>pip install --pre retrolab</pre><p>Development is happening is the following repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyterlab/retrolab\">https://github.com/jupyterlab/retrolab</a></p><p>Feedback, issues and pull requests are welcome!</p><h3>Try it out on Binder</h3><p>It is also possible to try RetroLab on <a href=\"https://mybinder.org\">Binder</a> using the following link:</p><figure><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jtpio/77c82c512f6779a1a05ab59d915dfc36\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/0*4itEMxUk39fqVdJj.png\" /></a></figure><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>With RetroLab, we hope to inspire the development of distributions and applications built using JupyterLab components.</p><p>A couple of other initiatives have already started:</p><ul><li>Gator: <a href=\"https://github.com/mamba-org/gator\">https://github.com/mamba-org/gator</a></li><li>Quetz Frontend: <a href=\"https://github.com/mamba-org/quetz-frontend\">https://github.com/mamba-org/quetz-frontend</a></li></ul><p>There are also plans to <a href=\"https://github.com/jtpio/retrolab/issues/133\">create a cookiecutter</a> that can serve as a template to quickly bootstrap new lab-based projects from scratch.</p><h3>Prior Art</h3><p>This project is mostly a reboot of the two previous attempts at making something similar:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/yuvipanda/simplest-notebook\">The Simplest Notebook</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/yuvipanda\">Yuvi Panda</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/jupytercalpoly/jupyterlab-clarity-mode\">JupyterLab Clarity Mode</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/jupytercalpoly\">Jupyter Cal Poly</a></li></ul><p>These projects really expressed the need for a stripped down, minimal version of the Jupyter Notebook UI, and were a huge source of inspiration for RetroLab.
