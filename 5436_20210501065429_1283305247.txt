Dr Aboul-Fadl received his Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry from Assiut University (1994) under the channel system and joint supervision scheme between Assiut University and Josai University/Japan. Dr Aboul-Fadl performed his postdoctoral training as a postdoctoral research fellow and Scientist at Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Austria (1997- 1998), Institute of Pharmacy and Food Chemistry, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität (FAU), Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany (1999 and 2013) and Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Utah, USA (2001-2002 and 2004-2005). Dr Aboul-Fadl joined Department of Medicinal Chemistry as an assistant Prof. in 1994, then promoted to associate Prof. in 1999 and to Professor in 2004. Dr Aboul-Fadl is a member of Egyptian Syndicate of Pharmacists since 1984, Egyptian Society of Pharmacists since 1994, American Chemical Society since 2002, The Stop TB Partnership Working Group on New TB Drugs (WGND) since Feb. 2010 and Member of Drug Research Council of Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology since June 2018. He is the author or co-author of more than 130 papers in international peer-reviewed journals and conferences and he has 4 patents Furthermore, he is a reviewer and a member of editorial board of several international journals. Dr Aboul-Fadl’s research interests are currently focused on computer aided drug design, design and development of cell cycle inhibitors as a potential anticancer agents, design and development of antituburcular drugs and Prodrugs and chemical delivery systems.

The later do not necessarily share similar chemical or physical properties. Moreover, they could exert different biological activity and even toxicity, the tragedy of the thalidomide drug is still in mind.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080\"><strong>How big an impact could your results potentially have?</strong></span><br />\n<em>E</em>/<em>Z</em>-Isomerization of some drugs such as Sunitinib “ an anticancer drug” and its analogs as our molecules can affect the bioavailability and the pharmacological activities. Accordingly the possibility of inversion of these isomers to each other worthy to be study for good shelf live, maximum biological activities and drug safety.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080\"><strong>Could you explain the motivation behind this study?</strong></span><br />\nSunitinib as an anticancer drug is bound to its receptor in the form of <em>Z</em>-diastereomer, even though they were the <em>E</em>-diastereomer in solution. The <em>E</em> form must be isomerized to the <em>Z</em> form before binding as the <em>E</em>-diastereomer is inactive. This was the motive to study the rate of isomerization in a polar solvent as DMSO. Furthermore, generation of a good multiple regression equation for prediction of stability of the diastereomers based on Quantum mechanics parameters.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080\"><strong>In your opinion, what are the key design considerations for your study?</strong></span><br />\nDevelopment of inexpensive new anti-cancer agents with good potency and offer both selectivity and lower toxicity.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080\"><strong>Which part of the work towards this paper proved to be most challenging?</strong></span><br />\nThe most challenging part was the generation of the predictive equation from the Quantum mechanics parameters and the rate of isomerization.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080\"><strong>What aspect of your work are you most excited about at the moment?</strong></span><br />\nAgreement of the laboratory results with those obtained by applying the generated equation. This will lead to confident prediction for the isomerisation rates of similar molecules and possible wide application in the pharmaceutical field.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080\"><strong>What is the next step? What work is planned?</strong></span><br />\n<em>In vitro</em> study of the antiproliferative activity and CDK2 inhibitory activity of the synthesized compounds. Investigations of isomerization in non-polar solvents and buffer induced isomerization particularly physiological and simulated gastric fluids buffers in addition to photoisomerization of these compounds and similar analogues.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong><a href=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/ra/d0ra10672k#!divAbstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inversion kinetics of some <em>E</em>/<em>Z</em> 3-(benzylidene)-2-oxo-indoline derivatives and their <em>in silico</em> CDK2 docking studies</a></strong><br />\nHany S.
