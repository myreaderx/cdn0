Wouldn’t it be weird if, in between every question, the person forgot what you were talking about? Well until recently, that’s kind of what would happen on Search.</p><p>Many Google searches are part of a longer series of queries, but Google didn’t always carry over the context from one query to another. Especially if that next search has multiple interpretations, the results might have felt a little off, leading you to spend more time rewriting your search until you found what you were looking for. </p><p>This year, Google Search rolled out new ways to get you to the information you want, using context from your recent activity. Thanks to our newest language understanding capabilities, it’s now easier for you to get to a more specific, on-topic search, navigate a topic you’re interested in and find additional information relevant to that topic. Let’s check out how this improved understanding can help around this time of year.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Understanding what you’re looking for</h3><p></p><p>Say you’re planning your Thanksgiving and you start your research to get ready.

But with this change, we can determine that you’re looking to learn more about preparing and serving a turkey and we’ll provide you with a helpful suggestion at the top of your search results page to get you to what you were actually looking for:</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Search for carving\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/C15n_2.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Making your exploration easier</h3><p>These new language understanding capabilities can also identify when you’re exploring a topic and make that exploration easier.</p><p>Say you’re looking for a movie the whole family can enjoy.
