Mmm . . . mmm . . . mmm.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My mouth is watering just typing that out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You hit that smorgashboard at Thanksgiving and then a month later you’re doing it again at Christmas, and in-between there are often parties, gift baskets, and dropped-off platters of cookies to wade through. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While holiday feasting is great for activating the pleasure centers in your brain, it’s not so great for your waistline. All that tasty carby and fatty food eaten in excess can put on the pounds. In fact, most people do indeed gain about 1 to 2 lbs during the holiday season. That may not sound like much, ‘til you consider that adding 2 pounds of fat each year for 30 years will leave you 60 pounds overweight. That’s a recipe for a bowl-of-jelly-esque belly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how can you enjoy those holiday meals without throwing off your nutrition plan? Are you doomed to eating just the celery and carrot sticks your mom puts out as a before-dinner snack? Will you have to bring your own premade meal while you watch everyone else eat Grandma’s delicious stuffing and pumpkin pie?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To answer the question of how to relish all the deliciousness of this holiday season without wrecking your health and fitness goals, I talked to my nutrition coach, Gillian Ward, head nutrition coach at Barbell Logic Online Coaching. </span></p>\n<h3>How to Feast at the Holidays Without Packing on the Pounds</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I track my macros 365 days a year, and religiously work out 4X a week. But, I think feast days are for feasting. Everyone needs those kind of “Mardi Gras” occasions where you let down your discipline hair and indulge a little. So I don’t curtail my eating </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> much on Thanksgiving and Christmas. At the same time though, I do take steps that don’t require much effort or sacrifice in order to mitigate the damage. Here’s what that looks like:</span></p>\n<p><b>Preliminary: start tracking your macros.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you’re not already tracking your macros, then setting up a plan for that is the first thing you should do before the holidays hit. </span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-track-macros/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s your complete guide for how to get started with macro tracking.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It’s simple and effective, and the great boon of doing macro tracking as your “diet” is that there’s a good amount of flexibility built in. If you budget for it, you can fit a couple of Christmas cookies or pieces of homemade fudge into your consumption for the day, guilt-free.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t track my macros on the holidays themselves (beyond making sure I get enough protein). But tracking my macros keeps me on track in between the holiday feasts and gives me the wiggle room to enjoy myself during them.</span></p>\n<p><b>Keep your holiday eating to the actual holidays. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes holiday feasting runs for week after week, big meal after big meal.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Gillian’s first rule is to limit your holiday eating to actual holidays and not let it extend throughout the holiday season. Enjoy yourself on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s, but don’t let the feasting bleed outside of those specific days. You can eat leftovers in the days that follow, but exercise portion control and get back to tracking your macros the day after the holiday.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch your nutrition leading up to the big meal.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the days leading up to the big Thanksgiving/Christmas meal, be extra mindful about your nutrition. Eat even “cleaner” than you usually would. Curb the junk food and snacking. Eat lots of lean protein, fiber, water, and tons of veggies — you will get plenty of carbs and fats at the celebration. It’s okay to be in a small caloric deficit heading into the feast, but resist the urge to starve yourself as that may lead to an all-out binge.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pregame your holiday feasting with 1-2 small meals.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> On the day of the big meal, Gillian recommends having 1-2 small meals beforehand. Your digestive system will handle the feast better, you will feel better, and you’re less likely to binge. These small meals should focus on protein and perhaps a small amount of fibrous carbs (think things like broccoli and beans). You’ll get plenty of fat during the feast.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gillian likes eating a couple of eggs and a slice of whole grain toast for breakfast and then Greek yogurt with berries as a small, light lunch before the Thanksgiving meal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For my small, pre-holiday feast meals, I usually have a whey protein shake (</span><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/chugging-your-protein-its-whey-easier-than-you-think/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here are my recommendations on this front</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) for breakfast and another shake along with some fruit or veggies for lunch. I know I’ll be focused on gobbling down carbs and fat at the feast (turkey is fine, but everyone knows the main attraction is the sides!), so the shake helps ensure I’ll be close to hitting my daily goal for protein intake.</span></p>\n<p><b>Eat slowly and wait a minimum of 10 minutes after finishing your first plate before going back for a second helping.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It takes a while for your body to register that it’s full; if you keep on cramming food down your gullet non-stop, you won’t realize you’re sated ‘til you’re painfully stuffed. So eat slowly, and then give yourself a 10-minute break before deciding if you really want seconds.</span></p>\n<p><b>Go for a walk within an hour of finishing your meal.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Taking a walk gets you away from the temptation to keep picking at the remnants of the feast, and knowing that you’re going to be moving your body afterwards will make you less likely to get uncomfortably stuffed while you eat. Also, it helps burn some of that glucose you have coursing through your body.</span></p>\n<p><b>Don’t beat yourself up about enjoying yourself. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that a meal is just a meal and the next time you eat you’ll have an opportunity to make better choices. Nobody gets fat from one indulgent meal. Just don’t let the holiday meal send you down the slippery, inhibition-releasing, “</span><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pressure-proof/201701/how-the-what-the-hell-effect-impacts-your-willpower\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what-the-hell effect</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” slope.</span></p>\n<p><b>Don’t freak out about sudden weight gain and waist size expansion the day after your holiday gorging. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next day, you’ll probably notice that you weigh 5 pounds more than usual and that your waist is an inch and a half wider. Stay calm. You didn’t put on five pounds of fat overnight. You’re just retaining a lot of water and are bloated. You likely ate a lot of carbs the day before and every carb molecule holds a few molecules of water. Get active, get sleep, and drink a lot of water (ironically, drinking more water releases more of it from the body), and over the next few days your body’s fluid levels will balance out.</span></p>\n<p><b>Manage leftovers. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider portioning the “healthier” leftovers into containers for lunches the following week, or freeze them for a night you can’t cook. If you can’t control yourself with not-so-healthy leftovers, send them home with friends and family. If you don’t have any takers, and don’t want the temptation, it’s okay to throw stuff away; yeah, it’s a waste, but weight gain leads to plenty of costs as well — and far higher ones than 50 cents worth of pumpkin puree.</span></p>\n<h3>Set a Reasonable Intention for the Holiday Season</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us won’t be able to either “cut” weight significantly or totally restrain ourselves from indulging during the holiday season. But we can maintain our current weight, and be content with this static interlude before the new year dawns. Aim to be in the same place come January as you were at the beginning of November. Gillian does this by weighing/measuring herself at the beginning of November and setting the intention to be in around the same place on New Year’s Day, and then intermittently checking in on her progress between those dates. Do likewise, and weigh and measure yourself each week. If you notice your weight creeping up more than it should during the holidays (usually more than a pound a week), this might mean adding some cardio or even being a bit more strict on your calorie intake on days you don’t need to splurge. Again: don’t beat yourself up; just do your best. And if you make changes, make small changes. Not drastic ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There you go: how to eat and enjoy yourself this holiday season without putting on (too) much weight. </span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-feast-at-the-holidays-without-packing-on-the-pounds/\">How to Feast at the Holidays Without Packing on the Pounds</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/G958FWM3LWM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 20:35:31 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"aec7c5e283ddcafb55da9a950156a5c2","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett and Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/Feast-Header-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn22@2020_1/2020/11/20/04-39-45-901_77638475abc525ab.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/G958FWM3LWM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn33@2020_6/2020/11/20/04-39-37-809_449a951a0f9bd57a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847170302},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:30","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:30","title":"8 Things That Can Help You Get More Hygge This Winter","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=129974","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130901\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/hygge3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/hygge3.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/hygge3-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/hygge3-320x197.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/hygge3-640x394.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p>The colder, grayer season is seeping in, and with it, a potential darkening of our mood. The winter can feel bleak in any year, and that’s especially the case in this one, in which a pandemic continues to pervade our lives and keep us from what would normally be welcome outings and festive entertainments. </p>\n<p>If there’s a silver lining to the season though, it’s that its bleakness heightens the pleasures of getting cozy, or, as the Danes — who must weather an especially long and dark winter — call it, getting “hygge.” Hygge represents a warm, snug, relaxing atmosphere, and it’s something you can intentionally cultivate.</p>\n<p>With all of us staying at home more this winter, there’s never been a better and more important time to add some hyggely elements to our abodes and daily routines, and below we have 8 suggestions for how to do just that. Keep in mind that the coziness of hygge is most strongly activated through <em>contrast</em>; that is, sitting by a crackling fire, in a comfortable pair of sweatpants, sipping a mug of cocoa feels most pleasurable . . . when it follows, say, an afternoon spent snowshoeing in the cold woods. So to best survive winter, toggle between continuing to get out for draughts of bracing fresh air, and then retiring to a domestic den which you’ve optimized for hygge-ness.</p>\n<h3>1. Candles</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-130887 aligncenter\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/candles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/candles.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/candles-320x225.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/hygge-make-memories-this-christmas-new-year/\">my podcast interview with Meik Wiking</a>, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062658808/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0062658808&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Little Book of Hygge: Danish Secrets to Happy Living</em></a>, he said that putting a ton of candles in your home is the first step in building hygge, noting that Denmark uses twice as many candles as the second-most candle-consuming country in Europe.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to understand why candles create the foundation for coziness: real fire feels primally comforting, and generates a softer and warmer light than what’s created with electric lamps. Though the flicker of a candle’s flame is small, it adds a disproportionately large amount of coziness to your home. There are endless makers of candles, and endless scents of them. But an Instagram follower recently introduced us to what has to be hygge-ist kind: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3kClz7b\"><strong>WoodWick candles</strong></a>. As the name implies, the wick is actually made out of wood, and when lit, the candle crackles, like a real fireplace fire. The effect is genuinely soothing.</p>\n<p>One place you may particularly want to put the unscented variety is your dinner table at mealtime. Wiking shared a story of the significant difference this addition can make:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I spoke to a Canadian a couple of years ago who had read <em>Hygge</em>, and because of the focus on lighting and candles in the book, he went out and he bought some [candelabras] and started to light candles for dinner at home. And him and his wife, they have three teenage sons, and when this guy, he started to light the candles, the boys, his sons, they started to tease him. ‘Dad, what’s going on with the candles? Do you want to have romantic time with Mom? Should we leave?’</p>\n<p class=\"htl-medrec-after\" style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">But eventually the boys, they started to light the candles and it became this sort of ritual of food and fire. And more importantly, he says now their family dinners last 20 minutes longer because the atmosphere of the candles puts the boys in a storytelling mood. So instead of just sitting down and shoveling down their food, they sit down, they talk about their day, they sip their wine. And I think it’s really fun and interesting to hear, and hear that from several sources, how a candle can actually change how a family interacts.</p>\n<h3>2. Slippers</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130886\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/slipper.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/slipper.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/slipper-320x315.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>There’s no need to wear constricting, uncomfortable shoes when you’re padding around the house, but just wearing socks can leave your dogs cold. Enter the slipper, for which today’s man has many options. You can go with the traditional slide-on that your grandpa may have worn. Or you can sport a leather moccasin. I had been a moccasin man for years. But this year, I’ve traded my mocs in for a yet hyggier kind of footwear: <a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=100&#38;url=43555\"><strong>the Grey’s Outdoor Slipper</strong></a>. It’s made of a cozy wool blend that feels like you’re wrapping your feet up in your favorite blanket, and yet is temperature regulating, moisture wicking, and odor resistant. The rubber sole provides some grip and allows you to venture out of the house. It also dampens sound as you walk across a tile or wood floor, allowing you to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-walk-like-a-ninja/\">sneak around like a ninja</a> (handy for fulfilling the role of tooth fairy, I can personally attest).</p>\n<h3>3. Blankets</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-130888 aligncenter\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/blanket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/blanket.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/blanket-320x214.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/blanket-640x427.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p>Wiking told me that the essence of what hygge should feel like is “a good hug.” Blankets are the kings of cozy for their clutch-ness in imparting this feeling. When you’re reading a book on a winter’s night, or snuggling up with your main squeeze, a blanket adds a comforting layer of warmth. <strong><a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=100&#38;url=43556\">This Faherty Brand blanket</a></strong> is a nice pick on this front; one side is made with brushed cotton, the other with soft Sherpa fleece.</p>\n<h3>4. Sweatpants</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130889\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/sweatpant.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/sweatpant.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/sweatpant-320x277.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>When you’re staying home, there’s no need to wear anything with a non-elasticized waistband. But that doesn’t mean your pants-wear has to be schlubby. There are many kinds of sweatpants in the world, but my favorite is the jogger, as the taper at the ankle just looks sharp and classic. I feel like Rudy training for Notre Dame’s football team on a crisp, fall morning in South Bend. I’ve been rocking <strong><a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=100&#38;url=43557\">Marine Layer’s Yoga Jogger</a> </strong>for the past few months and absolutely love them. They’re made with a super soft performance fabric that’s got plenty of stretch and has served me well for working at home, taking walks around the neighborhood, and coaching Gus’ flag football team.</p>\n<h3>5. Robe, Flannel and Bath</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130905\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/robe2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/robe2.jpg 800w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/robe2-768x366.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/robe2-320x152.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/robe2-640x305.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></img></p>\n<p>There are two types of robes for men. The first is a flannel robe that you might put on in the mornings to stay warm as you make coffee, or don in the evenings to get cozy while you read on the couch. The second is a bathrobe, made of absorbent materials that you put on as you emerge naked from a shower or bath. I’ve owned the former kind for several years, and use it for lounging around the house on cold days. I just recently became a <em>bath</em>robe guy and have become an ardent convert to the practice. I use my bathrobe in lieu of a towel, and I like how it cuts the chill as I step out of the shower and dries me off from head to toe. There are bathrobes that are thick and fluffy, but I like <a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=100&#38;url=43588\"><strong>this thinner, quite absorbent one from Upstate</strong></a> (it’s out-of-stock on Huckberry right now but will be back in a week or so).</p>\n<h3>6. Sweaters</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130890\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/sweater.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/sweater.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/sweater-320x257.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>Sweatshirts are certainly comfy, and many days you’ll find me padding around the house and running errands in my <a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=100&#38;url=43558\"><strong>10-Year-Hoodie from Flint and Tinder</strong></a>. But when the temperature really dips, and (on those currently rare occasions) I’m having some friends or family over, the warmth and classiness of a sweater can’t be beat. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sweater-mans-guide/\">Sweaters are an underused option in the male sartorial arsenal</a>, especially <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/wear-cardigan-sweater-style/\">the cardigan</a>, which you may fear will read as old-mannish, but can in fact be quite handsome. Case in point, the newest addition to my sweater collection and a candidate for my all-time favorite: <a href=\"https://www.schottnyc.com/products/wool-blend-basketweave-cardigan.htm/?partner=artofmanliness\"><strong>this rugged cardigan from Schott’s</strong></a>. It had me at “corduroy elbow patches.”</p>\n<h3>7. Flannel Sheets</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130884\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/sheets.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/sheets.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/sheets-320x318.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>Last year during the holiday season, my mom sent Gus and Scout sets of flannel Christmas-themed sheets from Pottery Barn Kids. Every night as Kate and I would put the kids to sleep, we’d gaze longingly at their amazingly cozy-looking bedding and feel really envious of it. Finally, unable to take it anymore, we ordered a set for ourselves. Yes, from Pottery Barn Kids, in the most mature pattern available, bedecked with cartoony deer. Honestly, we felt no shame, neither in the design, nor the fact we used them on our bed long after Christmas had come and gone, as the sheets were just as comfortable and snuggly as we had imagined. Now, I can’t in good conscience recommend that other adults also purchase children’s Christmas sheets for themselves (plus they only go up to queen size, which may be an issue for some). But I can wholeheartedly recommend flannel sheets in general; if you’re looking for something more grown up, <strong><a href=\"https://www.idevaffiliate.com/31555/idevaffiliate.php?id=100&#38;url=43559\">try these from Upstate</a></strong>.</p>\n<h3>8.

His name is <a href=\"https://theserendipitymindset.com/\">Christian Busch</a> and he’s a professor of economics and entrepreneurship and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0818ZH58R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B0818ZH58R&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>The Serendipity Mindset: The Art and Science of Creating Good Luck</em></a>. We begin our conversation with what serendipity is, and how it’s different than simple chance, and is instead a kind of smart luck, which requires acting on the unexpected and connecting the dots of seemingly random events. We then discuss the three types of serendipity, the obstacles to experiencing this force, and how the amount of  serendipity you experience depends on how you frame the world. Christian explains how to develop a serendipity-seeking mindset, including how to intentionally seed triggers for it. We end our conversation with how organizations and not just individuals can take steps to strategically leverage the power of serendipity. </p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>How is serendipity different from luck or chance?</li>\n<li>How the discovery of Viagra was actually quite serendipitous </li>\n<li>What it takes to develop a serendipitous mindset </li>\n<li>Becoming more open and observant </li>\n<li>Proactively seeking out serendipitous triggers in our life</li>\n<li>Leveraging technology to create your own luck </li>\n<li>Managing serendipity overload once you become more aware of it </li>\n<li>The beautiful power of used bookstores </li>\n<li>How your bad luck can be turned around for good </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807014273/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0807014273&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em></a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-541-the-art-of-noticing/\">The Art of Noticing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/poker-maria-konnikova-interview/\">What Poker Can Teach You About Luck, Skill, and Mastery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-lucky-charms-of-7-famous-men/\">The Lucky Charms of 7 Famous Men</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-490-can-you-learn-to-be-lucky/\">Can You Learn to Be Lucky?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/introversion-as-an-excuse/\">Introversion as an Excuse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/art-of-manliness-podcast-95-follow-your-curiosity-with-brian-koppelman/\">Follow Your Curiosity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gardnersbooks.com/\">Gardner’s Books</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/da-vinci-walter-isaacson-interview/\">How to Be a Creative Genius Like Da Vinci</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-boredom-creativity-productivity/\">Why Boredom Is Good For You</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/reframing-for-resilience/\">How Reframing Builds Resilience</a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-130880\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/11/seren.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"311\" height=\"499\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Christian</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://theserendipitymindset.com/\">Christian’s website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisSerendip\">Christian on Twitter</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!
