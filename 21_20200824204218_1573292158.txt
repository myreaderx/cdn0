it goes on sale for $200 <a href=\"https://mondoshop.com/blogs/news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at Mondo&#8217;s website</a> at 1:00 P.M. EST/10:00 A.M. PST on Wednesday, <strong>August 26</strong>,<strong> 2020</strong>. It will ship sometime in November.</p>\n<p><strong>Mo Shafeek</strong>, Mondo Creative Director of Music, said in a press release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no longer a secret that Ludwig Göransson is the most talented and exciting person working in film and television music right now. But what goes unspoken is his chameleon-like ability to play within multiple genres, even within single cues of his songwriting for the screen. His music for films like Creed and Black Panther showcase not only his collaborative nature, but also his relationship to pop and hip hop, as well as blending untraditional instrumentation with traditional orchestras. His score for The Mandalorian is similarly masterful in its ability to be wildly experimental while never feeling out of place &#8211; like a synth spaghetti western score that feels inspired in equal parts to Ennio Morricone, John Williams and Hans Zimmer, while also never feeling like a pastiche. We are honored to be the home for this complete score.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The press release notes that this is a one-time pressing. We&#8217;re not sure if that means this is the only way that the soundtrack will get released on vinyl, or this is the only time this exact box set will be offered. Either way, this will undoubtedly be a sought-after collector&#8217;s item, so good luck getting your hands on it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

The series takes a close look at NXIVM, an American multi-level marketing company and self-help group that was actually a cult accused of being a recruiting platform for a secret society known as &#8220;The Vow&#8221; (or sometimes &#8220;DOS&#8221;) in which women were branded and forced into sexual slavery.</p>\n<p>Following the debut of the first episode of <em>The Vow</em>, HBO has released a more extensive trailer revealing what&#8217;s in store for the rest of the series. Filmmakers <strong>Jehane Noujaim</strong> and <strong>Karim Amer</strong> (<i>The Great Hack, The Square</i>, <i>Control Room</i>) are diving into the deep end of NXIVM to reveal the complicated truths behind <span class=\"il\">the</span> many headlines driven by this, and one of them even has a personal connection to the group, which sparked the entire documentary project.<span id=\"more-633237\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Vow Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/31rSR0w0z30?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span class=\"il\">In 2010, Noujaim </span>attended Executive Success Programs, NXIVM&#8217;s flagship seminar, and explored making a film about <span class=\"il\">the</span> experience. She kept in touch with <span class=\"il\">the</span> people she&#8217;d met over the years, and when whispers of a controversial secret sorority emerged in 2017, and several high-ranking members defected, Noujaim and Amer started digging, and they had no idea where it would all lead.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, we have some idea of what to expect in the coming weeks. Here&#8217;s a look at some of the upcoming episodes of <em>The Vow</em>, though the later episodes are still being kept under wraps for the time being.</p>\n<p><strong>Episode 2: “Viscera” &#8211; </strong><strong>Sunday, August 30 (10:00-11:00 p.m. ET/PT)</strong><br />\nAfter seven years, Bonnie leaves Albany and NXIVM for Los Angeles to make sense of it all. She tries desperately to get through to Mark, who reassures her all is well. Meanwhile, Mark remains loyal to Keith and NXIVM, but a series of phone calls begin to sow doubt within him.</p>\n<p><strong>Episode 3: “At Cause” &#8211; </strong><strong>Sunday, September 6 (10:00-11:00 p.m. ET/PT)</strong><br />\nSarah confides to Mark about DOS, a secret women&#8217;s group involving “masters” and “slaves.” She struggles in her relationships with NXIVM, her husband Nippy, and her best friend. Nippy confronts <span class=\"il\">the</span> organization he’s helped grow for 15 years. Sarah and Mark lament how many members they’ve recruited and question what to do next.</p>\n<p><strong>Episode 4: “Building Character” &#8211; </strong><strong>Sunday, September 13 (10:00-11:00 p.m. ET/PT)</strong><br />\nMark, Bonnie, Sarah and Nippy strategize with Catherine Oxenberg about how to get her daughter, India, out of DOS, even though she wants to stay. &#8220;Jane,&#8221; a former member and India’s close friend, describes <span class=\"il\">the</span> appeal of <span class=\"il\">the</span> organization and of DOS, and why she left it all behind.</p>\n<p><strong>Episode 5: “Class 1 Data” &#8211; </strong><strong>Sunday, September 20 (10:00-11:00 p.m. ET/PT)</strong><br />\nCatherine believes her daughter is in danger and wants her to come home.

But things went south quickly once they got to the set, because the studio is completely starting over after just a week of production: the duo has now been replaced behind the camera and all of the footage they shot has been thrown out.<br />\n<span id=\"more-633266\"></span></p>\n<p>According to Deadline, Andy and Ryan Tohill walked away from the project after a week of shooting in Bulgaria, due to &#8220;some creative differences.&#8221; The report says Legendary &#8220;didn&#8217;t spark to what it saw&#8221; from the directors&#8217; first week&#8217;s worth of work, so the decision was made in the last 48 hours to start from scratch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Tohills&#8217; vision is exactly what the fans want,&#8221; producer <strong>Fede Alvarez</strong> said earlier this year. &#8220;It&#8217;s violent, exciting and so depraved that it will stay with you forever.&#8221; Looks like he spoke too soon, because the Tohills are out, and <strong>David Blue Garcia</strong> is in. The Emmy-winning, Texas-based Garcia has directed several commercials and served as the cinematographer on the meta horror-comedy <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/blood-fest-trailer/\"><em>Blood Fest</em></a>, but he only has one film under his belt as a director: a 2018 feature called <em>Tejano</em> that was shot in his hometown for just $58,000. You can watch the full feature on HBO Max right now. Check out a teaser for <em>Tejano</em> below to get an idea of what he can do with a micro-budget:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-kkvAk2z8s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Elsie Fisher</strong> (<em>Eighth Grade</em>), <strong>Sarah Yarkin</strong> (<em>Happy Death Day 2U</em>), <strong>Jacob Latimore</strong> (<em>The Maze Runner</em>), and <strong>Moe Dunford</strong> (<em>Vikings</em>) lead the cast. This is the first we&#8217;ve heard about Fisher&#8217;s involvement here, and after loving her performance in <em>Eighth Grade</em>, we&#8217;re excited to see what she does with a more overt type of horror movie. (Junior high was <em>really hard</em> for some people, OK?) <strong>Chris Thomas Devlin</strong> is writing the script, while Fede Alvarez and <strong>Rodolfo Sayagues</strong>, who brought us <em>Don&#8217;t Breathe</em> and the <em>Evil Dead</em> remake, are producing alongside <strong>Kim Henkel</strong>, the writer of the original movie. Production has been shut down this week to accommodate the behind the scenes changes, and it sounds like the plan is to get back up and running soon in Bulgaria.</p>\n<p>If you want to know more about this <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> sequel&#8217;s new director, he gets into some of his origin story and his approach to filmmaking in the following video:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Div4J3hx3cM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/texas-chainsaw-massacre-sequel-directors-replaced/\">&#8216;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#8217; Sequel Directors Replaced, and All of Their Footage Has Been Scrapped</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MyEp6wVQpJY:KRnJJ8Sqk70:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MyEp6wVQpJY:KRnJJ8Sqk70:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MyEp6wVQpJY:KRnJJ8Sqk70:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MyEp6wVQpJY:KRnJJ8Sqk70:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MyEp6wVQpJY:KRnJJ8Sqk70:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MyEp6wVQpJY:KRnJJ8Sqk70:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/MyEp6wVQpJY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:30:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/texas-chainsaw-massacre-restaurant-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"db26b80fcc5e5f78744cea3bd48e45fd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_2/2020/08/24/20-41-49-726_d76d7bc1755692ec.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":33889,"destBytes":10426,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/texas-chainsaw-massacre-restaurant-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_2/2020/08/24/20-41-49-726_d76d7bc1755692ec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn32@2020_1/2020/08/24/20-41-51-619_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MyEp6wVQpJY:KRnJJ8Sqk70:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/24/20-41-51-752_ece4fc10276052c2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn86@2020_1/2020/08/24/20-42-01-137_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MyEp6wVQpJY:KRnJJ8Sqk70:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn77@2020_2/2020/08/24/20-41-51-908_eecb14b1ca123cca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/MyEp6wVQpJY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn38@2020_5/2020/08/24/20-41-51-647_d1b04536fcc236d8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598301709438}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:41:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 04:41:49","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 20:41:49 +0000","fetchMs":53,"handleMs":1530,"totalMs":30584,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"34.196.141.188","hostName":"us-019.herokuapp.com","requestId":"ab4dcc8690264b0190e7879c1f8cc694_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":264108,"bgimgsTotal":3,"bgimgsGithubTotal":3,"articlesImgsTotal":23,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":23,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":1,"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx25":1,"myreaderx15":1,"myreaderx27":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx32":1,"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx21":1,"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx22":1,"myreaderx3":1,"myreaderx11":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx23":1,"myreaderx1":1,"myreaderx13":1,"myreaderx24":1,"myreaderx30":1,"myreaderx31":1,"myreaderx18":1,"myreaderx29":1,"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 01:13:36","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn72@2020_5/2020/08/22/17-13-36-873_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
