Have you gotten shocked thanks to frayed cables, or realized in horror that your cable is so worn out it will take hours to properly charge your phone? Or even worse, have you found yourself trying to transfer a large amount from your computer to your phone before a trip, only to realize that if you wait for it to finish you’ll miss your flight? All of these situations are avoidable if you find a quality USB charging cable. You’ll also have to consider just how important transfer speed is to you. Thanks to USB-C to USB-C cables you can now get even faster transfer speeds, but you’ll need an adapter.

These 10 stone-age survival skills are well worth knowing and highly efficient—especially in a time when we rely on electronics (and battery power) to keep us alive.</p><p>1. Make a fire using friction</p><img alt=\"Rubbing two sticks together will make fire, but doing it successfully requires some know-how. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"908\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/G9_7qESREGqvFzQwry0EpHiWuPs=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/BSWLZAA5CVD27ANQYADAZJNT7E.JPG\" width=\"1210\"/><br/><caption>Rubbing two sticks together will make fire, but doing it successfully requires some know-how.  (Tim MacWelch/)</caption><p>This is one of our most ancient techniques for creating a fire from the natural environment. Most methods involve spinning a drill back-and-forth on a board (reciprocation is the key to most friction methods), or a sawing motion (again, going back-and-forth). But whatever your technique, there are several constants to keep in mind. </p><p>Material selection is key—you’ll want softer wood species for the friction components. The wood should be dead and dry (if you plan to use the kit today), but not rotten. Bark falling off and fungi sprouting from it are both typical signs that the wood is too far gone to use as a friction-fire component. You’ll also want to focus on species with low ignition temperatures and low levels of pitch, an oil-based sap that ruining the friction by acting as a lubricant once heated. </p><p>Finally, you’ll have to construct the kit correctly and learn the skill of using it. There are a lot of things that can go wrong in this complex art form—but when everything goes right, you get fire.</p><p>2. Tie knots for life—but literally </p><p>No matter how much you work on your knot tying skills, all that practice will go to waste without the string, cord, and rope to tie those knots. This is where cordage production comes in as the unsung hero of backcountry survival. </p><p>The simplest cordage doesn’t need to be braided, twisted, or sliced—it’s ready to use “as-is” from the plants that provide it. Ribbon-like strips of bark, flexible vine runners (like wisteria), and long rubbery roots (like spruce roots) can all be used as a cordage alternative. They’re usually too stiff to fasten complex knots, but a simple sheet bend will usually do the trick. </p><p>And for the more plant-knowledgeable survivor, inner bark fiber from certain trees can be twisted into two-ply cordage of any length and thickness. All you need is the time, raw materials, and practice.</p><p>3. Make your own stone blades</p><img alt=\"Stone blades can give you advantages you won’t get from a survival knife.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/Se9iBPlSiw7j3oTghen4Cs7mn-w=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/5XNLIY7QMNBL7PMSD3XMKZHDNA.JPG\" width=\"1280\"/><br/><caption>Stone blades can give you advantages you won’t get from a survival knife. (Tim MacWelch/)</caption><p>You can use different stone working techniques to create razor sharp blades from common rocks all around the world. For example, by striking a thin edge on a piece of flint or quartz with a small stone cobble, you can drive off a sharp stone flake that can be used for many camp tasks. From slicing rope to cutting up food, these blades can be as tough as the stones they hail from. </p><p>And here’s the trait that actually gives them a leg up on your expensive survival knife—these stone flakes are disposable. You wouldn’t want to butcher an animal with your one and only knife, if you had something else to use that’ll save you the cleaning. (I’ve not only skinned, but also butchered entire deer with sharp quartz flakes.) When you’re done, you don’t have to put a dirty knife back into the sheath—just chuck the stone back into the woods and keep going.</p><p>4. Make some traps</p><p>Trapping can be used for predator control, or help you harvest game animals that aren’t practical to hunt, such as nocturnal species. When you follow the rules, this skill is a smart and practical way to increase your odds of bringing home meat. In order to harvest game, even when you’re not there, you’ll have to fool their nose by minimizing your own human scent, and also play the numbers game—setting dozens of traps will give you a greater chance to catch game. </p><p>Whether you’re setting deadfalls, snares, or some other type of device, trapping is a broad and complex skill set that is full of things that can fail. Even so, when survival trapping goes right, it almost feels like free food.</p><p>5. Boil water in a rock</p><img alt=\"A rock boil will keep your drinking water clean.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/PUoaaW1rZBfqg6ln0E36krvyYGE=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/TZV3BQBEY5BGROPVZGAG242WPE.jpg\" width=\"1084\"/><br/><caption>A rock boil will keep your drinking water clean. (Tim MacWelch/)</caption><p>Dehydration can kill us in a matter of days, so drinking enough is key. However, we’re vulnerable to many different organisms found in raw water all over the globe, so we can’t just drink any water. From viruses and bacteria, to amoeba and parasitic worms invisible to the naked eye, microorganisms that live in surface water can easily turn a lifesaving liquid into a deadly drink. </p><p>One of the oldest and most reliable methods for disinfecting raw water is boiling, and there’s an ancient way to do it without a pot or kettle—rock boiling. By heating small stones (collected from a dry area) for 30 to 45 minutes in a fire, you can drop these rocks one by one into a vessel to boil the water. The vessel could be a large wooden bowl or trough (something you could never place over a fire) or it could be a cavity in a rock (something too big to move or heat up). I’ve even rock boiled in pumpkin shells and holes in the ground. </p><p>I recommend making a pair of tongs from a thick green stick to move your hot rocks and finding the cleanest and largest vessel you can.</p><p>6. Build a shelter</p><p>Remember the little stick forts you built as a kid? Now it’s time to build another one, and this time, <a href=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/survival-shelters-15-best-designs-wilderness-shelters/\" target=\"_blank\">it’s going to save your life</a>. </p><p>There are many different survival shelters you can build from the resources in nature. Lean-tos can block the wind and provide some warmth, if we are able to keep a fire going through the night. Debris huts are even better for nighttime warmth, though they are cramped and take longer to build.

(Tim MacWelch/)</caption><p>On the one hand, foraging is as simple as picking some weeds and eating them, but on the other, there are a lot of subtleties and more than a few things can go wrong. From simple acts like picking berries to more complex ones like cracking and soaking acorns, <a href=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/ultimate-guide-to-eating-acorns/\" target=\"_blank\">foraging can be both basic and complicated</a>. However deeply you delve into the subject, it’s crucial that you make a positive identification of the plant species and you’re sure you know how to use the plant parts correctly. </p><p>Mistakes in foraging can be as minor as a stomach ache, or as serious as organ failure and death. Collect wisely.</p><p>8. Find your way around</p><p>Without today’s modern navigation equipment and detailed topographical maps, you might imagine that finding your way in the wild would be impossible. But that’s not true—our species has been finding its way around for millennia.</p><p>So when your compass turns up missing and GPS batteries die, you can still find your way by traditional means. The sun and moon can give you a general sense of direction, as both celestial bodies rise in the east and set in the west. Weather fronts can also follow predictable patterns, with most storms and prevailing winds blowing out of the west in North America. </p><p>Even at night, friendly stars and constellations can guide you—the North Star and its surrounding constellations (the Big Dipper, Little Dipper, and Cassiopeia) can show us which way is north. If that’s not enough, stab a stick into the ground in a sunny spot during midday. If it’s exactly the midpoint between dawn and dusk, the shadow will point due north. If you’re not certain of the time, mark where the tip of the shadow falls on the ground (place a stone there or stab a smaller stick in the dirt) and mark it again in a few hours. This will give you an east/west line, with the first marker being in the west and the second marker in the east.</p><p>9. Go fish</p><img alt=\"There are ways to lure fish from their watery home without a nightcrawler.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/pmgcgFU9RYpcClAQ0CufI_TaF5Q=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/K43VZSE6FRFA7H7PG356R5CAVI.JPG\" width=\"1280\"/><br/><caption>There are ways to lure fish from their watery home without a nightcrawler. (Tim MacWelch/)</caption><p>Fishing is an important food gathering strategy—especially in the spring and summer. Ancient fishing tackle looked nothing like the jigs and topwater lures we buy today, but that doesn’t make them less effective if used properly. </p><p>Heritage fishing techniques like nets, traps, spears, hooks, and even hand fishing can still land a whopper when luck and skill collide. In a survival setting, fish can provide us with critical calories from protein and fat (two macronutrients that are hard to find in spring and summer plant foraging).</p><p>10. Learn how to track</p><p>Our ancestors were skilled in tracking game animals and predators. While this art form isn’t used by most people today, tracking can still be a lifesaver in certain situations. Staying alert and reading the signs can warn you a of the dangerous creatures in your area (like bears and mountain lions), and it can also help you locate wild game animals for food. </p><p>When you find clear footprints, make sure you know what you’re tracking, and either follow a trail to find your next meal, or avoid a predator by walking away. </p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:07:24 +0000","feedId":410,"bgimg":"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/WzhX46_S76wmQN5ZWygR3YgvZYM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/FJDHEZUGFJE5PPKZDBOG3YMU4U.jpg","linkMd5":"9163a2e7d24131c6324f1a5727b1fa1d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn77@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-30-44-551_a0ec3a094c647c0b.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":303929,"destBytes":225652,"author":"By Tim MacWelch/Outdoor Life","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/WzhX46_S76wmQN5ZWygR3YgvZYM=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/FJDHEZUGFJE5PPKZDBOG3YMU4U.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn77@2020_5/2020/08/31/17-30-44-551_a0ec3a094c647c0b.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/G9_7qESREGqvFzQwry0EpHiWuPs=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/BSWLZAA5CVD27ANQYADAZJNT7E.JPG":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn43@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-31-08-944_ba398802b0dbc2f1.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/Se9iBPlSiw7j3oTghen4Cs7mn-w=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/5XNLIY7QMNBL7PMSD3XMKZHDNA.JPG":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn99@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-31-08-918_5492010e371bc756.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/PUoaaW1rZBfqg6ln0E36krvyYGE=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/TZV3BQBEY5BGROPVZGAG242WPE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn96@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-31-08-823_cce352542e4e0e51.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/WxHDikdlB5UVESWwUA0cqaDfE3s=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/MGOTPV7JENHKBFGD5OTWNF54DQ.JPG":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/31/17-31-08-968_141d93c536672d8e.webp","https://www.popsci.com/resizer/pmgcgFU9RYpcClAQ0CufI_TaF5Q=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/K43VZSE6FRFA7H7PG356R5CAVI.JPG":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598895044060},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:30:44","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:30:44","title":"Home composters that will help your garden and the planet","link":"https://www.popsci.com/story/shop/home-composting-gear/","description":"<img alt=\"Composting solutions for your yard.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/-g3SJ3R9QI25iRGyELBcP3zDY3c=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/JQKNC7J6PNGODJFV7T6N5NEHYQ.jpg\" width=\"938\"/><br/><caption>Composting solutions for your yard. (Neslihan Gunaydin via Unsplash/)</caption><p>Using compost is one of the best ways to improve the soil quality of your garden, and with a home composter, you can make your own using garden waste and table scraps. It’s an inexpensive way to improve the look of your property. It’s also environmentally friendly, since you’re keeping that material out of a landfill.</p><p>Compost is created when certain types of plant matter are added to the bin, where bacteria break it down to produce carbon dioxide and heat. At the same time, bugs and worms eat and excrete the organic material. After 3 to 12 months—depending on the type of composter and amount of material—the result is a brown, crumbly material rich in vitamins and nutrients plants crave.</p><p>There are two main types of composter: tumbling and stationary. Compost needs to be turned periodically so that oxygen can reach the bacteria, and tumbling devices make this much easier. But the stationary bins usually cost a bit less and have larger capacities, even if you will need to use a pitchfork and some elbow grease to work the material. Don’t forget to consider units that seal up tightly to keep out animals.</p><p>With a home composter, you might never need to buy compost again!</p><img alt=\"Dual-chambered construction.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://www.popsci.com/resizer/Imb4OYq6E1hUWMzaG9rboSOy_ds=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bonnier/57QTNGRMT5HMXCGYT22QY5IIXE.jpg\" width=\"1000\"/><br/><caption>Dual-chambered construction.

(Jason Blackeye/Unsplash/)</caption><p>Not long after Hurricane Laura made landfall in southeastern Louisiana on Thursday morning, there were already<a href=\"https://poweroutage.us/\"> hundreds of thousands of people</a> without power, with no indication of when it will return.</p><p>Blackouts are not a problem unique to this storm. They’re a consequence that can be expected whenever a major hurricane, wildfire, or heat wave grips a region powered by a fragile, aging grid. Just earlier this summer, Hurricane Isaias left more than <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21361751/tropical-storm-isaias-power-outages-tristate-utilities-energy-grid\">2 million people </a>along the east coast without power. A derecho with hurricane-grade winds in the midwest left over <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/derecho-iowa-storm.html\">250,000 without power</a> two weeks ago. California experienced historic rolling blackouts amidst a heat wave around the same time.</p><p>This starkest example of all might be Hurricane Maria. After the storm pummeled Puerto Rico in 2017, the vast majority of the island went dark and it wasn’t until 11 months later that the island fully recovered electricity. It’s the worst power outage in US history and a longterm public health crisis, leaving people scrambling to access essential medicine and putting sanitation systems offline. The disaster laid bare the vulnerabilities of a centralized, fossil fuel-dependent power system to major climatic shocks.</p><p>Yet Hurricane Maria wasn’t just a lesson in what went wrong. It also showed what a disaster-resilient energy model could look like, particularly in the mountainous town of Adjuntas in Puerto Rico. When the community fell dark after the storm, there remained all but one source of power: a solar microgrid operated by <a href=\"https://casapueblo.org/\">Casa Pueblo</a>, an environmental nonprofit and community center. The microgrid—a small power system with its own power source, capable of being disconnected from the main grid—made it easier for the community to recover in the long months to come.</p><p>“We became an energy oasis for the community,” says Arturo Massol-Deyá, the executive director of Casa Pueblo. The space, which also boasts a radio station and coffee shop, offered shelter, community, and power. People could charge essential electronics, receive food and medical supplies, use a satellite phone to call loved ones, and come together in the aftermath of a disaster. Casa Pueblo also distributed 14,000 solar lanterns to people nearby who remained without power.</p><p>It became clear that this could offer a way forward in future disasters, too. “Since [Hurricane Maria], we have been more aggressively promoting a transition to clean energy sources not as an opportunity, but more as a necessity for the island,” says Massol-Deyá. To date, they’ve installed over 150 solar projects, including at the fire station, grocery store, a nursing home, a hardware store, a pizza parlour, and in the homes of people with energy-dependent medical needs, like dialysis.</p><p>Already, these operations have been tested. Massol-Deyá says the solar operations have smoothly weathered a year-long series of earthquakes, as well as other disruptions this past month. “We have had two storms passing by Puerto Rico in the last 10 days and twice blackouts, yet our systems and all the projects that we have done—over 150—they’re resilient,” says Massol-Deyá. Plus, if something were to happen to one installation, he says it’s easy to repair and the entire system isn’t compromised.</p><p>Meanwhile, the country’s grid has continued to falter, even after being rebuilt following Hurricane Maria. “This time, Puerto Rico’s precarious power system faced an entirely different problem: The lines and poles rebuilt after the storm held up, but some of the aging power plants did not, revealing yet another urgent need for the bankrupt power authority,” reported <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/us/puerto-rico-electricity-power-earthquake.html\">The New York Times</a> in January.</p><p>Beyond a more steady source of power, Massol-Deyá sees microgrids as part of a broader vision of creating an energy system that local people are able to control. “We want to democratize energy in Puerto Rico and we want people to be producers instead of consumers,” says Massol-Deyá. “The wealth associated with energy generation can be distributed among the population as a way to deal with poverty.”</p><p>It’s not exactly surprising that a microgrid would perform better during a disaster. “In general, the reason you build a microgrid is so that it will provide power to critical loads—things you don’t want to lose—when the larger transmission system goes down,” says Robert Jeffers, a systems researcher who studies microgrids and energy systems at Sandia National Laboratories, “It’s natural that they would perform better than the transmission system during a hurricane because that’s what they were designed to do.”</p><p>That said, Jeffers says that “if you’ve seen one microgrid, you’ve seen one microgrid.” There can be a lot of variation in the design and purpose. In remote parts of Alaska, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.adn.com/energy/article/alaskas-microgrids-offer-prototypye-powering-world/2016/02/15/\">microgrids are used in places</a> where transmission lines simply can’t reach.</p><p>Along with Puerto Rico, other hurricane-vulnerable regions have turned to microgrids as part of a way to build resilience for the next—and likely worse—hurricane. “In our region we are susceptible to these high wind events for six months a year because our hurricane season starts at the beginning of June and ends in November,” says Fidel Neverson, who lives in St. Lucia &#38; the Grenadines and is a project manager at the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Islands Energy Program.</p><p>The program has been installing microgrids, solar panels, and batteries on islands across the Caribbean, including nine microgrids in the Bahamas, to prepare for a future of worsening hurricane seasons. Neverson says it’s also a way for the islands to become “energy independent” by not relying on costly imported fossil fuel. “When you’re on a little island, you’re relying on fuel coming in from somewhere to provide your generators with the fuel that it needs.”</p><p>It also can save customers who end up paying for these imported fuels. “In the Bahamas, you may see electricity rates more like 30 cents per kilowatt-hour,” says Neverson. That’s double the average cost in the United States of <a href=\"https://www.electricchoice.com/electricity-prices-by-state/#:~:text=The+average+electricity+rate+is,is+13.31+cents+per+kWh.\">13.19 cents per kilowatt-hour</a>. So, he says, “it makes a lot of sense from a cost savings standpoint to turn these small Island grids into microgrids.”</p><p>Currently, the Islands Energy Program is nearly done with the construction of a renewable microgrid on Ragged Island in the southern Bahamas. In the northern Bahamas, they are also building renewable microgrids to backup critical facilities on the Abaco Islands, which were hit hard by Hurricane Dorian in 2019. “What happened is essentially the power system there was devastated. All the power lines were taken down,” Neverson says. “In that case, you see the value of microgrids because you had these two power stations that were responsible for powering an entire island.”</p><p>While hurricanes are often thought of an island and coastal problem, more inland areas and landlocked states have also turned to microgrids. In the Rutland county, Vermont, the Stafford Hill Solar Farm and Microgrid was built over a capped landfill after Hurricane Irene inundated the region with flooding in 2011. “There were 11 inches of rain. Certain areas were isolated because roads and bridges are washed out,” says Todd Olinksy-Paul, a director of the <a href=\"https://www.cesa.org/projects/energy-storage-technology-advancement-partnership/#:~:text=The+Energy+Storage+Technology+Advancement,between+states+and+the+U.S.\">Energy Storage Technology Advancement Partnership</a> behind the project. “Something like a sixth of the state was <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/a-region-by-region-look-at-hurricane-irenes-toll.amp\">left without electricity service</a> from the grid.”</p><p>“Part of the impetus for the project was to figure out a way to provide community shelter with backup power in case of a grid outage,” says Todd Olinsky-Paul. It’s now able to power 2,000 homes in addition to a local high school that acts as a shelter during emergencies.</p><p>A key part of this project is the battery storage, explains Olinsky-Paul. It’s able to reduce the energy load on ordinary days and the amount ratepayers pay for transmission, while also increasing reliability.</p><p>The most recent Senate Democrats’ climate <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/08/25/2020/senate-democrats-climate-committee-releases-new-report-on-climate-action-plan-to-build-clean-economy-for-american-people\">report </a>notes the need for more distributed energy systems like microgrids. “There is an important role for small-scale distributed generation, which can help provide resilience during natural disasters and meet equity and environmental justice goals,” the report notes. Unfortunately, it doesn’t go into more details on the policies that would help increase the deployment and access to microgrids.</p><p>A microgrid itself doesn’t address environmental justice; like any technology, it depends on how it is used and integrated into a community. In fact, it could also further energy inequalities by essentially privatizing parts of the grid, explains Johanna Bozuwa, the co-manager of the climate and energy program at the Democracy Collaborative. “I think there is a real potential in which we see microgrids implemented in higher income communities,” says Bozuwa, “But then that doesn’t allow for low-income community members or folks in disenfranchised neighborhoods to actually get access to those services.”</p><p>Currently, low-income communities face barriers to accessing distributed renewable power. Bozuwa points to the fact that<a href=\"https://thenextsystem.org/learn/stories/redesigning-renewable-incentives-energy-democracy\"> tax credits</a>, one of the main incentive mechanisms for renewable energy, are not available to nonprofit organizations that don’t pay federal taxes, as well as cooperatives and low-income people who don’t pay enough taxes to make the cut. “That is a problem because often those are the entities that actually have the most incentive to try to create resiliency because they often are community based,” says Bozuwa.</p><p>Another key consideration is the ownership model for this technology. Across the country, advocates have been pushing for <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/public-utilities-energy-grid\">publicly-owned energy</a> as a way to better incentivize the transition to renewables, while also giving people more say of their energy future. In Iowa, which just suffered a massive power outage from a derecho, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement has been pushing to transition to more of a microgrid system. Adam Mason, the state policy organizing director, says they want power to be locally owned and democratically controlled. Already, some of Iowa’s longstanding (once fossil fuel-dependent) <a href=\"https://www.iowarec.org/\">rural electric cooperatives</a> are embracing solar energy; Mason hopes this model can be made more transparent and open to community participation.</p><p>Along with helping the state survive extreme flooding and wind events, Mason sees this community-owned, decentralized energy system as key to shifting the state away from corporate farming toward more local systems and jobs. “[It] will mean that we can start to bring some jobs back to these rural communities and development that will lead to more localized and small processors in some of these rural towns,” says Mason.</p><p>Similarly, Logan Atkinson Burke, the executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a Louisiana ratepayer advocacy organization, is pushing for a more grassroots-driven energy system for New Orleans. “In a city like New Orleans, where there is significant poverty, there are opportunities for what is closer to a mutual aid model than the traditional utility business model that was just about building and owning things,” says Burke.</p><p>As for Casa Pueblo, their next project is building Puerto Rico’s first <a href=\"http://www.honnoldfoundation.org/partners/casa-pueblo\">community-owned and -managed solar microgrid</a> with battery power, which will power 17 businesses on the island. By allowing community members to have control over the energy system, Massol-Deyá envisions this as a key way to give the island more determining power over its future. He says, “If Puerto Rico can fulfill its own energy needs, then we can think about decolonizing the island from this political situation we have with the US.”</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:28:50
