The first ever nuclear detonation &#8211; known as the Trinity test &#8211; took place in New Mexico on July 16th, 1945. Since then, ten countries built more than 134,000 nuclear weapons. More than 13,400 remain today.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadHistory1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-41406\" src=\"https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadHistory1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadHistory1.png 2010w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadHistory1-300x155.png 300w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadHistory1-1024x528.png 1024w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadHistory1-768x396.png 768w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadHistory1-1536x792.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the decades that followed, nuclear testing contaminated lands, oceans, and people, and triggered a nuclear arms race that continues to this day. </span><span class=\"s1\">The Federation of American Scientists is honored to join our colleagues at the <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trinitydownwinders.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium</a> in a <a href=\"https://ucs-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/global-security/Trinity-Joint-Statement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">joint statement</a> with five other U.S. organizations on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear testing, endured by victims in the United States and its Pacific territories, </span><span class=\"s1\">from French nuclear testing in French Polynesia and Algeria, Russian nuclear testing in Kazakhstan, British nuclear testing in Australia, and others.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to these harms, the Trinity test marked the beginning of the global nuclear arms race with its endless cycles of nuclear modernization and competition, which continue to this day. </span>Unlike any other invention, nuclear weapons have the capability to destroy human civilization and much or life on Planet Earth.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Federation of American Scientists has tracked the rise and fall of global nuclear arsenals for many years. Despite reductions since the Cold War, <a href=\"https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/\"><span class=\"s4\">there are still more than 13,000 nuclear weapons in the world</span></a>. And we are disappointed to note the emergence of five disturbing trends regarding the current and future state of nuclear weapons: </span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Every nuclear-armed country is currently in the midst of <a href=\"https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/\"><span class=\"s2\">modernizing their nuclear arsenals</span></a>. Some countries are actually increasing their stockpiles, while others are swapping out their older weapons with newer, more effective ones that will endure almost until the end of the 21st century.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Not only are nuclear arsenals either increasing or improving, but it appears that many states are reinvigorating or even expanding the role of nuclear weapons &#8211; specifically tactical nuclear weapons &#8211; in their military doctrines. State representatives have often claimed that these deployments are actually intended to <i>prevent</i> conflict; however, regardless of how much stake one puts into that sort of statement, it is a fact that many states are now increasingly posturing themselves for nuclear warfighting. This development will make it more difficult to reduce the role of nuclear weapons and pursue significant reductions &#8211; and certainly disarmament &#8211; in the future. </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">In recent years, we have also seen the decline &#8211; and general disinterest &#8211; in arms control writ large. Today, bilateral and multilateral arms control agreements have fallen away or are under severe stress, multilateral efforts to engage in good faith arms reductions appear to have completely stagnated, and states often seem more interested in blaming and shaming their prospective arms control partners than actually pursuing measures that would offer a modicum of transparency and predictability in an otherwise unpredictable world.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rather than pursue arms control, it seems that states are more content with pursuing arms competition and even arms races. This is a result of renewed military competition and is fueled by the tremendous influence that weapons contractors and lobbyists have on government decisions; indeed, sometimes nuclear decisions seem to be driven as much &#8211; if not more &#8211; by corporate interests than by national security concerns. </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Nuclear-armed states largely do not appear to consider nuclear disarmament to be an urgent global security, humanitarian, or environmental imperative. Instead, most states seem to consider disarmament as a type of chore mandated by the Non-Proliferation Treaty &#8211; and not one that they are seriously interested in completing in the foreseeable future. It is increasingly rare to hear any officials from nuclear weapon states express a coherent rationale for pursuing disarmament <i>other </i>than as a result of the obligation to do so under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Moreover, they seem increasingly focused on shifting the disarmament responsibility onto the non-nuclear states by arguing they first must create the security conditions that will make nuclear disarmament possible. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Although the Trinity test took place 75 years ago, its destructive legacy continues to this day. And despite these harms, some <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/502825-senate-panel-approves-10m-to-prepare-for-nuclear-test-if-necessary\"><span class=\"s2\">politicians</span></a> are even trying to return to an era of live nuclear testing. Resuming nuclear explosive testing would be taking a monumental step backward and would open the floodgates for worldwide resumption of nuclear testing and development of new nuclear weapons. Instead, on this 75th anniversary, we must look forward, try our best to reverse these worrying trends, responsibly reduce the arsenals and the role that nuclear weapons serve, and work towards a world eventually free from nuclear weapons.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadStockpiles.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-41405\" src=\"https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadStockpiles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"429\" srcset=\"https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadStockpiles.jpg 2500w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadStockpiles-300x172.jpg 300w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadStockpiles-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadStockpiles-768x440.jpg 768w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadStockpiles-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Trinity75-WarheadStockpiles-2048x1172.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Federation of American Scientists is honored to provide the world with the best non-classified estimates of the nuclear weapons arsenals.
