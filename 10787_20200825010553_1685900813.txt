Also called DirectX filters, we still occasionally use them today, for things like fallbacks for CSS gradients. They are proprietary though, and were never picked up by other browser vendors.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the Internet Explorer team decided to <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/09/08/microsoft-css-vendor-extensions.aspx\">add the <code>-ms-</code> prefix</a> in 2009. But soon after these filters were deprecated, and <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/12/07/moving-to-standards-based-web-graphics-in-ie10.aspx\">in IE10 they won&rsquo;t even be supported</a> no more. So you really never need to bother with the <code>-ms-filter</code> syntax, just use <code>filter</code> in those rare cases.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, the <code>filter</code> property has been reborn however, this time for SVG filter effects applied in CSS. Partially supported in Firefox since version 3.5, they&rsquo;re currently being <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/filters/index.html\">formally specified</a>, and also being implemented in <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/10/14/svg-filter-effects-in-ie10.aspx\">Internet Explorer 10</a> and <a href=\"http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/100565\">WebKit</a>. These CSS filter effects will allow some very exciting Photoshop-like filters, like grayscale, sepia, blur, saturate, brightness, and much more.

Some valid arguments in favor are summed up nicely in <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3612236\">this Hacker News thread</a>:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Cursors won&rsquo;t work on touch devices of course.</li>\n<li>Wait cursors might be too easily associated with a frozen browser/system.</li>\n<li>A spinner may indicate more clearly which part of the interface is updating.</li>\n</ul><p>So think carefully before applying the following technique on a large scale. It might be suited in specific conditions though.</p>\n\n<hr><p>There are loads of funky &ldquo;loading&rdquo; animated gifs out there, and these days I also encounter a few CSS spinners. But a technique I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot is simply using the <code>cursor</code> property to convey the message.</p>\n\n<p>Desktop apps usually use the cursor to indicate that users have to wait. Most of the time the cursor is exactly where the user is looking, so they won&rsquo;t miss the message. <a href=\"http://www.quirksmode.org/css/cursor.html\">Browser support</a> for <code>cursor</code> is very good too.</p>\n\n<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t solely rely on the cursor – graying out the loading parts of the interface works well too – but for your next web app you could try slapping a <code>loading</code> class to your body, or any other element, and using</p>\n\n<pre><code>body.loading { cursor: wait; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You might have to explicitly add form elements and links to the selector, so they don&rsquo;t trigger the default or pointer cursor. Adding <code>!important</code> won&rsquo;t work. So something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>body.loading, body.loading input, body.loading a { cursor: wait; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/lensco/eKUuL/\">a quick demo</a>. You can use <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/nimbu/bGxUd/\">other cursors</a> as well, or even a custom one with the <code>url(...)</code> value – although animated images won&rsquo;t work, and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/Using_URL_values_for_the_cursor_property\">other restrictions apply</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Feb 2012 11:35:00 +0000","feedId":10787,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2b5185b3714d6e1e74e5d2200a97571a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317548519},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:48","title":"Quickly toggling elements in the Web Inspector","link":"https://bricss.net/post/64013104469","description":"<p>Here&rsquo;s one Web Inspector shortcut I didn&rsquo;t know about (although it&rsquo;s listed in the shortcuts): just press the <code>h</code> key in the Elements tab and the currently selected element will be hidden.

In the meantime, the fine folk we call browser makers have been working hard on new developer tools to do just that: measure CSS performance. First the <a href=\"http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/style-profiler-preview\">Opera team showed off their upcoming style profiler</a>, and now the <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74004\">WebKittens are tinkering on a CSS selector profiler</a> too.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://files.myopera.com/hzr/files/profiler.png\"></a></p>\n\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"297\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img class=\"full\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;\" src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/2948d6c1e56bbce84c6b1f279297e27d/85f3e53de9f796cc-af/s540x810/6ea0e6c22707da060c9c907462f87f369e30b1bc.png\" data-orig-height=\"297\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure>\n\n<p>One of the features of these tools is to calculate how long your selectors take and then show a list of the worst offenders. But as you can see from the screenshots, and as <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74004#c5\">noted</a> by Pavel Feldman:</p>\n\n<p>&gt;I can see selector matching taking single digit milliseconds. I know from the timeline panel that layout takes hundres of milliseconds or even seconds.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bug-74004-attachments.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=118220\"></a></p>\n\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"231\" data-orig-width=\"500\"><img class=\"full\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;\" src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/d19d56e13deecc8dc23eac3361c010ab/85f3e53de9f796cc-10/s540x810/d11591d67685a8f36ad67aadd2cfcfd261bf61e2.png\" data-orig-height=\"231\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/></figure>\n\n<p>So the relevance of this information may be rather marginal. Perhaps more interesting then is the fact that the Opera Dragonfly style profiler shows the exact moment and location of paint events and layout reflows.

It&rsquo;s about the drop-shadow filter. You may have looked at it and thought &ldquo;this is pretty much the same thing as a box-shadow&rdquo; right? Well, not exactly. The big advantage of the drop-shadow filter is that <strong>it acknowledges the outline and transparency</strong> of an element.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dabblet.com/gist/3820382\"><img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/0G1c2v0I2Y0X3k2Z3L2W/box-shadow.png\" class=\"full\"/></a></p>\n\n<p>Have you ever wanted a box-shadow that followed the shape of an element, including generated content, like a tooltip with an arrow? Or you wanted a box-shadow to take transparent parts of a .png into account? That&rsquo;s exactly what <code>filter: drop-shadow()</code> does. It has the exact same syntax as the <code>box-shadow</code> property, except that inset drop-shadows and the spread value are not supported (yet?).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dabblet.com/gist/3820382\"><img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/2p3g1y1D1q3s3L1D1k35/box%20filter.png\" class=\"full\"/></a></p>\n\n<p>Yes, it’s an experimental property, and yes, it’s only supported in some WebKit browsers now. But <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-filters\">according to caniuse.com</a> there’s already 32.51% of web users with support. And since it’s usually a decoration type of enhancement you can start using this today. Or even use a regular box-shadow on browsers that don&rsquo;t support filters yet.

It would have been great to fully control which properties should be <em>sliced</em> and which ones not, but currently the poperty only has two possible values, <code>slice</code> (the default) and <code>clone</code>.

Take this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.error, .warning {\n    padding: 10px;\n    }\n.error p, .warning p {\n    font-size: 12px;\n    }\n.error a, .warning a {\n    color: #f00;\n    }\n.error a:hover, .warning a:hover {\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #f00;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the spec is implemented, you will simply be able to write it like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.error, .warning {\n    padding: 10px;\n    &amp; p { font-size: 12px; }\n    &amp; a {\n        color: #f00;\n        &amp;:hover {\n            border-bottom: 1px solid #f00;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The advantages are pretty clear: better readability and maintainability, and smaller file sizes!</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering about compatibility, the spec says the following about this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if any value is considered invalid (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration be ignored</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So a browser that doesn&rsquo;t understand nested selectors will read the above example as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.error, .warning {\n    padding: 10px;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While we wait for browser implementations, <del>it would be great if all CSS preprocessors added  support for this syntax so we can start getting used to it today</del> <ins>you can actually start using this syntax today – it&rsquo;s compatible with both LESS and SASS.

It&rsquo;s outlined in full detail on <a href=\"http://www.broken-links.com/2012/01/11/the-new-and-hopefully-final-linear-gradient-syntax/\">Peter Gasston&rsquo;s blog</a>, but the gist is this: If you need a direction keyword, you&rsquo;ll have to specify the <em>destination</em> keyword and prepend the word <code>to</code>. Previously you had to specify the <em>origin</em> of the gradient.</p>\n\n<pre><code>background: linear-gradient(left top, red, gold); /* old syntax */\nbackground: linear-gradient(to right bottom, red, gold); /* new syntax */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Makes it a bit more readable and logical, so it&rsquo;s a good adjustment. But how about the transition from old to new syntax then? Well, this will probably be the last edit to the syntax, as the CSS Image Values and Replaced Content Module Level 3 specification moved to the <em>Last Call</em> status. Browser vendors will likely only start using this new syntax when moving to unprefixed gradients, or keep supporting the old syntax for prefixed gradients (as Firefox 10 will do).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Therefore, if you already used unprefixed gradients with direction keywords – for future compatibility – you&rsquo;d better edit these stylesheets.</strong></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 08:29:16 +0000","feedId":10787,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"44455a7d5a2253431570f8d5d999943d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598317548519},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:48","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 09:05:48","title":"Using Sass source maps in WebKit Inspector","link":"https://bricss.net/post/33788072565","description":"<p>Here&rsquo;s a second topic I talked about in my <a href=\"http://fronteers.nl/congres/2012/jam-session\">Fronteers 2012 jam session presentation</a>. If you&rsquo;ve been using a CSS preprocessor in your workflow, you&rsquo;ve no doubt encountered this issue: you&rsquo;re inspecting some element and want to edit the CSS, but finding that selector proves to be difficult as the inspector shows you file names and line numbers for your <em>compiled</em> CSS.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/233K0g1D3t0x092e0R0U/source-maps-off.png\" class=\"full\"/></p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re using Firefox and Sass you might have heard about <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firesass-for-firebug/\">FireSass</a>, but Chrome users have been out of luck until recently. This is where source maps come into play. <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/\"><strong>Source maps</strong></a> are a language-agnostic way of pointing your inspector to the right location in your unminified and uncombined files. Originally devised for JavaScript, they can equally be applied to CSS preprocessors.</p>\n\n<p><ins><strong>Heads up</strong>: most of the instructions below are deprecated. There&rsquo;s an <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/css-preprocessors\">excellent and up to date overview of the necessary steps</a> on the Chrome DevTools blog.</ins></p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/123768\">fairly recent commit</a> enabled experimental support for Sass source maps in Chrome, so make sure you&rsquo;re running at least Chrome 24. You&rsquo;ll want to turn on <a href=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/1t3G383K3n0U1Z0G3i3L/settings.png\">Enable source maps</a> in the settings, and <a href=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/0a2I0z3g0Z1O0P403C0M/settings-experimental.png\">Support for Sass</a> in the experimental settings tab. <strong>Update:</strong> If the &ldquo;Experimental&rdquo; tab is not visible yet, visit chrome://flags first and turn on “Enable Developer Tools experiments”.</p>\n\n<p>Next, make sure the output style of Sass is anything but &lsquo;compressed&rsquo;. Finally you&rsquo;ll have to enable debug info – if you&rsquo;re compiling from the command line, pass the <code>--debug-info</code> flag. If you&rsquo;re using Compass, add this line to your config.rb:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sass_options = { :debug_info =&gt; true }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now when you compile your CSS you should see lines like these preceding every selector in your compiled CSS:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@media -sass-debug-info{filename{font-family:file\\:\\/\\/\\/Users\\/lensco\\/Sites\\/lensco\\/sass\\/style\\.scss}line{font-family:\\0000336}}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The WebKit Inspector will turn all this into exactly what we need: original file names and line numbers!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/1p3F0W280d080O1M460G/source-maps-on.png\" class=\"full\"/></p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to turn off the debug info in your production environment afterwards – you don&rsquo;t want all these lines littering your final CSS.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Oct 2012
