That’s a little more difficult right now, but given that it’s National Park Week, I decided to try and keep with my tradition by using Google tools to satisfy my wanderlust.</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <h3>Explore new places and parks</h3>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>This year, I’m heading to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/project/national-park-service?utm_source=blog.google&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=national-parks\">g.co/nationalparks,</a> a Google Arts &amp; Culture project developed in collaboration with National Park Service that takes you on guided tours narrated by park rangers from the Kenai Fjords, Hawai'i Volcanoes, Carlsbad Caverns, Bryce Canyon and Dry Tortugas. I can also visit historical sites that I’ve never been to before, like <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/virtual-tour-of-the-eleanor-roosevelt-national-historic-site/4gLCx0_hc_fpKg\">Eleanor Roosevelt’s woodsy home</a> in Hyde Park, New York or <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/camping-in-nature-s-laboratory-with-thomas-edison/IAJyi-hAK4E9Lw\">Thomas Edison</a>’s camping sites (which, to me, look a little more like glamping). There are <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/search/streetview?project=national-park-service\">more than 100 Street View historical tours</a> to choose from, and collections that let you discover Native American <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/grand-teton-national-park\">craft work or</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/dinosaur-national-monument\">fossils</a> from archeological digs.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>Afterward, I’ll take an in-depth tour of some of the <a href=\"https://earth.google.com/web/@34.7325599,-94.20828246,312.21005962a,12000000d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=Ci0SKxIgMzVhNjc1YmQ0NjVjMTFlOTg0Yjg1NTMyNWRjMDk2MzQiB3ZveV90b2M\">National Parks of the United States</a> and wander through a few of the <a href=\"https://earth.google.com/web/@40.66685923,-97.89663015,3450a,17648333d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=Ci4SLBIgZTRjZGJlNDAzNmViMTFlOTg5ZDAxNTBlY2RmNWE5Y2QiCG92ZXJ2aWV3\">most-loved ones</a> recommended by our community of Local Guides in two popular Google Earth Voyager stories.

Perhaps for the most well-traveled out there, they’re a way to remember a favorite adventure.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>\n  <h3>Or revisit old favorites</h3>\n  <p>Before I venture into the unknown, I decided to take a trip down memory lane (or rather, memory trail), and re-experience some of my favorite hikes in National Parks with the help of Google Street View, and anyone can join me—starting with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@36.0646562,-112.1376312,3a,75y,14.68h,93.43t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8A1Vq-AFa_ml0Q-jIQYxZA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656\">Bright Angel Trail</a> in the Grand Canyon. Saving the uphill journey for the second half of a hike is something my legs will never forget, but it remains one of my favorite National Parks memories. And thanks to Street View, I can recreate the journey … with fewer water breaks, probably.</p>\n  <p>I can also make my way up <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@42.9099312,-122.1328337,2a,75y,219.93h,90t/data=!3m10!1e1!3m8!1snbTmQ2lKWhXFglFbfUM7oA!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DnbTmQ2lKWhXFglFbfUM7oA%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D215.23961%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656!9m2!1b1!2i50\">Garfield Peak</a> in Crater Lake National Park (which I hiked during a camping trip where I first met my husband) and make as many nostalgic pit stops along the way as I want.</p>\n  <p>And last summer, my family and I all vacationed in Acadia National Park.

Google has built digital tools to help brands do this, including the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/see-your-messages-local-businesses-google-maps/\">ability to message</a> customers through Google Maps and Search, via Google My Business. Messaging has become such a valuable way to connect with customers that twice as many businesses are messaging via Google now, compared to last year.</p>\n  <p>Today we’re expanding <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages\">Business Messages</a> in Maps and Search to support all kinds of businesses, and giving them the ability to integrate Business Messages directly with their customer service platforms. Business Messages provides brands a comprehensive messaging solution across Android devices, and through Maps on iOS. To improve connections with customers, we’ve recently introduced new smart replies, visual product carousels, and unique welcome messages. There’s also a smooth transition from automated replies to a customer service agent, so that it's not disruptive when the customer messages a business.</p>\n  <p>Several organizations, including Woolworths, Walmart and MyGov were among the first to try the updated Business Messages experience to make customer care more effective and efficient, particularly during COVID-19. Woolworths, Australia's largest supermarket, allows customers to search for products and see availability and aisle information at their local store, plus get details about hours and COVID-19 related updates to make shopping easier. In just a few messages, Walmart lets customers quickly find up-to-date information about store hours, pick-up and delivery options, precautions and more. And MyGov, with partner Amplify.ai, is providing help and answering live questions from Indian citizens about hours, COVID-19 helplines, and ways to volunteer and donate, for more than 11,000 food and night shelters across India. <br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel

As a Black woman, entrepreneur and Googler, supporting Black-owned businesses and Black founders is my passion.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Over the past few months, we’ve seen a surge in online searches for Black-owned businesses. It’s been inspiring to witness so many people look for ways to invest in the Black community. Now, we’re announcing three new ways to help support Black business owners.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Starting today, merchants in the U.S. with a verified <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/business-profile/?gmbsrc=us-en_US-et-gs-z-gmb-s-318-h~z-vla-u\">Business Profile</a> on Google can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/9049526?p=attributes&amp;visit_id=637279614378088756-375796388&amp;rd=1\">add a Black-owned business attribute</a> to their profile, making it easier for customers to find and support them. As part of our $300 million commitment to support underrepresented entrepreneurs, we’re also integrating the attribute into the digital skills training programs we offer Black business owners through Grow with Google Digital Coaches. And through Google for Startups Accelerator for Black Founders, we’re starting our work with the first cohort of 12 startups.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Making Search and Maps more inclusive<br /></h3>\n  <p>With this attribute, our goal is to make Search and Maps more inclusive and help support Black-owned businesses when they need it most.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>“Everyone who comes into this store is welcome,” says Janet Jones, founder and co-owner of the Detroit-based Source Booksellers. “For us, being Black-owned means serving the community we’re in.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>By adding the attribute, people using Google Search and Maps can see Source Booksellers is Black-owned, and easily extend their support by purchasing one of their products, leaving a great review and sharing their Business Profile with others looking for their next book.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \">\n    <img alt=\"BoBA Mobile UI Pop-Up.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/BoBA_Mobile_UI_Pop-Up.max-2800x2800_OKaW0a.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>Identity attributes are featured on merchants' Business Profiles when they opt in</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>To help get the word out about the new Black-owned attribute, we’ve partnered with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://usblackchambers.org/\">U.S. Black Chambers, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(USBC). With 145 Black Chambers of Commerce and 326,000 members across the country, USBC provides leadership and advocacy to empower Black business owners through resources and initiatives. Together, Google and USBC will provide training for Black-owned businesses to enhance their presence on Google through the use of digital tools like Google My Business and Google Analytics. Our hope is that by partnering with USBC, we can help more businesses connect with their community and customers.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Reaching more businesses with digital skills training</h3>\n  <p>We’re also adding the Black-owned business attribute to the training curriculum offered through the Grow with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://grow.google/digitalcoaches\">Google Digital Coaches</a>&nbsp;program. Since 2017, Digital Coaches have offered free mentorship, networking, and workshop opportunities to Black and Latinx businesses in 11 cities across the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago and Detroit.

Starting next month, these 12 founders will receive training and support from Google and industry experts on technical challenges, business growth, and outside investment opportunities to help them reach the next level.</p>\n  <p>In my current role as the Head of Google for Startups in the U.S., I have the privilege of continuing to work with Black entrepreneurs. Today’s updates are a part of our company-wide effort to support Black-owned businesses through products and meaningful partnerships. It’s my hope that this attribute and Google’s tools and training can serve as additional resources for Black-owned businesses and the people who support them.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":591,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/BoBA_Mobile_UI_Pop-Up.max-2800x2800_OKaW0a.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"5d69ac0ccee302ae14477fca54e6aa0b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn50@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-12-01-727_d7e456946ea88635.webp","destWidth":732,"destHeight":1000,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/BoBA_Mobile_UI_Pop-Up.max-2800x2800_OKaW0a.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn37@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-12-02-966_d7e456946ea88635.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/GFSA-Black-Founders-Announcement8_1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn9@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-12-12-625_9eae5e427f0d57f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/SbSV?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn10@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-12-00-698_4bbeb52263385580.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/SbSV?i=KMSdULxsLjg:R-yt3bMEJWQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn14@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-12-00-759_43169b36946e2183.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/SbSV/~4/KMSdULxsLjg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn22@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-12-02-168_e426174a1276ceeb.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:11:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:11:59","title":"Update your Business Profile on Google Maps and Search","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/business-profile-maps-and-search/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>When it comes to your business’s online presence, putting your best foot forward matters.

Local Guides and other people who contribute to Google Maps are very helpful in offering information about how much they liked (or didn’t like) their trip, and many of them have the same topics on their mind that I do. Since you can sort reviews by date, it was easy to see the most relevant ones—i.e., those that have been filed since lockdown lifted—for current info on toilets (yes), parking (yes, but it’s expensive), and whether the playgrounds have reopened (yes, very recently).&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-small \">\n     <img alt=\"screenshot of photos from Weald Country Park.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screenshot_20200728-145528.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n     <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n      <div class=\"rich-text\">\n       <p><br /></p>\n      </div>\n     </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <h3>Browse the photos and Street View</h3>\n     <p>To really get a feel for a place, sometimes there’s no replacement for a photo.

And thanks to the hundreds of millions people who contribute information to Google Maps each year—like the best takeaway dish to order at a local restaurant or a photo of a nearby park’s new open hours—people can get local recommendations and up-to-date information about where to go and what to do. We’re now making it easier to uncover community-powered updates and recommendations in Google Maps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Last year we <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/discover-new-places-with-help-from-local-guides/\">announced</a> a Google Maps pilot feature that allowed people to follow select <a href=\"https://maps.google.com/localguides/\">Local Guides</a>, the everyday people who are passionate about sharing their experiences on Google Maps. It was exciting to see many of the Local Guides we invited in our initial pilot opt in and participate. Equally exciting was the interest we saw from many Google Maps users who began following top Local Guides to receive helpful recommendations about the places around them.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Today we’re expanding this feature and beginning to roll it out globally. If a Google Maps user has shared photos, reviews or lists publicly, you can now follow them and get their recommendations, advice and updates delivered to your Updates tab in Google Maps. So the next time you find someone sharing helpful photos of takeout menus, handy lists of your city's most spacious parks or inspiring photos of local shops and services, you can keep up-to-date on all of their recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \">\n    <img alt=\"Google Maps public profile\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Google_Maps_public_profile_UI.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>Topic filters add color and flavor to your Google Maps profile</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>There will also be new topic filters on Google Maps profiles, so you can see the topics and places people share about the most, like pizza, brunch, camping and parks. Whether they’re a coffee enthusiast documenting every last latte, or a hometown expert reviewing all things Perth or Phoenix, you can follow other Google Maps users with public profiles to get helpful recommendations about the places around you.</p>\n  <br />\n  <h3>Control your Google Maps experience and profile</h3>\n  <p>People want to be in control of their digital footprint. That’s why we’ve built in settings so you can easily manage and personalize your Google Maps profile. As always, everyone has the option to show (or not show) their reviews, photos and posts on their public Maps profile. To become followable in Google Maps, an eligible user can go to their profile and follow a simple process. And users who are followable on Google Maps can make their profile restricted. With a restricted profile, you approve new followers before they can see contributions on your profile.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Want to share your personality on your Google Maps profile?

We do two years of training, pass 11 exams, and we’re the only guides that can take you inside the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey.</p>\n     <p>Look Up London started originally as a <a href=\"https://lookup.london/blog/\">blog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/look_uplondon/\">social media channels</a>, where I shared quirkier bits of London history. The name is all about spotting the little details in the architecture around you, to tell the story of why something looks the way it does. For example, on Oxford Street, which is famous for its shopping, there's a building decorated with sculptures of beavers. They're a clue to the fact it used to be a hat factory—slightly gruesome, but a detail that is so often missed by passersby!</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>How has your business been impacted by COVID-19 and the government restrictions?</b></p>\n  <p>I’ve had to shut down, basically.

If I couldn’t go outside, I could offer people the next best thing, through a screen. I was already using Street View a lot for my work—it’s really good for my research. I love the feature where you can go back in time. It’s not possible for every location, but for a lot of central London, you can select a place in Google Maps for desktop, drag the Street View pegman into the picture and click on the clock in the top left corner to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvH3rtFMa9o\">explore imagery from the past</a>. You can see where buildings have been demolished and what used to be standing where.</p>So now, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 2 PM London time, I use Street View to give a virtual tour on Instagram Live. And for anyone who can’t make that time, I post the recordings \n     <a href=\"https://lookup.london/live/\">on my website</a>. They’re all free, and if people enjoy them, they can make a donation.\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>What’s been the response?</b></p>\n  <p>People have been so lovely. From the comments, I think it’s been very helpful for people in lockdown, who maybe are older and can’t get out of the house as often, or people who’ve had to leave London and are feeling homesick. Lots have messaged me to say it’s made them feel like they’ve been outside. They’ve really learned something new and taken their minds off the situation for twenty minutes or so.</p>\n  <p><b>Any advantages to using Street View compared to being there in person?</b></p>\n  <p>The great thing about Street View is that you can hop about—you can jump a mile down the road and people don’t have to get on a bus or actually walk, so you can cover a lot of ground.</p>\n  <p>And then there’s that feature to go back in time and see things how they appeared years ago, back to 2008. On a normal tour, you can show pictures and give people an idea, but if people are on Street View and feel like they’re standing in a space and seeing the changes right there, it’s a different experience.</p>\n  <p>One example, on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=252299472479782\">my Aldgate tour</a>, is a garden space that has been relandscaped.

Google Maps was particularly useful for creating Porsche’s route. She and her fellow riders rode from Sept. 25 to Oct. 14, starting in Maine and heading west across the Canadian border, then down through the Southwest to the Mexican border in Texas. They crossed the country, occasionally riding through snowstorms and dropping temperatures. “When you consider the seasons we were riding through, it was a definite challenge for organizers to find routes that weren’t closed down.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>While Google Maps could help the riders along their journey, it couldn’t do anything about inclement weather. “I quit about four times,” laughs Porsche. “Riding in the cold is not my favorite thing to do. But it was a positive experience all the way around; I don’t know that I would ride in the freezing cold again, but I would do a ride with those women again for sure. I always say the bonds are built on the ground: You’re going to love the folks you ride with to death or you won’t be so cool, and I’m happy to say I love those ladies to death.”</p>\n  <p>Porsche is vocal about the need for more representation for women in the motor sports community, and she says that things like social media visibility and technical tools like Google Hangouts have helped women who may have felt alone in their shared passion find each other. This idea is in part what inspired her to found <a href=\"http://blackgirlsride.com/\">Black Girls Ride</a>, a magazine and community originally launched as a place for women of color who ride, which has since grown to include all women. What inspired her to launch Black Girls Ride was the lack of representation she saw when she first started riding—especially in long-distance riding. Traditionally, women filled support roles during these cross-country expeditions, taking a literal backseat to men. In fact, Porsche’s first experience on a bike was sitting behind a man, on the back of her cousin’s bike. “I didn’t so much like the feeling of being a passenger...but I loved the feeling of riding.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Thanks to women like Porsche and the WRWR riders, the world of motor sports is changing. “Women have become fearless and bold enough to take long distance biking trips on their own. We’re witnessing the explosion of the all-female long distance ride, where women take it upon themselves to create rides that cater to them instead of being a subset of an all-male ride. It’s where we get to take our power back.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Talking about these rides and seeing women taking them via social media and internet communities are crucial, says Porsche, who also mentions using Google Hangouts to connect with riders across the country. “You’re able to see the growth of female riders; women taking these long distance trips and riding solo have always been there—there are women riding today who have been doing this since the 60s—but social media is now shining a light on them.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>That increased visibility is part of Porsche's work with Black Girls Ride. “I knew from riding in LA that there were more of us than the community would admit to. There was no representation in mainstream media, even for women who were riding professionally, there was very little to nothing,” Porsche says. Now \"women all over the world are connecting to the Black Girls Ride brand. We have readers in London, Nigeria, France, just about every country you can name. I’m motivated by these women.” Black Girls Ride has become more than a publication, hosting trainings, workshops and events. And while both men and women are included, it’s Porsche’s focus to make sure women riders are invited to the table and that they are given the same representation, advertising and sponsorship opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Most of all, she just wants women to feel welcome in this world. “It’s always been my goal to create safe spaces for women to ask questions and get the help they need without fear of ridicule,” she says. “And I’m glad I can be a part of creating that.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Learn more about the women behind WRWR and how they planned their relay at <a href=\"https://about.google/stories/wrwr-using-google-maps/?utm_source=g.co&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=womenriders\">goo.gle/womenriders</a>.</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":591,"bgimg":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/FldLWuBibuw/maxresdefault.jpg","linkMd5":"f2c1d80b692f4a767756d3b32324a6bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn58@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-12-01-520_91def1be1ac7d27f.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":720,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.youtube.com/vi/FldLWuBibuw/maxresdefault.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-11-59-644_0cfc9adc895588a0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/SbSV?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn10@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-12-00-698_4bbeb52263385580.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/SbSV?i=FgBEk4r81ig:L3qehxLLb1g:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn77@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-12-03-504_68fb97239fdb9269.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/SbSV/~4/FgBEk4r81ig":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn1@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-12-01-900_8fe6659121823d32.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:11:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:11:59","title":"6 ways you can support local businesses with Google Maps","link":"https://blog.google/products/maps/support-small-business-with-google-maps/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><i>Editor’s Note:&nbsp;Small businesses are crucial to our communities.

Since February, requests for cycling directions in Google Maps have jumped by 69 percent—hitting an all-time high last month. Whether people are hitting the road to get their heart pumping or commute safely during COVID-19, we’re making it easier for cyclists everywhere to get on their own bike or a shared one.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;Ten years ago, we <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/biking-directions-added-to-google-maps.html\">introduced</a> biking directions in Google Maps. Now it’s available in nearly 30 countries around the world and millions of people use it every day. As biking habits change, especially as things evolve with COVID-19, we’re constantly updating this information to help you uncover the most reliable bike route.</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <h3>Raise the (handle)bar on biking routes&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n  <p>To give you the most up-to-date bike route, we use a combination of machine learning, complex algorithms and our understanding of real-world conditions based on imagery and data from government authorities and community contributions. We also consider various forms of bike lanes and nearby streets that might be less friendly for your two wheels (like tunnels, stairs and poor surface conditions) so you can have the best and smoothest biking route. You can also see how flat or steep your route will be, so you’ll know if you’re in for an easy breezy ride or one that will really get the heart pumping.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>However, the best route can always change and we are hard at work to reflect new information. For instance, due to COVID-19, many cities are adding and widening bike lanes to encourage cycling and accommodate more riders. We’re already working to integrate hundreds of thousands of new bike lanes in the coming months. Local government agencies can provide this data through our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mapcontentpartners/answer/9359574?hl=en\">Geo Data Upload tool</a> to have their latest bike lane information reflected in Google Maps.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <h3>Gear up for new docked bikeshare directions in 10 cities</h3>\n  <p>As more people choose to cycle, they’re buying new bikes, fixing up old ones and turning to bike sharing options. In fact, worldwide search interest for “bike repair near me” hit an all-time high this month—more than double what it was last year.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>For riders opting to use bike sharing, we’re rolling out more detailed information. Over the last several years, we’ve <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/travel-last-mile-google-maps-and-lime/\">launched</a> a dockless bike and scooter integration with Lime in more than 100 cities and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/real-time-bikeshare-information-google-map/\">introduced</a> real-time docked bikeshare information to help travellers in select cities locate bike sharing stations and real-time availability. With bikeshare providers seeing sharp increases in usage during COVID-19, it’s even more important to quickly and easily check how many bikes are available at the station you’re headed toward and if there are docks available to drop off your bike near your destination.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Starting today, when you look up biking directions, you’ll see end-to-end directions that include docked bikeshare information. Steps will include detailed walking directions to bikeshare stations near your starting point along with live bike availability, turn-by-turn cycling directions to the bikeshare station closest to your destination with live dock availability, and, finally, walking directions from there to your final destination. And, for some cities, Maps will show you links to open the relevant bikeshare app to book and unlock the bike.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"docked-bike-full.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/docked-bike-full.gif\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>New docked bikeshare directions coming to 10 cities.</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Rolling out over the coming weeks, you’ll find docked bikeshare directions in these 10 cities, thanks to our partnership with <a href=\"https://www.itoworld.com/\">Ito World</a>and bikeshare partners around the world.

The technology to generate Plus Codes is also <a href=\"https://opensource.google/projects/open-location-code\">open source</a>, which means the technology is easy and free to use, so anyone can see how the technology works and develop their own applications for any use case.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"About Plus Codes\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/About_Plus_Codes.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>A helpful tool for emergency and crisis situations&nbsp;</h3>\n  <p>Plus Codes can be especially helpful for people and organizations in emergency and crisis response scenarios. If you’ve ever been in an emergency, you know that being able to share your location for help to easily find you is critical. Yet in many places in the world, organizations struggle with this challenge on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>With Plus Codes, not only can people share their location quickly even without an address, but they can now do so by simply opening up Google Maps and tapping on the blue dot to view, copy and share their Plus Code location. A Plus Code can then be entered into Google Maps to help locate and navigate to that location.</p>\n  <p>Digital locations through Plus Codes means that everywhere now has an easily identifiable location, saving time and getting resources there when it really matters. Not having an address should no longer be a barrier to easily sharing your location with service providers, guiding them to you when you most need them.</p>\n  <p>Download the latest version of the Google Maps Android app over the coming weeks to try out the new update.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 28 May 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":591,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Plus_Codes_blue_dot.gif","linkMd5":"f52282044de5d95f3ab75325eb545299","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn30@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-12-07-756_e6173fe37689862b.webp","destWidth":540,"destHeight":540,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Plus_Codes_blue_dot.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-12-08-226_e6173fe37689862b.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/About_Plus_Codes.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn98@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-12-08-916_3121961b74ba28f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/SbSV?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn10@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-12-00-698_4bbeb52263385580.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/SbSV?i=lzdwUdkFtdo:rrmPoU-TEWI:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn13@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-12-02-099_4b20342a61be85fb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/SbSV/~4/lzdwUdkFtdo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-11-59-483_256665e560f87788.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:11:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:11:59","title":"Take a virtual travel day with Street View","link":"https://blog.google/products/maps/virtual-travel-day-with-street-view/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>As a program manager for Street View, I’ve had the opportunity to work in more than 20 countries around the world, collecting <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-101-how-imagery-powers-our-map/\">imagery</a> that transports people to new places and powers Google Maps.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>You can even find my blurred face from time to time in Street View.

Health consultations over the phone or by video conference not only help alleviate strain on doctors’ offices and emergency rooms but are also recommended as an important way to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/preparedness-resources.html\">protect patients and staff</a> against COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>To help individuals and health care providers connect, we’re focused on providing individuals with access to high-quality and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/connecting-people-covid-19-information-and-resources/\">authoritative information</a> and supporting them throughout their health journey. Over the coming week, we’re beginning to roll out two new features in Search and Maps that make it easier for people to connect to virtual healthcare options, whether it’s to a doctor’s office down the street, the hospital across town, or a national telehealth platform.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Local healthcare providers, now virtual</h3>\n  <p>Healthcare providers like hospitals, doctors, and mental health professionals can now enter a virtual care offering in their Business Profile, so that people searching for their local provider, for instance, might see a “get online care” link on Search and Maps. Clicking this link will take people to that provider’s virtual care website where they can find more information, and in many cases, schedule a virtual healthcare visit with a provider.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>The pandemic has affected many healthcare providers’ operating hours and walk-in visit policies. To help communicate changes that might affect someone’s visit, we’re automatically surfacing a link directly to health providers’ COVID-19 information page on Search and Maps, and we've assembled <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9781983\">best practices</a> on how healthcare providers can update their websites and provide <a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/?p=covid_posts\">COVID-19</a> information on <a href=\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/9798848?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=4539639\">Google My Business</a>.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"New health information about Hillview Hospital\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/hospital.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>With health providers limiting in-person visits due to COVID-19, we’re making it easier for people to discover virtual care options.</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Find virtual healthcare, anywhere, anytime</h3>\n  <p>Beginning as a pilot in the U.S., we’ll also begin showing widely-available virtual care platforms directly on Search so people can more easily access virtual visits.

Because of COVID-19, it’s increasingly important to know how crowded a train station might be at a particular time or whether the bus is running on a limited schedule. Having this information before and during your trip is critical for both essential workers who need to safely navigate to work and will become more important for everyone as countries around the world begin to reopen.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>In our latest release of Google Maps on Android and iOS, we’re introducing features to help you easily find important information if you need to venture out, whether it’s by car or public transportation.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Get alerts about important information&nbsp;</h3>\n  <p>When you look up public transit directions for a trip that is likely to be affected by COVID-19 restrictions, we’ll show relevant alerts from local transit agencies. These alerts can help you prepare accordingly if government mandates impact transit services or require you to wear a mask on public transportation. Transit alerts are rolling out in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, France, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Thailand, United Kingdom and the U.S. where we have information from local transit agencies, with more coming soon.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>We’re also introducing driving alerts to notify you about COVID-19 checkpoints and restrictions along your route, like when crossing national borders (starting first in Canada, Mexico and the U.S.). You’ll see an alert on the directions screen and after starting navigation if your route is impacted by these restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>When navigating to medical facilities or COVID-19 testing centers, we’ll display an alert reminding you to verify eligibility and facility guidelines to avoid being turned away or causing additional strain on the local healthcare system. Starting this week, alerts for medical facilities will be available in Indonesia, Israel, the Philippines, South Korea, and the U.S., and testing center alerts will be available in the U.S.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\">\n    <ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\">\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Blog_1.max-2000x2000.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Commute_Covid19.jpg</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>&nbsp;New transit alerts show you when your trip is likely to be affected by COVID-19 restrictions</p>\n        </div>\n       </figcaption>\n      </figure></li>\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Blog_2.max-2000x2000.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Traffic_Covid19.jpg</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>See if there are COVID-19 border restrictions along your route.</p>\n        </div>\n       </figcaption>\n      </figure></li>\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Blog_3.max-2000x2000.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Testing Center_Covid19.jpg</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>Heading to a medical facility or a COVID-19 testing center?

In Google Maps, we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvn02V2U8o\">use</a> aggregated, anonymized data showing how busy certain types of places are—helping identify when a local business tends to be the most crowded. We have heard from public health officials that this same type of aggregated, anonymized data could be helpful as they make critical decisions to combat COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Starting today we’re publishing an early release of our <a href=\"http://google.com/covid19/mobility\">COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports</a> to provide insights into what has changed in response to work from home, shelter in place, and other policies aimed at flattening the curve of this pandemic. These reports have been developed to be helpful while adhering to our stringent privacy protocols and <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\">policies</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>The reports use aggregated, anonymized data to chart movement trends over time by geography, across different high-level categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential. We’ll show trends over several weeks, with the most recent information representing 48-to-72 hours prior. While we display a percentage point increase or decrease in visits, we do not share the absolute number of visits. To protect people’s privacy, no personally identifiable information, like an individual’s location, contacts or movement, is made available at any point.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>We will release these reports globally, initially covering 131 countries and regions. Given the urgent need for this information, where possible we will also provide insights at the regional level. In the coming weeks, we will work to add additional countries and regions to ensure these reports remain helpful to public health officials across the globe looking to protect people from the spread of COVID-19.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Global_Blogpost_Search_Spain.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Global_Blogpost_Search_Spain.gif\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>Navigate and download a report for your region of interest</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>In addition to other resources public health officials might have, we hope these reports will help support decisions about how to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

Similarly, persistent visits to transportation hubs might indicate the need to add additional buses or trains in order to allow people who need to travel room to spread out for social distancing.
