He took up residence in a former Victorian fisherman&#8217;s hut between an old lighthouse and a nuclear power plant on the headland of Dungeness, a newly designated a conservation area. He named it Prospect Cottage, painted the front room a translucent Naples yellow, replaced the ramshackle door with blue velvet curtains, and set about making a garden around the gnarled century-old pear tree rising from the carpet of violets as the larks living in the shingles sang high above him in the grey-blue English sky. </p>\n<p>At low tide, he collected some handsome sea-rounded flints washed up after a storm, staked them upright in the garden &#8220;like dragon teeth,&#8221; and encircled each with twelve small beach pebbles. These rudimentary sundials became his flower beds, into which he planted a wondrous miniature wilderness of species not even half of which I, a growing gardener, have encountered &#8212; saxifrage, calendula, rue, camomile, shirley poppy, santolina, nasturtium, dianthus, purple iris, hare-bell, and his favorite: sea kale. (A gorgeous plant new to me, which I immediately researched, procured, and planted in my Brooklyn garden.) </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_69840\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/red-poppy-by-elizabeth-blackwell-from-a-curious-herbal-1737-benefits-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=680%2C986&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"986\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69840\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?w=1429&#38;ssl=1 1429w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=240%2C348&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=320%2C464&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=768%2C1114&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?resize=600%2C870&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/elizabethblackwell_curiousherbal_poppy.jpg?w=1360&#38;ssl=1 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Red poppy from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/01/29/elizabeth-blackwell-curious-herbal/\"><em>A Curious Herbal</em></a> by Elizabeth Blackwell, 1737.

The garden, which his Victorian ancestors saw as <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/02/07/the-moral-of-flowers-rebecca-hey/\">a source of moral lessons</a>, became his sanctuary of &#8220;extraordinary peacefulness&#8221; amid the deepest existential perturbations of death, his canvas for creation amid all the destruction. </p>\n<p>The record of this healing creative adventure became Jarman&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Nature-Derek-Jarman/dp/178487387X/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Modern Nature</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/modern-nature-the-journals-of-derek-jarman-1989-1990/oclc/1108243615&#038;referer=brief_results\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; part memoir and part memorial, a reckoning and a redemption, a homecoming to his first great love: gardening. What emerges from the short near-daily entires is a kind of hybrid between Tolstoy&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/07/21/leo-tolstoy-kindness-calendar-of-wisdom/\"><em>Calendar of Wisdom</em></a>, Rilke&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/10/joanna-macy-a-year-with-rilke-death-mortality/\"><em>Book of Hours</em></a>, and Thoreau&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/07/08/thoreau-journal-skunk-cabbage-optimism/\">philosophical nature journals</a>.</p>\n<p>On the last day of February, after planting lavender in a circle of stones he collected from the beach under the clear blue sky, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Apart from the nagging past &#8212; film, sex and London &#8212; I have never been happier than last week. I look up and see the deep azure sea outside my window in the February sun, and today I saw my first bumble bee. Plated lavender and clumps of red hot poker.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is a different garden of Eden he is building on these windblown shores, living with a deadly disease while his friends &#8212; his kind, our kind &#8212; are dying of it in a world too indifferent to human suffering, too bedeviled by millennia of religion-fomented homophobia. Gardening becomes not only his salvation, but his act of resistance:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Before I finish I intend to celebrate our corner of Paradise, the part of the garden the Lord forgot to mention.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_69911\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/honeysuckle-from-the-moral-of-flowers-1833-by-rebecca-hey_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_honeysuckle1.jpg?resize=680%2C893&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"893\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69911\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_honeysuckle1.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_honeysuckle1.jpg?resize=240%2C315&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_honeysuckle1.jpg?resize=320%2C420&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_honeysuckle1.jpg?resize=768%2C1008&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_honeysuckle1.jpg?resize=600%2C788&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Honeysuckle from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/02/07/the-moral-of-flowers-rebecca-hey/\"><em>The Moral of Flowers</em></a> by Rebecca Hey, 1833.

A time that does not cleave the day with rush hours, lunch breaks, the last bus home. As you walk in the garden you pass into this time &#8212; the moment of entering can never be remembered. Around you the landscape lies transfigured. Here is the Amen beyond the prayer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am reminded of the great Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky&#8217;s insight about film, Jarman&#8217;s primary creative medium &#8212; that its raw material and its gift to the viewer is time: <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/08/sculpting-in-time-tarkovsky/\">&#8220;time lost or spent or not yet had.&#8221;</a> I am reminded, too, of Seneca, writing two millennia earlier about <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/04/17/seneca-letter-1-time/\">mastering the existential math of time spent, saved, and wasted</a> &#8212; I have found few that better clarify the difference between the three than the quiet lessons of gardening. </p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/10/the-little-gardener-emily-hughes/\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/thelittlegardener_emilyhughes3.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Illustration by Emily Hughes from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/10/the-little-gardener-emily-hughes/\"><em>Little Gardener</em></a>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the garden, Jarman discovers &#8212; or rather befriends &#8212; the most disquieting byproduct of time: <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/16/boredom/\">boredom</a>. Half a century after his Nobel-winning compatriot Bertrand Russell <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/01/21/bertrand-russell-boredom-conquest-of-happiness/\">placed a capacity for boredom and &#8220;fruitful monotony&#8221; at the heart of human flourishing</a>, Jarman contemplates his new cottage life away from London&#8217;s familiar &#8220;traps of notoriety and expectation, of collaboration and commerce, of fame and fortune,&#8221; and writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have re-discovered my boredom here&#8230; where I can fight &#8220;what next&#8221; with nothing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His boredom, like all of our boredom, becomes a laboratory for presence &#8212; a nursery in which to grow the capacity for paying attention, a studio in which to master the vital art of noticing, out of which our contact with beauty and gladness arises &#8212; the wellspring of all that makes life livable. In an entry from the last day of March, Jarman shines the beam of his garden-honed attention directly at the poetics of reality: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Sun a pure white globe in a chalky sky, mist blowing across the Ness in milky veils, silent pussy willow woods the palest pastel yellow luminous in the silvery light.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_69914\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/hare-bell-and-grass-from-the-moral-of-flowers-1833-by-rebecca-hey_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_hare-bell1.jpg?resize=680%2C1025&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"1025\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69914\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_hare-bell1.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_hare-bell1.jpg?resize=240%2C362&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_hare-bell1.jpg?resize=320%2C482&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_hare-bell1.jpg?resize=768%2C1157&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moralofflowers_rebeccahey_hare-bell1.jpg?resize=600%2C904&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hare-bell from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/02/07/the-moral-of-flowers-rebecca-hey/\"><em>The Moral of Flowers</em></a> by Rebecca Hey, 1833.

In the summer of 1857, after the hardest winter of her life, she rounded up her savings for a transatlantic ticket, made the arduous journey from her native Nantucket Island to Manhattan, and boarded a steamer to Liverpool. Having narrowly avoided a collision with another ship during the ten-day crossing, it arrived in England on her thirty-ninth birthday. </p>\n<p>With a prized letter of introduction from Sir John Herschel &#8212; the era&#8217;s most esteemed astronomer, who had played a key role in <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/04/03/virginia-woolf-julia-margaret-cameron-photography/\">the birth of photography</a> a quarter century earlier and had applauded Mitchell&#8217;s comet discovery &#8212; she hastened to meet her greatest scientific hero: the polymathic Scottish mathematician Mary Somerville, for whom <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/10/20/mary-somerville/\">the word <em>scientist</em> had been coined</a> two decades earlier and whose amiable genius left Mitchell feeling that “no one can make the acquaintance of this remarkable woman without increased admiration for her.”</p>\n<p>From England, with the help of Nathaniel Hawthorne &#8212; who had taken the post as American consul after his <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/02/13/herman-melville-nathaniel-hawthorne-love-letters/\">ill-fated almost-romance with Herman Melville</a> &#8212; Mitchell set out to visit some of Europe&#8217;s intellectual luminaries, including her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/elizabeth-barrett-browning/\">favorite poet</a>, and to look through humanity&#8217;s finest telescopes. In Italy, she headed for the Observatory of Rome, mecca of the latest research on spectroscopy, but was jarred to learn that the observatory was closed to women. Somerville, by then revered as Europe&#8217;s most learned woman, had been denied entrance. Even Herschel had failed to arrange entry for his scientifically inclined daughter. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_66441\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/solar-system-quilt-by-ellen-harding-baker-1886_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ellenhardingbaker_solarsystemquilt1.jpg?resize=680%2C564&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"564\" class=\"size-full wp-image-66441\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ellenhardingbaker_solarsystemquilt1.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ellenhardingbaker_solarsystemquilt1.jpg?resize=240%2C199&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ellenhardingbaker_solarsystemquilt1.jpg?resize=320%2C266&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ellenhardingbaker_solarsystemquilt1.jpg?resize=768%2C637&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ellenhardingbaker_solarsystemquilt1.jpg?resize=600%2C498&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/12/06/ellen-harding-baker-solar-system-quilt/\">Solar System quilt</a> by Mitchell&#8217;s contemporary Ellen Harding Baker, made over the course of seven years to teach women astronomy when they were barred from higher education in science.

I remembered that the days of Galileo were days of two centuries since. I did not know that my heretic feet must not enter the sanctuary, &#8212; that my woman’s robe must not brush the seats of learning.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mitchell was eventually allowed to enter with special permission from the Pope, obtained after American diplomats pressed on her behalf. An hour and a half before sunset, she was led through the church into the observatory, where she marveled at the expensive instruments the papal government employed in studying the very motions for which they had tried Galileo two centuries earlier. She had hoped to see nebulae through the observatory’s powerful telescope, but she was informed that her permission did not extend past nightfall and was hastily sent away. A woman of uncommon clarity about <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/01/19/maria-mitchell-purpose/\">the art of knowing what to do with one&#8217;s life</a>, she must have resolved, as soon as the back door spat her out into the narrow alley behind Collegio Romano, that when she built her own observatory, it would welcome any and all who hungered to commune with the cosmos.</p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/01/what-miss-mitchell-saw/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/whatmissmitchellsaw8.jpg\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/01/what-miss-mitchell-saw/\"><em>What Miss Mitchell Saw</em></a> &#8212; a picture-book biography of Maria Mitchell</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Upon returning from Europe, Mitchell was greeted by an extraordinary gift &#8212; a five-inch refractor telescope, on a par with the instruments of the world’s greatest observatories, purchased through what may have been the world’s first crowdfunding campaign for science. </p>\n<p>Elizabeth Peabody &#8212; who had <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/07/05/elizabeth-peabody-figuring/\">coined the word <em>Transcendentalism</em></a>, revolutionized education, and introduced America to Eastern philosophy with her translations of Buddhist texts &#8212; had envisioned the project and spent years raising the $3,000 for the telescope through a subscription paper, rallying the women of New England to contribute: Kickstarter and Patreon rolled into one, a century and a half before either existed. Just as Mitchell was departing for her European journey, Emerson &#8212; the emperor of American intellectual life, whose unexpected praise had just <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/08/emerson-whitman-letter/\">lifted the struggling young Whitman out of despairing obscurity</a> &#8212; had lent his voice to the crowdfunding effort on the pages of his popular magazine:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Europe, Maria Mitchell would command the interest and receive the homage of the learned and polite, while in America so little prestige is attached to genius or learning that she is relatively unknown. This is a great fault in our social aspect, one which excites the animadversion of foreigners at once. “Where are your distinguished women &#8212; where your learned men?” they ask, as they are invited into our ostentatiously furnished houses to find a group of giggling girls and boys, or commonplace men and women, who do nothing but dance, or yawn about till supper is announced. We need a reform here, most especially if we would not see American society utterly contemptible.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_56152\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Figuring-Maria-Popova/dp/1524748137/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mariamitchell5.jpg?resize=558%2C917&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Maria Mitchell\" width=\"558\" height=\"917\" class=\"size-full wp-image-56152\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mariamitchell5.jpg?w=558&#38;ssl=1 558w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mariamitchell5.jpg?resize=240%2C394&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/mariamitchell5.jpg?resize=320%2C526&#38;ssl=1 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maria Mitchell</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While touring Europe’s iconic astronomical institutions, Mitchell had been dreaming up an observatory of her own. The crowdfunded telescope came as a wondrous surprise after a particularly difficult stretch for her, marked by the death of her great love, Ida, and her once-brilliant mother’s terrifying descent into dementia. The instrument became the first physical building block of her dream. Behind the school resembling a Greek temple where her father had once served as founding schoolmaster, she erected a simple eleven-foot dome that rotated on a mechanism made of cannonballs. A month before Darwin published <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, her observatory opened its doors and Mitchell began welcoming boys and girls. The crowdfunded telescope is still housed at the more recently built <a href=\"https://www.mariamitchell.org/vestal-street-observatory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">observatory</a> across the street from Mitchell&#8217;s humble childhood home in Nantucket. </p>\n<p>But beyond its material impact, crowdfunding bequeaths upon its beneficiary something even more powerful &#8212; a tangible token of solidarity and faith by a vast number of fellow humans, solidarity and faith that made all the difference to Mitchell as she endeavored to blaze a brand new path. Within a decade of the gift, she became the only woman on the faculty of the newly established Vassar College. She immersed her all-female students in an unexampled curriculum marrying mathematical physics with observational astronomy &#8212; something the all-male Harvard, which had dropped its mathematics requirement altogether in 1851, would later replicate. Mitchell&#8217;s students became not only the world&#8217;s first class of professional women astronomers but the first generation of Americans trained in what we now call astrophysics. Some of them went on to join the ranks of the famed <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/12/06/the-glass-universe-dava-sobel/\">&#8220;Harvard computers,&#8221;</a> who revolutionized our understanding of the universe long before they could vote. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_59515\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mitchell-Letters-Journals-Classic-Reprint/dp/1451018460/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=680%2C413&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"413\" class=\"size-full wp-image-59515\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?w=1145&#38;ssl=1 1145w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=240%2C146&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=320%2C194&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=768%2C466&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mariamitchell_telescope.jpg?resize=600%2C364&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Maria Mitchell, standing at telescope, with her students at Vassar</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Occasionally, Mitchell punctuated her astrophysically ambitious lectures with glimpses of her life-tested credo, which must have sculpted her students&#8217; spirits as much as her mathematical-astrophysical rigor sculpted their minds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am far from thinking that every woman should be an astronomer or a mathematician or an artist, but I do think that every woman should strive for perfection in everything she undertakes. </p>\n<p>If it be art, literature or science, let her work be incessant, continuous, life-long. If she be gifted above the average, by just so much is the demand upon her for higher labor, by just that amount is the pressure of duty increased&#8230; Think of the steady effort, the continuous labor of those whom the world calls “geniuses.” Believe me, the poet who is “born and not made” works hard for what you consider his birthright. Newton said his whole power lay in “patient thought,” and patient thought, patient labor, and firmness of purpose are almost omnipotent.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Complement with <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/tag/figuring/\">more excerpts from <em>Figuring</em></a>, exploring the little-known humanity beneath celebrated legacies that have shaped our lives, then revisit Mitchell on <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/09/10/maria-mitchell-friendship/\">how friendship transforms us</a> and consider <a href=\"https://pioneerworks.org/initiatives/observatory-at-pioneer-works/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lending a friendly hand</a> in the endeavor to honor her legacy by building New York&#8217;s first public observatory.</p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">For 15 years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month to keep <em>Brain Pickings</em> going.
