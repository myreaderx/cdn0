There will be a bunch of <em>Rick and Morty</em>-related items in the box, but perhaps the most satisfying is a replica of the butter robot from &#8220;Something Ricked This Way Comes,&#8221; a throwback to the ninth episode of the very first season.

Let the butter robot&#8217;s existential crisis remind you that no matter how bad life gets, at least your sole purpose isn&#8217;t serving butter. Maybe you can even put it out at Thanksgiving, let your family ask you what this butter dish is all about, show them an episode of <em>Rick and Morty</em>, and have your grandparents be disappointed in you.

Making its world premiere at Nightstream Festival, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honeydew</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is as auditorily savory as it is visually sadistic. A blend of horror sub-genres, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milburn</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proves that he has a talent (and an appetite) for serving audiences a disturbing new take at an exploration in the countryside gone wrong.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641441\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rylie (</span><b>Malin Barr</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) is a PhD student who is doing her thesis on a specific parasite that has invaded crops in a certain region. As a result, large amounts of cattle in the area died off and several people experienced physical ailments from ingesting the grain. While researching the countryside on a road trip with her boyfriend Sam (</span><b>Sawyer Spielberg</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), the two end up accidentally trespassing on a piece of property. Having to pack up and find another place to stay for the night, they encounter a small house in the woods owned by an old woman named Karen (</span><b>Barbara Kingsley</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). She attempts to help Rylie and Sam by calling a neighbor to fix their car, but he never shows. Karen cooks a late dinner for the couple and leads them down into her basement so they can stay the night in a room tucked far away from sunlight. Once they start getting ready for bed, hallucinations start to kick in and their evening quickly spins into an uncontrollable nightmare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several familiar elements at play in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honeydew</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The storyline is reminiscent of </span><b><i>Hansel &#38; Gretel</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><b><i>The Hills Have Eyes</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><b><i>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at various points. Rylie and Sam have a strained relationship from the beginning and get easily frustrated with one another. Their chemistry is subtly toxic and creates a tension on camera before they even enter Karen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s house. Once they meet the old woman, the film grows increasingly distressing but is disguised as hospitality through Karen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s kind demeanor. Aloof yet friendly, her avoidance on certain topics and insistence on them staying becomes awkward and demanding. With nowhere else to go, the couple complies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What sets </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honeydew</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> apart from the films and sub-genre it is reminiscent of is its incredible sound design. Composer </span><b>John Mehrmann</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> utilizes organic sounds in order to create a menacing atmosphere that is unlike any other. While many horror films use string instruments to induce terror or silence to induce madness and fear, Mehrmann utilizes an interesting combination of sounds that are almost like a symphony of foley. Sounds of a sharp object being slid across metal, popping or bubbling noises people would normally make with their mouth, and heavy rhythmic breaths all accumulate in various ways to create dread in a deceptively welcoming environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At times, the film</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s composition is harrowing and abrasive. For example, echoing and loud chanting occurs as if a demonic choir</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s singing is rising straight up from the depths of Hell. Other moments have a soundscape that is light-hearted and boppy, even during scenes that are particularly stress-inducing. The music complements the characters as they both tease the overall tone of the film. Just when viewers think they can let their guard down for a minute, the sound design and odd characters suggest otherwise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The unique audio is coupled with visual split screens that contribute to Sam and Riley</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s hallucinations and distorted sense of time and place. The use of multiple scenes being shown at once provides a collective horror that is heartbreaking and deeply uncomfortable. It asks the question: what is scarier and sadder, to be in a dangerous situation alone or with the one you love but there may not be anything you can do about it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kingsley</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is an engaging terror as Karen. While she is able to be sweet and inviting by humming Christmas songs over a warm stovetop, it is the reason </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she is cooking and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> she is so happy to have company that makes her kindness turn sinister. Karen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s religious devotion is an answer to everything that ails her and her community after the plight of their crop. Her religious dedication is delusional and foils Rylie</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s scientific and analytical mind. Barr</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does a fantastic job at subduing her emotions in order to appease Sam, who is eager to dismiss continuous red flags. Spielberg</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">successfully delivers an engaging and complex character as Sam. While he bickers with Rylie, Sam also has a distinctive relationship with food that is normally attributed to female characters on screen. There is an element of body image from a male perspective and health concerns which prohibit him from indulging in items like sugar, salt, and carbs. So, when Karen offers him to help himself to any leftovers, Sam sneaks away in the middle of the night and ends up eating with Karen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s eccentric and mute son. This plays into one of the film</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s themes of deprivation and indulgence which is interesting to view through a male character.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honeydew </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a nightmarish exploration of religious perversion and the dangers associated with what we consume both physically and mentally. Mehrmann</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s sound design and composition is a refreshingly rare addition to the horror genre and allows for the tone of the film to freely fluctuate under a veil of perpetual danger.

The series is described as a &#8220;modernization of the novel and movie that explores the lives of descendants from the original work.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641495\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/fried-green-tomatoes-series-reba-mcentire-norman-lear-nbc-1234803671/\">Variety</a> has the scoop on the <em>Fried Green Tomatoes</em> TV series that will star Reba McEntire. Here&#8217;s how they&#8217;re describing the show:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The hour-long drama project is described as a modernization of the novel and movie that explores the lives of descendants from the original work. When present-day Idgie Threadgoode (McEntire) returns to Whistle Stop after a decade away, she must wrestle with a changed town, estranged daughter, faltering cafe and life-changing secret.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The novel – which was titled <em>Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe</em> – followed two women: &#8220;Evelyn, who’s in the sad slump of middle age, and gray-headed Mrs. Threadgoode, who’s telling her life story. Her tale includes two more women—the irrepressibly daredevilish tomboy Idgie and her friend Ruth—who back in the thirties ran a little place in Whistle Stop, Alabama, offering good coffee, southern barbecue, and all kinds of love and laughter—even an occasional murder. And as the past unfolds, the present will never be quite the same again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The book was adapted into a 1991 film that starred Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Cicely Tyson. The film was a hit, and ended up nominated for two academy awards: Best Supporting Actress for Jessica Tandy, and Best Adapted Screenplay. However, the movie did take some liberties with the source material. In Flagg&#8217;s book, the characters of Idgie and Ruth have a romantic affair, but the movie skirts around that and keeps things a bit ambiguous. Here&#8217;s a <em>very</em> retro home video trailer for the film.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5hb5mc-dfI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>McEntire will executive produce along with Norman Lear, a legend in the TV business whose credits include <em>All in the Family</em>, <em>The Jeffersons</em>, <em>Sanford and Son</em>, <em>One Day at a Time</em>, and many more. The series will also be executive produced by Jennifer Cecil, who will also write. Cecil&#8217;s credits include <em>Hell on Wheels</em>, <em>One Tree Hill</em>, <em>Private Practice</em>, <em>Brothers and Sisters</em>, <em>Notorious</em>, and more. Other executive producers on the series include <strong>Brent Miller</strong> and the book&#8217;s author, Fannie Flagg.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/fried-green-tomatoes-tv-series/\">&#8216;Fried Green Tomatoes&#8217; TV Series From NBC and Norman Lear Will Star Reba McEntire</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ETZAEX67L1g:R8LHPxlZoIk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ETZAEX67L1g:R8LHPxlZoIk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ETZAEX67L1g:R8LHPxlZoIk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ETZAEX67L1g:R8LHPxlZoIk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ETZAEX67L1g:R8LHPxlZoIk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ETZAEX67L1g:R8LHPxlZoIk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ETZAEX67L1g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 23:00:04 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fried-green-tomatoes-tv-series-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"5742214a1339ae035ae0f692d0e91a4c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn22@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-44-49-165_4528f9216fa5b26d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":33793,"destBytes":20902,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/fried-green-tomatoes-tv-series-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn22@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-44-49-165_4528f9216fa5b26d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ETZAEX67L1g:R8LHPxlZoIk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn61@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-45-03-256_a9a33b30ea4ecc1f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ETZAEX67L1g:R8LHPxlZoIk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn92@2020_2/2020/10/16/16-45-04-391_c1c4fcf83028a765.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ETZAEX67L1g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn99@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-45-03-283_0ec79cce1c120e97.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673065},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"‘Doctor Strange 2’ Sends ‘Baby-Sitters Club’ Star Xochitl Gomez to the ‘Multiverse of Madness’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641641","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/doctor-strange-2-cast.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641650\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/doctor-strange-2-cast-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"doctor strange 2 cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/doctor-strange-2-cast-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/doctor-strange-2-cast-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/doctor-strange-2-cast-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/doctor-strange-2-cast.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Doctor Strange 2</em></strong> cast is growing.<strong> Xochitl Gomez</strong>, who recently appeared on Netflix&#8217;s <em>The Baby-Sitters Club</em>, has joined the <strong><em>Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness</em></strong><em> </em>cast. Who is she playing? We have no idea! Like the Multiverse of Madness itself, this is a story shrouded in mystery. But it&#8217;s just another sign that Marvel is soldiering on with their productions even as the pandemic leaves the future of movie theaters – and, by extension, big movies – up in the air.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641641\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline broke the news about Xochitl Gomez joining the <em>Doctor Strange 2</em> cast, adding &#8220;Plot details and what character Gomez will be playing are unknown at this time.&#8221; Which means I don&#8217;t have a whole lot to tell you here, folks! Here&#8217;s what we know: <strong>Benedict Cumberbatch</strong> is back as Doctor Steven Strange, a neurosurgeon turned Sorcerer Supreme. <strong>Sam Raimi</strong> is directing, which is kind of a big deal – it&#8217;s his first superhero movie since <em>Spider-Man 3</em>. And speaking of <em>Spider-Man</em>, Cumberbatch is <em>also</em> playing Strange in the <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em> sequel, with rumors swirling that he&#8217;ll be taking over the mentor role for Tom Holland&#8217;s Peter Parker. Cumberbatch will film his <em>Spider-Man</em> scenes first and then get to work on <em>Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness</em>. Per Deadline, <em>Doctor Strange</em> is hoping to start production in May 2021.</p>\n<p>Original <em>Doctor Strange</em> director Scott Derickson was set to helm the sequel but departed over creative differences. He&#8217;ll remain an executive producer on the project. <em>Doctor Strange</em> actors <strong>Benedict Wong</strong> and <strong>Chiwetel Ejiofor</strong> are both expected to return for the film, and <strong>Elizabeth Olsen</strong> will also appear as Scarlet Witch, with <em>Multiverse of Madness</em> expected to coincide with the Disney+ series <em>WandaVision</em>.</p>\n<p>The film&#8217;s title suggests that the MCU will finally open up the Multiverse, a series of alternate universes that have similar characters in different situations. The Multiverse was teased in <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>, but ended up all being a rouse concocted by the film&#8217;s villain, Mysterio. <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em>, which <em>isn&#8217;t</em> an MCU film, played around with a Multiverse angle as well.</p>\n<p>Having not watched a single second of Netflix&#8217;s <em>The Baby-Sitters Club</em>, I can&#8217;t tell you much about Xochitl Gomez. She&#8217;s 14-years-old, so I can&#8217;t even really speculate on which character she might be playing in the film. As of now, <em>Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness</em> is due to arrive in theaters on <strong>March 25, 2022</strong>, but these days, movie release dates are not set in stone.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/doctor-strange-2-cast/\">&#8216;Doctor Strange 2&#8217; Sends &#8216;Baby-Sitters Club&#8217; Star Xochitl Gomez to the &#8216;Multiverse of Madness&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Upeez403hFo:tu1XyIPVGjo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Upeez403hFo:tu1XyIPVGjo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Upeez403hFo:tu1XyIPVGjo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Upeez403hFo:tu1XyIPVGjo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Upeez403hFo:tu1XyIPVGjo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Upeez403hFo:tu1XyIPVGjo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Upeez403hFo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:35:17 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/doctor-strange-2-cast-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"4ab5d5f6a9119adbd562bc9eba399fd5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn70@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-44-33-397_24d882cca031304a.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":21444,"destBytes":11574,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/doctor-strange-2-cast-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn70@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-44-33-397_24d882cca031304a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Upeez403hFo:tu1XyIPVGjo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn97@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-45-03-950_8c1ca417938ec8d1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Upeez403hFo:tu1XyIPVGjo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn40@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-45-03-320_004fdfde310ce311.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Upeez403hFo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn63@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-207_d1ad44467a5724df.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673063},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"‘The Mandalorian’ Season 3 Will (Probably) Start Filming This Year","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641530","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641554\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"mandalorian season 3 filming\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-season-3-filming.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>The Mandalorian</em></strong> season 2 isn&#8217;t even out yet, but <strong>Jon Favreau</strong> isn&#8217;t wasting any time. The <strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong> TV series creator says that if all goes according to plan, <em>The Mandalorian</em> season 3 filming should commence before the end of 2020. Unlike many other shows, <em>The Mandalorian</em>&#8216;s StageCraft technology – a gigantic digital video screen that allows filmmakers to &#8220;capture a significant amount of complex visual effects shots in-camera using real-time game engine technology and LED screens to represent dynamic photo-real digital landscapes and sets with creative flexibility previously unimaginable&#8221; – keeps it a relatively small affair, production-wise. This will no doubt help the show avoid running into problems with potential COVID-19 scenarios.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641530\"></span></p>\n<p>While speaking with <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/star-wars-mandalorian-movie-pedro-pascal-jon-favreau-1234805417/\">Variety</a>, Jon Favreau, creator of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, revealed that season 3 of the hit Disney+ would probably start shooting before the end of this year. &#8220;We&#8217;re operating under the assumption that we’ll be able to go forward,&#8221; Favreau said, adding: &#8220;We&#8217;re in very small situations and oftentimes we have a lot of characters in masks. And we also have a lot of digital work that augments things. So we’re a show that’s probably well-equipped to be flexible based on the protocols that are emerging surrounding work restarting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While other movie and TV productions are having to find ways to work around the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,<em> The Mandalorian</em> employs ILM&#8217;s StageCraft technology, which puts it in a unique position. As ILM <a href=\"https://www.ilm.com/hatsrabbits/virtual-production-on-the-mandalorian/\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over 50 percent of <em>The Mandalorian</em> Season One was filmed using this ground-breaking new methodology, eliminating the need for location shoots entirely.

His work on Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s <em>Requiem for a Dream</em> remains one of the most haunting scores of this millennium, and his other credits – from <em>Moon</em> to <em>Stoker</em> to <em>The Fountain</em> and <em>Black Swan</em> – represent a depth and sophistication that&#8217;s rare in an era in which many scores are little more than background noise.</p>\n<p>Mansell previously collaborated with director Ben Wheatley on <em>High-Rise</em>, and now he&#8217;s re-teamed with the filmmaker for <em><strong>Rebecca</strong></em>, a new adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&#8217;s gothic romance novel. His score is one of the best parts of the entire film: it captures the unease of Lily James&#8217; main character and builds a moody, occasionally eerie foundation for the mysteries of the story. We spoke with Mansell about creating new music in the shadow of Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s Best Picture-winning 1940 adaptation, using &#8220;the devil&#8217;s instrument&#8221; as part of the score, how he infuses music with emotion, and more.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also happy to premiere a full track from Mansell&#8217;s <em>Rebecca</em> score, so immerse yourself in a spooky atmosphere while reading the interview by pressing play below.<span id=\"more-641411\"></span></p>\n<h2>&#8220;The Wings of Mercury&#8221;</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gfepy2fXV-0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Clint Mansell Interview</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Note: this conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>I read that you studied English literature in college. Had you read Daphne du Maurier’s book before you signed on to this project?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It wasn’t part of my curriculum back then, but I had read it some years ago. I can’t say that I totally re-read it this time, but I did [come close]. The shadow of Hitchcock’s version probably hangs heavier than the book really, just because I guess that’s how society – or at least my world – is these days. Literature, for a lot of people – myself included, and I do consider myself a reader – but in the modern world, it’s been supplanted really, by not just movies but by the pace of technology. So going back and re-investing in it definitely gives you a different sense of time and pace, particularly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Also, peripherals, if that’s the right word. In a book, you get to know a lot more things that don’t make it into the movie: background, atmosphere, feelings are discussed more. From a composer’s point of view, that’s really helpful. I felt the same way when I did <i>High-Rise</i> with Ben. So much of the composer’s work, for me anyway, isn’t just what’s on the screen. You’re trying to bring in a whole atmosphere, a whole universe, if you like. That may hide in the words of the pages a bit more than the film…from a composer’s point of view, there’s almost another world that you can dig under the surface that may or may not be helpful to you when you’re creating the music for the film.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Can you talk about your approach for crafting the score for this movie, in addition to re-investing in the book?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It felt like a very different film for both Ben and I, really. We discussed those realities: biggish studio films with lots of people having opinions and involvement, and what an aim of a movie like this is. I’ve composed work on a lot of stuff at the same time half the time, but I didn’t feel like I could do that: I just focused entirely on <i>Rebecca</i> whilst I was doing this and ended up being on it for over a year, part of that being because of being shut down by the pandemic. But that gave me a lot of time to research and to absorb the film.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I went back to something that I kind of stopped doing over the years. I did a 20 year <i>Requiem of a Dream</i> anniversary for the Toronto International Film Festival recently, and talking about that reminded me that I used to write on the script a lot, back in the early days of my formative years [as a composer]. It was something that I’d kind of moved away from over time, but I went back to that with <i>Rebecca</i>. I got the script pretty early, and he asked me to do the film before we shot it, so I had a lot of time to think about it and invest in it, you know? It’s a period piece, but it’s gotta be a modern film because people are watching it now. So you sort of have a foot in the past and a foot in the future. We sort of played around with, how far can we go toward the classic, melodramatic approach to old-fashioned filmmaking? And where would the line be where we go, “Oh, that’s too much. That starts to suck.” So I got into a lot of stuff from the script and just jamming on ideas that we could just play with and think about: “More of this, less of that.” Time is always one of my favorite things to have on a film. A good film to work on is another big part, but having time to absorb and think and invest in what you’re doing is always wonderful news.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The other thing I did was, on the Criterion version of [Hitchcock’s] <i>Rebecca</i>, <strong>Franz Waxman</strong>’s score is an isolated track, so you can just listen to the score and watch the film. That was a fantastic education. Not in the “Oh, I should do what he did” way, but the way that it works. I had written something like 40 to 50 pieces of just rough ideas – a minute long, three minutes long, ten seconds long – I had all these different material I’d written from reading the script and the book and thinking about things. I thought, “OK, if I was scoring this in 1939, I’d probably be following some form of template that went on in movies at that time,” and Waxman nailed that incredibly in that film. You start off with the opening title sequence and you’ve got the fanfare for Selznick and stuff like that, and I’ve used up about twelve ideas in the first 45 seconds! There’s just so much going on, all these themes that you’d be revisiting later in the film, you’re setting up in the opening suites. Oh my God. I knew this, to some degree, but when you’re trying to mimic it with your material, to some degree, it’s like, “My God, this score is doing such a lot of work and we haven’t even got into the film yet!” It’s also incredibly seamless: it didn’t feel like you were being bombarded. It was seamless the way it would flow from one melodic idea to another.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I come from a rock-and-roll background, pretty punk rock, like, “Fuck you, this is the way I’m doing it.” But obviously that doesn’t work all the time. That’s a nice attitude to have, that your stuff is edgy, that you can break barriers. But that sort of falls down when you’re actually telling stories. You still have to adhere to the rules – you’re there to support the picture and the storytelling, so you are following orders, to some degree. Yes, you can move it around and try [other things], but essentially, you’re there to support what’s going on on screen. I really did enjoy that old-fashioned, classical storytelling with the music, which I’ve kind of always tried to do and I hope I do that, but literary works for the screen bring an extra challenge. I really enjoyed it. I loved the book and the original film, so for me, to be able to write for Danvers, particularly, and the void that is Rebecca, was brilliant.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>There’s a sadness, almost a melancholy that permeates songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5a1V6A7mPg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Rebecca Always Rebecca.”</a> Can you talk about how you go about translating a specific emotion into a piece of music?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I think it’s partly to do with, inherently, one’s own personality. I don’t know that I’m a great actor in that respect. I think I can kind of channel things that speak to me, and I think that’s probably borne out by the work that I’ve done. It’s not like I suddenly pop up doing a comedy romp. There are certain things that I feel like I’m wired to do, and I probably look for those elements in the story. I’m not going to give any points of the story away, but we feel Rebecca obviously all the way through the film, and the second Mrs. de Winter’s view on her is – she’s being gaslit to some degree – but she doesn’t know the full story. So there’s the way she interprets what those feelings are that are around her, and of course one of those would be melancholy at what she perceives as Maxim’s loss and as Danvers’ loss, and even Manderley’s loss. The joyous spirit that she imagined was there in Rebecca’s time is now absent. So finding that was probably the thing I was looking forward to the most. It’s almost like a misdirection, but it’s also a truth to the second Mrs. de Winter at that time.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>I’ve heard about composers using unconventional items as instruments in some of their scores to help create sounds that are unique to that specific project. Was there anything like that for your work on <i>Rebecca</i>?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not specifically, but with the demos, I did a lot of things on an instrument called a erhu, it’s like a two-string violin. It has Eastern connotations, which obviously didn’t really fit into the palette and gave it a vaguely mystical vibe in the demos, which wasn’t really what I was wanting. What I was wanting was a haunting droning effect, and we achieved that in the end with electric cello. It really brought it to life. Demos are weird and wonderful things: they sort of say everything and give you an idea of almost nothing you’re going to get when you record the [final score]. Maybe it’s just my demo making, I don’t know. But talking about the old days, Franz Waxman probably would have played his ideas to Hitchcock on the piano, he would never have done mocked up versions of stuff. It would have been, “Oh, this will be Manderley, this is Danvers, this is Maxim, this will be the court scene,” and stuff like that.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’m very fortunate to record at Air Studios in London…a wonderful place to record. I’m an untrained musician. But I’ve never been anything but welcomed by trained musicians and professionals who bring my music to life, because they’re so excited by ideas and performance and playing. Those are the things you just can’t get in a demo…using things like the glass armonica, which is an amazing instrument that’s made by glass bowls and you play by wetting your fingers and pedaling and they revolve. They sound like wine glasses. But it’s an amazing instrument, and there are very few places in the world where you can go and get that sound.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>I’ve never heard of that instrument before. I’ll have to look that up.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Oh man, you’ve gotta check it out. It was invented by Benjamin Franklin, and it was called “the devil’s instrument” for the longest time, because you learned to play it, and within two years you’d be dead.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>What? (laughs incredulously)</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It happened all the time. When you look at it, you’ll realize why. These glass bowls ascend in size, and they’re on a spindle, and you can pedal that and revolve, as if you were running your finger around a wine glass, but the wine glass itself was moving. It’s set up symphonically a little bit like a piano, but the black keys nowadays have gold leaf on them so you know which ones are black keys. But back in the day when they first did it, they used lead paint. So basically you’d be mainlining lead when you played it, and it’d drive you crazy and you’d die.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Wow.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was the most amazing thing. Yeah, it’s an incredible instrument. If you email me, I’ve got a little clip of <b>Alasdair Malloy</b>, who played it on <i>High-Rise</i>, that I can send you that maybe you can put on the website.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVqkY2cIz_w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Were there any specific moments discussed beforehand where you knew a particular track would need to do a lot of heavy lifting, or do you have to create the entire score with the mentality that it all needs to sort of be able to keep the movie afloat during any moments without dialogue?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not really. Working with Ben, things sort of develop out of what we’ve got in front of us. With scenes like the dream sequences, they’re so sound-designed, too. I never felt like it was totally reliant on score, or that the score had to take the lead. It’s sort of a real choreographed event, where things worked in tandem. I love working with Ben, but his work evolves through what he’s presented with. Nothing is set in stone. It sort of naturally evolves to where it takes us, and I love that.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>What was the aspect of this score that you’re the most proud of?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">(laughs) Well, to be honest, it’s probably the same as every score: that we got it done. Obviously I’ve been doing this for twenty years or whatever it is now, but it still feels like every time you start with a blank page, you go, “Oh my God, what am I going to do? Why do I even start?” It really does seem like such a mountain to climb. Yes, you’ve got inspiration in front of you, the work of the book, the director, the actors, the atmosphere, the sound effects, the look, the cinematography – everything to feed off of and join in with something that will hopefully really work and excite people. But the first day on the job, it’s just like, “Oh my God, what if this is the one that doesn’t get done?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s a bit like, not that I have any children, but I can only compare it to having children – which may be doing a great disservice to all the women who have had babies and the men who have lived through the experience. I really don’t know. But for me, it is sort of like birthing something and you kind of go through a lot of turmoil, a lot of anxiety, a lot of joy, and in time, you remember nothing about it once it’s actually done because you’re sort of overwhelmed by the creation of it. So the real joy of actually having it be done and you’re listening to the final mixes, you see the final film and go, “There it is.” It’s like memories: you remember good things, mostly. Yes, you can sort of dip into the occasional bad memory, but you spend to not spend too much time with them. So the result is always the thing that I’m most proud of, that we actually did it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Well, this result was fantastic and everything came together really beautifully. I love the score. Thanks for taking the time.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Thank you very much, I appreciate that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>Rebecca</em> arrives on Netflix on <strong>October 21</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.

Watch the <em>Ammonite</em> trailer.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641488\"></span></p>\n<h2>Ammonite Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MpHa6Fi75ck?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Written and directed by Francis Lee, <em>Ammonite</em> is the stuff of awards contender dreams: an LGBT period drama romance headlined by an Oscar winner and Oscar nominee. And indeed, who wouldn&#8217;t want to see Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan romance each other in what appears to be a British spin on last year&#8217;s sublime <em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em>?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a concept that has won over many critics since <em>Ammonite</em> made its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, and wins over a fair few more as the movie makes its festival rounds. But it has earned several negative reviews, including one from /Film&#8217;s Jason Gorber at TIFF, who <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ammonite-review/\">wrote</a>, &#8220;Like the fossils encrusted in rock there’s a core aspect of this film that’s certainly worth digging out, it’s just not entirely excavated through its execution, still trapped in its austere and distanced style. Lee’s film lacks the precision of a <i>Barry Lyndon</i> or the exquisitely intense gaze of <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i>, making <i>Ammonite</i>’s deliberate pace and chilly characters feel little more than trinkets in a sea-side store – fine to look at, but little more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I still remain intrigued by <em>Ammonite</em> despite the divisive reviews, though it&#8217;s uncertain when I&#8217;ll get a chance to decide for myself, as the trailer only teases that the film is &#8220;coming soon.&#8221; No release date has yet been set for either theaters or VOD.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Ammonite</em>, which also stars <strong>Fiona Shaw</strong>, <strong>Gemma Jones</strong>, <strong>Alec Secareanu</strong>, and <strong>James McArdle</strong>.:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the 1840s, acclaimed self-taught palaeontologist Mary Anning works alone on the wild and brutal Southern English coastline of Lyme Regis. The days of her famed discoveries behind her, she now hunts for common fossils to sell to rich tourists to support herself and her ailing widowed mother. When one such tourist, Roderick Murchison, arrives in Lyme on the first leg of a European tour, he entrusts Mary with the care of his young wife Charlotte, who is recuperating from a personal tragedy. Mary, whose life is a daily struggle on the poverty line, cannot afford to turn him down but, proud and relentlessly passionate about her work, she clashes with her unwanted guest. They are two women from utterly different worlds. Yet despite the chasm between their social spheres and personalities, Mary and Charlotte discover they can each offer what the other has been searching for: the realisation that they are not alone. It is the beginning of a passionate and all-consuming love affair that will defy all social bounds and alter the course of both lives irrevocably.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ammonite-trailer-official/\">&#8216;Ammonite&#8217;

Nyong&#8217;o was set to star while Gurira was set to write and serve as showrunner. Along with Nyong&#8217;o, the series was set to star Uzo Aduba, Corey Hawkins, Zackary Momoh, and Tireni Oyenusi.</p>\n<p>Here was the logline for <em>Americanah</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It tells the story of Ifemelu (Nyong’o), a young, beautiful, self-assured woman raised in Nigeria, who as a teenager falls in love with her classmate Obinze (Momoh). Living in a military-ruled country, they each depart for the west, with Ifemelu heading for America, where, despite her academic success, she is forced to grapple for the first time with what it means to be black. Quiet, thoughtful Obinze had hoped to join her, but with post-9/11 America closed to him, he instead plunges into a dangerous undocumented life in London.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Americanah </em>was a longtime passion project for Nyong&#8217;o, who had previously planned to adapt Adichie&#8217;s novel into a film in which she would star alongside David Oyelowo. The project turned into a series in 2018, and was picked up by HBO Max last year. Things were going swimmingly for the project, with shooting planned to begin in early 2020, until the coronavirus pandemic hit. Production dates were pushed back until it was untenable for Nyong&#8217;o to stay on board due to conflicts with other projects on her schedule.</p>\n<p><em>Americanah</em> is just the latest casualty of the pandemic. Netflix has canned shows like <em>The Society, I Am Not Okay With This</em>, and <i>GLOW</i>. Showtime also canceled the acclaimed Kirsten Dunst-led <em>On Becoming a God in Central Florida</em> just before its second season. While shows — both beloved and less so — around the board have been getting the axe, curiously, <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/all-the-shows-unrenewed-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a majority</a> of the canceled series have been led by women or people of color. While <em>Americanah</em> is a case of an unavailable star, its cancelation unfortunately does add to that pattern.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/americanah-tv-series-canceled/\">Lupita Nyong&#8217;o and Danai Gurira&#8217;s &#8216;Americanah&#8217; Series Not Moving Forward at HBO Max Due to COVID-19</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zzGjjJL8Vzk:gYnzYH2hWqU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zzGjjJL8Vzk:gYnzYH2hWqU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zzGjjJL8Vzk:gYnzYH2hWqU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zzGjjJL8Vzk:gYnzYH2hWqU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zzGjjJL8Vzk:gYnzYH2hWqU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zzGjjJL8Vzk:gYnzYH2hWqU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/zzGjjJL8Vzk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 22:30:26 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/danai-gurira-lupita-nyongo-e1602787309939-700x335.jpeg","linkMd5":"ac6bcaaeadccd070cd9d444dde786195","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn14@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-44-49-350_a1dbfa78b2da8c64.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":335,"sourceBytes":29280,"destBytes":16558,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/danai-gurira-lupita-nyongo-e1602787309939-700x335.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn14@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-44-49-350_a1dbfa78b2da8c64.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zzGjjJL8Vzk:gYnzYH2hWqU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn95@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-45-04-396_dde9f2c914e19251.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zzGjjJL8Vzk:gYnzYH2hWqU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn86@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-45-03-288_7551240d44f56aef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/zzGjjJL8Vzk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-255_2e6a3aa0359da5ce.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673064},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"‘Buck Rogers’ Movie in the Works at Legendary, Could Spawn Television and Anime Spin-Offs","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641469","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Buck-Rogers-movie.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641491\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Buck-Rogers-movie-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Buck Rogers movie\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Buck-Rogers-movie-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Buck-Rogers-movie-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Buck-Rogers-movie-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Buck-Rogers-movie.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hollywood is once again trying to bring space opera hero<strong> <em>Buck Rogers</em></strong> to the big screen. Legendary Pictures and producers <strong>Don Murphy</strong> and <strong>Susan Montford</strong> are developing a new <em>Buck Rogers</em> movie with hopes of launching a franchise – because these days you can&#8217;t adapt a character like this <em>without</em> promising it&#8217;ll spawn several sequels. The character originated in the pulp magazine <i>Amazing Stories </i>in 1928 and went on to appear in a comic strip, a radio program, a film serial, a television series, and more. In the stories, Buck Rogers is a man from the 20th century who is knocked out in an abandoned mine, only to wake up in the year 2429 A.D.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641469\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/buck-rogers-movie-in-the-works-at-legendary\">THR</a> is reporting that a new <em>Buck Rogers</em> movie is in the works over at Legendary. But Legendary doesn&#8217;t want to just stop at a film – oh, no. Instead, they&#8217;re hoping that the big screen take will launch &#8220;a prestige television series as well as an anime series, giving audiences a 360-look at heroics sets in the 25th century.&#8221; Legendary is taking a similar approach with their upcoming sci-fi epic <em>Dune</em>, which is set to spin-off into a TV series (and probably more), as well as sequels – provided it ends up making enough money at the box office.</p>\n<p>As a character, <em>Buck Rogers</em> has been around since 1928, and has appeared in all sorts of media, from comics, to radio dramas, to TV shows, and beyond. There was a 1979 film called <em>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</em>, which was actually a pilot for a new TV series. Rather than release the pilot on TV, Universal opted to release it in theaters before the series, also called <em>Buck Rogers in the 25th</em> <em>Century</em>, premiered.</p>\n<p>Over the years, several filmmakers have attempted to get a new <em>Buck Rogers</em> movie off the ground. At one point, comic book writer and artist, and sometimes director <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/frank-miller-to-direct-buck-rogers-2/\">Frank Miller</a> was hoping to make his own <em>Buck Rogers</em> flick. That never happened, probably because everyone watched Miller&#8217;s <em>The Spirit</em> movie and realized he should never, ever be allowed to make a film again.</p>\n<p>After Miller, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/paul-ws-anderson-directing-buck-rogers-3d/\">Paul WS Anderson</a>, of <em>Resident Evil</em> fame, was attached to direct a 3D <em>Buck Rogers</em> film. This was in 2010, a year after <em>Avatar</em>, when Hollywood suddenly thought every big budget movie <em>needed</em> to be in 3D.

But thanks to a new book written by Lucasfilm&#8217;s <strong>Pablo Hidalgo</strong>, we know Lucas&#8217; plans for the new trilogy share at least two major things in common with the versions that ultimately hit screens: Luke Skywalker died in Lucas&#8217;s treatment for <em>Episode 8</em>, and the idea for the character of Rey was there from the start (although she had a different name when Lucas was envisioning her). Read on to get the details.<span id=\"more-641248\"></span></p>\n<p>In Hidalgo&#8217;s new book <strong><em>Star Wars: Fascinating Facts: Story, Lore &#38; History From The Greatest Galaxy</em></strong>, the author reveals that &#8220;years before <em>The Last Jedi</em> began development, the treatment left behind by George Lucas in 2012 also had <em>Episode 8</em> be the one wherein Luke Skywalker would die.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That is fascinating for multiple reasons. Though Luke Skywalker died in Rian Johnson&#8217;s <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>, the iconic character&#8217;s death wasn&#8217;t the main sticking point for the vocal contingent of fans who didn&#8217;t like that film – many of them didn&#8217;t appreciate the fundamental type of character that Luke evolved into in that film. However, the book notes that Lucas&#8217; plans for Luke were very similar to what Johnson ultimately delivered. In his treatments, Luke has become &#8220;a recluse, withdrawn into a very dark space and needs to be drawn back from despair.&#8221; So while <em>The Last Jedi</em> remains controversial, it seems like Lucas and Johnson were very much on the same page.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s an interesting coincidence that if George Lucas had his way, he would have also killed Luke in that same movie instead of waiting until the final installment in the nine-movie Skywalker saga. It&#8217;s especially interesting because it presents a conflicting narrative to one that actor Mark Hamill has previously put forth in the press. Hamill has gone on record saying that Lucas&#8217;s original plan did not, in fact, feature Luke dying in <em>Episode 8</em>, but instead held his death until <em>Episode 9</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I happen to know that George didn&#8217;t kill Luke until the end of [<em>Episode</em>] <em>9</em>, after he trained Leia, which is another thread that was never played upon [in <em>The Last Jedi</em>],&#8221; Hamill <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/episode-9-ending/\">said in 2018</a>. So&#8230;who is correct here?</p>\n<p>Also, we previously knew that before landing on the character name of &#8220;Rey,&#8221; J.J. Abrams referred to Daisy Ridley&#8217;s character as &#8220;Kira,&#8221; a name which lasted through much of <em>The Force Awakens</em>&#8216; pre-production. But this book claims that &#8220;one idea that remained constant from the start was that of a young woman&#8217;s quest to become a Jedi Knight. In George Lucas&#8217;s original outline, she was a 14-year-old girl named Taryn. In his subsequent iterations, she would briefly be named Thea and – believe it or not – Winkie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Winkie, huh? If that sounds unbelievable&#8230;well, we thought so too. And that&#8217;s why we ordered a copy of this new book and independently confirmed all of this after this news started circulating around the internet earlier this week. Yep, it&#8217;s all in there and it&#8217;s real.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, all of this leaves us wondering just how much of Lucas&#8217;s original treatments made their way into the final versions of the sequel trilogy. We know that his plans <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-star-wars-sequel-trilogy-plans/\">included the Whills and the return of midi-chlorians</a>, but perhaps there wasn&#8217;t quite as much thrown out as we once assumed.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/luke-skywalker-died-in-george-lucas-star-wars-8/\">Luke Skywalker Died in George Lucas&#8217; Original Treatment For &#8216;Star Wars: Episode 8&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=QqRDdHCgOHo:JNaPnDIzFO0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=QqRDdHCgOHo:JNaPnDIzFO0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=QqRDdHCgOHo:JNaPnDIzFO0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=QqRDdHCgOHo:JNaPnDIzFO0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=QqRDdHCgOHo:JNaPnDIzFO0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=QqRDdHCgOHo:JNaPnDIzFO0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/QqRDdHCgOHo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 14:30:39 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-lastjedi-luke-lightsaber-finalbattle3-700x292.jpg","linkMd5":"f6ed83e8687ce89fb3bf07773201abd5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn25@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-44-47-520_9531070c6b8ef567.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":292,"sourceBytes":41056,"destBytes":14628,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/starwars-lastjedi-luke-lightsaber-finalbattle3-700x292.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn25@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-44-47-520_9531070c6b8ef567.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=QqRDdHCgOHo:JNaPnDIzFO0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-45-04-442_df2a9a96f90697fc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=QqRDdHCgOHo:JNaPnDIzFO0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn36@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-03-278_916d1d99256e56f2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/QqRDdHCgOHo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn9@2020_2/2020/10/16/16-45-03-180_7cb1d743f2cca181.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673064},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"The Quarantine Stream: ‘Penny Dreadful’ is the Beautiful, Lurid Gothic Horror Show of Your Dreams","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641578","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/penny-dreadful-the-quarantine-stream.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641579\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/penny-dreadful-the-quarantine-stream-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"penny dreadful the quarantine stream\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/penny-dreadful-the-quarantine-stream-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/penny-dreadful-the-quarantine-stream-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/penny-dreadful-the-quarantine-stream-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/penny-dreadful-the-quarantine-stream.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/the-quarantine-stream\"><strong>The Quarantine Stream</strong></a>, a new series where the /Film team shares what they’ve been watching while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Show: </strong><em>Penny Dreadful</em></p>\n<p><strong>Where You Can Stream It: </strong>Netflix</p>\n<p><strong>The Pitch: </strong>Gothic horrors from classic literature collide in Victorian England.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Essential Quarantine Viewing: </strong>Gory, sexy, and scary, <em>Penny Dreadful</em> is a show that deserved better. While the terrible <em>American Horror Story</em> gets to stretch on into infinity, this better-made, better-written, better-acted series was mostly ignored by a wider audience and only lasted three seasons (although it did get a recent reboot, which I haven&#8217;t seen). But those craving all sorts of gothic goodness – tales of vampires, werewolves, immortals, and more – will find plenty to love here. It&#8217;s the ultimate Halloween season show.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641578\"></span></p>\n<p>Pulling from <em>Frankenstein</em>, <em>Dracula</em>, <em>Dr. Jekyll and</em><em> Mr. Hyde</em>, <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, and more, <em>Penny Dreadful </em>is a loving tribute to gothic horror. Set in foggy, filthy Victorian England, the show follows a team of rag-tag loners and misfits who come together to fight evil forces. At the center of the show is <strong>Eva Green</strong> as Vanessa Ives, a heroine with a dark past. Green&#8217;s work on the show is phenomenal, and part of the reason I&#8217;ve never bothered to check out <em>Penny Dreadful: City of Angels</em> is that I can&#8217;t imagine watching any form of the series without her.</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s <strong>Reeve Carney</strong> as the immortal Dorian Gray;<strong> Timothy Dalton</strong> as noble hunter Malcolm Murray; <strong>Rory Kinnear</strong> as the Frankenstein Monster; <strong>Billie Piper</strong> as a kind of Bride of Frankenstein (she dies of consumption and then gets brought back to life); <strong>Harry Treadaway</strong> as Dr. Frankenstein; and<strong> Josh Hartnett</strong> as Ethan Chandler, the lone American in the group who <em>also</em> happens to be a werewolf.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;dark characters from classic Brit lit who team up&#8221; idea isn&#8217;t new – Alan Moore made it famous with his <em>League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</em> comic, after all. But what <em>Penny Dreadful</em> lacks in originality it makes up for in style. It&#8217;s a show full of crumbling castles, dark alleys, and haunted houses. Seances go terrible wrong; blood rains down on waltzers during a party; fog wafts through every street; and vampires, witches, and other creatures of the night lurk around every corner.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a romance that blooms between Vanessa and Ethan, and it&#8217;s sweet, and tender, and, of course, doomed. All of these characters are doomed. But that doesn&#8217;t make the series any less entertaining. Best of all, writer and creator John Logan and company play with expectations. Yes, the characters in this show are from stories that everyone knows by heart by now. But <em>Penny Dreadful</em> doesn&#8217;t stick to the source material. Things we expect to happen don&#8217;t, leading to big, wicked surprises.</p>\n<p>Logan was made aware that the series was going to be canceled, and as a result, <em>Penny Dreadful</em> doesn&#8217;t end on a cliffhanger. It wraps its story up in season 3, although the way it goes about wrapping things up left several fans very upset (I&#8217;m somewhere in the middle; I don&#8217;t <em>love</em> the ending, but I think it <em>mostly</em> works, too).</p>\n<p>If you crave things that go bump in the night, and you <em>also</em> want most of those things that go bump in the night to be kind of sexy, you can&#8217;t go wrong with <em>Penny Dreadful</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/penny-dreadful-the-quarantine-stream/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8216;Penny Dreadful&#8217; is the Beautiful, Lurid Gothic Horror Show of Your Dreams</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EerA9ofGgxY:RmraVELINhM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EerA9ofGgxY:RmraVELINhM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EerA9ofGgxY:RmraVELINhM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EerA9ofGgxY:RmraVELINhM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=EerA9ofGgxY:RmraVELINhM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EerA9ofGgxY:RmraVELINhM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/EerA9ofGgxY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 14:00:29 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/penny-dreadful-the-quarantine-stream-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"be29771c7ff8e58f1cf2c75a23b0d031","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn23@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-44-36-973_e8b5cd9118a56390.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":44532,"destBytes":29706,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/penny-dreadful-the-quarantine-stream-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn23@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-44-36-973_e8b5cd9118a56390.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EerA9ofGgxY:RmraVELINhM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn2@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-03-316_bc83b07ca3e38e89.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=EerA9ofGgxY:RmraVELINhM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn36@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-45-03-315_f1b8b855de68ad6d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/EerA9ofGgxY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn10@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-45-03-276_e290d2135d5e1285.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673064},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Series ‘House of the Dragon’ Moves Away From Northern Ireland, Will Film in England Instead","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641545","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-428745 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/game-of-thrones-dragonstone-review-6-700x330.jpg\" alt=\"house of the dragon filming locations\" width=\"700\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/game-of-thrones-dragonstone-review-6.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/game-of-thrones-dragonstone-review-6-360x170.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the end of an era.</p>\n<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> used the city of Belfast in Northern Ireland as its home base for all eight seasons of its run on HBO, and the expectation was that any prequel or spin-off shows would continue to shoot there. (Another prequel did film there, but that show wasn&#8217;t picked up.) But now Westeros will be created in another country altogether: according to a new report, the upcoming prequel series <em><strong>House of the Dragon</strong></em> will shift its home base away from Northern Ireland over to England, just northwest of London.<span id=\"more-641545\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> fan site <a href=\"https://winteriscoming.net/2020/10/14/house-of-the-dragon-production-headquarters-game-of-thrones-prequel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Winter is Coming</a> relays the news that the <em>House of the Dragon</em> filming locations will primarily be in Leavesden Studios in Watford, England. The facility has hosted productions like <em>GoldenEye</em>, <em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em>, every <em>Harry Potter</em> film, <em>The Dark Knight</em>, <em>Inception</em>, <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, <em>Paddington</em>, <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em>, and <em>F9</em>, just to name a few. It&#8217;s currently home to Matt Reeves&#8217; <em>The Batman</em>. I <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/spider-man-far-from-home-set-visit/\">visited the studio</a> while <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em> was shooting there, and it is absolutely massive: the huge water tank, several sound stages, and its gigantic backlot area barely scratch the surface of everything it has to offer.</p>\n<p>The studio is owned by Warner Bros., which is in the same corporate family as HBO, so the thinking may have been to keep <em>House of the Dragon</em> under a familiar roof. (It also could be a way for execs to keep a closer eye on this production and a tighter hand on the reins, with this base being just outside of London.)</p>\n<p>Of course, this is a massive blow to the people of Northern Ireland. When I <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/game-of-thrones-locations/\">visited the original Winterfell</a> a couple of years ago, it was clear that <em>Game of Thrones</em> was a major source of pride for the people there and the tourism from its global fanbase was pumping tons of money into its economy. (Whether or not the show&#8217;s divisive ending will stem the flow of visitors remains to be seen.)</p>\n<p>Rumor has it that <em>House of the Dragon</em> will ramp up in January 2021 and land on HBO sometime in <strong>2022</strong>. The show, which takes place <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/house-of-the-dragon-series/\">300 years before the events</a> of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, has already <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/game-of-thrones-prequel-cast-paddy-considine/\">cast</a> <strong>Paddy Considine</strong> to play King Viserys Targaryen. It&#8217;s set largely at Dragonstone, which was created in <em>Game of Thrones</em> using a combination of locations in Northern Ireland and Spain, so it&#8217;ll be interesting to compare and contrast once we get our first look at the new (well, chronologically older) version.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/house-of-the-dragon-filming-locations/\">&#8216;Game of Thrones&#8217; Prequel Series &#8216;House of the Dragon&#8217; Moves Away From Northern Ireland, Will Film in England Instead</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lowy1b5guI8:nbHV_S6D7ZU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lowy1b5guI8:nbHV_S6D7ZU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lowy1b5guI8:nbHV_S6D7ZU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lowy1b5guI8:nbHV_S6D7ZU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lowy1b5guI8:nbHV_S6D7ZU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lowy1b5guI8:nbHV_S6D7ZU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lowy1b5guI8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 20:30:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/game-of-thrones-dragonstone-review-6-700x330.jpg","linkMd5":"d566a5e8aee0bd1aebd2c2e8b2dc4812","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-44-33-470_6c51a62f83c14891.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":330,"sourceBytes":62779,"destBytes":41848,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/game-of-thrones-dragonstone-review-6-700x330.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-44-33-470_6c51a62f83c14891.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lowy1b5guI8:nbHV_S6D7ZU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-45-03-318_0f977deb82531cf2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lowy1b5guI8:nbHV_S6D7ZU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-45-03-347_2078cf489e4935be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lowy1b5guI8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn64@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-04-464_1cc9432bea2e2605.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673065},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"‘Bruce Springsteen’s Letter to You’ Trailer: The Boss and The E Street Band Record a Live Album","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641512","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-641532 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Bruce-Springsteens-Letter-to-You-Trailer-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Springsteen's Letter to You Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Bruce-Springsteens-Letter-to-You-Trailer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Bruce-Springsteens-Letter-to-You-Trailer-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Rock and roll icons <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong> and The E Street Band haven&#8217;t recorded an album together live since 1984&#8217;s <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em>, but more than 35 years later, they headed back in the studio to do it again – and a camera crew was present to capture the action.

He&#8217;s a prolific songwriter who has 19 albums (and tons of unreleased material) under his belt already, and in recent years, he&#8217;s become known for his lengthy concert performances. While many bands (in the pre-COVID era) would come out and play for 90 minutes and then pack it up, Springsteen would regularly blast past that, sometimes even playing shows that were four hours long.</p>\n<p>His newest album, <em>Letter to You</em>, is coming out later this month, and coinciding with that release is the premiere of this documentary, chronicling the mostly harmonious (but sometimes chaotic) making of the album. <strong>Thom Zimny</strong>, who has been making music videos for Springsteen and documenting the musician&#8217;s career for the past fifteen years (and has also taken detours into the lives of Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Johnny Cash), directed this documentary. His most recent directing credit was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/western-stars-trailer/\"><em>Western Stars</em></a>, the 2019 live concert performance doc about Springsteen.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good time to be a Springsteen fan right now, what with his recent Broadway show being captured as a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/springsteen-on-broadway-review/\">Netflix special</a>, his music inspiring the recent movie <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/blinded-by-the-light-trailer/\"><em>Blinded by the Light</em></a>, and now this.

There&#8217;s lots of talk of traversing worlds in this trailer, and aeronaut Lee Scoresby (<strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong>) is hot on the kids&#8217; trail, coming face to face with Andrew Scott&#8217;s new character along the way. (Don&#8217;t forget that Scott&#8217;s character has a daemon that will be voiced by his <em>Fleabag</em> co-star <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong>.) <strong>Ruth Wilson</strong>&#8216;s Mrs. Coulter is also on a quest to find Lyra, and her character&#8217;s arc seems like the most fascinating of the bunch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She does such horrific things that you really need to balance that with potential reasons why,&#8221; Wilson <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/his-dark-materials-season-2-trailer-comic-con-2020/\">said</a> of her character&#8217;s journey throughout the second season. &#8220;And we know by season 3, we see her as a completely different person. So you need to find the journey through the three seasons to see why she gets where she is by the end of the books. It&#8217;s much more about self-discovery, she&#8217;s on her own a lot in season 2. It’s more about her relationship with herself and her monkey.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here is the show&#8217;s official synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>His Dark Materials stars Dafne Keen, James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Adapting Philip Pullman’s award-winning trilogy of the same name, which is considered a modern masterpiece of imaginative fiction, the first season follows Lyra, a seemingly ordinary but brave young woman from another world. Her search for a kidnapped friend uncovers a sinister plot involving stolen children, and becomes a quest to understand a mysterious phenomenon called Dust. As she journeys through the worlds, including our own, Lyra meets Will, a determined and courageous boy. Together, they encounter extraordinary beings and dangerous secrets, with the fate of both the living?—?and the dead?—?in their hands.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>His Dark Materials</em> season 2 is set to premiere on HBO on <strong>November 16</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/his-dark-materials-season-2-trailer-new/\">&#8216;His Dark Materials&#8217; Season 2 Trailer Should Satiate Your Thirst for Big Budget Fantasy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=P39VN6oR7oA:74b7X5lm1mA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=P39VN6oR7oA:74b7X5lm1mA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=P39VN6oR7oA:74b7X5lm1mA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=P39VN6oR7oA:74b7X5lm1mA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=P39VN6oR7oA:74b7X5lm1mA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=P39VN6oR7oA:74b7X5lm1mA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/P39VN6oR7oA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 22:00:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/His-Dark-Materials-season-2-trailer-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"f659a6c30abfa1cd86da855c1f788eb5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn27@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-44-33-458_47bc945fa2ef2938.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":27134,"destBytes":16090,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/His-Dark-Materials-season-2-trailer-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn27@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-44-33-458_47bc945fa2ef2938.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=P39VN6oR7oA:74b7X5lm1mA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn15@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-03-261_98c91c2dfcd388cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=P39VN6oR7oA:74b7X5lm1mA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn78@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-03-811_ef5eea4d08c625cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/P39VN6oR7oA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn91@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-04-927_70ed7e7a9ea7a96f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673064},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"‘Days’ Review: A Slow, Wordless March Towards Loneliness [NYFF 2020]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=640906","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-640907\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/days-e1602443731825-700x317.jpg\" alt=\"days review\" width=\"700\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/days-e1602443731825-700x317.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/days-e1602443731825-360x163.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/days-e1602443731825-768x348.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/days-e1602443731825.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Misery may love company, but loneliness craves it. Yearns for it. Counts down the minutes waiting for company to arrive until life is but a hollow shell, an endless repetition of mindless tasks, wasting away waiting for something that may never come. And then when that company is finally there, doesn&#8217;t know what to do it with it but shyly dance around it.</p>\n<p>Taiwanese auteur <strong>Tsai Ming-liang</strong> has long delved into the feeling of alienation, isolation, and the miracles of human connection with his films, and <strong><em>Days</em></strong> is no exception. A mesmerizing exercise in the mundane, <em>Days</em> is almost completely free of dialogue — and intentionally unsubtitled for this reason — inducing a kind of calm hypnotic state that makes the viewer even more aware of the sharp stabs of loneliness felt by his longtime muse <strong>Lee Kang-sheng</strong>. Lee stars as Kang, a middle-class man wandering through the lonely urban landscape of Hong Kong, biding his time until he meets Non, a young Laotian immigrant working as a masseuse in Bangkok (<strong>Anong Houngheuangsy</strong>).</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-640906\"></span></p>\n<p>Kang floats through his beautiful empty house, staring at the goldfish pond in his backyard as the rain patters on his windows. He heads to Hong Kong to receive an acupuncture treatment, disconnected even from the mass of people surrounding him on the streets. Meanwhile, Non keeps busy in his shabby Bangkok apartment, praying to the altar in his home before going about his day, washing vegetables and cooking, surrounded by little in his apartment except for the constant dripping of water from exposed pipes. The film paints a stark difference in these two men&#8217;s lives, bonded by little except for an all-consuming sense of loneliness.</p>\n<p>The filmmaking is as sparse as the story, with Tsai setting up unmoving wide shots that stretch on for five, 10 minutes, with little change happening onscreen except for the shifting reflection on the window, the patter of the rain, or the changing orange lamplight. Non moves in and out of frame, always keeping busy, but Kang is as still as a statue, his expression never changing from one of morose detachment. Tai&#8217;s camera is both voyeuristic and immersive, placing us just outside Kang and Non&#8217;s lives, but within their headspaces — the suffocating sense of isolation in the empty spaces of the frames, the unchanging tedium of everyday life. There&#8217;s something to be said about how Tsai deconstructs the innate voyeurism of the camera and uses that window into these characters lives as an attempt to peer into their souls. Lee and Houngheuangsy&#8217;s stoic performances don&#8217;t lend much in the way of emotional insight, but Tsai&#8217;s deliberately lethargic filmmaking style engrains you in a sense of quietude that feels both calming and crushingly lonely.</p>\n<p><em>Days</em> climaxes in the meeting between Kang and Non, which moves as slowly as the rest of the film. Kang waits anxiously in a hotel room before Non arrives, folding the hotel bed comforter before perching on the corner with a cigarette. In the longest still shot of the film, Tsai&#8217;s camera watches dispassionately as Non gives Kang a full-body massage, the audience only seeing Kang&#8217;s face and back while Non&#8217;s is hidden from view. Non actually goes through the full effort of giving a professional massage before the two men become intimate in a scene that feels not at all at odds with the rest of the film&#8217;s languid non-action. But what hammers home the spark the two feel is the moment that comes after, when Kang gives Non a music box, the two of them sitting side by side to play its twinkling music. It is eroticism as emotional catharsis, an exceedingly intimate moment of human connection that feels all the more fleeting for how its effects linger on.</p>\n<p>Despite the closeness with which Tsai treated Kang and Non before, he pulls back when they spend time together outside of the hotel, sharing a meal at a streetside restaurant before parting ways. <em>Days</em> refuses us the satisfaction of voyeurism after we&#8217;ve already peeked into the depths of this achingly intimate moment they shared, and leaves us instead with only the detachment — Kang returning to his beautiful empty house, Non playing the music box at a loud street corner while waiting for a bus. The window has closed, and we&#8217;re left only with our own lonely realities.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 7 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/days-review/\">&#8216;Days&#8217; Review: A Slow, Wordless March Towards Loneliness [NYFF 2020]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HlhDWYTmq-M:BpkXfH2fZAQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HlhDWYTmq-M:BpkXfH2fZAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HlhDWYTmq-M:BpkXfH2fZAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HlhDWYTmq-M:BpkXfH2fZAQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HlhDWYTmq-M:BpkXfH2fZAQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HlhDWYTmq-M:BpkXfH2fZAQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HlhDWYTmq-M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 19:00:34 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/days-e1602443731825-700x317.jpg","linkMd5":"9b215915b1c2bb56a822ae7b43f6deab","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn19@2020_2/2020/10/16/16-44-33-492_b002e1747156351c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":317,"sourceBytes":27718,"destBytes":15662,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/days-e1602443731825-700x317.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn19@2020_2/2020/10/16/16-44-33-492_b002e1747156351c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HlhDWYTmq-M:BpkXfH2fZAQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn99@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-45-03-354_5f8d9cad3c297abc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HlhDWYTmq-M:BpkXfH2fZAQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn60@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-369_87a3ee706075e8f6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HlhDWYTmq-M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn70@2020_2/2020/10/16/16-45-03-186_39a6c42cdef1fbe1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673063},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"21st Century Spielberg Podcast: ‘Bridge of Spies’ and ‘The Post’ Personify the Spielbergian Hero’s Quest to Do the Right Thing","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=639936","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/21st-century-spielberg-bridge-of-spies-the-post.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641101\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/21st-century-spielberg-bridge-of-spies-the-post-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"21st century spielberg bridge of spies the post\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/21st-century-spielberg-bridge-of-spies-the-post-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/21st-century-spielberg-bridge-of-spies-the-post-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/21st-century-spielberg-bridge-of-spies-the-post-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/21st-century-spielberg-bridge-of-spies-the-post.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to </em><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tag/21st-century-spielberg/\"><strong>21st Century Spielberg</strong></a><em>, an ongoing column and podcast that examines the challenging, sometimes misunderstood 21st-century filmography of one of our greatest living filmmakers, <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>.

Someone who risks it all – life, limb, and reputation – for the greater good. And not some wispy, intangible greater good, either – oh, no. It&#8217;s not the belief in a better world; it&#8217;s the belief that the world we already have is as good as it&#8217;s going to get, if only we allow it. Spielbergian America is a place where the power is in the hands of the people, and all the people need do to make the country live up to its lofty goals is to fight for what&#8217;s right, no matter how daunting the fight may be. Two of <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>&#8216;s 21st-century films personify this perfectly, and, coincidentally enough, both star <strong>Tom Hanks</strong>: <strong><em>Bridge of Spies</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Post</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-639936\"></span></p>\n<h2><b>Part 6: Do the Right Thing – <i>Bridge of Spies</i> and <em>The Post</em> </b></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" title=\"Spotify Embed: Bridge of Spies &#38; The Post\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/4aFc8vRP9o0CnOuxyaEY9v\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spielberg-rockwell.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641004\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spielberg-rockwell-700x607.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spielberg-rockwell-700x607.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spielberg-rockwell-360x312.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spielberg-rockwell-768x666.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spielberg-rockwell.jpg 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Everyone Deserves a Defense</strong></h2>\n<p>The first thing <em>Bridge of Spies</em> does is drop us into the middle of some Cold War spycraft. But this isn&#8217;t your typical movie espionage. There are no shoot-outs; no tuxedoes; no martinis, neither shaken <em>nor</em> stirred. Instead, the spy work being done in the opening moments of <em>Bridge of Spies</em> consists of a slight, quiet man painting. He paints his portrait – the shot set up to recall Norman Rockwell&#8217;s painting &#8220;Triple Self-Portrait&#8221; with three distinct things to look at – the man doing the painting, the mirror he&#8217;s looking into, and the canvas he&#8217;s recreated his visage on. And he also heads off to the park to paint some landscapes.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s an unassuming, unthreatening man, played by <strong>Mark Rylance</strong>, an actor who had primarily stuck to stage work and some minor film roles until Steven Spielberg came along. The character&#8217;s name is Rudolf Abel – but we don&#8217;t know that yet. We don&#8217;t really know anything yet, because Spielberg stages this opening in near-silence. Sure, there are the sounds of the Brooklyn neighborhood Abel lives in. And there are the sounds of the footfalls of the men in suits who seem to be tailing Abel around. But there&#8217;s no music; no drama, really. We&#8217;re dropped into this world and forced to go along with it until we can figure out just what the heck is going on.</p>\n<p>Abel is a spy. He may not <em>look</em> like a spy – his clothes are shabby, the hotel room he&#8217;s staying in is a tiny mess, and his eyes are owl-like behind a pair of thick glasses. But right under the noses of all around him, Abel has been engaged in spycraft for the Russians. But now his time has run out – the FBI comes storming into Abel&#8217;s hotel room and hauls him away (although not before Abel is able to slyly destroy a secret document he had hidden in plain sight).</p>\n<p>Now in custody, the accused Soviet spy needs a lawyer – and he gets one in James B. Donovan (<strong>Tom Hanks</strong>), an insurance lawyer at a prestigious firm. The American government&#8217;s position is that Abel deserves a defense – but not <em>too good</em> a defense. Everyone commends Donovan for taking the job, but they&#8217;re also not very subtle in their wishes for him to lose the case. Sure, Abel deserves the <em>appearance</em> of a defense – but as far as everyone around Donovan is concerned, the man is a commie spy who deserves to be strapped into the electric chair. Donovan&#8217;s bosses; his wife Mary (an unfortunately underused <strong>Amy Ryan</strong>); the U.S. Government; even the judge in the case – they all make it pretty clear that there&#8217;s only so far Donovan should go to do his duty.</p>\n<p>But Donovan doesn&#8217;t agree. &#8220;Everyone deserves a defense,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Every person matters.&#8221; It&#8217;s a mantra he&#8217;ll repeat more than once. He&#8217;s that prototypical Spielbergian hero, and in the hands of Tom Hanks, he becomes a figure of unimpeachable integrity. Hanks is an actor who radiates nice guy vibes, so his casting here is pitch-perfect. As Spielberg put it:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;James Donovan was what you would call a stand-up kind of guy, someone who stands up for what he believes in, which, in his case, is justice for all, regardless of what side of the Iron Curtain you are on. He was only interested in the letter of the law. And Tom&#8217;s own morality and his own sense of equality and fairness, and the fact that he does such good things in the world by wisely using his celebrity, made him the perfect fit.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Best of all, Hanks doesn&#8217;t make Donovan a total square. Sure, he&#8217;s a lawyer who is standing up for what&#8217;s right based on his almost fervent belief in the rule of law. But he&#8217;s also a funny guy, with Hanks&#8217; natural comedic timing shining through. He and Abel click almost immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Have you represented many accused spies?&#8221; Abel asks during their first meeting, to which Donovan replies: &#8220;No. Not yet. This will be a first for the both of us.&#8221; It&#8217;s an ice-breaker moment that endears the men to each other. Donovan knows that Abel is a spy, but in his eyes, Abel is just a guy doing his job for his country – the same way that Donovan is. And he&#8217;s ready to fight like hell to defend the man. &#8220;I don’t work for the government,&#8221; he tells Abel. &#8220;I work for you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Donovan&#8217;s almost stubborn refusal to take the easy way out seems almost unbelievable these days. Can you think of a public figure here in the 21st century that would be so unflinchingly principled to do what&#8217;s right? I&#8217;m sure if you can the list is very, very small. But it also never seems phony in <em>Bridge of Spies</em>. We <em>want</em> to believe in upright men like James B. Donovan. We want to buy into Steven Spielberg&#8217;s firm belief in America.</p>\n<p>America is not an abstract idea to Spielberg. And while the filmmaker didn&#8217;t write the screenplay to <em>Bridge of Spies</em>, you can feel his own personal belief system radiating off the screen. It&#8217;s perfectly encapsulated in a scene in which Donovan has a conversation with a CIA agent. The agent would very much like Donovan to ignore attorney-client privilege and spill whatever secrets Abel may have revealed (little does he know that Abel hasn&#8217;t given away anything – and never will. He remains tight-lipped about his spying activities, even when given the opportunity to give them up in exchange for freedom).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go Boy Scout on me,&#8221; the CIA agent tells Donovan while pressing for answers. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a rule book here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But Donovan doesn&#8217;t agree. &#8220;What makes us both Americans?&#8221; he asks the agent. &#8220;Just one thing. One. Only one. The rule book. We call it the Constitution, and we agree to the rules, and that&#8217;s what makes us Americans. That&#8217;s all that makes us Americans. So don&#8217;t tell me there&#8217;s no rule book, and don&#8217;t nod at me like that you son of a bitch.&#8221;</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z6LDXOwA3XQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a perfect speech, delivered perfectly by Hanks, who remains calm through the delivery, even when dropping that &#8220;son of a bitch&#8221; at the end. It&#8217;s not corny; it&#8217;s not overdramatic. It&#8217;s what Donovan – and, by extension, Spielberg – believes. We are not American by blood. It doesn&#8217;t matter where we came from; what country our family immigrated from to get here. What makes us American is our unspoken agreement to follow that rule book, the Constitution. That&#8217;s all that matters. It has nothing to do with nationalism. It&#8217;s all about just playing fair.</p>\n<p>Despite a rather solid case – the FBI had no warrant to collect the items they did from Abel&#8217;s hotel room – Donovan loses and Abel is convicted. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief – Donovan can say he did his best, and everyone can move on. But the lawyer is far from done. First, he manages to convince the judge to give Abel a life sentence rather than send him to his death, reasoning that one day, the Russians might capture an American spy – in which case Abel could be used as a bargaining chip to get this metaphorical American spy back. Then, Donovan goes all the way to the Supreme Court to argue for an appeal.</p>\n<p>Usually big Supreme Court scenes are saved for the <em>end</em> of a movie, but with <em>Bridge of Spies</em>, things are just warming up. As a result, this is almost two movies in one, with the first half dedicated to Donovan&#8217;s defense of Abel in America, and the second half taking the lawyer far from home. Donovan fails to sway the Supreme Court, and finally seems ready to accept that his work is done. In truth, his job is just getting started.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-hanks-rylance.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641103\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-hanks-rylance-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-hanks-rylance-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-hanks-rylance-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-hanks-rylance-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-hanks-rylance.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>You Know What You Did</h2>\n<p>Jump to 1960, and Gary Powers, a pilot in the CIA&#8217;s top-secret U-2 spy plane program, has just gone and gotten himself shot down in the USSR. This is a big problem because getting captured is the <em>one</em> thing Powers was instructed not to do. As far as the CIA is concerned, Powers doesn&#8217;t exist. His mission, should he choose to accept it, is to commit suicide rather than fall into the hands of the Reds. But Powers is indeed captured, and paraded in front of cameras in a show trial meant to embarrass the United States. Which it does. Powers is convicted and locked up in Russian prison, but the Americans realize they have an ace up their sleeve to get him back – Rudolf Abel.</p>\n<p>After a series of back-channel messages, Donavan is drafted by the CIA to head to Berlin to negotiate the swap. But Berlin is a powder keg at the moment. The Berlin Wall is going up, and Donovan will soon find himself in the middle of dealing with both the Russians and the East Germans. Before Donovan&#8217;s arrival, American student Frederic Pryor ends up arrested in East Germany and sent to jail on suspicion of spying. Donovan learns about Pryor&#8217;s capture when he arrives in Germany, but as far as the CIA is concerned, Pryor doesn&#8217;t matter. Powers is the objective.</p>\n<p>But Donovan can&#8217;t let that go. He&#8217;s that Spielbergian hero, committed to not just doing his duty, but going above and beyond. He plans to arrange the release of both Powers <em>and </em>Pryor, but that&#8217;s easier said than done. The Russians and the East Germans keep bouncing him back and forth, resulting in confusion and miscommunication, almost all of it played for surreal laughs.</p>\n<p><em>Bridge of Spies</em> isn&#8217;t just a Steven Spielberg movie. It&#8217;s <em>also</em> a <strong>Coen Brothers</strong> movie. Sort of. <strong>Matt Charman</strong> wrote the initial draft of the script, and when Spielberg came aboard, he brought in Joel and Ethan Coen to polish things up. The Berlin section of the film is where the Coen&#8217;s style shines through, as nearly every character Donovan encounters seems plucked from a Coen-like farce (think a slightly-less-silly <em>Burn After Reading</em>).</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Joel and Ethan got us very, very deep into the characters,&#8221; Spielberg said. &#8220;They really instilled a sense of irony and a little bit of absurd humor, not absurd in the sense that movies can take license and be absurd, but that real life is absurd. They are great observers of real life, as we all know from their great august body of work, and were able to bring that to the story.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>While the first half of the movie is strong, the second half is when things really begin to sing, as Donovan treks around a snowy Berlin and comes down with a cold in the process. Donovan&#8217;s consistent sniffling and coughing adds an extra layer of amusement to the proceedings and helps to lighten what could&#8217;ve been a non-stop series of tension-filled scenes. Donovan is playing with fire here, putting his life, and the lives of Pryor <em>and</em> Powers in danger – and yet <em>Bridge of Spies</em> manages to find the humor in it all, be it in how Donovan keeps trying to sweet-talk his way to victory, or in how blatant the Russians and East Germans are in their lies and obfuscation.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Donovan achieves the impossible. He&#8217;s able to convince both sides to give up their prisoners in exchange for Abel, with everything culminating in a thrilling, tense conclusion set both at Glienicke Bridge, where Powers is to be swapped with Abel and at Checkpoint Charlie, where Pryor is to be set free. So much of <em>Bridge of Spies</em> consists of people simply having conversations, but Spielberg is able to turn those conversations into cinematic thrills. Spielberg&#8217;s camera tracks Hanks&#8217; Donovan anxiously waiting on the bridge while cutting over to Checkpoint Charlie, where a bored CIA agent waits for Pryor to show up. So much is riding on whether or not this will all go according to plan, and the tension builds.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s alleviated for a moment when Abel is brought to the bridge and he and Donovan reunite with a handshake that seems so warm against the winter cold. These men respect each other, and Donovan wants to make sure Abel survives all of this. In a sense, he cares more about Abel than does the American prisoners he&#8217;s arranged to have released.</p>\n<p>Eventually, it works out. Abel returns to the Russians, Powers and Pryor are released, and Donovan heads home. On the flight back, the CIA are cold and standoffish to Powers. He wasn&#8217;t supposed to be captured, after all. But Powers insists to Donovan that he kept his mouth shut and gave away nothing to the Russians. But Donovan replies: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what others think. You know what you did.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because not only is the Spielbergian hero committed to doing the right thing, he&#8217;s also selfless. Even after all is said and done, Donovan returns home and doesn&#8217;t bother to tell his wife what he did – she has to find out via the TV news while Donovan is passed out upstairs. He&#8217;s done his duty without bothering to brag, and he can feel pretty good about himself.</p>\n<p>Or can he? After a seemingly upbeat moment of triumph, all of it scored by <strong>Thomas Newman</strong>&#8216;s gorgeous music (regular Spielberg collaborator John Williams was dealing with medical issues at the time, and Newman stepped in), Spielberg throws in one moment of dark doubt. In Berlin, Donovan watched in horror from a passing train as kids tried to scramble over the Berlin Wall, only to be shot in the back. Now, riding the train in America, he looks out and sees a group of kids leaping over a backyard fence. It&#8217;s framed exactly the same way as the Berlin Wall moment, and we almost expect gunfire to rain down on these fence-jumpers. But of course, that doesn&#8217;t happen. They go about their merry way – but Donovan looks on. He looks on for a long time, long after the train has left those kids and that fence behind. He did the right thing, and he knows what he did. But he&#8217;ll never be able to get certain images from the experience out of his head.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-behind-the-scenes.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641104\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-behind-the-scenes-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-behind-the-scenes-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-behind-the-scenes-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-behind-the-scenes-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-behind-the-scenes.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Kinship</strong></h2>\n<p><em>Bridge of Spies</em> is Spielberg at the peak of his power. It speaks to the filmmaker&#8217;s talent that he was able to turn <em>Bridge of Spies</em> – a talky, adult-driven drama that has nothing to do with franchises – into a box office success. That&#8217;s not always a given with a Spielberg movie, but <em>Bridge of Spies</em> managed to pull it off because of its inherent quality.</p>\n<p>The filmmaker is clearly having <em>fun</em> here. There&#8217;s something thrilling about watching Spielberg set up moments like when Donovan tries to evade a CIA tail in the rain; or the back and forth dialogue between Donovan and nearly every character. Even the film&#8217;s one big action moment – Powers&#8217; plane crash – radiates with innovation, like when Spielberg has the camera point up through a hole in Powers&#8217; parachute to show the pilot&#8217;s spyplane disintegrating above.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can’t live on an alien planet my entire career,&#8221; Spielberg said in regards to the grounded, real-world story of <em>Bridge of Spies</em>. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to find things that are earthbound that make me glad to be on this planet, and experiences, when I&#8217;m making films, that have relevance and have kinship to actual events in history. That fills me up; that makes me actually happier in this stage of my life than even a success like <em>Jurassic World</em>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hanks&#8217; stellar performance is a key ingredient to making this all work, and it&#8217;s hard to imagine any other actor in the role. But it&#8217;s also important to single-out Mark Rylance&#8217;s award-winning turn as the calm, polite Abel. The antithesis of the generic enemy spy, Abel is simply a guy doing his job, and Rylance brings such an air of poise to the part that it&#8217;s immediately endearing. Like Donovan, we can&#8217;t help but like this guy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What Mark brings to the role is a completely-realized self-assuredness. Mark will not take a moment and throw it completely out and come in and completely redo it,&#8221; said Hanks of his co-star. &#8220;What Mark will do instead is construct the character in the scene that slow little motions of feint, either one way or the next, will bring a new jolt of energy to, but is still the same character he built.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tying all of this together is a world that feels lived-in. The late 1950s-early, 1960s atmosphere never feels staged. The costumes the characters wear feel lived in. There&#8217;s a Rockwell-like nostalgia, sure – but nothing here feels idealized. Frequent Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski plays around with a lighting style that will carry over into the similarly-themed <em>The Post</em>, where the interiors of rooms are dark and full of wafting smoke while bright, almost unearthly light blasts through windows. As bright as that light is, it also looks cold, which sells the wintry atmosphere most of the film is set in.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a practical reason for the way the light burns through those windows: the glass has all been frosted over. <em>Bridge of Spies</em> was another quick shoot for Spielberg, and as a result of the fast-paced production, there wasn&#8217;t enough time to deal with greenscreens and digital historic settings. The solution: frost the glass so we can never really see what&#8217;s going on through certain windows. Like all great magic tricks, it seems kind of cheap when you realize how it&#8217;s done. But in the context of the movie, it works exceedingly well.</p>\n<p>Kaminski also plays around with the lighting in the film&#8217;s locations – the United States, East Germany, and West Berlin are all lit in different ways. &#8220;When you think about the New York part, which is more golden, our perception of the period tends to be a little bit warmer, because it is in the past, so we tend to romanticize those images,&#8221; Kaminski said. &#8220;And also, the United States during that time was slightly more innocent, so the light and the color reflect that innocence to some degree. And then actually progressing through the film and going to West Berlin, [this] is still colorful, but not as colorful as New York. And subsequently, when you move to East Germany, there is a total void of color. It becomes not black and white, but desaturated and more bluish. And you achieve that by exposing the film a certain way, not putting color gels on the lights, but lighting with bluish and white light.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But best of all, <em>Bridge of Spies</em> succeeds because of how deftly it sells its message without ever seeming like a &#8220;message movie.&#8221; This is a film with deep faith in America, but it&#8217;s not your typical flag-waving patriotic clap-trap. Spielberg&#8217;s <em>Bridge of Spies</em> isn&#8217;t interested in those abstractions, or that pageantry. It&#8217;s instead interested in shining a light on a rare individual willing to go the distance to uphold that rule book he believes so dearly in. This is a much-needed civics lesson wrapped up in a bright, shiny Spielbergian package. A rejection of blind, stupid, thoughtless nationalism for the sake of nationalism, and instead rooted firmly in the belief that the country is only as good as its people are willing to be. As a nation, we can all be better – if only more people were willing to believe in that rule book as much as James B. Donovan.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-hanks-and-streep.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641107\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-hanks-and-streep-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the post hanks and streep\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-hanks-and-streep-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-hanks-and-streep-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-hanks-and-streep-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-hanks-and-streep.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>&#8220;I Might Be Crazy, But I Think I’m Going to Make Another Movie Right Now&#8221;</strong></h2>\n<p>Steven Spielberg makes movies <em>for</em> everyone, but he primarily makes movies <em>about</em> men (and boys). There are plenty of Spielberg female supporting characters, some of them quite great, but the overwhelming body of Spielberg&#8217;s work consists of male-driven stories. And then, in his early &#8217;70s, Spielberg went ahead and made the most feminist movie of his entire career: <em>The Post</em>.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of male figures swirling about the character-driven saga, most notably Tom Hanks&#8217; gruff newspaperman Ben Bradlee. But <em>The Post</em> is really a story about a woman, and how that woman – after years of being told to keep quiet and remain in her place – finally decided to speak up and wield the power she possessed.</p>\n<p>That woman is Katharine Graham, played by <strong>Meryl Streep</strong>. Graham was never supposed to be an influential figure. Her husband, Phil, had inherited the <em>Washington Post</em>. And then, like his father before him, Phil Graham died by suicide. Phil&#8217;s death resulted in Katharine becoming the paper&#8217;s owner, which made her the first female publisher of a major American newspaper in the 20th century.</p>\n<p>While the script for <em>The Post</em> would eventually be expanded to include many characters, it started out as the Kay Graham story. Liz Hannah had read Graham&#8217;s Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography <em>Personal History</em> and come away inspired. &#8220;I had never read a memoir where somebody was <i>so </i>willing to talk about their mistakes and talk about their relationships and really analyze them,&#8221; the screenwriter said.</p>\n<p>Hannah sent her script out to agents, never dreaming it would end up being a big movie with a big cast and a big director. In Hannah&#8217;s own words she thought the project would end up being &#8220;this tiny little movie that no one will ever see.&#8221; But of course, she was wrong. The script caught the eye of legendary producer Amy Pascal. Pascal would, in turn, send the script to Spielberg – who was doubtful, at least at first.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I got a call from Stacey Snider and Amy Pascal, who suggested I read a script from a brand-new writer who&#8217;d never sold anything in her life — Liz Hannah, 31 years old — who had written a story about Katharine Graham,&#8221; Spielberg said. &#8220;I was reluctant to read the script, but Stacey and Amy said, &#8216;I think you&#8217;ll change your mind&#8230;&#8217; And I did.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The aftermath of the election of 2016 ignited in Spielberg a passionate fire to get <em>The Post</em> made. &#8220;The level of urgency to make the movie was because of the current climate of this administration, bombarding the press and labeling the truth as fake if it suited them,&#8221; Spielberg said after the film was made. &#8220;I deeply resented the hashtag &#8216;alternative facts,&#8217; because I’m a believer in only one truth, which is the objective truth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The urgency resulted in a prototypical Spielbergian case of overachievement, with the filmmaker stepping away from post-production on his impending <em>Ready Player One</em> to shoot <em>The Post</em>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Liz&#8217;s writing, her premise, her critical study and especially her beautiful, personal portrait of Graham got me to say: &#8216;I might be crazy, but I think I’m going to make another movie right now,'&#8221; Spielberg later recounted.  &#8220;It snuck up on me.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><em>The Post</em> producer Kristie Macosko Krieger added: &#8220;We just turned everything around in a day. I called everybody and said&#8230;&#8217;we&#8217;re going to make a movie in New York in 11 weeks.'&#8221; After those weeks of pre-production (it ended up being 12, not 11), Spielberg completed shooting on <em>The Post</em> in two months (the entire process, from pre-production to release took only seven months). He had flexed his powers to put together a huge cast – mostly comprised of actors acclaimed for their TV work – and put at the head of that cast Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks.</p>\n<p><em>Spotlight</em> screenwriter <strong>Josh Singer</strong> also came aboard to expand Hannah&#8217;s script. &#8220;Liz’s script was about two human beings on an intimate journey, an incredible script,&#8221; Singer said. &#8220;What we then wanted to do was add in more history and a strong sense of the timeline to show how remarkable these few days were and bring the audience deeper into that world. We move beyond Kay and Ben to see what’s going on with the Nixon tapes and with The New York Times and it all helps create more context for Kay’s massive moment of decision-making.&#8221; The end result may not be Steven Spielberg&#8217;s <em>best</em> movie – but it is one of the most entertaining, and rewarding. It&#8217;s a breezy, fast-paced, star-studded masterclass on doing the right thing, and lobbying praise on the sanctity of the press.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-streep.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641279\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-streep-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-streep-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-streep-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-streep-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-streep.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Let&#8217;s Go</strong></h2>\n<p><em>The Post</em> tells the true story of the publishing of the &#8220;Pentagon Papers,&#8221; a set of classified documents regarding the 20-year involvement of the United States government in the Vietnam War, loaded with plenty of proof that America knew that there was no way to win the war, but was too proud to admit it or pull out of the conflict. The papers were leaked to the press by military analyst Daniel Ellsberg, played in the film by <strong>Matthew Rhys</strong>.</p>\n<p>Vietnam is mostly in the background of <em>The Post</em>, but Spielberg can&#8217;t resist dropping us into the war by showing Ellsberg in the midst of the conflict, complete with a groan-inducingly predictable Creedence Clearwater Revival cut blaring over the soundtrack. At some point, someone decided Creedence was the official music of the Vietnam War, and Spielberg was unfortunately not above falling into the trap.</p>\n<p>Ellsberg knows the war is going poorly, and he says as much to then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. But later, Ellsberg watches in horror as McNamara lies to the press about the war with a smile on his face. The story then jumps forward a few years – without really clarifying that, making it look as if this is all happening in the span of a few days. Now working as a civilian-military contractor/consultant for the RAND Corporation, a military thinktank, the still disillusioned Ellsberg decides to do something: he photocopies hundreds of pages of classified documents pertaining to the war. Documents that stretch back to the Truman administration. Documents that make it abundantly clear that the United States has known Vietnam was a lost cause for years, and yet continued to send troops off to their death rather than admit defeat.</p>\n<p>Spielberg stages these opening moments with all the urgency of a paranoia-tinged spy thriller, with Ellsberg on edge as he hustles about, photocopying documents. To better illustrate how far back the words in these documents go, and to make the scene all the more exciting, Spielberg juxtaposes footage of various presidents giving speeches about the conflict against scenes of Ellsberg photocopying pages while reading off dates and excerpts. Over it all, John Williams&#8217; score is like a ticking clock. It even recalls the music he created for the &#8220;stealing of the embryos&#8221; scene in <em>Jurassic Park</em>, and while <em>The Post</em> is far removed from that fantastical film, this theft scene has almost the same energy. In short, it&#8217;s thrilling. In the span of a few minutes, Steven Spielberg manages to make a man photocopying some pages look just as exciting as a car chase sequence.</p>\n<p>After the Ellsberg intro, <em>The Post</em> moves on to our main characters. We meet Katherine Graham (Meryl Streep), the owner of <em>The Washington Post</em>. She&#8217;s always the lone woman in a room full of men – a motif Spielberg returns to again and again, with Graham always sticking out among a sea of business suits. It&#8217;s 1971, and the <em>Post</em> is still considered a &#8220;small local paper.&#8221; That might soon change, though, as Graham plans to take the paper public, hoping the stock market launch will improve financial matters.</p>\n<p>Graham clashes with the <em>Post</em>&#8216;s editor, the gruffer-than-gruff Ben Bradlee, played by Tom Hanks. The first scene that the two share starts off playful, even friendly. But it becomes clear that Bradlee has a bad habit of talking over Graham. And at one point, when she makes a suggestion about publishing something, Bradlee snaps at her. It renders Graham momentarily silent, and the character&#8217;s silence is something Streep does wonderful work with.</p>\n<p>I know it&#8217;s almost cliched at this point to point out what a great actress Streep is, but she does some of the finest work of her career in <em>The Post</em>. The part allows Streep to constantly be just a tiny bit off-kilter – Katherine doubts herself. During a meeting with the <em>Post</em>&#8216;s board, when given the opportunity to talk using a series of notes she spent all night working on, Katherine clams up, preferring instead to let Chairman of the Board Fritz Beebe (the always-welcome Tracy Letts) speak for her. During the same meeting, when someone asks for a monetary figure, Graham has the answer, but she only whispers it to herself. No one hears her.</p>\n<p>The relationship between Bradlee and Graham is ultimately warm and caring, but it takes almost the whole film for Bradlee to really realize how much of a risk Graham is taking. But as the narrative kicks off, Bradlee is more worried about the <em>Post</em>&#8216;s reputation. He&#8217;s angry their stories aren&#8217;t big enough; aren&#8217;t groundbreaking enough. He&#8217;s worried no one takes them seriously. Hell, they can&#8217;t even get an invite to Richard Nixon&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s wedding at the White House.</p>\n<p>But everything is about to change. The <em>New York Times</em> starts publishing the Pentagon Papers. Soon, the <em>Post</em> gets some of the papers themselves. And then one of their staff, assistant editor Ben Bagdikian (<strong>Bob Odenkirk</strong>, who is phenomenal here, giving a memorable but understated performance) realizes he knows where the papers are coming from. He has a connection to Ellsberg, and manages to track the man down and retrieve even more of the stolen documents.</p>\n<p>However, things have gotten complicated. A federal district court injunction has stopped the <i>Times</i> from publishing more of the papers. Bradlee says that shouldn&#8217;t be a problem – the injunction was against the <em>Times</em>, not the <em>Post</em>. He wants to publish them. He <em>needs</em> to publish them. Not just for the sake of the <em>Post</em>, but also because it&#8217;s a First Amendment issue. The government has never before stepped in like this against a newspaper. &#8220;The only way to protect the right to publish is to publish,&#8221; Bradlee says. Hanks is having fun with this part. It&#8217;s not his most nuanced work, and his scratchy voice is a little distracting (as is his wig). But Hanks realizes that this isn&#8217;t his movie – it&#8217;s Streep&#8217;s. Bradlee is just a supporting player, and Hanks knows just how to dial things back so that he never takes over the picture. He also gets quiet moments to shine, such as when Bradlee reflects on how his close friendship with John F. Kennedy surely got in the way of how he covered the JFK administration.</p>\n<p>While Bradlee and his staff are raring to publish, everyone who is not on the writing side of the <em>Post</em> – the lawyers, the board members, the money men – thinks it&#8217;s a terrible idea, and they make sure their objections are heard by Katherine. But Katherine is clearly conflicted. She knows that Ben is right – that publishing is important. But like James B. Donovan in <em>Bridge of Spies</em>, almost everyone around her is telling her it&#8217;s wrong. Even Fritz, who is always ready to defend Katherine, tells her he probably wouldn&#8217;t publish.</p>\n<p>This all builds to one of Spielberg&#8217;s most enjoyable bits of filmmaking, coupled with tour de force work by Streep. Katherine is on the phone with Ben and the lawyers. Ben is yelling that they should publish. The lawyers are yelling that they shouldn&#8217;t. The camera starts off above and behind Katherine, slowly circling around to her face as she stands alone in a room in her house, clutching the phone. Katherine is being told that journalists will resign if they don&#8217;t publish. Ben adds that if they don&#8217;t publish: &#8220;We will lose. The country will lose. Nixon wins. Nixon wins this one, and the next one, and all the ones after that. Because we were scared. Because&#8221; – and here he repeats his mantra – &#8220;The only way to protect the right to publish is to publish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Spielberg starts pushing in on Katherine&#8217;s face. Streep widens her moist eyes; her breathing begins to increase; she cocks her head to the side and bites her lower lip. She looks ready to say <em>something</em>, <em>anything</em>. But the words aren&#8217;t coming – not just yet. Not till the camera gets to where it needs to be. First, it has to push in on Streep&#8217;s face as she struggles to find the right words. And then, when the camera hits its mark, and when Streep&#8217;s face is filling the frame, she blurts out: &#8220;Let&#8217;s go. Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; And she slams the phone down before she can have her mind changed.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s dynamite. It&#8217;s electric. On paper, the scene is simple – Katherine hesitates, then gives her answer. But in Spielberg and Streep&#8217;shands, it&#8217;s a scene that gets your heart pumping in your chest.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-gang.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641282\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-gang-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the post gang\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-gang-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-gang-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-gang-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-gang.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Brave</strong></h2>\n<p>The publication kicks off a firestorm from the Nixon White House. Spielberg makes the rather odd decision to make Nixon a sort of comical boogeyman – playing audio recordings of Nixon&#8217;s phone calls against shots of an actor playing Nixon pacing around the Oval Office. Spielberg never goes inside the Oval – we just hang out on the lawn, peeking in through the window.</p>\n<p>Remember what I said about <em>Bridge of Spies –</em> how big Supreme Court scenes are saved for the end of a movie? It wasn&#8217;t true in that film, but it is here. Graham and Bradlee go to the Supreme Court to argue their First Amendment constitutional rights, and – spoiler alert – they win. The court decision is read out by editorial writer Meg Greenfield, played by a criminally underused <strong>Carrie Coon</strong> who none the less gets what might be the most important speech in the film: &#8220;In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.&#8221;</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6SlFv5iZPs4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a big, triumphant moment. It&#8217;s Spielberg and company striking a blow for the First Amendment and reminding us that the Trump years weren&#8217;t the only time that Republican administrations attacked the press. And Spielberg, that eternal optimist, wants to remind us that this is a fight worth having. That the only way to protect the right to publish is to publish. &#8220;We’re telling the story of resiliency, honesty and dedication of the whole career of journalism,&#8221; Spielberg said. &#8220;Some would have us believe that there is no difference between beliefs and facts. We wanted to make a story where basically facts are the foundation of all truth and we wanted to tell the truth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For all of its wonderful, important, and timely moments, <em>The Post</em> trips over its own feet on more than one occasion. The Vietnam opening is unnecessary. The spooky shots of Nixon through the White House windows are distracting. And, worst of all, Spielberg tacks on an ending that feels like he&#8217;s trying to set up <em>The Post</em> Cinematic Universe. After all is said and done, Katherine and Bradlee share a warm moment together where they commend each other for doing the right thing. And then Katerine says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I could ever live through something like this again!&#8221; At which point – after a brief Nixon moment – Spielberg cuts to the Watergate break-in, complete with a guard saying, &#8220;I think we have a break-in at the Watergate Hotel!&#8221; It&#8217;s groan-worthy, as if Spielberg is winking at us as he sets up the events covered in <em>All the President&#8217;s Men – </em>a movie that doesn&#8217;t feature Katherine Graham, but does feature Ben Bradlee, played by Jason Robards.</p>\n<p>But these missteps are minor compared to all the wonderful work Spielberg does here. It&#8217;s the little things that matter: the way Bradlee and two writers run down to the newsstand to grab the <em>New York Times</em>, and pages of the paper blow out of their hands and flutter overhead like birds. The way Spielberg cuts to a shot of everyone in the <em>Post</em> newsroom with their nose in the <em>Times</em>. The way the printing press in the <em>Post</em>&#8216;s basement rattles the whole building when it&#8217;s turned on, as if it&#8217;s some ancient slumbering god shaking itself awake.</p>\n<p>And then there are those performances. While some actors are underused, they all get at least one moment to shine. The best example of this might be<strong> Sarah Paulson</strong>, who is stuck in the thankless task of playing Bradlee&#8217;s wife Tony. Paulson spends the majority of the movie just hanging in the background, and just when you think she&#8217;s about to be completely underserved by the movie, she ends up with a wonderful speech where she finally makes Ben realize just how brave Katherine is being by agreeing to publish the papers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Kay is in a position she never thought she&#8217;d be in, a position I&#8217;m sure plenty of people don&#8217;t think she should have. When you&#8217;re told time and time again that you&#8217;re not good enough, that your opinion doesn&#8217;t matter as much. When they don&#8217;t just look past you, when, to them, you&#8217;re not even there, when that&#8217;s been your reality for so long, it&#8217;s hard not to let yourself think it&#8217;s true. So to make this decision, to risk her fortune and the company that&#8217;s been her entire life, well, I think that&#8217;s brave.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DWlkO1zmqk0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Spielberg usually storyboards for his films, but the rushed production of <em>The Post</em> made that impossible. Instead, the filmmaker relied on his actors to help him create his shots. &#8220;Every single shot was discovered through the discovery of the actors&#8217; performances,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you get performances like this and a company of actors like that, the shots are coming at me fast — I’m having trouble keeping them in my head how I want to shoot the scene — but I came to work every day with an open mind without a shot list…The same way the actors never rehearsed, everything was done in the moment and very spontaneously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the look of the film. The blown-out window light from <em>Bridge of Spies</em> is back, but there&#8217;s an old school feel to the footage due to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski shooting on 35mm film. &#8220;I wanted with Janusz to make the film look like it was not a contemporary film but rather shot in the early 1970s,&#8221; Spielberg said. &#8220;It was all about color temperature and palette and coordinating Janusz’s lighting with Ann Roth&#8217;s brilliant costumes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Clocking in at 116 minutes, <em>The Post</em> whizzes by. There&#8217;s not an ounce of fat on this thing – it flies off the screen and never overstays its welcome. And, most remarkable of all, it has a woman as the Spielbergian hero. Spielberg was 71 when he made <em>The Post</em>, and yet even at that age, he was showing that he still had plenty of tricks up his sleeve. That he could still pump out a thrilling, challenging film better than any filmmaker half his age working at the time, and that he could try new things. But <em>Bridge of Spies</em> and <em>The Post</em> were both grounded, character-driven films set in the real world. And Spielberg wasn&#8217;t done yet. He still had two other films arriving in the 21st century, both of which returned him to effects-driven fantasy, for better or worse. Mostly worse. But that&#8217;s a story for next time.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/21st-century-spielberg-podcast-bridge-of-spies-and-the-post/\">21st Century Spielberg Podcast: &#8216;Bridge of Spies&#8217; and &#8216;The Post&#8217; Personify the Spielbergian Hero&#8217;s Quest to Do the Right Thing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zY36_CENyS8:IvJRZXo1OXk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zY36_CENyS8:IvJRZXo1OXk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zY36_CENyS8:IvJRZXo1OXk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zY36_CENyS8:IvJRZXo1OXk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zY36_CENyS8:IvJRZXo1OXk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zY36_CENyS8:IvJRZXo1OXk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/zY36_CENyS8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:00:33 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/21st-century-spielberg-bridge-of-spies-the-post-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"54917ca5656e3bc1bbc50e313a6b06ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-44-45-310_c6df28c7d2d304d8.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":30504,"destBytes":17040,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/21st-century-spielberg-bridge-of-spies-the-post-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-44-45-310_c6df28c7d2d304d8.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spielberg-rockwell-700x607.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn51@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-03-268_f3d42ca41fcab5a8.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-hanks-rylance-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-45-03-283_9d4ff906fc07469f.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bridge-of-spies-behind-the-scenes-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn83@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-03-305_6a930c9e2ff76c38.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-hanks-and-streep-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn96@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-45-05-210_d4fdf682cc73f931.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-streep-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn79@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-45-03-313_ee1296d6e7e61946.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-post-gang-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-660_9bf2e2f128d42e2b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zY36_CENyS8:IvJRZXo1OXk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn59@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-03-266_cbfccc62283ac9eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zY36_CENyS8:IvJRZXo1OXk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn71@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-04-366_0ccf45cd6ab0dcd9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/zY36_CENyS8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-45-04-287_fc1c835a5f324b3c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673065},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"‘The Last Starfighter’ Sequel is Still in the Works; Original Writer Provides a Status Update","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641504","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-641508 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Last-Starfighter-sequel-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Last Starfighter sequel\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Last-Starfighter-sequel.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Last-Starfighter-sequel-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>1984&#8217;s science fiction adventure film <em><strong>The Last Starfighter</strong></em> captured the imaginations of a generation, and screenwriters have been wanting to remake it or tell more stories in that universe for decades. Now, more than thirty-five years after the original premiered, a sequel is closer than ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Jonathan Betuel</strong>, who co-wrote the original film, recently gave a <em>The Last Starfighter</em> sequel update and explained that he is still working on a follow-up film with <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> writer <strong>Gary Whitta</strong>, and that finally, after years of trying to secure the rights, &#8220;it looks like we&#8217;ll be making the deal to get it going.&#8221;<span id=\"more-641504\"></span></p>\n<p><em>The Last Starfighter</em> centered on a teenaged boy living in a trailer park who used video games as a way to disappear from his humdrum life. When he becomes the highest scoring player on an arcade game called Starfighter, the boy is kidnapped by an alien and learns that the game is actually a training simulator for a real-life interplanetary conflict, and he&#8217;s drafted into their war. (Simply put, it&#8217;s like a combination of <em>Ender&#8217;s Game</em> meets <em>Ready Player One</em>.) Here&#8217;s the trailer for the original film:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Q-Qs3loKoc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>In a new interview with <a href=\"https://moviehole.net/interview-jonathan-betuel-writer-director-of-my-science-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Moviehole</a>, Betuel reveals that he and Gary Whitta are still chipping away at <em>The Last Starfighter</em> sequel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It looks like we&#8217;ll be making the deal to get it going,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Gary&#8217;s a gifted collaborator, we&#8217;ll be writing the script together but it&#8217;s taken a long time. I had to go through a process that took years to recapture the rights, but that was recently completed and although nothing is ever clear sailing, it looks like we have a really good opportunity now. So I&#8217;m really looking forward to taking it up.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Betuel waved away rumors that the project would be a TV series and instead doubled down on the fact that it&#8217;ll be &#8220;a movie with all the bells and whistles, and it won&#8217;t presuppose that you’ve seen the original film. There&#8217;ll be references here and there, but it&#8217;ll carry the saga forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As for story details, he explained that &#8220;the leads are now parents and time has passed. It&#8217;s not a remake, it&#8217;s going to continue the story. What&#8217;s changed is time itself, certainly as the video world and the alien world have continued to tick away. It&#8217;s not a time capsule of the &#8217;80s by any means, we&#8217;re taking it to the next level. Passing the torch…or the joystick.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can read some more about the project and even see more concept art <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/last-starfighter-sequel/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/last-starfighter-sequel-update/\">&#8216;The Last Starfighter&#8217; Sequel is Still in the Works; Original Writer Provides a Status Update</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UWbwIXsZkd4:v1addstrU2U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UWbwIXsZkd4:v1addstrU2U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UWbwIXsZkd4:v1addstrU2U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UWbwIXsZkd4:v1addstrU2U:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=UWbwIXsZkd4:v1addstrU2U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UWbwIXsZkd4:v1addstrU2U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/UWbwIXsZkd4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 17:30:16 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Last-Starfighter-sequel-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"f97b0ca988b94c95bc46efb16340958f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-44-33-400_61b65a6a5c26534b.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":32125,"destBytes":20952,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Last-Starfighter-sequel-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-44-33-400_61b65a6a5c26534b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UWbwIXsZkd4:v1addstrU2U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_3/2020/10/16/16-45-04-333_786c62e06081a6a2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=UWbwIXsZkd4:v1addstrU2U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn48@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-45-03-247_a89431625bc515d5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/UWbwIXsZkd4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn6@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-03-185_76dad3e09624bcb2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673064},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"‘Uncle Frank’ Trailer: Paul Bettany and Sophia Lillis Star in an LGBTQ Dramedy From ‘American Beauty’ Writer Alan Ball","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641503","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641510\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/uncle-frank-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"uncle frank trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/uncle-frank-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/uncle-frank-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/uncle-frank-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/uncle-frank.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Paul Bettany</strong> has been able to carve out a second wave in his career thanks to a much-needed boost from Marvel.

But Bettany finally gets a leading-man vehicle he deserves in <em><strong>Uncle Frank</strong>, </em>an LGBTQ dramedy from <em>American Beauty</em> writer <strong>Alan Ball</strong>.

There, she discovers that Frank is gay and living with his longtime partner Wally (<strong>Peter Macdissi</strong>). A family tragedy brings them both home, with Frank reluctantly returning to the hometown he sought to flee.</p>\n<p><em>Uncle Frank</em> made its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, where it was met with positive reviews and picked up for distribution by Amazon Studios. The film already has built up some interest, coming from writer-director Alan Ball, who won an Oscar for his <em>American Beauty</em> screenplay and created <em>Six Feet Under</em> and <em>True Blood</em>. But I have to admit, as someone with a longtime crush on Bettany, I&#8217;m happy to see him allowed a meaty role that he can chew on. Lillis impressed me in <em>It</em> and <i>Sharp Objects </i>as well, and appears to give a nice grounded performance in <em>Uncle Frank</em>, if with a bit of a shaky accent. The balance of comedy and drama, as well as the classic structure of a road trip movie, makes <em>Uncle Frank</em> seem like a promising watch.</p>\n<p>Also starring in <em>Uncle Frank</em> are <strong>Steve Zahn</strong>, <strong>Judy Greer</strong>, <strong>Margo Martindale</strong>, and <strong>Stephen Root</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Uncle Frank</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 1973, teenaged Beth Bledsoe (Sophia Lillis) leaves her rural Southern hometown to study at New York University where her beloved Uncle Frank (Paul Bettany) is a revered literature professor. She soon discovers that Frank is gay, and living with his longtime partner Walid &#8220;Wally&#8221; Nadeem (Peter Macdissi) &#8212; an arrangement that he has kept secret for years. After the sudden death of Frank&#8217;s father &#8212; Beth&#8217;s grandfather &#8212; Frank is forced to reluctantly return home for the funeral with Beth in tow, and to finally face a long-buried trauma that he has spent his entire adult life running away from.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Uncle Frank</em> is scheduled to premiere on Amazon Prime Video on <strong>November 26, 2020.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/uncle-frank-trailer/\">&#8216;Uncle Frank&#8217; Trailer: Paul Bettany and Sophia Lillis Star in an LGBTQ Dramedy From &#8216;American Beauty&#8217; Writer Alan Ball</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SU0hqWJue7g:4eYH_kPKhEE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SU0hqWJue7g:4eYH_kPKhEE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SU0hqWJue7g:4eYH_kPKhEE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SU0hqWJue7g:4eYH_kPKhEE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SU0hqWJue7g:4eYH_kPKhEE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SU0hqWJue7g:4eYH_kPKhEE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SU0hqWJue7g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:24 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/uncle-frank-700x291.jpg","linkMd5":"7ea82e2ac4555ad80d464e37b1377b94","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn34@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-44-33-438_e88df8fced5c9c45.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":291,"sourceBytes":31627,"destBytes":20354,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/uncle-frank-700x291.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn34@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-44-33-438_e88df8fced5c9c45.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SU0hqWJue7g:4eYH_kPKhEE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn30@2020_6/2020/10/16/16-45-03-330_119a88836064102c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SU0hqWJue7g:4eYH_kPKhEE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn94@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-45-03-261_dd930bb24fe6be47.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SU0hqWJue7g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn79@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-612_683787a96e8e8098.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673064},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"‘The Witches’ Video: Anne Hathaway Teaches You How to Spot a Witch, Unveils New Footage","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641538","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-641543 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Witches-video-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Witches video\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Witches-video.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Witches-video-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>What do you get when you take three of Hollywood&#8217;s most creative minds – <strong>Robert Zemeckis</strong>, <strong>Guillermo del Toro</strong>, and <strong>Kenya Barris</strong> – and set them loose on an adaptation of a <strong>Roald Dahl</strong> novel?</p>\n<p>Answer: <em><strong>The Witches</strong></em>, Zemeckis&#8217;s upcoming take on the story of a boy who discovers a conference of witches staying at a hotel and is subsequently transformed into a mouse.

Pictures (@wbpictures) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wbpictures/status/1316481238023118848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 14, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Despite all of the talent involved here (including a <em>Devil Wears Prada</em> reunion between Hathaway and Tucci), I can&#8217;t say that anything I&#8217;ve seen from this version of the story so far has me excited to check this out. I&#8217;m just not clicking with the tone, but maybe I should read Dahl&#8217;s book or see the 1990 adaptation starring Anjelica Huston before deciding once and for all if I should sit this one out.</p>\n<p>In any case, here&#8217;s the official synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>From Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis (“Forrest Gump”) comes the fantasy adventure “Roald Dahl’s The Witches.” The film stars Oscar winners Anne Hathaway (“Les Misérable,” “Ocean’s 8”) and Octavia Spencer (“The Help,” “The Shape of Water”), Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci (“The Hunger Games” films, “The Lovely Bones”), with Kristin Chenoweth (TV’s “Glee” and “BoJack Horseman”) and award-winning comedy legend Chris Rock. Newcomer Jahzir Kadeem Bruno (TV’s “Atlanta”) also stars, alongside Codie-Lei Eastick (“Holmes &#38; Watson”).</p>\n<p>Reimagining Dahl’s beloved story for a modern audience, Zemeckis’s visually innovative film tells the darkly humorous and heartwarming tale of a young orphaned boy (Bruno) who, in late 1967, goes to live with his loving Grandma (Spencer) in the rural Alabama town of Demopolis. As the boy and his grandmother encounter some deceptively glamorous but thoroughly diabolical witches, she wisely whisks our young hero away to an opulent seaside resort. Regrettably, they arrive at precisely the same time that the world’s Grand High Witch (Hathaway) has gathered her fellow cronies from around the globe—undercover—to carry out her nefarious plans.</p>\n<p>Based on the book by Roald Dahl, the screenplay is by Robert Zemeckis &#38; Kenya Barris (TV’s “black-ish,” “Shaft”) and Oscar winner Guillermo del Toro (“The Shape of Water”). Zemeckis is also producing, alongside Jack Rapke, del Toro, Alfonso Cuarón and Luke Kelly. Serving as executive producers are Jacqueline Levine, Marianne Jenkins, Michael Siegel, Gideon Simeloff and Cate Adams.</p>\n<p>Zemeckis’s behind-the-scenes team includes a roster of his frequent collaborators, including Oscar-nominated director of photography Don Burgess (“Forrest Gump”), production designer Gary Freeman, editors Jeremiah O’Driscoll and Ryan Chan, Oscar-nominated costume designer Joanna Johnston (“Allied,” “Lincoln”), and Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (“Polar Express,” “Forrest Gump”).</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Witches</em> arrives on HBO Max on <strong>October 22</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-witches-video/\">&#8216;The Witches&#8217; Video: Anne Hathaway Teaches You How to Spot a Witch, Unveils New Footage</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=LdvK7LdorAo:6ynCUpLDMvo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=LdvK7LdorAo:6ynCUpLDMvo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=LdvK7LdorAo:6ynCUpLDMvo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=LdvK7LdorAo:6ynCUpLDMvo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=LdvK7LdorAo:6ynCUpLDMvo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=LdvK7LdorAo:6ynCUpLDMvo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/LdvK7LdorAo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 23:30:13 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Witches-video-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"2793eb88776fc087a31d2f43248556f5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn29@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-44-49-954_7c742eea0f9e67cd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":52558,"destBytes":38762,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Witches-video-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn29@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-44-49-954_7c742eea0f9e67cd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-04-423_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=LdvK7LdorAo:6ynCUpLDMvo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/16/16-45-04-384_8145cac52c8add0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn100@2020_1/2020/10/16/16-45-05-292_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=LdvK7LdorAo:6ynCUpLDMvo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/LdvK7LdorAo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_4/2020/10/16/16-45-04-225_e9bd3fc930adc7bf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602866673064},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 00:44:33","title":"Cool Stuff: New X-Men and Batman Prints Unleash Mutants, Sentinels, Rogues, and the Batmobile","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641608","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641617 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bottleneck-xmen-batman-fall2020-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bottleneck Gallery X-Men and Batman Posters\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bottleneck-xmen-batman-fall2020-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bottleneck-xmen-batman-fall2020-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>New York Comic-Con may be over, but Bottleneck Gallery is still celebrating some of your favorite Marvel and DC Comics characters with yet another wave of outstanding new prints that will empty your bank account.

There&#8217;s also a collection of <strong>Batman</strong> prints featuring a variety of incarnations of The Dark Knight from the classic 1966 TV series, <strong><em>Batman: The Animated Series</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Batman Begins</em></strong>.

All the key X-Men are teaming up to take down a towering Sentintel. Even Cable can be spotted on a nearby rooftop. It&#8217;s a shame that some of the X-Men villains couldn&#8217;t be incorporated into this print in some way, but even so, it&#8217;s a great tribute to the X-Men of the 1990s.</p>\n<h2>Batman &#8217;66 by Matt Ferguson</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641624 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-regular-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Batman '66 by Matt Ferguson\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-regular-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-regular-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-regular-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-regular.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Batman ‘66</strong> by Matt Ferguson<br />\nScreen print<br />\n36 x 24 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 200<br />\n$50<br />\nEstimated to ship in 4 &#8211; 6 weeks</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641623 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-variant-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Batman '66 by Matt Ferguson\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-variant-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-variant-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-variant-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman66-mattferguson-variant.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Batman ‘66 &#8211; Variant</strong> by Matt Ferguson<br />\nScreen print<br />\n36 x 24 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 100<br />\n$60<br />\nEstimated to ship in 4 &#8211; 6 weeks</p>\n<p>Matt Ferguson really knows how to bring life to a still image. In this pair of prints inspired by the classic 1966 <em>Batman</em> TV series, you can just hear the Batmobile spinning its tires as Adam West jumps into The Caped Crusader&#8217;s signature vehicle alongside Burt Ward as The Boy Wonder. There&#8217;s even some dirt flying up from the tires. Plus, the detail on the computers within the Batcave itself are pretty impressive. My only complaint is that the logo in the corner feels a little invasive.</p>\n<h2>Batman vs Mr. Freeze by Raid71</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/2915/products/MrFreezeGif_1024x1024.gif?v=1602693106\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Batman Vs.

Inspired by <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>, this print has Mr. Freeze looking down at The Dark Knight menacingly as he&#8217;s encased in a snow globe of Gotham City. Since it&#8217;s a lenticular poster, as you walk around it framed on the wall, it&#8217;ll appear to have a 3D effect.</p>\n<h2>Batman Begins by Doaly</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641622 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batmanbegins-doaly-full-700x933.jpg\" alt=\"Batman Begins by Doaly\" width=\"700\" height=\"933\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batmanbegins-doaly-full-700x933.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batmanbegins-doaly-full-360x480.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batmanbegins-doaly-full.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Batman Begins</strong> by Doaly<br />\nScreen print<br />\n18 x 24 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 125<br />\n$40<br />\nEstimated to ship in 4 &#8211; 6 weeks</p>\n<p>Taking a very different approach than many of the Batman prints that we usually see for sale, Doaly&#8217;s artwork for <em>Batman Begins</em> is a piece that feels classy. Using the Bhutan blue flowers as the primary image, this would appear to be a simple tribute to the fear at the center of The Dark Knight&#8217;s origin story. Upon further inspection, you&#8217;ll notice that one of the leaves resembles a certain flying creature of the night.</p>\n<h2>Batman: The Animated Series by Steven Reeves</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641621 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-animatedseries-stevenreeves-regular-700x1049.jpg\" alt=\"Batman: The Animated Series by Steven Reeves\" width=\"700\" height=\"1049\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-animatedseries-stevenreeves-regular.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-animatedseries-stevenreeves-regular-334x500.jpg 334w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Batman: The Animated Series</strong> by Steven Reeves<br />\nScreen print<br />\n16 x 24 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 325<br />\n$40<br />\nEstimated to ship in 4 &#8211; 6 weeks</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641620 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-animatedseries-stevenreeves-variant-700x1049.jpg\" alt=\"Batman: The Animated Series by Steven Reeves\" width=\"700\" height=\"1049\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-animatedseries-stevenreeves-variant.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-animatedseries-stevenreeves-variant-334x500.jpg 334w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Batman: The Animated Series &#8211; Variant</strong> by Steven Reeves<br />\nScreen print<br />\n16 x 24 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 125<br />\n$50<br />\nEstimated to ship in 4 &#8211; 6 weeks</p>\n<p>All of the major villains from Batman: The Animated Series on are display in this collection of rogues from Steven Reeves. Framing them with the wings of Man-Bat and having the lower part of the image overtaken by Batman&#8217;s flowing cape creates a nice juxtaposition, and you don&#8217;t even need the Batman logo to enhance it.</p>\n<h2>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm by Sam Gilbey</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641619 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-maskofthephantasm-samgilbey-regular-700x1049.jpg\" alt=\"Batman: Mask of the Phantsm by Sam Gilbey\" width=\"700\" height=\"1049\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-maskofthephantasm-samgilbey-regular.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-maskofthephantasm-samgilbey-regular-334x500.jpg 334w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</strong> by Sam Gilbey<br />\nFine art giclée<br />\n16 x 24 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 100<br />\n$40<br />\nEstimated to ship in 4 &#8211; 6 weeks</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641618 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-maskofthephantasm-samgilbey-noir-700x1049.jpg\" alt=\"Batman: Mask of the Phantsm by Sam Gilbey\" width=\"700\" height=\"1049\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-maskofthephantasm-samgilbey-noir.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-maskofthephantasm-samgilbey-noir-334x500.jpg 334w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</strong> &#8211; Noir Variant by Sam Gilbey<br />\nFine art giclée<br />\n16 x 24 inches<br />\nHand-numbered edition of 50<br />\n$50<br />\nEstimated to ship in 4 &#8211; 6 weeks</p>\n<p>Finally, the theatrically released animated movie Batman: Mask of the Phantasm takes the spotlight. This one is designed almost like a classic movie poster with imagery and floating busts inspired by the film.
