Many of the narratives were short, and most of them were scaffolded by the narrator’s relatives and friends, who sat on the floor with them and helped the teller remember what things were called and figure out how verbs were inflected. But what emerged in the narrative sessions was that all young people in the village over age eighteen have some active competence in the vernacular, and some of them have excellent active competence—even though they never use it.</p> \n <p>Several of the young villagers in their mid- to late twenties were highly proficient storytellers. They spoke relatively unhesitatingly, they had a broad vocabulary, they used a variety of tenses and verbs of motion (which are often irregular in Tayap and very tricky to inflect correctly) in the stories they told, and they also commanded other features of the grammar that showed unexpected mastery of Tayap. The truly curious thing about the speakers is that outside of these sessions, they never displayed their command of the language. I once asked Membo, a twenty-six-year-old woman, what she thought about her twenty-five-year-old husband Ormbes’s competence in Tayap. Membo laughed dismissively. “Oh, he messes it all up,” she told me, “He doesn’t speak Tayap.”</p> \n <p>I later asked Ormbes to tell me a story in Tayap. He narrated an almost flawless tale of how he and his brother went hunting in the rainforest and speared a pig. Ormbes turned out to be one of the most fluent younger speakers in the village. That his wife, who not only had been married to him for ten years but also had grown up with him and had known him all her life, was convinced that her husband didn’t speak Tayap, was remarkable—and telling.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><span id=\"more-9131\"></span></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>I scoured the linguistic literature for a label to name people like Ormbes, and I came up empty. Ormbes isn’t what’s known as a passive bilingual because he is capable of relatively advanced language production. Nor is someone like Ormbes quite the same as what linguists who work with endangered languages call a semi-speaker. Semi-speakers are speakers of a dying language who have perfect passive competence and perfect communicative competence in that language. In other words, they understand everything that fluent speakers say to them, and they respond in culturally appropriate ways, using short bursts of the language. Semi-speakers’ ability to get jokes, interject comments, and actively participate in conversations by contributing a few well-turned utterances here and there is deceptive, and it often masks the fact that they can’t actually say very much. Linguists who work with endangered languages report cases in which their work with semi-speakers has caused extreme embarrassment to a whole community. The linguists have given such speakers language proficiency tests because they assumed that they were fluent speakers (having seen them conversing with fluent speakers, and because fluent speakers identified them as fluent speakers). When confronted with a language test, though—and to everybody’s dismay—the people who everyone thought were fluent, in reality, could barely manage to compose a single grammatically correct sentence on their own.</p> \n <p>Young people in Gapun like Ormbes aren’t semi-speakers partly because they can construct grammatically correct sentences, and also because they don’t ever actually converse in Tayap. They actively participate in conversations when older speakers speak Tayap, but their own contributions are always in Tok Pisin. With the exception of lexical items and a few formulaic phrases like “Give me betel nut,” they never use Tayap at all.</p> \n <p>Rather than calling the young people in Gapun who can narrate stories in Tayap passive bilinguals or semi-speakers, I’ve taken to calling them “passive active bilinguals.” The convolutedness of that label seems fitting to describe speakers who possesses sufficient grammatical and communicative competence in their second language to use that language, but who never actually do use it because social and cultural factors make it unnecessary or undesirable to do so.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I’m sure it’s not a common situation, but it presumably occurs elsewhere. <em>Einmal ist keinmal</em>, as they say.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 18:14:53 +0000","feedId":5269,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f4b506a55cd52a8d702154b57cdfd092","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"languagehat","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=languagehat-20&l=ur2&o=1":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617427576645}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 13:26:16","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 13:26:16","feedId":5269,"fetchDate":"Sat, 03 Apr 2021 05:26:16 +0000","fetchMs":3520,"handleMs":71,"totalMs":188651,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"8505a3c7be0395d3ea35c7edc8fc4169","hostName":"us-028*","requestId":"2de9ddc98f35484b8c26f3ee1ebc9e69_5269","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:30:05","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 11:06:05","id":5269,"name":"languagehat.com","url":"http://www.languagehat.com/index.rdf","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://languagehat.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn1@2020_3/2020/09/01/03-06-05-628_0248cd1ffef4ec96.jpg","description":"","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 13:29:21","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 13:29:21","id":null,"feedId":5269,"linkMd5":"f4b506a55cd52a8d702154b57cdfd092"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1617427572994,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":3586,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":71,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":121531,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://europe-22.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-012.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
