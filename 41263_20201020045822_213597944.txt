Review articles are incredibly time consuming, scouring an application for code to improve can take hours, making the changes takes time, and all of that is dependent on getting that perfect submission.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>So while I intend to continue to do review pieces here (keep those submissions coming in) I’m going to extend the format here to include a few different kinds of posts.  I’ll be doing some focussed introductory pieces which cover the best practices for a few tricky areas that I see experienced rails programmers getting wrong.  I’ll also be doing a few ‘soapboxy’ pieces where I can address misinformation about Rails and Ruby or just advocate a particular piece of technology or code that I think is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>One of my primary goals with this relaunch will be to post regularly, but I’m not going to try and stick to a schedule that takes the fun out of it for me.  Some weeks might see multiple posts, and others will see none at all.  I’m just hoping that you guys will enjoy most of them.</p>\n          ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Jan 2009 03:52:00 +0000","feedId":41263,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2a92b240b7301926503668bd519a2c2b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Koz","publishedOrCreatedDate":1603169902634}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 12:58:22","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 12:58:22","feedId":41263,"fetchDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 04:58:22 +0000","fetchMs":21,"handleMs":180234,"totalMs":180286,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":15,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"b61367955ce0c617c692299987db8df0","hostName":"europe65*","requestId":"6b3f79aad8c44b58b5d95ec0feb2770d_41263","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:23:30","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:43:13","id":41263,"name":"The Rails Way - Home","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheRailsWay","subscriber":78,"website":null,"icon":"http://www.therailsway.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"","weekly":null,"link":"http://www.therailsway.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603169722348,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":52,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":180234,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
