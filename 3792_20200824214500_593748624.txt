I liked the third, but the fourth felt a little more dynamic which is how I think of the game - a bit frantic.</p>\n<p>To get this to load into NextBASIC, I have three options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I can export as an 8-bit BMP and load on the machine using <code>.bmpload</code> - which is probably fine, but has a little more latency that I'd like.</li>\n<li>I can convert the file first to an BMP and then to <a href=\"https://wiki.specnext.dev/File_Formats\">an SL2 file</a> - which is a pure dump of the screen layer. Then easily loaded back in using <code>LAYER 2,1: LOAD &#34;screen.sl2&#34; LAYER</code>. This is quick (there's no calculation to be done as it represents a memory dump) but it does read of the SD card. This would be fine if I was showing this screen once, but I show it many times, particularly through the option screens.</li>\n<li>Generate the SL2 file, and load individual thirds into banks - this is the method I used since the data is loaded in memory for quick copying back into the screen memory.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I made <a href=\"https://zx.remysharp.com/tools/\">another online tool</a> that lets me upload any file format, and so long as it's 256x192 (or not wider than 256) then my code will translate the data to both an 8-bit BMP (with the default Spectrum Next palette) <em>and</em> an SL2 file (which is very similar to a BMP, just ordered slightly differently).</p>\n<p>Once I have the SL2 file, I need to break it into 3 equal parts of 16K (the size of a memory bank) and for the final touch, the last third of the screen is solid black for 16 lines - which I can do at the same time.</p>\n<p>A unix tool called <code>dd</code> can be used to split the file up:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ dd if=screen.sl2 of=screen1.bin bs=16k count=1 skip=0\n$ dd if=screen.sl2 of=screen2.bin bs=16k count=1 skip=1\n$ dd if=screen.sl2 of=screen3.bin bs=16k count=1 skip=2\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will create 3 files of 16K blocks each (based on screen.sl2).</p>\n<p>The final task is to block out the last 16 lines in black pixels - <code>0x00</code> which conveniently is what comes out of <code>/dev/zero</code>, so I can source that stream and use <code>dd</code> to write it into the <code>screen3.bin</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=4k count=1 oseek=3 of=screen3.bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now the binary files can be reploaded into banks then loaded into the LAYER on demand:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-nextbasic\"><span class=\"token keyword\">LOAD</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"screen1.bin\"</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">20</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">LOAD</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"screen2.bin\"</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">21</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">LOAD</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"screen3.bin\"</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">22</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">; later in the code</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">20</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">TO</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>   <span class=\"token comment\">; bank 9 is the start of LAYER 2</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">21</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">TO</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">22</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">TO</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the state of play on Sunday 9 August is that all the (known) bugs are fixed, the new music and sound effects are in place, high scores are updating and saving. I'm investigating a couple of performance tweaks (that aren't required, but will be nice if I can it off) which leaves me with one last problem to solve.</p>\n<p>Do I keep the name <em>&#34;Oh Mummy!&#34;</em>? There's other clones of Amsoft's Oh Mummy, some have a different name, some reuse the name, but there is a question over copyright. I'd hope that copyright holders would see this as a hat-tip to old but it bears considering.</p>\n<p>So, so far there's some ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mummy Mummy!</li>\n<li>Return of Oh Mummy!</li>\n<li>Oh Daddy!</li>\n<li>Go Mummy!</li>\n<li>(and) Oh Remmmy!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although the last one is rather self serving, I quite like it - just trying to work out how it fits in the story lineâ€¦ (I also prefer titles that are approximately the same length as the original).</p>\n<p>So closeâ€¦</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/devlog/go-mummy/2020-08-09\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=IDptS0CU1ug:0UdJDpR9woA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=IDptS0CU1ug:0UdJDpR9woA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/IDptS0CU1ug\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"https://remysharp.com/images/devlog/ohm-2020-07-20b.png","linkMd5":"17ba7db2dda19405e85bf787f978dc68","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-36-748_ff7d018b40127f5d.webp","destWidth":1584,"destHeight":1188,"sourceBytes":8811,"destBytes":66432,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://remysharp.com/images/devlog/ohm-2020-07-20b.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-36-748_ff7d018b40127f5d.webp","https://remysharp.com/images/devlog/ohm-2020-08-09.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-58-857_2afa4e1b87cdedaf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=IDptS0CU1ug:0UdJDpR9woA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-57-569_b948eb987667a191.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/IDptS0CU1ug":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-58-147_0b69c5924067bb02.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476247},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"The first computer program in BASIC ran OTD in 1964 [link]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/29f5UiYATlI/2020-05-28-2b3aeadb","description":"\n<p>As BASIC returns to my radar, this was a bit of lovely timing on Twitter lately:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first computer program in BASIC ran OTD in 1964.

in fact, &#34;Police brutality&#34; is just a clever avoidance of the fact that the police are murdering black folk. It's disgusting. It's unforgivable. It's deep, deep, racism that's ever present andâ€¦ andâ€¦ I've no fucking wordsâ€¦</li>\n<li>Women are treated like shit, still, decades after the women right's movements (that said, we still have huge problems with racism so it's hardly surprising)</li>\n<li>I don't know how adults aren't incredibly sad or incredibly angry <strong>all the fucking time</strong> - I know that if I scratch under the rather thin surface that's what's sitting there for me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've seen a few posts of &#34;what a week&#34;, but this isn't just one week. &#34;This week&#34; is the culmination of decades and decades and centuries of persecution. Persecution towards anyone who didn't look, let's be honest, like a white man.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't ever call myself racist, but I know, when I examine closely that I've been racist. I wouldn't call myself sexist, but, again, I know I have been. I have been because it never occurred to me, because I've never been in that situation. That in itself is mind bogglingly fucked up. I get a free pass in life by total fluke.</p>\n<p>I'm a white guy, born in britain, middle-class enough, working in tech, with privilege left right and centre. <em>I am</em> the problem, <strong>it's on us</strong> (not the pandemic, but frankly it seems like the pandemic is just the planet's way of telling us something's a little more than fucked).</p>\n<p>I do have personal and professional ways that I can help make positive change, but good lord it feels like a piddle in the ocean.</p>\n<p>So, this week, people protest on the streets for equality, to be treated fairly and not in fear - becauseâ€¦human rights, right? This week we sit in our homes, not visiting friends, not getting hair cuts, not doing anything unless vital and we wait to hear that the pandemic is on the decline.</p>\n<p>More importantly, to me, this week, we talked (again) to our (white) kids to about racism, about sexism, about hate and fear. That, so far this week, is the best I've managed.</p>\n<p>I hope this time ends. I hope we return to a new normality.

The downside is control over the machine.</p>\n<p>Currently <em>Oh Mummy</em> has (really cool) music thanks to Richard Faulkner (from the Spectrum Next facebook forum). To play sound effects poses a number of problems, and ultimately I've had to park the idea entirely.</p>\n<p>Since my game is pretty high speed and involves constant movement, any sound effect is going to have to run along side the rendering. The way BASIC is wired up doesn't really allow this. When I'm calling the <code>BEEP</code> function (for instance) I can't be moving my sprite.</p>\n<p>In machine code it doesn't work like this anyway, so it's useful to think in machine code context. The way it works at the lowest level is that the user code changes the interrupt routine (in web language this would be akin to request animation frame) and then tones would be adjusted at this point.</p>\n<p>Without knowing the details, I'm fairly confident that this is how the audio <code>DRIVER</code> call works to play the <a href=\"http://nextdaw.biasillo.com/\">NextDAW</a> music.</p>\n<p>So the <code>BEEP</code> function is pretty much out of the window. Not only because it'll pause the runtime enough to make playing uncomfortable, but also I can't design a beeper based sound to sound decent enough. Though it might be worth my looking at <a href=\"http://freestuff.grok.co.uk/beepola/\">Beepola</a>.</p>\n<p>NextBASIC also comes with a powerful <code>PLAY</code> function which sends commands to the AY-8-3912 chips. This does sound great (assuming I can construct the right string to send to the <code>PLAY</code> command) but it <em>also</em> suffers from locking up the play back.</p>\n<p>I also looked at <a href=\"https://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml\">Beepfx</a> which is Windows specific but does generate machine code that I can call from BASIC using <code>RANDOMIZE USR 60000</code>. This works pretty well for sounds and includes a very useful demo library of sound effects. The problem is that a) it also locks up until complete - which could be mitigated with extremely short sounds, but most importantly b) it's configured to run on a 3.5Mhz spectrum <em>not</em> one running at 28Mhz which is the speed I'm using to get the game to feel quick and responsive. The beepfx sounds are more like a crazed mouse on acid.</p>\n<p>Sadly, I can't get my head around the sound engineering maths required to modify the beepfx values, and switching down to 3.5Mhz, calling the routine, then speeding back up to 28Mhz has the same (if not worse) slow down.</p>\n<p>One novel approach that Dave Clarke (also of Spectrum Next facebook forum) uses is to enable the AY chips via the <code>OUT</code> function in BASIC, set the volume to zero, then adjust the volume on demand in his game loop. The same technique can be used to adjust the tones on demand to create effects.</p>\n<p>I also <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/remy/8dd68e03adfa023e9adf6c3c9dbee238\">experimented</a> with working through a string of toggles during the game loop and it kinda half works but the sounds I'm making are quite terrible <strong>and</strong> I'm competing with the background music for the AY chips (which in reality just doesn't let me play back).</p>\n<p>So, for the time being, this game will have to be sans sound effect.

A <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science)#Common_integral_data_types\">short is a 16 bit integer</a>. Though I think this is just as interesting!</p>\n<p>Recently I had a requirement to read a file that contained an array of 16bit values. This means <em>pairs of bytes</em>. When we read files in the browser or in Node we get byte (8bit) and the process <em>should</em> be straight forward to view this data as 16bit data, but, as you might guess, it's not.</p>\n<h2>On the web</h2>\n<p>The web makes it mostly straight forward so long as you're working with files arranged in the same endianness as your own system.</p>\n<p>I want to write about endianness (mostly for my own understanding and recollection), but in lieu of that, MDN have a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Endianness\">good article on endianness</a> (TL;DR: defines the byte order, little being the bytes are reversed, which is also the most common format).</p>\n<p>To get a 16bit array out of a file, the process is relatively straight forward:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// assuming result is an arrayBuffer, possibly from readAsArrayBuffer</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// [1, 2, ...]</span>\nresult<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>byteLength <span class=\"token comment\">// ? 512</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> data <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint16Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>result<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\ndata<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length <span class=\"token comment\">// ? 256 elements - correct (2 bytes per value)</span>\ndata<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// ? first value is 513 (0x0201)</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, if your machine is little endian and your file is big endian (not super likely, but still), there's no straight forward way of getting this data so it needs a helping hand:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// result is an arrayBuffer - as above</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> view <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">DataView</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>result<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> data <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint16Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>result<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>byteLength<span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&#60;</span> data<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  data<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> view<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getUint16</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>i <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// false = read as big endian</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\ndata<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// ? first value is now 258 (0x0102)</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Though, I still find it odd that the system defaults to little endian and yet <code>getUint16</code> defaults to big endian (if the <code>false</code> boolean is omitted).</p>\n<p>Node is a bit more of a struggle.</p>\n<h2>Inside node</h2>\n<p>When reading a file in Node using the <code>fs</code> module, either <code>readFile</code> or <code>readFileSync</code> you'll get a Node specific <code>Buffer</code> back. It extends the <code>ArrayBuffer</code> so you can get to the underlying buffer but you can't throw it into a new 16bit array - you need to use some careful code.</p>\n<p>I don't fully understand the inner workings, but when you do a <code>readFile</code> there's a <code>poolSize</code> property that changes has the data sits in the buffer. From the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_byteoffset\">docs</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>â€¦when allocating a buffer smaller than Buffer.poolSize, the buffer doesn't start from a zero offset on the underlying ArrayBuffer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To see this in action, I can read a file and throw the buffer into a <code>Uint16Array</code> and see how wrong it is:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// result is a Buffer object, which contains the same data arrangement</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// as our earlier example: [1, 2, ...] an a length of 512 bytes</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> bad <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint16Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>file<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nbad<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length <span class=\"token comment\">// ? 4096 - ðŸ˜±wat</span>\nbad<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// ? 8827 (and changes each time I run the code)</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Clearly not good. This is because there's junk bytes on our buffer, and so we need to makes sure we pick out the data correctly:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> good <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint16Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>file<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> file<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>byteOffset<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> file<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\ngood<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length <span class=\"token comment\">// ? 256 ðŸ‘�</span>\ngood<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// ? 513 ðŸ‘�</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Node has a <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_swap16\">convenience method for swapping</a> the endianness of the bytes: <code>swap16</code>. Calling this method before loading the buffer into the <code>Uint16Array</code> will change the data from little endian (in my current case) to big endian.</p>\n<p>So that's how to get 16bit data.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/2020/07/08/gotcha-reading-shorts\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=_lIRPF7quY0:rtGOET53Ack:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=_lIRPF7quY0:rtGOET53Ack:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/_lIRPF7quY0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=_lIRPF7quY0:rtGOET53Ack:F7zBnMyn0Lo","linkMd5":"9ae59366d921275e9c6fa0908988af53","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn23@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-36-554_7824d0a523479e4d.webp","destWidth":105,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1058,"destBytes":436,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=_lIRPF7quY0:rtGOET53Ack:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn23@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-36-554_7824d0a523479e4d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/_lIRPF7quY0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-57-310_35c85f0dcd442dd2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476251},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"Safari 10 supports module, but not nomodule [til/javascript]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/xf1IgAw3pZc/safari-10-supports-module-but-not-nomodule","description":"\n<p>More and more of my own project uses <code>&#60;script type=&#34;module&#34; src=&#34;app.js&#34;&#62;</code>, and for good measure, I tend to use <a href=\"https://parceljs.org/\">Parcel</a> (or <a href=\"https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/\">Rollup</a>) to compile a nomodule bundle that ships alongside the &#34;regular&#34; code.</p>\n<p>Except, of course, Safari 10 doesn't support <code>nomodule</code>.

Already a lot more shouting than anyone would want. It's been an exceedingly hot few days which also means no one is sleeping well. It all mounts up. Sometimes this blog is for me, and this is one of those times. This is unedited and raw.</p>\n<p><em>Content warning: stillbirth</em></p>\n<p>This morning I'm trying to work on a client project, some stupid data wrangling and I can't concentrate. The kids are asking me questions that I'd normally be happy to help, but instead I'm getting more frustrated and angry at myself. I can't solve this computing problem and I'm making repetitive mistakes.</p>\n<p>And then there's the lockdown since late March. In those 4 months, I've seen two friends. I've not been the gym (though it reopened a couple of weeks ago). I've outgrown my medium t-shirts and am now filling, once again, my large t-shirts. Julie, my partner, to say has her hands are full is an understatement. She has all the same pressures I have except that her full time job is our kids (during this lockdown), and being a full time parent is ten-fold more demanding that some stupid data wrangling. That's to say, in the scheme of things I don't really have anything to complain about. But I do. And I don't really have anyone to talk to.</p>\n<p>I can feel my chest is tight. I'm struggling to concentrate. It's not just all the crap we're dealing with. My body remembers. My body remembers that it would be Tia's tenth birthday this month. In a matter of weeks. It's like a foot that stands on my chest, just enough to make my breathing hard.</p>\n<p>Ten years today, I remember driving down the road (just around the corner where we live now) and I remember thinking at the time, this is level 10, we're right on 9 months and baby is coming real soon. This the level 10 boss and I need to drive carefully and play through this level carefully and not do anything unsafe because we're nearly there. We're nearly at the day that we meet our first child.</p>\n<p>Tia died during birth. Stillbirth. Though I don't like to say &#34;stillbirth&#34; because some people confuse stillbirth with miscarriages. It's not simple (both ways). We know that Tia was alive the week she was due. We think, as much as it hurts to think, that she kicked the day before we went into hospital. But she had died. We don't know why. I didn't and don't want to know why. I never wanted anyone or anything to blame. If there was something to blame then it might have been preventable and that path of madness is too much for me.</p>\n<p>After she was born, the days and weeks that followed I saw Tia in another universe. In a universe where Julie, myself and our newborn Tia were happy. Going for walks in the new pram, enjoying the sunshine and happiness. I'm not religious but wondered if I could have the chance to see Tia again after I died. It's something I ran over my mind over and over, something I needed to solve. I didn't believe in heaven and the variables involved was too much (was <em>everyone</em> in heavenâ€¦ etc) but I could see the appeal of Belief.</p>\n<p>I don't think about that anymore. Not all these years later. When she was born it was like our snow globe of a world had been thoroughly shaken - everything was unrecognisable. It took a long, long time for it to settle. Time doesn't heal, it changes you. Tia's loss is part of me, it's part of our family. I carry the pain as matter of fact. In the first year I feared that if I stopped hurting I wouldn't remember her and that I'd lose her. The pain is still there, the hole in my life is still there, it's just I carry it now. It's there: the hole of her not being in our daytime lives is part of me.</p>\n<p>And I need to cry, but I can't. Though this could be the anti-depressants I've been on for the last 4 years or so (please don't send unsolicited opinions on this). The the drugs help me in ways that I can't describe (they're not for Tia, they're for something else), but they do seem to put a plug on my ability to cry. I'm unsure whether it would make any difference, but that foot on my chest and that need to cry is like something on the edge of my vision that I can never quite focus properly on.</p>\n<p>I've got some time off around her birthday. The hope is that I'm able to disconnect myself enough to stop. To stop properly and to let the memories and emotions wash over me. This writing helps. It helps to know that friends see me and know about Tia. For her 10th birthday - a word that will never sit right but we don't have other words - we're having her gravestone cleaned. It's made of sandstone, enclosing a mix of heather plants, small stones, butterfly trinkets and a number of small soft toys. The headstone is heart shaped with the inscription:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tia Sharp</p>\n<p>31 August 2010</p>\n<p>Our heartbreaker.</p>\n<p>Our sleeping beauty.</p>\n<p>We will always love you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/2020/08/13/ten\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=RRE0jf9m52U:eaGZ9stybJ0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=RRE0jf9m52U:eaGZ9stybJ0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/RRE0jf9m52U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=RRE0jf9m52U:eaGZ9stybJ0:F7zBnMyn0Lo","linkMd5":"a6998f0d64547eccf778088335c34142","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn50@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-44-36-399_0eeb830483d5bdc1.webp","destWidth":105,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1058,"destBytes":436,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=RRE0jf9m52U:eaGZ9stybJ0:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn50@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-44-36-399_0eeb830483d5bdc1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/RRE0jf9m52U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-44-57-379_aa3fc7f2431cc181.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476247},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"Clearing twitter [blog]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/PGWWbobs69I/clearing-twitter","description":"\n<p>It's no surprise that twitter and similar sink holes are constantly trying to &#34;engage&#34; you so you can be sucked into their void. As someone who believes that the web belongs to its users and I browse the way <em>I want</em> I frequently change and block content on these sites so I can use them the way I would like.</p>\n<p>So here's a quick share on how I'm doing that.</p>\n<p>This is a simple example of how <em>I think</em> twitter can be improved - the picture below shows, highlighted in red, the &#34;trending news&#34; which really isn't news - or at least not news that I would recommend consuming. I certainly don't want to get my COVID-19 advice from the latest trending bullshit. More recently they have launched (possibly in split tests) a DM â€¦ &#34;thing&#34;? so I can use that to message people instead ofâ€¦what, email? WhatsApp? Not sure. Anyway, it's shit that I don't need in my life, so it's getting ejected.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://remysharp.com/images/clean-twitter.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Step 1: get yourself <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/\">uBlock Origin</a> (the origin bit is important) available for <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation\">most browsers</a></p>\n<p>Step 2: use the right click - block element picker to stop content from bothering you</p>\n<p>When you fire up the picker, you'll notice that Twitter (and other sites that don't believe in writing actual CSS classes) are using something to generate their CSS, which makes picking element using CSS selectors tricky.</p>\n<p>Except, the trick is to look for aria roles or even data properties.

I suspect if I want to add AI, I'll need to decrease the random effect as difficulty increases</li>\n<li>Mummy's revealed in a tomb follow you to the next level, and if you don't lose a life from a mummy (or kill a mummy using a scroll), the in game mummy number increases quickly, so the game needs to work with 5+ mummy's in play (currently adding mummy's has a direct impact on game speed)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I've also been reviewing how I'll unveil the tombs. Currently I'm throwing on a <code>LAYER ERASE</code> (which has glitches in Cspect) but this won't fly when I want to draw on the scroll etc. So it's likely I'll create a tile map for these areas at some point soon.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/devlog/go-mummy/2020-05-25\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=aWqyPmoHv20:WLL5RvQcBtk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=aWqyPmoHv20:WLL5RvQcBtk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/aWqyPmoHv20\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=aWqyPmoHv20:WLL5RvQcBtk:F7zBnMyn0Lo","linkMd5":"bb1b67f9f74ebe684568ee16a89b6bfe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn8@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-44-36-614_8899f5078205c19e.webp","destWidth":105,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1058,"destBytes":436,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=aWqyPmoHv20:WLL5RvQcBtk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn8@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-44-36-614_8899f5078205c19e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/aWqyPmoHv20":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-57-308_23e1e90af8429405.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476260},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"Old (way) Octal [til/javascript]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/DC2Pg-GEy78/old-octal","description":"\n<p>JavaScript has lots of numerical type support, my usual default is decimal.</p>\n<p>Then with a lot of the byte mangling work I do, I use hex a lot, so things like <code>0x80</code> give me a little more information than just <code>128</code> because it tells me that the <abbr title=\"Most significant bit\">MSB</abbr> is on when all others are off.</p>\n<p>This works well with binary too (which frankly looks weird in JavaScript): <code>0b10000000</code>.</p>\n<p>Octal is knocking around in JavaScript, <code>0o40</code> (which is 32 - and no, I'm never quite sure when to use octal), but, <abbr title=\"Today I learnt\">TIL</abbr>, octal has an &#34;old format&#34; in JavaScript: <code>040</code>.

Music is definitely my weak/no-skill-at-all spot.</p>\n<p>So now the game has music (which you can turn on and off at your leisure).</p>\n<p>I've also been tweaking some of the game play decisions, one in particular is that as you rescue each archaeologist and move to the next level, you get more baddies and so on until level 5 where you have the potential for up to 6 baddies (5 for 5 levels plus 1 hidden baddie in a tomb).</p>\n<p>I also need to think about what points mean and whether a) I bother with points and whether survival is enough and b) if I keep points I'll need a high score board.</p>\n<p>There's also a few minor bugs that need fixing (that my kids keep pointing out!), like the top right corner of the game doesn't have any footprints when going in a specific direction. I'm trying to capture these as a I go along in my github repo - which makes me wonder how on earth developers in the 80s managed to code both on a single process system (i.e. no multi-tasking) and without any code control. Yoinks.</p>\n<p>Here's a demo of where the game is up to:</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ii9i5YVinz0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>As further procrastination I've been looking at whether I can bundle all the game assets (currently 8 additional files excluding the main NextBASIC) into a single .TAP file. I've managed to create a tool that lets me bundle, but there's some technical constraints on the machine the code is running on, specifically I can't install the music player using this method, nor can I use any of the Next OS command line tools (dot commands).</p>\n<p>But then, being told that it's not possible has only spurred me on to new investigations, and this evening I've been looking at whether I can write my own assembly and trigger it directly from my NextBASIC to avoid using any of the OS commandsâ€¦ trippy.</p>\n<p>So this is the code I've got at the moment, and yep, it's pretty senseless!</p>\n<pre><code>DATA 17,40,41,33,0,1,205,0,192,195,6,192,201\n</code></pre>\n<p>It does <em>something</em> but instead of music, I get noise on the screen!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://remysharp.com/images/devlog/asm-ohm.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Back to the drawing board, eh?</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/devlog/go-mummy/2020-06-25\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=YLwgbLQsTNc:LfOeDlZsZ5Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=YLwgbLQsTNc:LfOeDlZsZ5Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/YLwgbLQsTNc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"https://remysharp.com/images/devlog/asm-ohm.gif","linkMd5":"09aaf3f64c1b70194aa33643c8c70210","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-36-814_7046b94ab81eaee2.webp","destWidth":360,"destHeight":280,"sourceBytes":38533,"destBytes":19870,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://remysharp.com/images/devlog/asm-ohm.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-36-814_7046b94ab81eaee2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=YLwgbLQsTNc:LfOeDlZsZ5Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn20@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-44-57-346_9b33ce77747d57c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/YLwgbLQsTNc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn7@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-44-57-311_c858bf998a58c40f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476252},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"Network Effect (The Murderbot Diaries, #5) [book]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/44OuSE13lXI/network-effect-the-murderbot-diaries-5","description":"<p>Fun stuff, as always, but requires prior knowledge</p>\n<p>I'm a big fan of the Murderbot Diaries the first story was so fresh and unlike anything I had before so I was particularly excited to read the full length novel by Martha Wells.</p>\n<p>I was actually looking forward to recommending it to friends, but the one thing that surprised me and with mild disappointment is that you would definitely need to read the previous novellas. There's a lot of references to prior adventures, characters, outcomes and learnings - which makes it hard to jump straight into this book (I wouldn't recommend doing so actually).</p>\n<p>However, I <em>have</em> read all the prior novellas and was able to pick up from where I left off, and SecUnit continues to be lovable, grumpy and extremely uncomfortable with emotions.</p>\n<p>What was a real delight was the return of ART. We met ART in <em>Artificial Condition</em> (book 2) and I remember being disappointed that we didn't meet it again, but in this story, ART plays a main character - and it's beautiful.</p>\n<p>I do also love how Wells writes about these characters. Firstly they're respectful of pronouns - somehow whenever I've thought of a robot, I've referred to them as &#34;he&#34; yet robots have no gender. Wells makes it pretty clear that a) this has never been an issue to the constructs, and b) always makes sure we're using the right pronouns, including always referring to SecUnit's mushy clients as &#34;humans and augmented humans&#34;.</p>\n<p>If you're a Murderbot fan, then I definitely think you'll enjoy this.

The first (and the one I'll use) is <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/dev/zero\"><code>/dev/zero</code></a> the alternative is to use <code>yes</code> with an argument (so <code>yes 1</code> will repeat <code>1\\n</code> over and over) - but with <code>yes</code> I'd need to strip the new line, then change the <code>1</code> character.</p>\n<p>So, pipe <code>/dev/zero</code> to <code>tr</code> and transform the zero byte into <code>0xFC</code>. Of course, <code>tr</code> doesn't do hex, it does octal (base 8), so I need:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">tr '\\0' '\\374' &#60; /dev/zero\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's double check this is the right value, by looking at the first 16 bytes as hex:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">tr '\\0' '\\374' &#60; /dev/zero | head -c 16 | hexdump\n0000000 c3 bc c3 bc c3 bc c3 bc c3 bc c3 bc c3 bc c3 bc\n0000010\n</code></pre>\n<p>Urmâ€¦spot a problem? I've got <code>0xC3BC</code> as a repeating word which is <em>not</em> what I was after. From what I could gather, this is because <code>tr</code> is used to translate strings, and the default language it's using is UTF8 whichâ€¦ the byte 0xFC is outside of a normal range, or, something - I'm never quite going to understand UTF8 fully (<a href=\"https://http203.libsyn.com/how-to-avoid-getting-utfd-by-text-encodings\">but these two do</a>).</p>\n<p>The solution is to switch the language <code>tr</code> is using:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">LC_CTYPE=C tr '\\0' '\\374' &#60; /dev/zero | head -c 16 | hexdump\n0000000 fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc\n0000010\n</code></pre>\n<p>That's better. Now let's pipe that to <code>dd</code></p>\n<h2>Generating fixed length files</h2>\n<p>My aim is to take a file that has an arbitrary length with existing data, and pad it to 16K and any padded bytes must be <code>0xFC</code>.</p>\n<p>To create a 16K file (called <code>output.bin</code>) with <code>dd</code> using our byte, the line is:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ LC_CTYPE=C tr '\\0' '\\374' &#60; /dev/zero | dd of=output.bin bs=16k count=1\n</code></pre>\n<p>This means our <em>blocksize</em> <code>bs=</code> is 16k (<code>dd</code> supports shorthand for file sizes) and we want one block of 16k. Alternatively I could have <code>bs=1k count=16</code> to make 16 blocks of 1k - hopefully you get the idea.</p>\n<p>Except this makes a whole file, I need to <em>add</em> to a file. This is multipart task with a calculator handy.</p>\n<p>Instead of 16K of data, I need <code>16K - $currentFileLength</code>. To get this, I need two things: <code>expr</code> (for the maths) and <code>stat</code> (to get the file size accurately).</p>\n<p>To test this, I use the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ expr 16384 - $(stat -f &#34;%Dz&#34; input.bin)\n15488\n</code></pre>\n<p>To generate a zero byte for 15,488 bytes I'll use <code>dd</code> to fill with a blocksize of 1 byte and for a count of 15,488 bytes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=$(expr 16384 - $(stat -f &#34;%Dz&#34; input.bin))\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this is still zero bytes, so streaming through <code>tr</code> converts to <code>0xFC</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=$(expr 16384 - $(stat -f &#34;%Dz&#34; input.bin)) \\\n | LC_CTYPE=C tr '\\0' '\\374'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I have 15,488 bytes of <code>0xFC</code>.</p>\n<p>So now I need to take the contents of <code>input.bin</code> and the generated output from <code>dd</code> and concatenate the two blocks of content into a final file called <code>output.bin</code>.</p>\n<p>That looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">cat input.bin \\\n &#60;( dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=$(\\\n      expr 16384 - $(stat -f &#34;%Dz&#34; input.bin)\n    ) | LC_CTYPE=C tr '\\0' '\\374'\n ) &#62; output.bin\n</code></pre>\n<p>A bit of a mouthful, but it puts together all the parts, then uses stream redirection to add <code>dd</code> to the output of <code>cat</code> and the concatenated result is put in <code>output.bin</code>, which is: exactly 16K large, contains 896 bytes of the original <code>input.bin</code> data and then follows <code>0xFC</code> for all the subsequent bytes.</p>\n<p>Ah yes, that old &#34;command line rabbit hole&#34;.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/2020/06/17/how-to-pad-a-file-with-specific-bytes\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=glEOnYrdaVo:Jt5_wmS0Utc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=glEOnYrdaVo:Jt5_wmS0Utc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/glEOnYrdaVo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=glEOnYrdaVo:Jt5_wmS0Utc:F7zBnMyn0Lo","linkMd5":"863efc871cef98096fd06f9a6d216935","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn71@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-36-381_88efdb57203aec51.webp","destWidth":105,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1058,"destBytes":436,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=glEOnYrdaVo:Jt5_wmS0Utc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn71@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-36-381_88efdb57203aec51.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/glEOnYrdaVo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn64@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-44-57-293_bd4974c1a30eaaa1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476254},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"Consolidating Content [blog]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/ZHMje_iycCc/consolidating-content","description":"\n<p>I've been quietly expanding the type of content I've been storing under this URL, remysharp dot com, but somehow I decided not to surface it â€¦ until now ðŸŽ‰</p>\n<p>So, if you've subscribed to <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/feed.xml\">my blog via RSS</a> you'll find there's suddenly appeared a number of new, terser posts.</p>\n<h2>Introducing TIL &#38; devlog</h2>\n<p>Particularly in the current global pandemic crisis, and being stuck at home, I need somewhere to put my thoughts and the voice that bounce around (because it's keeping me up).</p>\n<p>I recently posted about how I took <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/\">Simon Willison's TIL</a> and made <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/2020/05/02/setting-up-simons-til\">it work for me</a>.

For some reason or another I decided to take a break at the start of this year (probably laziness) but they're also included in the feed and are more <em>digest'y</em> than full blog posts.</p>\n<h2>At home here too</h2>\n<p>All of this new (sort of) content has a home on this blog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://remysharp.com/archive\">The whole shebang</a> - <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/feed.xml\">dedicated RSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://remysharp.com/\">blog</a> - <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/blog.xml\">dedicated RSS (of <em>just</em> blog posts)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://remysharp.com/til\">til</a> - <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/til.xml\">dedicated RSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://remysharp.com/devlog\">devlog</a> - <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/devlog.xml\">dedicated RSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://remysharp.com/links\">links</a> - <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/links.xml\">dedicated RSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://remysharp.com/newsletters/#content\">newsletters</a> - <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/newsletters/\">email subscription</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The whole feed also has an indicator tag to show whether the type of post it is (so if you're an RSS subscriber you can skim over things like the devlog if it doesn't interest you).</p>\n<p>These entires also appear in search results on my site and on the archive pages (which now look like I've been super busy writing, which makes me feel good but isn't quite representative of the truth!).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I kind of feel like I've ruffled all the pillows in my website and sunk my butt right down to make a cozy <em>remy shaped</em> dent here.

Normally, in modern coding, I'd avoid unnecessary code execution, but with NextBASIC to get the game to run at a consistent speed, I'm making sure that each loop does roughly the same amount of work.</p>\n<p>Thus far I'm only using 8 bits of the value to indicate the status of the tomb and I need to be able to flag the tomb to say what's contained inside of it, either a scroll, a mummy, a key, a tomb or nothing at all. I could keep all this data inside a single byte, but the integers in NextBASIC as 16bit so I could also expand out to the high byte to store the value of the tomb.</p>\n<p>Meh. I prefer to be efficient, so how about this:</p>\n<pre><code>0x00-0x04=tomb contents\n0x08=tomb has been unlocked\n0x10=top\n0x20=right\n0x40=bottom\n0x80=left\n</code></pre>\n<p>This shifts around where the data is stored, but I put the wall status on the high nibble for simplicity, so that I can then do something like <code>%T = %T + INT (key)</code> and set <code>key = 3</code> somewhere as a constant (though in reality I'll stick to integer expressions).</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/devlog/go-mummy/2020-05-24\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=rUEg6gUsvUU:cykIa16Mdz4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=rUEg6gUsvUU:cykIa16Mdz4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/rUEg6gUsvUU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 24 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=rUEg6gUsvUU:cykIa16Mdz4:F7zBnMyn0Lo","linkMd5":"181d3ddd96f356de8657e05c3690cbaa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn37@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-36-397_bd1a661f5581d46b.webp","destWidth":105,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1058,"destBytes":436,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=rUEg6gUsvUU:cykIa16Mdz4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn37@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-36-397_bd1a661f5581d46b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/rUEg6gUsvUU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-58-137_5f2b5c7eed9e5a6e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476261},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"Go Mummy - 7-Jul 2020 [devlog/go-mummy]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/NpXxCAExnJc/2020-07-07","description":"<p>This most recent round of development has been dedicated to squashing out bugs and investing in performance optimisations.</p>\n<p>What's particularly fun about NextBASIC is that it's so close to the metal (as it were) - NextBASIC -&#62; interpreter -&#62; machine code - that it has a heavy hand in the code design that I work with.</p>\n<p>I'm used to JavaScript which goes through part compile, part interpreted along with a lot of JIT'ting and hot path optimisation. No such pleasantries with NextBASIC.</p>\n<p>A simple example is that in modern high level languages, I'd reduce my code reuse and refactor based on the rule that if a value or expression is used more than once, then it belongs in it's own variable or routine.</p>\n<p>Using that approach with NextBASIC comes at a cost, a cost that is immediately visible in the execution. Multiple routine calls slows down the runtime speed. Inlining code will always speed execution up (and this is also true of languages like JS).</p>\n<p>There's also the aspect of finding the absolute perfect fit of code for the problem - which again in JavaScript (or other languages) the perfect fit isn't always necessary (and sometimes discouraged and it makes it harder to read later). But this approach makes me think carefully about how the system works at it's lowest level.</p>\n<p>A recent change is that I removed all the <code>CLS</code> calls from my game. This clears the screen. But the ROM routine <a href=\"https://speccy.xyz/rom/asm/0d6b\">does a lot more</a> than &#34;just clearing the screen&#34;.</p>\n<p>Instead, now I'm writing bytes directly to the screen memory which has a near instant effect and there's no longer a wipe-and-wait delay:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-nextbasic\"><span class=\"token comment\">; bank 9-11 is the thirds of the screen memory in layer 2</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">; bank 25 contains 1/3 of a screen header</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">25</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">TO</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token comment\">; \"Oh Mummy header\"</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">ERASE</span> <span class=\"token number\">252</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token comment\">; Set the middle third to yellow</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">ERASE</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span><span class=\"token variable\">$3000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><span class=\"token number\">252</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token comment\">; REM 0-0x3000 as yellow</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">BANK</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">ERASE</span> <span class=\"token operator\">%</span><span class=\"token variable\">$3000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><span class=\"token operator\">%</span><span class=\"token variable\">$1000</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; last 4k is black</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The bugs I've been squashing have been mostly been subtle issues that (hopefully) make the difference between &#34;okay cool&#34; and &#34;oh, that's odd&#34;.</p>\n<p>Here's a fun bit of debugging to make sure the footsteps are positioned correctly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://remysharp.com/images/devlog/ohm-2020-07-07.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The most recent fix I was most proud of is a control hack.

A deep insight into clinical depression.</p>\n<p>I have to admit that in reading this book I really struggled to enjoy it - and not because it of the nature of the book, but because it felt like I was bouncing around inside of Sylvia Plath's head in a random jumbled up, non linear fashion.</p>\n<p>In fact, I'd say the first third of the book is almost entirely that. The mini stories that occur don't really finish, and as we were journeying through one recounted story, I'd find we'd quickly make a sharp turn and begin a new journey.</p>\n<p>The middle third starts to become a bit more pieced together but the book was struggling to win me over. Esther Greenwood (which I'd read earlier The Bell Jar was semi-autobiographical) wanted to kill herself. The way that this third goes on read almost childish and, for my shame, I was beginning to hope the character &#34;just get on with it&#34;.</p>\n<p>It was also that the first section of the book painted an extremely successful character and the character in the second part was very much the opposite end of the spectrum and the different was jarring and hard to consolidate (as a reader).</p>\n<p>Suffice to say, she does indeed attempt suicide. For the final third of the book she is institutionalised and undergoes therapy but also electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The ECT isn't glorified nor is it vilified which was interesting and challenging (particularly with the story being semi-autobiographical).</p>\n<p>The last third takes its time and walks gently through the journey that she takes during her institutionalised. None of this part of the book is glamourised and she doesn't make some magical recovery.</p>\n<p>It's slow, gentle and unsure. Even as Esther finally reaches her board review to see if she can leave the institution, she herself is unconvinced that anything has changed, but something is certainly at rest in her.</p>\n<p>The last part of the book definitely calls for reflection and helped to give me an insight into those who struggle with existing. There's rarely some grand purpose that drives them to death by suicide, and indeed in Esther's case there's nothing that particularly explain <em>why</em> she wanted to end her life.</p>\n<p>There's a moment with her medical supervisor where Esther says that she hates her mother. This is after their last encounter - and her mother isn't bad in the slightest, it's that her mother wants to know what she had done wrong to have not been able to help protect her daughter from these feelings. The supervisor (slash therapist) says, &#34;I believe you do&#34;. She doesn't try to sympathies or give Esther another point of view. This line surprised me, in a believable way.</p>\n<p>And as the book ends, Esther is reunited with her mother, and her mother, naively says she just wants to forget about it all and move forward from this, healthier time. To which Esther writes that her mother may want to forget and that perhaps Esther might forget those feelings:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe forgetfulness, like a kind snow, should numb and cover them. But they were part of me. They were my landscape.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having dealings with depression myself, and shock grief of the worst kind, it really doesn't go away, and it isn't forgotten. It's as Plath writes: it becomes part of your landscape.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is a hard book to read, partly for the confused start, but also the very real ending. Made harder by knowing that Sylvia Plath died by suicide the same year of this book's release.</p>\n<p>Plath described the book (to her mother) as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a pot boiler really, but I think it will show how isolated a person feels when he is suffering a breakdown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed that's the experience of the last third of the book.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/books/2020/the-bell-jar\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=az62Q5YRXys:CiT56c4GdFM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=az62Q5YRXys:CiT56c4GdFM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/az62Q5YRXys\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=az62Q5YRXys:CiT56c4GdFM:F7zBnMyn0Lo","linkMd5":"8ec1f54f55dcd8eb5579d49d3b58f623","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn91@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-36-378_980fd3b2225cca4e.webp","destWidth":105,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1058,"destBytes":436,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=az62Q5YRXys:CiT56c4GdFM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn91@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-44-36-378_980fd3b2225cca4e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/az62Q5YRXys":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn75@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-44-57-398_cb5059759fc9f9dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476248},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"\"Share the knowledge for free\" [blog]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/qJCzbmOIPso/share-the-knowledge-for-free","description":"\n<p>That title is in &#34;air quotes&#34; - just to be clear.

Or certainly not in the way I was using them.</p>\n<p>For as long as I can remember I've used <code>px</code> for my CSS fonts. I tried with <code>em</code>s and usually ran into some sizing issues (better devs than me know how to use them properly). I had a lot of success with <code>rem</code>s (not only because clearly they're named after yours trulyâ€¦not), but if you asked me yesterday how to a make a font sized at 16 pixels, I'd have said 'font-size: 16px`.</p>\n<p>If I'm honest, it's close enough and when a font size isn't <em>quite</em> right, I adjust. I tweak the font size, I tweak the line height, I tweak margins and padding until it looks right.</p>\n<p>From a fully technical and exact perspective though, I didn't know what I was talking about!</p>\n<h2>When I realised</h2>\n<p>I was trying to render tiny fonts, no larger than 8 pixels wide into a canvas, and extract the pixel data (for a ZX Spectrum project). So I unwittingly set the font size in the 2D drawing API to <code>8px</code> and ran the <code>fillText</code> method only to be faced with text that either didn't fit in the 8x8 square or was way too small.</p>\n<p>I <em>thought</em> (incorrectly) that <code>8px</code> meant the font would be 8 pixels tall. So utterly wrong.</p>\n<p>This is also compounded by the fact that when you draw on a canvas, you need to specify the X and Y coordinate of the baseline - the specification suggests X/Y is the top left corner, but this isn't the case as drawing text in a canvas draws <em>upwards</em> so with <code>x:0, y:0</code> you get nearly completely clipped text.</p>\n<p>So I would have hoped the way to get the text to render on the canvas would be to add the pixel height of the font: <code>x:0, y:8</code> but as we already know, the height of the font isn't 8 pixels.</p>\n<h2>What makes the height of a font?</h2>\n<p>I won't pretend to fully understand it (yet) but there's an <a href=\"https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align\">excellent breakdown post by Vincent De Oliveira</a> that examines how to align 100px to a font height and how it breaks up. The practical example that De Oliverira gets into is if they want to place a checkbox image aligned with the text. It's not as easy as it might first sound.</p>\n<p>Also, more practically, there is the <a href=\"https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/\">Capsize</a> project that allows you to upload a font or select an existing Google font, and the page will read in the metadata about the font and help you adjust values to get the height of the font to best suit your needs.</p>\n<p><strong>As it turns out, in a lot of cases, when I'm thinking of the <em>height</em> of a font, I'm actually thinking about the height of a capital letter, which is the ascender in font metrics.</strong></p>\n<h2>Bits of a font</h2>\n<p>In my side projects I spend a lot of time looking at binary data and parsing it in JavaScript so it made sense that I should poke around in the font to see if I could find these values myself.</p>\n<p>Thus far I've only looked at TrueType fonts. The font file is structured as so:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Header (12 bytes) - which includes the font file signature and directly after includes the 32bit table count</li>\n<li>Array of tables - each table includes: tag name (4 characters padded), checksum, file offset and length</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these small bits of information we will have an array of all the font tables that are included in the file. The tables of interests are required in the file format (according to <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/fonts//TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM06/Chap6.html#Overview\">Apple's documentation</a>) and I want to look inside the tables: <code>OS/2</code>, <code>hhea</code> and <code>head</code>.</p>\n<p>These tables can appear in any order in the file and have variable length - both depending on the tag name but also the version of the table.</p>\n<p>To extract the information out of the file, first the file is uploaded into the browser and using the <code>FileReader</code> API I'll get an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> of the bytes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">input<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function-variable function\">onchange</span> <span

the aim is to align text, then it makes sense to collect the font metric data ahead of time with a tool like <a href=\"https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/\">Capsize</a> or if that resource ever disappears I've extended the code I wrote earlier to a barebones <a href=\"https://font-size.isthe.link/\">TTF metrics extraction</a> tool.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a

A wonderful murder mystery that initially had me guessing and unsure, then around half way decided that I knew who 'dun it, and by 75% I was at a loss again.</p>\n<p>The book doesn't go deeply into word prose, but keeps the pace on who would end up under the chopping block next leaving us guessing: who, when and how!</p>\n<p>I do also wonder how much of modern day media bases it's murder mystery on Chritie's work as I could conjure up images of the characters and the scenes quite easily in my mind.</p>\n<p>Good stuff.

The process being copy the png image to an HTML5 canvas element, then extract the pixels then generate the bitmap header and arrange the image data appropriately.</p>\n<p>I've always known about indexed palettes and their existence (as an option during exporting in Photoshop) but never really knew how they worked.</p>\n<p>After rolling it by hand (without compression), it's rather obvious - though only in retrospect!</p>\n<p>Generally (apparently) 8bit and below Bitmaps will include their own palette. This (I think/imagine) is because the size of the palette (in bytes) at 16bits would be larger than the data representing the pixels, so in 16bit and above, the actual colour is in the pixel byte (I could be totally wrong, but that'll be a TIL on 16bit images!).</p>\n<p>An 8bit image (or smaller, such as 4bit) is structured thusly:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Header - contains dimensions, colour information, offsets, etc. 56 bytes.</li>\n<li>Palette - if the colour count isn't defined (i.e. 0 in the header), then this will be 4 * 256 (4 being alpha, blue, green, red - yes, in that order).</li>\n<li>The pixel bytes referencing the palette</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what's interesting is that the pixel bytes are single bytes from the range of 0-255 which is an index of the palette. The palette range can be anything with an RGBA range.</p>\n<p>A 4bit bitmap would use a &#34;nibble&#34; for the palette (and I'd expect it to be 512bytes, though I've not investigated them fully).</p>\n<p>So that's what indexed palette is. It's 1K of colour data and the actual pixel data <em>points</em> to the palette. Clever.

Most computer's memory goes up in powers of 2, 16mb, 32mb, 64mb, etc. Sure, you can sometimes have a 16mb RAM chip along side 32mb but that isn't super common.</p>\n<p>Anyway, in reading Spectrum Machine Language for the Absolute Beginner (because ... I don't really know), I came across this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The maximum memory that can be accessed [in ZX Spectrum] by this instruction is only 64K! This means that all the memory - ROM, program, display, and free memory have to fit within 64K. On a &#34;16K Spectrum&#34; there is actually 16K used by the ROM and 16K of RAM making a total of 32K.</p>\n<p>The &#34;16K&#34; refers to the RAM part only. On the &#34;48K Spectrum&#34;, the same 16K of POM is present plus 48K of RAM making a total of 64K.</p>\n<p>It is not possible therefore for the Z80 to access more memory than is available on a 48K spectrum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ZX Spectrum used a single 16K ROM IC chip (the bit that held the operating system burnt into the chip), and then a bank of 16K via 8 2K ICs and another bank of 32K via 8 4K ICs.</p>\n<p>So that's a total of 64K, 65536 bytes of &#34;memory&#34;. 16K of which is ROM and the rest, 48K, is RAM. Hence the name, that stuck with me for 30 or so years.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/til/spectrum/48k\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=0v0svzjl5Ak:M204YIvzwK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=0v0svzjl5Ak:M204YIvzwK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/0v0svzjl5Ak\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 09 Jun 2020 14:55:58 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=0v0svzjl5Ak:M204YIvzwK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo","linkMd5":"8178f025a953056d55b3f887d9e9c42e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn75@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-44-36-454_ec1e0e9b99d3a1c5.webp","destWidth":105,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1058,"destBytes":436,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=0v0svzjl5Ak:M204YIvzwK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn75@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-44-36-454_ec1e0e9b99d3a1c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/0v0svzjl5Ak":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn99@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-44-58-101_eeeb45bec43c1997.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476255},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"Go Mummy - 28-Jul 2020 [devlog/go-mummy]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/0pKw0vB68S8/2020-07-28","description":"<p>After <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/devlog/oh-mummy/2020-07-20\">last week's failure</a> in sound this week(end) was a total win over sound ðŸ’ª</p>\n<p>I knew the game played better with some audible feedback and I also knew that the only way I could pull it off in NextBASIC was to use the interrupt handler at the machine code level.

It's kind of a beautiful aspect of the P in PWA: the web sites are progressively enhanced to be available even without an internet connection.</p>\n<p>Yet browsers won't tell us so. More on that in a bit. How do we tell our visitors our sites work offline. How do we tell our visitors that they don't need an app because it's no more capable than the URL they're on right now?</p>\n<p>I've created a Github issue (by way of creating an open forum) with a call for ideas and collaboration.</p>\n<p>Please, if you're a designer, iconographer, tinkerer, please contribute your ideas: <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/works-offline/logo/issues/1\">github#works-offline/logo/issues/1</a></strong></p>\n<p>I created the issue and the repo, but this isn't mine. In fact I immediately made <a href=\"https://github.com/works-offline/logo/issues/2\">issue 2</a> to that effect. This is an effort that requires us, the makers of the web, to take matters into our own hands.</p>\n<p>Creating a visual cue to offline capability isn't a new thing and I'm certainly not the first. The most recent large waves came in the form of the <a href=\"http://offlinefirst.org/\">Offline First initiative</a> which is already over 5 years old and <a href=\"http://hood.ie/blog/say-hello-to-offline-first.html\">introduced by Hoodie</a>. I remember <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/offline-first/\">A List Apart bringing support</a> (albeit via an article) which created some great momentum.</p>\n<p>Yet we're 5 years on and our visitors still don't realise how capable our sites are. Hell, I'd call myself pretty savvy but I didn't think for a moment that <a href=\"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15\">lodash's documentation</a> would work offline until I happened upon it by accident.</p>\n<p>I want to see some way that we can show, proudly, on our own web sites that our URLs work offline. As <a href=\"https://adactio.com/links/17137\">Jeremy reminds us</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>â€¦seeing as browsers have completely dropped the ball on any kind of ambient badging, itâ€™s fair enough that we take matters into our own hands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Branding matters</h2>\n<p>HTML. Web 2.0. Ajax. RSS. HTML5. PWA.</p>\n<p>These are â€¦ &#34;words&#34; that meaning to a select few individuals, and yet are recognised by a broad range of every day people.</p>\n<p>Some of these have <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/html/logo/faq.html\">logos</a> <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application\">attached</a> to their ideas.</p>\n<p>But these are all examples of technical terms making it out into the wider world and becoming brand ambassadors for technical progress and innovation.</p>\n<p>Branding is incredibly powerful, as anyone hired to build an &#34;HTML5 web app&#34; knowing full well there may not actually be any &#34;HTML5&#34; in the resulting software. The exact definition doesn't matter. What matters is the hook.</p>\n<p>Often we just need a word to lean on to help people grasp the idea and run.</p>\n<p>What's also interesting is that a lot of these terms have a commonality that they don't mean just one thing. Just as &#34;XMLHttpRequest is only part of the Ajax equation&#34; as <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180822143943/https://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/ajax-new-approach-web-applications/\">explained by Jessie James Garret</a> and as PWA doesn't <a href=\"https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/\">just mean &#34;service worker&#34;</a> (though technically without service workers there is no PWA).</p>\n<p>Likewise, &#34;works offline&#34; does not mean it has to satisfy a specific tick list. It's an idea, one that the makers of the web need to impress upon the world.</p>\n<h2>What does &#34;works offline&#34; mean?</h2>\n<p>I tried to spread the request for help via Reddit (a web site I very, very rarely visit) and one individual raised an interesting and valuable question (though it was phrased as a counter point): <em>isn't this just saving a cached copy?</em></p>\n<p>This is what we need to overcome with our software. For a site to work offline, is so much more, so much richer than the saved bones of an HTML page.</p>\n<p>The reality, today in fact, is that with the service worker capability we can deliver the same offline experience as many appstore installed mobile apps. At a fraction of the cost.</p>\n<h2>Is working offline the same as installable?</h2>\n<p>The short answer, as you know, is no. But installable isn't better than &#34;works offline&#34;. I've installed many applications from the app stores that I found out the hard way flat out didn't work without an internet connection (usually on my travels off of my home cellular network).</p>\n<p>Yet if I install software from the app store I expect it to work offline.</p>\n<p>If I visit a web site, I never expect it to work offline.</p>\n<p>What if you could tell me, when I visited your web site, that it worked offline.</p>\n<p>Absolutely yes, the browsers should provide badging. They <em>could</em> track if new entries were made to the origin's cache, and they could run a routed request for the URL I visited (stopping it from hitting the network layer preventing a double request if there wasn't middleware offline routing in place).</p>\n<p>Yet there's no indication that will come from browsers in the short term. So how about <a href=\"https://github.com/works-offline/logo/issues/1\">we do it ourselves</a>?</p>\n<p>The same way RSS went. How did you know a web site offered a feed of their content (before RSS was baked into browsersâ€¦or even after they all removed it)?

Why did we select jQuery over Prototype, or Prototype over Mootools, or Vue over React, or Angular over Ember, or Lodash over underscore and so on a forever for unlimited combinations for unlimited dependencies.</p>\n<p>My own process is internal and so fast that I'll often have arrived at my decision with what might appear as no thought. But this isn't so, and I thought it was about time I document some of my own process, least of all to allow myself to review it and adjust over time.</p>\n<h2>Types of dependency</h2>\n<p>When I'm looking for new dependencies I'm usually in one of two mindsets: looking for a framework level project or looking for a specific solution (a plugin, mini library, or the like). This also factors into what I consider important when I'm reviewing the options.</p>\n<p>What follows is a list that is generally in priority order when I'm considering a new dependency for my project.</p>\n<h2>1. Is the project actively maintained?</h2>\n<p>This is particularly important for smaller projects as they'll usually have a single individual working on the code. It's far from a deal breaker to visit an idle repository but I also need to consider the potential inherited technical dept from a new dependency.</p>\n<p>Two data points I'll look at are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recency of commit activity - usually a scan over github's project landing page does the job here</li>\n<li>Age of any open pull requests - long held pull requests that have no activity on them might suggest the maintainer isn't around (I've certainly been this person with nodemon in the past).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Is the project used?</h2>\n<p>Popularity isn't a decider for me, but it does mean that the more the software is used, the more that bugs are found in the wild.</p>\n<p>In this case, I'm looking at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total issues</li>\n<li>Open issues - high open issues is not a negative factor</li>\n<li>Number of closed issues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The speed in which the issues are closed, for me, isn't particularly important, particularly with a project that gets a lot of issues - what matters is that there's discussion going on.</p>\n<h2>3. Full depth of dependencies</h2>\n<p>In the land of Node and npm there's a running joke that the heaviest object in the universe, beyond the Sun, a neutron star and even beyond a black hole is: <code>node_modules</code>.</p>\n<p>This is a huge area of risk that somehow we web devs just take on the chin, thank goodness Deno is coming to the scene (Deno tries to solve by providing a stdlib which causes the dependency graph to stop spreading).</p>\n<p>So importantly this is not the count of dependencies (that you might see on sites like npmjs), but the full depth. Oddly I've only seen this available on <a href=\"http://Snyk.io\">Snyk.io</a> - ie. <a href=\"https://snyk.io/test/npm/nodemon?tab=dependencies\">nodemon's dependencies</a></p>\n<h2>4. Supply of live examples</h2>\n<p>Relevant to client side libraries, I want to see working interactive examples of the code running and be able to see enough of the code to recreate the demo myself.</p>\n<p>This offers immediate insight into answering the question: <em>&#34;does this do what I want&#34;</em>.</p>\n<h2>5. Documentation and complexity</h2>\n<p>Secondary to actually seeing code is, for me, documentation. Smaller projects I would expect to see example code in the readme document. Larger projects I'd hope to find multiple pages dedicated to docs.</p>\n<p>When I look at documents I'm looking for the starting examples and specifically asking: <em>does this require some additional build tools?</em></p>\n<p>Many projects I've come across have assumptions in the documentation, and the level of those assumptions add to complexity, particularly if I'm not familiar with the systems the project is referring to.</p>\n<p>For example, for me personally, nearly every Python project I've come across assumes knowledge of how to install a dependency - which I fall into the category of not being able to.</p>\n<h2>6. Version numbers</h2>\n<p>If a project isn't using semver this tends to be a red flag as there's a good amount of information that can be ascertained from a version number.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">semver</a> uses major versions as an indicator of a breaking change, minor versions as a feature change and patch versions as bug fixes.</p>\n<p>There's a grey area that lives around documentation and refactoring (when the API remains exactly the same, but the inner workings are different, you have to release, but this doesn't align to any semver change).</p>\n<p>However, a high major version suggests high frequency of breaking changes - possibly risk to my project maintenance.</p>\n<p>A high minor number (such as Snyk's command line tool, currently at 1.323.0) suggests <em>lots</em> of features, possible a new release per feature.</p>\n<p>A high patch suggests, to me, stability and running in maintenance mode.</p>\n<h2>7. Age</h2>\n<p>This would be ageism in &#34;real life&#34; but in software project age can tell some important stories.</p>\n<p>An &#34;old&#34; project shows potential maturity or might even be a potential early signs of abandonment. What is old? If Node is 11 years old (in 2020) then anything around the decade mark is pretty old.</p>\n<p>I'd generally avoid an extremely young project (months old).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A lot of this advice goes a long way towards: should the dependencies be created and owned by the project I'm working on?</p>\n<p>This is a question I tend to always ask myself, and if the specific problem I'm trying to solve is distinct enough, I might even pull the code in, copy in the license and a citation for the source and have it as a completely frozen dependency.</p>\n<p>If you're a web developer are there any other things you look for in your own auditing process?</p>\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://remysharp.com/2020/05/20/picking-dependencies\">Remy Sharp's b:log</a></em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?a=ztJ25w9OPdU:yJWq6IX4_Dg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=ztJ25w9OPdU:yJWq6IX4_Dg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/ztJ25w9OPdU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 20 May 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":3792,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=ztJ25w9OPdU:yJWq6IX4_Dg:F7zBnMyn0Lo","linkMd5":"e9052c196417e7dd5d8e55c488369db5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn60@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-37-202_c90eb80332136da0.webp","destWidth":105,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":1058,"destBytes":436,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/remysharp?i=ztJ25w9OPdU:yJWq6IX4_Dg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn60@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-44-37-202_c90eb80332136da0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/remysharp/~4/ztJ25w9OPdU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-44-57-308_57c25d932e945e1d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305476262},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:44:36","title":"Debugging shell scripts [til/cli]","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/remysharp/~3/HWXCds7RANw/debugging-shell-scripts","description":"\n<p>I use shell scripts a lot when I find I've got a repetitive and long command to run on the command line.
