Her last two solo albums, <em>BEYONCÉ</em> (2013) and <em>Lemonade</em> (2016), were instant classics of the contemporary Black canon; her landmark 2019 concert film and live album <em>Homecoming</em> capped off a decade of breathless creative and commercial ascent and skillfully reframed her entire discography within the context of Black music&#8217;s rich history. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways, &#8220;Black Parade,&#8221; the surprise single Beyoncé released on the night of Juneteenth, is a consistent extension of <em>Homecoming</em> and auxiliary projects <em>EVERYTHING IS LOVE</em> (2018) and <em>The Lion King: The Gift</em> (2019), where celebrating Blackness and Black sounds were main concerns. But, here, everything is better. Her vocal is an elastic, shapeshifting thing that deftly switches between different flows and melodies. Her music is swelling, polyrhythmic, and lovely, anchored somewhere between the HBCU marching band tradition of <em>Homecoming</em> and the thrilling diasporic sounds of <em>The Gift</em>. Her words are sharp and vibrant and continue to tell stories of community, self-love, spirituality and powerfully affirm that the color of her skin is the source of her worth.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-43020\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, &#8220;Black Parade&#8221; is attuned to our moment in history and arises as a song of protest. Though it shines with solidarity, it simmers with a palpable anger.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"su-quote su-quote-style-default su-quote-has-cite\"><div class=\"su-quote-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">Trust me, they gon&#8217; need an army (Ah) <br>Rubber bullets bouncin&#8217; off me (Ah) <br>Made a picket sign off your picket fence (Ah) <br>Take it as a warning (Ah, ah)<span class=\"su-quote-cite\"><a href=\"https://genius.com/Beyonce-black-parade-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\">Beyoncé, 'Black Parade'</a></span></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/black-parade/1519555113?i=1519555424\"></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2qzUpSVI4NnPyWxbXwumTj\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 20:05:46 +0000","feedId":13285,"bgimg":"https://danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/beyonce-black-parade-9019698.jpg","linkMd5":"8695bb351c69129def335a1020fdd0f1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"Daniel Tovar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/beyonce-black-parade-9019698.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322592888},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","title":"CrasH Talk by ScHoolboy Q","link":"http://ci02457015500027c1","description":"<img src=\"\" class=\"attachment-small size-small wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" /><figure><img src='https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7483396-9861967.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"7483396-9861967\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p><span class=\"su-dropcap su-dropcap-style-flat\" style=\"font-size:2.5em\">A</span>fter the breakthrough of <em>Section.80</em>, 2012 was definitely the year of the Black Hippy crew, with the excellent releases of Ab-Soul’s <em>Control System</em>, Kendrick Lamar’s <em>good kid, m.A.A.d. city</em> and ScHoolboy Q’s <em>Habits &#38; Contradictions</em>. Each rapper was so different in voice, flow and subject matter that it was fun for me to conceptualize them: Jay Rock as the gangsta, Ab-Soul as the intellectual, Kendrick Lamar as speaker for generation Y (or maybe just “human motherfucking being over dope-ass instrumentation”) and ScHoolboy Q as party animal. As the decade progressed, some of these have dropped off, especially in the case of Ab-Soul who failed to capitalize on the heady wordplay demonstrated on songs like “Terrorist Threats” or “ILLuminate” or even the (ahem) soulful “The Book of Soul.” Meanwhile, Jay Rock has yet to deliver a full-length that demands attention all the way through. ScHoolboy Q, who I would’ve argued was potentially the least interesting of these four from a rapping perspective back in 2014, has only proven himself again and again. 2014’s <em>Oxymoron</em>, his major record debut, had a lot of songs that were a (successful) bid to go big: “Collard Greens,” “What They Want,” “Hell of a Night,” “Man of the Year,” but it also had some of his most interesting beats (ie. “Studio,” the sex joint that’s way too dark to function as such) and rapping yet (ie. “Prescription / Oxymoron”). <span id=\"more-19168\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Blank Face LP</em> followed, and despite the popular and critical response, it still feels underrated. Like <em>Habits &#38; Contradictions</em>, <em>Blank Face</em> was just an almost filler-free affair (impressive, since it ran 17 tracks) of varied nightmare grooves that effortlessly merged the west coast of the 1990s (features like E-40, Tha Dogg Pound and Jadakiss over beats that sounded like Dr. Dre circa <em>The Chronic</em>) and of the 2010s (features like Anderson .Paak and Vince Staples over a stacked production roster). For comparison, just the year before, the Game released a two-part project in <em>The Documentary 2</em> and <em>2.5</em> that ran a combined 150 minutes that tried to do the same thing (ie. by featuring members of the Black Hippy crew as well as N.W.A. rappers) and failed in comparison.</p>\n<p>At 14 songs clocking in at under 40 minutes, ScHoolboy Q’s latest album is notably more concise than his previous albums, and the nightmare grooves &#8211; what really attracted me to Q in the first place, as he rapped over ‘esoteric’ samples like Genesis or Portishead or a Kid Cudi cover performed live by Lissie &#8211; don’t come out to play given the short lengths (more than half of them don’t breach the 3-minute mark). From a structural standpoint, a lot of these songs are hook-verse-hook-end (“Gang Gang,” “Dangerous,” “Attention”), and given how annoying some of these hooks are, I wish he went for broke and just did a revolving door of quick verses over loose beats and let a groove build itself naturally from there. <em>Madvillainy</em>’s the gold standard, but I’m also thinking about albums like Mos Def’s <em>The Ecstatic</em> or ,more recently, Earl Sweatshirt’s <em>Some Rap Songs</em>. It’s not like he really gave much thought into sequencing: “Gang Gang” just ends and “Tales” begins.</p>\n<p>Production is handled mostly by the people responsible for helping Kendrick Lamar find a more mainstream-ready sound in both <em>DAMN.</em> and the <em>Black Panther</em> soundtrack: DJ Dahi, Sounwave and Cardo handle the bulk of beats here, with additional help from ScHoolboy staples Nez &#38; Rio, plus the venerable Boi-1da and Jake One. Except the results are less <em>DAMN.</em> and more <em>Redemption</em>, the Jay Rock album from last year that everyone has already forgotten. Second single “Chopstix” is cut from the same clothe as that album’s “WIN,” which is to say a deadly-lazy hook (in this case, chopping up Travis Scott singing “chopsticks” over and over), and the comparison makes sense when you realize that Kendrick Lamar was involved with both, which you soon realize <em>doesn’t make sense</em>.</p>\n<p>(Not helping is ScHoolboy insisting that he’ll “Beat the pussy up, stab at it” which gives me flashbacks to his unnecessary contribution on Tinashe’s “2 On.”)</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Kendrick Lamar has his hand on a few writing credits here, but neglects to show up for a proper feature. Not necessarily a bad thing: sure, his feature on “Blessed” remains one of my favorite verses by him, and I found his verse on “Collard Greens” to be pure fun, but <em>Blank Face LP</em> managed fine without him, outsourcing instead to the contemporary Vince Staples and Anderson .Paak as well as Kanye West still in <em>The Life of Pablo</em> mode, in addition to the others that I’ve already talked to. On <em>CrasH Talk</em>? We get Travis Scott doing nothing interesting and 6LACK in a ‘blink and you’ll miss it’ feature on “Drunk.” Neither Ty Dolla Sign and Kid Cudi get to indulge in the autotuned soul that they’re renown for (you wouldn’t even know it was them on “Lies” and “Dangerous” as opposed to any random b-lister). Sure, 21 Savage and Lil Baby provide some of the best verses on the album, but it’s too little, too late (and not just because both “Floating” and “Water” have hooks almost as lazy as “CHopstix”); at this point, why not call on Kung Fu Kenny?</p>\n<p>Some of the beats aren’t so easy to write off, and even “CHopstix,” which the world collectively decided was a brick, has DJ Dahi playing around with synths pretending to be a small string quartet that I wish was talked about more than the nonsense hook that feels like it was written in a cheap Chinese restaurant at 3 AM. Elsewhere, “Drunk” &#8211; produced by Dahi and Sounwave &#8211; features a ghostly piano figure that makes you worried about ScHoolboy Q trying to convince you that he “ain’t really drunk” (especially when the verse goes “Why my grandma couldn’t live? Gone way too fast / Cousin murdered in the field, gone way too fast”). But for the most part, they’re spare and simple to the point of genericism, and ScHoolboy Q, hardly a rapper’s rapper, doesn’t do enough heavy-lifting to detract, although there are obvious exceptions: “Your tax bracket ain’t impressive / You buy a chain, but won’t buy no land / That hashtag should say ‘desperate’” on “CrasH” had me do a double take, and lead single “Numb Numb Juice” crams multiple flow switches into a track that isn’t even two minutes in length.</p>\n<p>I think back to <em>Oxymoron</em>, an album which I found hard to like at first but slowly got won over because Q managed to brighten up his dark hedonism enough for the mainstream without losing that darkness. <em>CrasH Talk</em> is the album that we could’ve gotten instead, an album with features that feel decreed by labelheads because they’re hot at the time (sure, <em>Oxymoron</em> had the 2 Chainz verse that all hip-hop releases in 2014 had, but it also had the Black Hippy members, Raekwon and Tyler, the Creator). Maybe it’s not unexpected: after working so hard for years, he’s made it to the point that he’s “getting praises from Jay (Z),” so he did what many, many musicians eventually do: he went on autopilot.</p>\n<p><strong>C PLUS</strong></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 12:06:12 +0000","feedId":13285,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f08dcca833b8d50ebd378d7e38c1833a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"marshall-gu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7483396-9861967.jpg?w=1220&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322592890},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","title":"A Long Red Hot Los Angeles Summer Night by Blu & Oh No","link":"http://ci0241667fc0002494","description":"<img src=\"\" class=\"attachment-small size-small wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" /><figure><img src='https://i0.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/7383155-8314802.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"7383155-8314802\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p><span class=\"su-dropcap su-dropcap-style-flat\" style=\"font-size:2.5em\">L</span>ike many other traditionalists, Blu is guilty of being born in the wrong decade, although perhaps ‘traditionalist’ sells the underground rapper short. To wit, 2011’s <em>NoYork!</em> was one of the most exciting left-turns in hip-hop this decade, finding Blu rapping over glitchy beats from Flying Lotus and Knxwledge. In a way, <em>NoYork!</em> predicted Mac Miller’s <em>Watching Movies with the Sound Off</em> or Flying Lotus’ alter-ego Captain Murphy’s <em>Duality</em>, to say nothing that four years later, Kendrick Lamar would hook up with those producers on <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>. No, Blu’s biggest fault is his defiance: after creating his own <em>Blueprint</em> on breakthrough <em>Below the Heavens</em>, his discography has been almost impossible to follow, with feints (the Madlib-produced <em>UCLA</em> that Madlib denies being involved in), and jabs when they should’ve been uppercuts (releasing proper follow-up <em>Give Me My Flowers While I Can Sell Them</em> unmastered on bandcamp or leaking <em>NoYork!</em> himself). <span id=\"more-17\"></span></p>\n<p>In a way, <em>A Long Red Hot Los Angeles Summer Night</em> – produced entirely by Oh No – feels like Blu’s first ‘major’ release since <em>Give Me My Flowers</em> or <em>NoYork!</em>. There was, of course, the Madlib-produced <em>Bad Neighbor</em>, which would’ve been much better if Madlib’s beats were a little sharper and if Blu didn’t share microphone time with non-entity MED (be sure to listen to “The Strip,” which features a pre-famous Anderson .Paak), as well as a slew of EPs, notably <em>Titans in the Flesh</em>produced by Nottz. But Oh No – Madlib’s younger brother – carries more weight than the French production duo Union Analogtronics, who handled 2016’s <em>Cheetah in the City</em> which was mostly forgettable, and one wonders how much better the project would’ve been if Blu hadn’t stretched himself thin with all the EPs earlier that year.</p>\n<p>Blu practically announces as much, and he hasn’t sounded this hungry since his breakthrough. On the first proper song, “The Lost Angels Anthem,” he plays around with the same word and/or syllable in a loose stream of consciousness that might not <em>mean</em> anything (ie. “I bust back rapidly, raps wrap packages / Ship pack in the clip, gift-wrap rap packages / Stadium packed, packed bag”), but despite the speed, Blu enunciates each word more clearly than he has in years.</p>\n<p>Most of the songs are short, bringing to mind a famous album by Oh No’s brother, but sequenced more carefully: there’s a loose narrative throughout, culminating in Blu being sent to jail and listening to his new inmates (as guest rappers) on posse cut “Jail Cypher” before being released on closer “Fresh Out”; Tri State’s opening line on “The Robbery” makes me think of Kendrick Lamar’s “good kid” (“The first thing’s first…where you from?”) and the narrative of the actual act recalls Lamar’s “The Art of Peer Pressure.”</p>\n<p>Alas, Blu and the various features here don’t have the talent to really drive the narrative; I’m just picturing what Ghostface Killah circa 1993-2000 would’ve done over these beats! And what results is a collection of mostly fine raps and beats tied loosely together. Mostly fine: the hook of “Pop Shots” is pretty lame, and Tri State hands in a few groaners on “The Robbery” (“So take it off slow…run the jewels / Not the rap group, nah, I mean chains and shoes”; “No Mask Off, I see the Future”), and while the first verse is loaded with internal rhymes, the flow itself is quite choppy. Ca$hus King, previously known as Co$$ and who had worked with Blu on <em>NoYork!</em> does better, especially when Blu makes room for his knottier (albeit brief) flows on “Liquor Store.”</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I came to <em>A Long Red Hot Los Angeles Summer Night</em>because the vibrant cover and because I’ve been a fan of Blu for a decade now, despite the fact that his aforementioned output sometimes makes it hard. But I stay for Oh No’s beats: the cinematic elements of &#8220;It Never Rains in South L.A.&#8221;, the keyboard climbs through “Straight No Chaser” (despite another annoying hook, which this time sounds grafted in) and the triumphant horn line (linked by jazzier ones) on “Made the Call.” Some of my favorite beats are on the short ones: the minor key detective fiction drama of “Stalkers”; the sad backdrop where Blu details the charges on “Facing Time,” replete with soulful vocals and dusty guitars”; the appropriately sunny horns on closer “Fresh Out” once he leaves prison.</p>\n<p>It’ll take a better rapper than Blu to create a concept album with <em>Madvillainy</em>-style beats (I’m picturing Danny Brown or Freddie Gibbs), but Oh No’s beats and the ambition here still result in Blu’s best album in years.</p>\n<p><strong>B PLUS</strong></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 09 Mar 2019 12:06:18 +0000","feedId":13285,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"bab05bde5a07e5d1bfc3f0fb4b3dddf7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"marshall-gu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/7383155-8314802.jpg?w=1220&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322592890},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","title":"Remember When: Pop Music Felt Simpler And Happier","link":"http://ci0243149880002711","description":"<img src=\"\" class=\"attachment-small size-small wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" /><p>I go to tons of concerts and understand that most tend to veer on the positive side. An act fulfilling their musical dreams in front of a crowd who loves them for it &#8211; there are few other experiences which feel so communally enjoyable. As with everything, some do this better than others, and singer Jess Glynne did so at LA’s Wiltern Theatre. Admittedly, when a friend invited me along to the show, I worried she wouldn’t be all that thrilling.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Jess Glynne, the material is positive and extremely accessible. Her song titles make their meanings more than obvious, and their gospel qualities ensure that they will bang but not necessarily bite. She’s not known for expansive choreography and a Justice-style laser light show never seemed like an option either. Instead of focusing on her better qualities such as her voice or honesty, I concerned myself with possible shortcomings. I soon learned what a miscalculation I had made. I love an intricate, thought-provoking performance a la FKA Twigs as much as the next person, but sometimes it refreshes the soul to watch a bit of no-nonsense, feel-good music. <span id=\"more-13\"></span></p>\n<p>Vocalist Abir served as the night’s opener, joined by a guitarist, keyboardist, and trumpeter. As Glynne would do later in the evening, Abir relied on vocal prowess to impress the audience.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='1220' height='687' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8PRJu3rzyo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>“I really had no one to look up to as a Muslim girl,” she shared with the audience before finishing off with “Young &#38; Rude”. This track was probably about as “negative” as this evening ever got, but its overall feelings of rebellion and individuality resonated with the generally optimistic atmosphere. The moment Abir finished her set, “Tears Dry On Their Own” began playing through the venue. Since the song failed to match the cheerful mood, sound engineers cut it off before Winehouse even finished her first verse. As I said before, this night was <em>all </em>about good vibes.</p>\n<p>Armed with a husky yet caramel-sweet voice Americans like me <em>roll in the deep</em> over, Glynne needed little else to charm the crowd. Her slight rasp lent her a relatable quality; her outfit, a onesie that, with her red locks, only made me see <em>Herbie Fully Loaded</em>, suited her without elevating her too high from us plebeians. Basically, Glynne presented herself more like a friend at a jam session than a pop star headlining a concert.</p>\n<p>This lent itself nicely to the <em>Always in Between</em> tour, an experience centered on the basic tenets of pop music. Starting the night on the right foot, Glynne launched into “Hold My Hand”. From the moment she started, the crowd just <em>sang</em> right along with her. Songs like “Far To Go”, “These Days”, and “123” are perfect singalongs because not only are they quite gospel-esque but they also display an honest and straightforward look at life’s better emotions.</p>\n<figure><img src='https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dsc_0376-2-9782253.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"dsc_0376-2-9782253\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p>At many points in the evening, Glynne took the time to feature her backing singers and bandmates. Her vocalists left their section and joined her for a simple yet fun bit of choreo at the head of the stage; meanwhile, guitarists sidled up between them to join them in the fun. As Glynne swayed and laughed, so did the crowd.</p>\n<p>None of the performance felt especially fresh, but that largely played into its success. The vocals sounded great, especially Glynne’s mic control on “Take Me Home” where she echoed her voice for a beautiful effect. Basic lights illuminated the stage, yet combinations of turquoise and orange or red and purple melded together so well that the effect still dazzled.</p>\n<p>Even Glynne’s banter hit all the expected notes. “I always take a moment to say thank you. I wouldn’t be where I am without you,” is something you hear at 95% of shows, though I cared little because <em>Always in Between</em> never pretended to be something other than it was: a pop concert.</p>\n<figure>\n<p><img src='https://i0.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/img_2080-2-6194314.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"img_2080-2-6194314\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p>Pop shows give the fans what they want, and Glynne mashing up “So Real”, “Real Love”, and “My Love” was <em>exactly</em> what the girls and gays at this show wanted. Ever a gracious performer, she used this to segue into the massive and inescapable “Rather Be”, sending the audience over the edge of joy and into glory. While most interpretations of “Rather Be” see Glynne singing to a love interest, at the Wiltern it felt as if she was singing to her fans. The eventual finale with “Never Be Alone Again” happened as what I assumed to be a polyamorous relationship of 5+ people embraced in front of me. After all, communal love is just as real as any other kind.</p>\n<p>In the end, I realized this concert offered a nice release from the menace of Billie Eilish or the utter sorrow of Lana del Rey. As <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2018/05/16/sadness-in-pop-music-study\">the world of pop</a> and the world at large continue to become darker and sadder, Jess Glynne delivered a jolt of serotonin the old-fashioned way &#8211; with strong vocals, accessibility, and a chance to escape. I never forgot that live music could do that for you, but I had forgotten that one can achieve the same results with a bit of “sacred simplicity.”</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 18:47:25 +0000","feedId":13285,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"64584ae14d9df237fac48ed206014087","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"mick-jacobs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dsc_0376-2-9782253.jpg?w=1220&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://i0.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/img_2080-2-6194314.jpg?w=1220&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322592890},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","title":"Let’s Try the After Vol. 2 by Broken Social Scene","link":"http://ci0244c9cc60002562","description":"<img src=\"\" class=\"attachment-small size-small wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" /><figure><img src='https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7438100-7150067.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"7438100-7150067\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p><span class=\"su-dropcap su-dropcap-style-flat\" style=\"font-size:2.5em\">A</span>s a Canadian, and specifically, as a Canadian that was in university during indie rock’s last gasp (2009-2012, the years of Animal Collective, Phoenix and M83, among others), Broken Social Scene was pretty much everywhere. And what’s particularly interesting about Broken Social Scene is that their early work, from K.C. Accidental’s debut album through breakthrough <em>You Forgot It In People</em>, is that they sounded unique despite co-founder Kevin Drew’s rather non-descript voice. They are, of course, a collective, and their early music sounded like that: <em>You Forgot It In People</em> contained post-rock climaxes (“KC Accidental”), touching ballads (“Lover’s Spit,” “I’m Still Your Fag”), anthemic rock songs (“Almost Crimes,” “Cause = Time”), and the indescribable “Anthems For a Seventeen Year-Old Girl,” the most unlikely of songs to act as an album centerpiece or would come to remain their most treasured song. I like their self-titled album quite a bit, but what made <em>You Forgot It In People</em> special in the indie market got traded for a more stream-lined approach, with more ‘proper’ songs and less instrumentals, and they sounded less like a collective and more like Kevin Drew and friends, and this continued through to <em>Forgiveness Rock Record</em>. <span id=\"more-11\"></span></p>\n<p>It took them seven years to follow-up on that album, but <em>Hug of Thunder</em> was as good as a Broken Social Scene album could be in 2017. So many hooks! “You say we’re halfway home.” “You’re never gonna be that word.” “The hours, the minutes, the seconds.” And “Hug of Thunder” &#8211; the title track &#8211; might very well be their best song since “Anthems For a Seventeen Year-Old Girl,” with its airy melody hanging over the heavy bass notes and the second half that achieves the sweetness and <em>sound</em> promised by the title. With each of their albums since <em>You Forgot It In People</em> came with a companion piece, so you could hear the more touching voice of Feist over “Lover’s Spit” hangover chords on the clever-titled <em>Bee Hives</em> or a faster take on “Major Label Debut” on <em>EP To Be You and Me</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Let’s Try the After</em> is broken out into 2 releases, which suggests a wealth of material written during the seven years between <em>Forgiveness Rock Record</em> and <em>Hug of Thunder</em>, and like the previous volume released in February, this starts with an instrumental and contains four songs. Like their previous EPs, you’d be hard-pressed to say anyone <em>needs</em> this stuff. Single “Can’t Find My Heart” is Broken Social Scene in full anthem mode, but it’s not exactly a replacement for “Halfway Home.” You could probably swap this in for one of the weaker songs from <em>Hug of Thunder</em>’s second half.</p>\n<p>“200 Couches” follows, the shortest song here that sees Kevin Drew ‘experimenting’ with auto-tune, except it’s less an ‘experiment’ and more a typical Broken Social Scene streetcar-ride tune with the tool switched on. Auto-tune has its uses, and I think of Sufjan Stevens on <em>The Age of Adz</em> or even Dave Longstreth on “Keep Your Name,” which let these artists digitally remove the ‘human’ component of their voices and, paradoxically, were able to yield more emotional results (obviously, inspired by Kanye’s <em>808s and Heartbreak</em>). Kevin Drew doesn’t have Kanye West or Sufjan Stevens’ skill or emotional depth, nor is there a backstory here that made “Keep Your Name” interesting. It’s just the same old hat with auto-tune, and the lyrics are the same nonsense of “Can’t Find My Heart”: “So where’d you go”’s hook becomes “Where did you go?”</p>\n<p>Kevin Drew’s also a renown potty-mouth, from the “I’m Still Your Fag”’s urine-drinking to “It’s All Gonna Break” or “Me and My Hand,” and it’s long past the point of poignancy to the point of ridiculous: he drops “Who the fuck can climb this?” and “Tomorrow’s kind of a bitch / The kind of bitch you can’t believe” on the EP’s best song &#8211; the title song &#8211; and neither hold nearly as much power as they could given how often he runs his mouth off. (Oh yeah, Kevin Drew sings lead on all of these: not a single lead from Feist or Ariel Engle.) Shame, because foggy backdrop of “Let’s Try the After” is more of that hangover music that I think this band does so well. And the last song, with its notably heavy, synth-y bass, feels like a dry-run for <em>Hug of Thunder</em> closer “Mouth Guards of the Apocalypse.” Ultimately, since it took them 7 years to follow-up their last album, both of the <em>Let’s Try the After</em> EPs function, at the very least, as a stop-gap until their next one.</p>\n<p><strong>B MINUS</strong></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 14:54:01 +0000","feedId":13285,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1d17a0784ee1e078548505a220809c78","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"marshall-gu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7438100-7150067.jpg?w=1220&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322592890},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","title":"The Black Album by Weezer","link":"http://ci0240a12df000279d","description":"<img src=\"\" class=\"attachment-small size-small wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" /><figure><img src='https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/7243264-3275569.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"7243264-3275569\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p><span class=\"su-dropcap su-dropcap-style-flat\" style=\"font-size:2.5em\">S</span>o, I mean, this album isn’t dark. Like at all. There is a histrionic song about cake. And it starts with “doo doo doo doo’s”. It has almost the exact same riff as “Beautiful” by Moby, a song I almost guarantee you have never heard. The song is called “Piece of Cake” and it’s about a specific woman’s ability to break Rivers’ heart and drugs inability to change that. It’s also about the popular soft drink Sprite, or something. Its many things, but it isn’t dark. <span id=\"more-19\"></span></p>\n<p>There is also an electropop song about living in one of the most expensive cities in America. It’s called “Living in LA” and it was released as an advance single. It sounds like a Tesla wrote it. It’s a misfire, it’s a well-produced mess, but its not dark. Isn’t that the whole point of the record? The White record was supposed to be poppy and this was supposed to be the bad ass Prince funky record?</p>\n<p>There is also a song called “I’m Just Being Honest.” It sounds like if Dashboard Confessional wrote a poem and the Fray set it to music with help from Keane. There are more “doo doo doo doo’s” (the Prince Who Wanted Everything). There is the greatest pop rock song for serious fans of the Walking Dead (Zombie Bastards). There is also a song that sounds like Of Montreal wrote it in an attempt to get a Portugal the Man crossover hit (Byzantine).</p>\n<p>There is also a song called “High As a Kite” and it is incredible. Casual piano tinkering makes way for a perfect pop verse. The strolling instrumentation paired with a classic chord progression makes way for a huge Weezer chorus. The lyrics are sad but with a pinch of irony where previous records have added a gallon. There is a video of the song where they are kind of Mr. Rogers and the audience dislikes their attitudes and set destruction. The chorus soars effortlessly like Pork and Beans but without the studio effort. I can’t stress enough how satisfactory this song will be to classic Weezer fans.</p>\n<p>There is also a song called “California Snow” and it is a midlife crisis in three and a half minutes. It will be HARD for Rivers to claim he isn’t rapping in it. The production is painfully top 40. Just casually saying “Worst song in Weezer’s discography” is saying A LOT considering they did a track with Lil Wayne that I actually don’t necessarily hate. I could explain why its so awful but please, take a listen, enjoy.</p>\n<p>This is the most disjointed record in Weezer’s discography. Its probably not the worst but its right there with Raditude and Make Believe.</p>\n<p><strong>B</strong></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":13285,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ac7b3bdc797173a52cf587f9da20003e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"landon-macdonald","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/7243264-3275569.jpg?w=1220&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322592890},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","title":"Flamagra by Flying Lotus: Review","link":"http://ci0247b6d3b0002481","description":"<img src=\"\" class=\"attachment-small size-small wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" /><figure><img src='https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/7481577-6651150.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"7481577-6651150\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p><span class=\"su-dropcap su-dropcap-style-flat\" style=\"font-size:2.5em\">F</span>lying Lotus lays serious claim to one of the greatest musicians of the 2010s, and you could reasonably argue that any of his albums are his <em>magnum opus</em>: the glitchy <em>Los Angeles</em> released before the new decade, the psychedelic journey through digitized space of <em>Cosmogramma</em>, <em>You’re Dead!</em> seemed to update 70s’ jazz fusion into the modern era. (I’m team <em>Cosmogramma</em>, personally.) On records like these, he showed that different genres could, not just live side-by-side with one another, but very easily be blended together; I think about the seemingly non-jokey scat-intro of “Do the Astral Plane” as the best example. Also, as grand-nephew of Alice Coltrane, his glitchy beats have gotten jazzier over-time, from enlisting Ravi Coltrane (John Coltrane’s son) on <em>Cosmogramma</em> to the venerable Herbie Hancock on <em>You’re Dead!</em>. It’s all gotten to the point where he defies easy genre capsulation. And that’s without mentioning his other projects, from mentoring Thundercat (he helps produce much of Thundercat’s discography) to his Odd Future-influenced alter-ego Captain Murphy to loose beats here and there, including the opening track to Kendrick Lamar’s <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>. As far as I’m concerned, Flying Lotus’ hyper-digital realizations of J Dilla soul and Madlib’s wonky beats was one of the best ideas anyone’s had this decade.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Flamagra</em> is his newest album, which comes after an unprecedented 5-year wait, which has allowed him to more-carefully curate <em>more</em> beats than ever: it runs 31 tracks over 67 minutes, whereas his previous albums are all around 45 (with <em>You’re Dead!</em> even shorter than that). It might just be me, but a lot of the dialogue around <em>Flamagra</em> has just shown how much ‘listening culture’ has changed since 2010’s <em>Cosmogramma</em>: lots of people claiming it’s ‘too long’ and would work better if the shorter tracks were removed, never mind that the shorter tracks were how Flying Lotus made his name in the first place (ie. of <em>Cosmogramma</em>’s 17 songs, only 5 crossed the 3-minute mark). I can’t think of many other artists that make albums for the sake of making <em>albums</em>, and so few of them scream ‘listen to this from front-to-back’ the way <em>Flamagra</em> does. I know this leaked earlier, but how have you guys already parsed out 31 <em>dense</em> tracks of an artist whose previous works have all <em>demanded</em> replays?</p>\n<p>I stress the word “track” because Flying Lotus’ albums have always been this way, where you can’t really tell where one track ends and the next begins (ie. Arca’s mixtape work), although Flying Lotus is kind enough to throw in a few more full-bodied (as opposed to more ‘fleshed out’ which suggests that the others aren’t laboured over) to help ground listeners. Increasingly, these songs tend to be the ones with features, culminating in Kendrick Lamar bringing <em>You’re Dead!</em> to climax on centerpiece “Never Catch Me.” My guess? This is where the reports that the second half is some dramatic drop-off are coming from: there’s less features (only two of them on the second half).</p>\n<p>On <em>Flamagra</em>, joining the constant Thundercat at Flying Lotus’ side are the soulful voices of Anderson .Paak and Solange off the heels of their own releases. More surprisingly – as Flying Lotus has always worked with neo-soul artists – are Denzel Curry (the Florida rapper, whose previous <em>TA13OO</em>, I wrote about positively) and David Lynch (who inspired the ‘concept’ of the album when he talked about an “eternal flame sitting on a hill,” according to Flying Lotus). Shabazz Palaces appears on “Actually Virtual,” where Flying Lotus digitally exaggerates Ishmael Butler’s voice to contrast against the natural-sounding rattling drums, and given Shabazz Palaces’ own themes of space and Butler’s own love for jazz (he headed Digable Planets after all), having them collaborate is a match made in heaven. (Shabazz Palaces’ sophomore album, <em>Lese Majesty</em>, is actually a good comparison to <em>Flamagra</em> because a lot of listeners who apparently loved <em>Black Up</em> didn’t want to do the work to parse out a longer, more difficult album. Shame, because I continue to think <em>Lese Majesty</em> as one of the most interesting albums of 2014.)</p>\n<p>It isn’t “More” or “Black Balloons Reprise” or “Land of Honey” that are the album’s main highlights even though that’s going to be how it’s reported. You could listen to these songs individually, but then you’d be missing out on the lead-in to “More” that is “Heroes in a Half Shell” with the indelible climbs of Thundercat’s unmistakable touches (Stephen Bruner has co-writing credits across the album) and the subtlest of backing vocals (likely from Thundercat himself, they have that friendly <em>airiness</em> to them) and subtlest of jazzy keyboard chords. (Despite running less than 80 seconds in length, “Heroes in a Half Shell” is just indispensable to me, and adds to my fire against anyone who thinks that these shorts songs are skippable.) And on the other side, there’s “Capillaries” which functions as an excellent come-down after .Paak’s naturally attention grabbing voice. I find it telling that the album’s longest song (therefore, the <em>de facto</em> centerpiece of the album even though it comes quite early) is one without any ‘proper’ features at all, “Takashi” which runs close to 6 minutes, an ‘updated’ 70s’ jazz fusion groove that features Thundercat’s brother on drums.</p>\n<p>In that regard, highlights are everywhere if you give them time to reveal themselves: “Pilgrim Side Eye” switches from a maddeningly absurd groove – which features Herbie Hancock, incidentally – into a scene where the curtains rise and reveal a tranquil oasis, and manages this in 90 seconds; the stop-start motion of “All Spies” that sounds like it came from the soundtrack to a vintage video game; there’s the East Asian-sounding string line on “Say Something” atop the plucked strings that evoke dread (another highlight that clocks under 80 seconds). And plenty of great keyboard textures, like the one running through “Remind U” or Robert Glasper on the Solange-featured “Land of Honey” to the point that I wouldn’t even cut a mild track like the preceding “FF4” because it’s nice to hear the hand-offs between the piano and the plucked strings, plus the bass tethering it all together. And as with <em>You’re Dead!</em>, many songs ruminate on death, whether it’s the seemingly OutKast-inspired “Debbie is Depressed” (“Toilet Tisha,” anyone?), or Denzel Curry’s black balloons-as-depression metaphor. Two tracks here are tributes to the late Mac Miller, for whom Flying Lotus has produced beats, including “Find Your Own Way Home” (which is part of another theme about home) and “Thank U Malcolm.” (I feel like I’m beating a dead horse here, but these are the tracks that y’all want to cut?)</p>\n<p>(Denzel Curry continues to demonstrate a very <em>hungry</em> flow, and rhyming “ignited” with “knighted” – at the start of his verse – is pretty inventive, and I like how he sneaks in a few lines about the American president, “If the President fuck around and piss off ISIS / Bury me in blueberry bills, jewels and ices,” but the Nesquik line is awful, and emblematic of his problems of every now and then tossing in a frighteningly stupid line. Caught between being ‘lyrical trap rap’ and ‘meme rap,’ he just sort of bounces back and forth, alas.)</p>\n<p>I feel like because Flying Lotus helped define the Los Angeles scene in the new decade with his album named after the city before increasing his scope on <em>Cosmogramma</em> and then proving that beats that seemed to be ‘unrappable’ could, in fact, be rapped over on Blu’s <em>NoYork!</em> and Captain Murphy’s <em>Duality</em>, there’s disappointment that <em>Flamagra</em> – after the long wait – doesn’t bring anything new to the table. It’s the same argument as <em>Until the Quiet Comes</em>, an album that’s grown on me the most, like an introverted version of <em>Cosmogramma</em>. I guess it doesn’t, but <em>Flamagra</em> does bring an hour of new material from someone that I’ve sorely missed – isn’t that enough?</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 25 May 2019 03:09:33 +0000","feedId":13285,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"38ba2aec2dcd28cacae47d268e55991b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"marshall-gu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/7481577-6651150.jpg?w=1220&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322592888},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","title":"The Teal Album by Weezer","link":"http://ci0240a1157000279d","description":"<img src=\"\" class=\"attachment-small size-small wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" /><p><span class=\"su-dropcap su-dropcap-style-flat\" style=\"font-size:2.5em\">D</span>o you think Rivers even knows if he is joking anymore?

What’s even the point any more? There is an obvious self-awareness here. Meme-core, Twitter-induced, mindfully silly dad rock fans rejoice? For an album with both a Eurythmics cover AND a Black Sabbath cover it’s a surprisingly listenable, albeit pointless entry in their discography, Weezer has spent a decade becoming more interesting to read about than listen to.</p>\n<p>I will say though, that if you had the cheapest room on a Caribbean Cruise that ran out of gas in the gulf this would make a GREAT soundtrack to your misery. “No Scrubs” and the cover of “Take On Me” are about as throwaway as you would expect although the latter contains a delightful falsetto from Mr. Cuomo. “Happy Together” is painful in its color by numbers simplicity, the chorus pops, but who really cares? That may sound mellow dramatic, you might be thinking – Ok, great another Pinkerton head who hates modern Weezer.</p>\n<p>You might have me pegged as a Leslie Jones purist. You would be right to a certain extent – except that 2014’s <em>Everything Will Be Alright In the End</em> and 2016’s <em>The White Album</em> were late career renaissance pieces. They were nostalgic but still modern. They were nearly perfect. After <em>Raditude</em> they were pure magic, infinitely better than could be expected. I am not pre-disposed to hating this record.</p>\n<p>There are a few successes here – the Black Sabbath cover is fun and is the track here that most represents what seemingly originally influenced young Rivers to put a Kiss poster on his wall and write “In the Garage”. “Mr. Blue Sky” is the best track here, it floats and just sounds fun in the same way the White Album did. (Weezer’s not the Beatles’)</p>\n<p>But like, I mean, everyone could rate “Weezer 80’s Cover Record” without even hearing it, right? Like you knew what you thought before you hit play and then almost immediately forgot this existed right?</p>\n<p>But at some level, I hope Weezer doubles down again. Why not? Make a 90’s record, a 00’s record. Make a full cover of Ok Computer and then tell a magazine you did it because Radiohead is underrated. Go on tour with Creed. What do we still have that you haven’t already taken away, Rivers?</p>\n<p>C+</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 03:31:18 +0000","feedId":13285,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"eb8c751ccc1400884f8da96cc4e265ae","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"landon-macdonald","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322592890},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","title":"Father of the Bride by Vampire Weekend","link":"http://ci02464e7dc0002751","description":"<img src=\"\" class=\"attachment-small size-small wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" /><figure><img src='https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/7508807-5426697.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"7508807-5426697\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p><span class=\"su-dropcap su-dropcap-style-flat\" style=\"font-size:2.5em\">V</span>ampire Weekend are a tuneful band with rhythms that trace back to Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel&#8217;s albums of 1986, themselves tracing back to different genres within African music, and I found their first two records easily likable for those reasons. Their third record, <em>Modern Vampires of the City,</em> felt way more than just &#8216;likable&#8217;, and even back then I remember thinking the leap from the humbler <em>Contra</em> to <em>MVotC </em>felt comparable to Radiohead&#8217;s leap from <em>The Bends</em> to <em>OK Computer</em>. More electronic flourishes, from pitch-shifted vocals (&#8220;Diane Young&#8221;) to electronic drums (&#8220;Bicycle&#8221;) helped distinguish songs, but even better was the unexpected shifts within songs, like the climax of &#8220;Hannah Hunt&#8221; or the Rolling Stones-referencing bridge of &#8220;Ya Hey.&#8221; Their lyrics got headier too, with Hannah Hunt tearing the New York Times to pieces or &#8220;I hummed the Dies Irae as you played the Hallelujah,&#8221; which, in combination with the cover, reminded me of the uncertainties explored by Simon and Garfunkel on <em>Bookends</em>. I eagerly waited for their next release. <span id=\"more-19167\"></span></p>\n<p>At least, until 2016, when Rostam Batmanglij &#8211; the not-secret weapon behind <em>Modern Vampires</em>, with a practically Sufjan Stevens-esque credited list of instruments &#8211; announced that he was leaving Vampire Weekend to work on his solo career, which included production for a who’s who of critical darling: Charli XCX, Carly Rae Jepsen, Solange and Frank Ocean. I remember wondering whether or not Vampire Weekend would even be a thing without him because in essence, Batmanglij was as essential to Vampire Weekend as Steven Drozd is to the Flaming Lips. (Appropriately, both Wayne Coyne and Ezra Koenig have <em>very friendly</em>voices.)</p>\n<p>3 years after that announcement, and Vampire Weekend’s first album in six years, feels like a labour of love: 18 tracks running just under 60 minutes, a lot of them short and all of them sweet to the point that it feels like Vampire Weekend’s attempt at a song cycle. Predictably, vultures have already torn it apart, scavenging for highlights (ie. “Harmony Hall”) but also criticizing the filler. I don’t remember similar critical discourse around Arcade Fire’s <em>The Suburbs</em> when it dropped: a 16-track album, compared to the more concise 10 or 11 songs of their debut and sophomore, that spanned notably longer as well. (Maybe it did, but 2010 was a completely different time. Back in 2010, Vampire Weekend topped Billboard album charts, you remember.)</p>\n<p><em>Father of the Bride</em> also contains more features than their previous albums, and in that regard makes me think of how Blur replaced guitarist Graham Coxon for would-be swan song <em>Think Tank</em> – tons of other musicians. Danielle Haim (of Haim) and Steve Lacy (of many things) are properly credited as features, but songwriting and production are backed by many names appropriate for Vampire Weekend’s major label debut: DJ Dahi (who, with Steve Lacy, produced much of Kendrick Lamar’s <em>DAMN.</em>), BloodPop, Mark Ronson, Ariel Rechtshaid. What results is an album full of sounds from other decades (notably a lot more 1970s’ love this time) ‘updated’ by modern production techniques, to say nothing of the wealth of auto-tune. Rostam Batmanglij also returns for a few cuts, “Harmony Hall” and “We Belong Together,” and you’d probably be able to guess that he was responsible in both even without the production credits considering the keyboard lines that bring me back to 2013.</p>\n<p>Many of these 18 songs are short, with 8 of them not even breaching the 3-minute mark that only accentuates the ‘song cycle’ feeling. I beg you not to write these ones off (short tracks are typically the first to go). Opener “Hold You Now” introduces a sample of the soundtrack to <em>The Thin Red Line</em>, and the way it’s introduced (with Ezra Koenig going “Alright” and then pressing a button) makes me think of the audacity of Kanye West doing something similar for “On Sight” more than anything else (albeit on a smaller scale); the DJ Dahi-assisted “Big Blue” starts with an isolated Ezra Koenig verse (the feeling increased through the slightest auto-tune touch) and then builds on that more and more, and accomplishes so much in less than 90 seconds, from George Harrison slide guitars to theatrical backing vocals and overdubs. The use of auto-tune in the coda of “Bambina” and closer “Jersalem, New York, Berlin” both bring me back to <em>Modern Vampires</em>, although I wish the former were more developed (the verses and choruses feel like parts of completely different songs).</p>\n<p>It’s disheartening to see some write off <em>Father of the Bride</em> and Vampire Weekend’s oeuvre by calling it ‘dad-rock,’ which isn’t just a stupid term to begin with, but is so wrongly applied here. Very little of this rocks, as was the case of their previous albums. A shocker that an album with these mostly pop/hip-hop/R&#38;B collaborators isn’t a rock album! The 70s’ influences that they pull from include the Grateful Dead, yes, but it also includes the Beach Boys’ early 70s’ records, Paul Simon’s early solo career (notably, <em>Graceland</em> is no longer the template) and country duets. The Danielle Haim-featured songs cannot be classified as country, don’t worry, but that’s the inspiration anyway, especially on the lovely “Married in a Gold Rush” (speaking of the 70s, the words “midnight train” evokes many Karaoke nights to a particular hit). Ultimately, the criticisms of ‘dad-rock’ (or ‘mom-rock’) makes me think of many of the similarly empty criticisms of ‘appropriation’ and ‘whiteness’ that were circulating after the success of their first two albums, obliquely addressed in the title of “Unbearably White” (whose title has nothing to do with the actual lyrics, and the song itself is one of the weaker ones).</p>\n<p>There are some artistic choices that’ll be contentious: the “Boy” sample throughout “2021”; the scatting on “Sunflower”; the exaggerated drum and strum on “We Belong Together” (the last of the Haim collaborations, and easily the worst of ‘em – it’s hard to believe that this is the one that Rostam had the most hand in). And while I’m on the weak points, the choruses of “How Long?” are a bit rote, and the way Ezra Koenig is singing only a few notes in a higher register makes me think of Lily Allen’s “My One” from <em>No Shame</em> (a song which I only recently learned was a collaboration with none other than Ezra Koenig).</p>\n<p>Crucially, I don’t think these issues amount to much on an 18-track album, especially when there are so many <em>tasteful</em> moments. “This Life” is <em>Father of the Bride</em>’s “Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa,” and the lyrics “Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain / I just thought it didn’t rain in California” is straight out of Frank Ocean’s lyricbook. “Harmony Hall” comes with a guitar line that reminds me of Tinariwen of all things, the communal, ‘desert blues’ African group, and the wordless vocal hook is something that I swear I’ve heard from TV on the Radio’s Tunde Adebimpe (who fittingly worked with Tinariwen), but regardless, the song achieves the musical promise of its title. “Married in a Gold Rush” has that lovely bit in the choruses where Danielle Haim asks “Boy, who’s your baby” to which Ezra Koenig responds “Girl, if you don’t know by now…” “Rich Man” is a slow dance through an S. E. Rogers song, and the strings’ll make you swoon even more than the guitar. “Flower Moon” has that memorable hook (“year-ea-ear”) from Steve Lacy, although a problematic bridge (featuring Danielle Haim tossing out a few rhymes for rhyme’s sake). “Sympathy” is this album’s version of “Diane Young” or “Cousins” or “A-Punk,” and the only <em>rock</em> song on the album, and that riff makes the song worth keeping despite the awkward bridge, with the repeated cut off “sympa—”’s. This is the only song on the album that can readily be described as rock music, and tell me with a straight face that this’ll be something that dads listen to.</p>\n<p>On “Sympathy,” Steve Lacy – who’ll feature on the next two songs – bemuses “I think I take myself too serious. It’s not that serious,” which prompts the riff, and it makes me think of Arcade Fire’s “Normal Person,” a song that had Win Butler also speaking to himself and also was worth keeping for its riff. But I really like Steve Lacy’s intro because Vampire Weekend had never wanted to be taken seriously: I think of references to Lil Jon on “Oxford Comma” and the rather ridiculous choruses of “Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa” as prime examples, but also the cover of their major label debut which looks like an in-joke. And it’s when they get too serious that is when the album’s at its most ignorable. “Sympathy” has a couplet that goes “Judeo-Christianity, I’d never heard the words / Enemies for centuries until there was a third,” presumably about Islam, but also totally disconnected from the rest of that verse and the rest of the song. And “Married in a Gold Rush” starts with “Something’s happening in the country / And the government’s to blame,” that, again, is so disconnected from the rest of the love duet and reminds me of a lot of shitty music from the past few years – the vagueness! Yeah, something <em>is</em> wrong. Should we talk about it? Nah, let’s just quickly mention the government in passing and talk about kissing in the pouring rain.</p>\n<p>Vampire Weekend’s debut album dropped right before I entered university, and I remember it and <em>Contra</em> sound-tracking those years, and <em>Modern Vampires</em> came right about when I was finishing school up. In that regard, few other indie albums mean as much to me as that one does, especially when 2013 was perhaps the final year before tastes moved away from indie and back towards the mainstream. I wouldn’t rank <em>Father of the Bride</em> as highly as that album: few songs here measure up to “Unbelievers” or “Step” or “Ya Hey.” But it’s as good an album by a Rostam-less Vampire Weekend in 2019 as we could have possibly gotten, and the sound is a return to <em>Vampire Weekend</em> and <em>Contra</em> except arguably better with the ‘upgraded’ production and thoughtful textures. The change from indie to mainstream in the tiniest of microcosms: a Vampire Weekend album.</p>\n<p><strong>A MINUS</strong></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 May 2019 01:07:43 +0000","feedId":13285,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8b9cc80cc8b2b42c4f3e9ece946b7922","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"marshall-gu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/7508807-5426697.jpg?w=1220&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322592889},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:29:52","title":"Remember When: you listened to music standing still","link":"http://ci024567ec900027c1","description":"<img src=\"\" class=\"attachment-small size-small wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin-bottom:10px;\" /><p><span class=\"su-dropcap su-dropcap-style-flat\" style=\"font-size:2.5em\">A</span>t one of the first shows I ever attended unaccompanied by an adult, Warped Tour in Cleveland, I found myself at a rousing Motion City Soundtrack performance. The energy of their performance reached a fever pitch, and the crowd began moshing. As one of my introductory experiences to live music, Warped Tour demonstrated to me that one of live music’s key elements involves audience response. If the crowd expresses discontent, the show resonates with it. One of the (seemingly) clear indicators of such discontent is a stationary crowd, unable to be persuaded to even sway to the sound.</p>\n<p>With the rise of smartphones and tighter performance spaces, a motionless audience has become more and more the norm. For many performances, this stillness dampens the mood and forces acts to rouse them. I once saw <a href=\"https://secondhandsetlists.com/2017/03/21/little-simz-the-echo-32017/\">Little Simz years ago</a> restart her entrance at the Echo because the crowd failed to match her energy. I personally love to move, and live music provides an excellent outlet for such activity. Seeing a crowd remain still while an artist pours their soul out usually makes for a boring, if awkward, situation.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, standing idly to music feels a bit unnatural – iPods allowed us to play music while we work, work out, cook, clean, commute, literally any activity. Music, for a long time now, feels like something meant to enhance action, be it dancing, work, or travel. But at a Hop Along and Soccer Mommy performance at LA’s El Rey Theatre last night, I remembered the pleasures of idle listening. <span id=\"more-7\"></span></p>\n<p>The Nashville-based Soccer Mommy first took to the stage in a cute and relatively simple outfit, the sole outlier being her metallic-tinged footwear. As the case would be this evening, the focus fell on the music. Vocalist Sophie Allison needed only her guitar and words to captivate the crowd. She cycled through numbers off 2018’s well-received <em>Clean</em>, a calm yet intimate album where truths are laid bare without any fanfare. The tranquil crowd hung on every word, especially as she dove into a solo section where she covered Springsteen’s “I’m On Fire”.</p>\n<figure>\n<p><img src='https://i0.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/soccer-mommy-1-4177740.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"soccer-mommy-1-4177740\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p>“Only what you wanted for a little while,&#8221; an already heavy admission, impacted much harder when the crowd hung on Allison&#8217;s every word. She commanded the stage well and solidified her act as something to watch for years to come.</p>\n<p>Much like Soccer Mommy, headliners Hop Along also strove for showmanship in the simplest way. Like Allison, they too succeeded. They certainly sounded louder and a bit more abrasive than Soccer Mommy, but even they kept the crowd in a relatively serene state.</p>\n<p>By standing still, moving only to tap your foot or bop your head, one felt more in touch with the band&#8217;s relaxed attitude. I found myself in awe of how easily lead singer Frances Quinlan’s tone switches. Who could focus on dancing when you were listening to someone vocally transition from <em>Glow</em>’s raspy MelRose to the light soprano of Empress Of’s Lorely Rodriguez?</p>\n<p>Equally as varied and expansive was the band&#8217;s set list, which cycled evenly through each of their albums, from last year&#8217;s <em>Bark Your Head Off Dog</em> to the now seven-year-old (wow) <em>Get Disowned</em>. No matter what track they played, the audience always elicited a thrill which settled into a respectful repose. Truly, the one moment of a bit of thrashing happened at the finale, where&#8221;The Knock&#8221;&#8216;s guitar solo sent Quilan to her knees. This subsequently reminded the crowd that, though it was more relaxed than many, they were still at a rock show.</p>\n<figure>\n<p><img src='https://i2.wp.com/danieltovar.io/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hop-along-2-6214870.jpg?w=1220&#038;ssl=1' alt=\"hop-along-2-6214870\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n<p>Growing up as a show choir and K-pop-listening kid, I always associated music with movement. So being reminded to slow down felt a bit unnatural, but it is something I realized I’d always wanted to hear.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 27 Apr 2019 06:41:37
