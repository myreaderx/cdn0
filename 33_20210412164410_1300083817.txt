Her work has culminated in two highly effective vaccines for Covid-19 and is being extended to produce possible vaccines for HIV, the flu, tuberculosis, and malaria.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Now Katalin Kariko, 66, known to colleagues as Kati, has emerged as one of the heroes of Covid-19 vaccine development. Her work, with her close collaborator, Dr. Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania, laid the foundation for the stunningly successful vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.</p> \n <p>For her entire career, Dr. Kariko has focused on messenger RNA, or mRNA — the genetic script that carries DNA instructions to each cell’s protein-making machinery. She was convinced mRNA could be used to instruct cells to make their own medicines, including vaccines.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Stat also wrote <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/\">a piece about Kariko and the development of the mRNA vaccines</a>. It seems like Kariko will be strongly considered for a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her achievements. The Covid vaccines will save hundreds of thousands of lives alone, and if mRNA can indeed be harnessed to protect against HIV and malaria, the effect on the world will be immense. Give Kariko all the prizes and whatever she wants to be happy in life — she’s earned it and more.</p> \n<p><strong title=\"Apr 12, 2021\">Update:</strong> From Derek Thompson at The Atlantic, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/how-mrna-technology-could-change-world/618431/\">How mRNA Technology Could Change the World</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>But mRNA’s story likely will not end with COVID-19: Its potential stretches far beyond this pandemic. This year, a team at Yale patented a similar RNA-based technology to vaccinate against malaria, perhaps the world’s most devastating disease. Because mRNA is so easy to edit, Pfizer says that it is planning to use it against seasonal flu, which mutates constantly and kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world every year. The company that partnered with Pfizer last year, BioNTech, is developing individualized therapies that would create on-demand proteins associated with specific tumors to teach the body to fight off advanced cancer. In mouse trials, synthetic-mRNA therapies have been shown to slow and reverse the effects of multiple sclerosis. “I’m fully convinced now even more than before that mRNA can be broadly transformational,” Özlem Türeci, BioNTech’s chief medical officer, told me. “In principle, everything you can do with protein can be substituted by mRNA.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Katalin%20Kariko\">Katalin Kariko</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/vaccines\">vaccines</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:23:30 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"fa5679fdd923ebd2304989b38bf96016","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245817504},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:37","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:37","title":"A Supercut of Everything Brad Pitt Eats & Drinks in Ocean&#8217;s Eleven","link":"https://kottke.org/21/04/a-supercut-of-everything-brad-pitt-eats-drinks-in-oceans-eleven","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6mNJwImPb4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>If you’ve seen Ocean’s Eleven more than once, you probably noticed that Brad Pitt’s character Rusty Ryan is eating or drinking something in almost every scene he’s in. cinemATTIC made a supercut of all of those food and beverage moments from the movie.

During a recent Avengers: Endgame viewing, my son asked, “Doesn’t anyone ever have to go to the bathroom in these movies?” Then we talked about how they hardly ever eat either, aside from the occasional shawarma. But now that I’m thinking about it, there’s quite a bit of eating and drinking in Endgame: Black Widow’s peanut butter sandwich, Hulk-delivered tacos, the diner scene, Thor’s drinking, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/bzdqfr/endgame_has_more_scenes_with_food_on_screen_or_in/\">many more</a>.<sup id=\"fnref:1617908061\"><a href=\"https://kottke.org/21/04/a-supercut-of-everything-brad-pitt-eats-drinks-in-oceans-eleven#fn:1617908061\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Ocean’s reference or nah?

Scientists say that people can change their personalities well into adulthood. And what better time for transformation than now, when no one has seen you for a year, and might have forgotten what you were like in the first place?</p> \n <p>It was long thought that people just are a certain way, and they’ll remain that way forever. The Greek physician Hippocrates believed that people’s personalities were governed by the amounts of phlegm, blood, black bile and yellow bile that flowed through their bodies.</p> \n <p>Modern science, of course, has long since discarded notions of bile and humors. And now, it appears the idea that our personalities are immutable is also not quite true. Researchers have found that adults can change the five traits that make up personality — extroversion, openness to experience, emotional stability, agreeableness and conscientiousness — within just a few months. Much as in Dr. Steffel’s case, the traits are connected, so changing one might lead to changes in another.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Put more succinctly: “Remember that your personality is more like a sand dune than a stone.”</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Olga%20Khazan\">Olga Khazan</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 19:56:52 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1fc96dcbad9eaf620338101df68117fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245817556},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:37","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:37","title":"Anywhere Can Happen","link":"https://kottke.org/21/04/anywhere-can-happen","description":"<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/533086714?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Sure, there’s the big budget superhero &amp; action films, but the falling cost and increasing availability of really good motion graphics tools also enables a sort of everyday surrealism that’s on display in this short video by <a href=\"https://www.bsfilms.me/\">Fernando Livschitz</a>.

The night views, with all that pulsing orange lava, are especially mesmerizing.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Iceland\">Iceland</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/time%20lapse\">time lapse</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/volcanoes\">volcanoes</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 17:40:50 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"afc23cdc65e4b4c5c22353a626247842","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1618245817556},{"createdTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:37","updatedTime":"2021-04-13 00:43:37","title":"A Kitchen Scraps Cookbook from Ikea","link":"https://kottke.org/21/04/a-kitchen-scraps-cookbook-from-ikea","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/scrapsbook.jpg\" width=\"1002\" height=\"727\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Scrapsbook\" /></p> \n<p>Ikea has published a cookbook for cooking with food waste called The ScrapsBook and <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/campaigns/scrapsbook-zero-waste-recipes-pub147efb60\">it’s available to download for free</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>IKEA has created The ScrapsBook, in collaboration with chefs from across North America. This cookbook is dedicated to cooking with the little things we usually throw away. Or, as we like to call it, “scrapcooking.”</p> \n <p>Scrapcooking is about finding the beautiful possibilities in that banana peel, radish top, or even the chicken bones you’re about to toss, and make the most of everything available to you. It’s little things like these that can add up to make a big difference.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>It includes recipes for dishes like banana peel bacon &amp; wild rice pancakes, corn cob soup, and bruised apple butter cake.
