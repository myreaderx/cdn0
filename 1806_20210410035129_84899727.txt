This applies to web designers as well.</p>\n<p>While design trends may tend to change with time, some are more or less evergreen. If they change at all, the change is slow, while newer ones may suddenly be thrust upon us.</p>\n<p>None of the following 5 new design trends for 2021 should cause a web designer any grief. They are not radical, mind-bending conceptions. They make sense, they are not difficult to implement, and they even suggest that the new normal may be an improvement over the old one.</p>\n<p>We’ll show you examples of websites that are already incorporating some of these new trends, together with a selection of <a href=\"https://themes.muffingroup.com/be/splash/?utm_source=webdesignledger.com&#38;utm_medium=content&#38;utm_campaign=apr21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BeTheme pre-built websites</a> that are also onboard.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Use soothing and reassuring color palettes</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Strong, bold color palettes along with a variety of gradient schemes have been emphasized in recent design trends to capture a visitor’s attention.</p>\n<p>We’ve tired of the stress, strain, and shouting associated with 2020’s “normal”, and we are more than ready to change to calmer times, and softer and more toned-down color palettes as well.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bellroy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bellroy</a> company’s website is an excellent example of a toned-down look.

But are today’s users thrilled with it? Not quite so much.</p>\n<p>Most users only want to view a video if they feel the need to see it. In other words, user-controlled videos are in, and embedded autoplay videos are becoming more and more unpopular. If viewers are given the choice as to whether to view or not to view, you can expect video to make a substantial comeback this year.</p>\n<p>This is how&#160;<a href=\"https://www.walgreens.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Payoneer</a>&#160;has dealt with the issue:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.walgreens.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-50891\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/86369de6-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/86369de6-8.png 800w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/86369de6-8-500x277.png 500w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/86369de6-8-768x425.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Notice how the Watch Video button stands out against the background.

Instead of spending several minutes to size up a brick and mortar business, an online shopper will often do so in a minute or less.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the following trust building approaches are familiar to web designers, and they can make use of any one or of several:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data visualization (e.g., charts, graphs, counters, statistic callouts)</li>\n<li>Logos, whether they are a client’s, a partner’s, or media’s</li>\n<li>Client or customer reviews and/or testimonials</li>\n<li>Case studies/portfolios</li>\n<li>Security seals (e.g., Better Business Bureau (BBB), TRUSTe, PayPal Checkout)</li>\n<li>Proof of social involvement, environmental involvement, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s simply a matter of which of these would be a good fit to a business’s website and could convince a visitor to become a valued customer.</p>\n<p>The approach taken by <a href=\"https://www.omaze.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Omaze</a> is to emphasize social involvement, encourage its visitors to make donations, and offer prizes when they do so.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.omaze.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-50893\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/a3a229f5-10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/a3a229f5-10.png 800w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/a3a229f5-10-500x277.png 500w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/a3a229f5-10-768x425.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<p>It also brings added legitimacy to the table by reserving a space for highlighting reputable publications that have featured the organization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.omaze.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-50894\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/5114c9d8-11-970x537.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"970\" height=\"537\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/5114c9d8-11-970x537.png 970w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/5114c9d8-11-500x277.png 500w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/5114c9d8-11-768x425.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/5114c9d8-11-1000x554.png 1000w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/5114c9d8-11-400x220.png 400w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/5114c9d8-11.png 1425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Testimonials and data visualization are two additional trust building elements that Omaze puts to good use.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.omaze.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-50895\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/cbfb2023-12-970x537.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"970\" height=\"537\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/cbfb2023-12-970x537.png 970w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/cbfb2023-12-500x277.png 500w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/cbfb2023-12-768x425.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/cbfb2023-12-1000x554.png 1000w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/cbfb2023-12-400x220.png 400w, https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/cbfb2023-12.png 1425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\" /></a></p>\n<p>No matter how large or small the organization or enterprise you’re designing a website for may be, there’s always room for incorporating one or more impressive trust builders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://themes.muffingroup.com/be/portfolio2/?utm_source=webdesignledger.com&#38;utm_medium=content&#38;utm_campaign=apr21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BePortfolio</a> shows how you might incorporate trust builders in a portfolio site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://themes.muffingroup.com/be/portfolio2/?utm_source=webdesignledger.com&#38;utm_medium=content&#38;utm_campaign=apr21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-50896\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/webdesignledger.pub.network/WDL/27d57631-13.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></a></p>\n<p>BePortfolio’s home page dedicates plenty of space to the following trust builders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Portfolio samples</li>\n<li>Satisfied customer counts</li>\n<li>Testimonials and case studies</li>\n<li>Client logos</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Giving people a reason to trust your brand is fine, but it’s a lot better if you can give them <u>more than enough</u> reasons to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you begun to use these new web design trends yet?</strong></p>\n<p>As we noted earlier, some trends stay with us a long time.
