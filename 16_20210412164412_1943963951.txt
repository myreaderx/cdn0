By the conclusion of the course, they have to write a poem about it. </p>\n<p>Inevitably, the creatures previously regarded as remote and abstract othernesses, caricatured by a few loathsome features, are gradually rendered interesting by the thousand small details of their being, complex and concrete. Because interest is the crucible of intimacy and intimacy the crucible of connection, because the light of attention cast upon the creatures renders them luminous golden threads indivisible from the tapestry of aliveness that makes our rocky planet an enchanted loom of a world, the poems inevitably become love poems.</p>\n<figure  class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/snake-and-muricated-lizard-by-sarah-stone-1790_print?sku=s6-10687987p4a1v45?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sarahstone_snake.jpg?resize=680%2C544&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"544\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-67332\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sarahstone_snake.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sarahstone_snake.jpg?resize=240%2C192&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sarahstone_snake.jpg?resize=320%2C256&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sarahstone_snake.jpg?resize=768%2C614&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sarahstone_snake.jpg?resize=600%2C480&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Snake and Muricated lizard, from trailblazing 18th-century artist Sarah Stone&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/03/12/sarah-stone-natural-history-illustration/\">natural history illustrations</a> of exotic and endangered animals.

If you are possessed by anger or fear, the tangerine may not be very real to you.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to share a reality-regrounding mindfulness practice from his work with children that is, like a great children&#8217;s book, a miniature masterpiece of philosophy and a psychological salve for any stage of life:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One day, I offered a number of children a basket filled with tangerines. The basket was passed around, and each child took one tangerine and put it in his or her palm. We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. They saw petals falling down and the tiny fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that.</p></blockquote>\n<figure id=\"attachment_73156\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/tangerine-art-from-1905-agricultural-yearbook_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tangerine_1905.jpg?resize=680%2C580&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"580\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73156\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tangerine_1905.jpg?w=1369&#38;ssl=1 1369w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tangerine_1905.jpg?resize=320%2C273&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tangerine_1905.jpg?resize=600%2C511&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tangerine_1905.jpg?resize=240%2C205&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tangerine_1905.jpg?resize=768%2C655&#38;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tangerine.
