and highlighted multiple data points that he said indicate a strong recovery is underway.&#160;</p><p>\"To me the financial markets and the corporate and individual behaviors tell a very different narrative than I hear about every day,\" the chief investment strategist said on Monday.&#160;</p><p>He pointed to the recent stock rally that's been led by cyclical and small-cap stocks. These stocks are sensitive to an economic recovery and their gains are a good sign, Paulsen said. He also cited rising commodity prices and increased initial-public-offering activity as bullish signals.&#160;</p><p>The chief strategist added: \"We're seeing behaviors by companies and consumers that are just not consistent with the national narrative that this economy is hanging by a thread and consumers and businesses are petrified in fear.\"</p><p>Housing, auto, and durable goods sales have been rising, he said, adding that these are purchases that are made by consumers who feel confident and secure financially.</p><p>On the job front, he said that temporary jobs as a percentage of total jobs are rising every month, and that's a precursor to \"better job creation down the road.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a

said.&#160;</p><p>The strategist also said the economy may have not seen the full benefits from the first stimulus because historically fiscal policies take about a year to help the economy.<br><br>\"We could have a surprisingly solid, healthy, maybe even accelerating economic growth over the coming quarters because of what we did six, nine, 12 months ago, and I don't think that

The get-around was short-lived — it launched last week, and after a journalist with the state-backed publication Global Times <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RitaBai/status/1314539100343476224\">tweeted</a> about it, Tuber <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RitaBai/status/1314854115382497281\">reportedly</a> disappeared from the Huawei app store. The app, which is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/new-chinese-browser-lets-users-get-around-great-firewall/\">backed by a subsidiary</a> of the Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, is also now unavailable on Apple's App Store, according to CNBC. Qihoo 360 did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.</p><p>China has a long history of censoring the internet, strictly regulating the kinds of websites and services users can access. Its \"Great Firewall\" <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/major-us-tech-companies-blocked-from-operating-in-china-2019-5\">bans a slew of US tech firms</a> from being able to reach millions of users in the Eastern nation, but some have been able to get around it by using virtual private networks, or VPNs.</p><p>The Tuber app allowed residents to access banned websites without the need for VPNs. However, a test of the app from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/new-chinese-browser-lets-users-get-around-great-firewall/\">TechCrunch</a> revealed it was still somewhat censored, with politically sensitive terms such as \"Tiananmen\" showing no results. The outlet also found that Chinese citizens were required to provide a phone number to use the Tuber app, meaning their identity could be potentially shared with officials.</p><p>News of Tuber's disappearance from app stores comes as tensions continue to grow heated between the US and China. The Trump administration has cracked down on Chinese apps and services, with the president's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/can-trump-ban-tiktok-no-legal-experts-cfius-alternative-options-2020-7\">attempts to ban the popular video-sharing app TikTok</a> — owned by Beijing-based ByteDance — being a prime example. President Trump has also sought to ban the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tencent-explained-wechat-owner-trump-china-executive-order-2020-8\">popular Tencent-owned social app WeChat.&#160;</a></p><p>Federal judges in late September temporarily blocked Trump's attempts to ban both TikTok and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-judge-blocks-wechat-ban-trump-2020-9\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"dc345e535bbf3ea44e90fc59d0fece57\">WeChat,&#160;</a>but their futures in the US remain uncertain. A hearing is slated for&#160;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-ban/u-s-judge-to-hold-november-4-hearing-on-commerce-dept-tiktok-ban-idUSKBN26R2KQ\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"9c17d20a1a273670c1cce2f252bf7fb3\">November 4</a>, when a federal judge will decide whether or not to allow the administration to ban transactions with TikTok. TikTok is still in negotiations with Oracle for a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-oracle-partnership-trump-china-bytedance-explainer-2020-9\">potential sale of its US operations</a>, a deal that will need the approval of US regulators.&#160;&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-google-chinese-firewall-app-tuber-down-qihoo-360-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/wl3UT3_mF2U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:20:05 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f8474c3642e9400180b5575?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4e2aadd51bfbfa5d7d00b5b2444a2732","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn15@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-50-672_a79ca3e70906fd21.webp","destWidth":1777,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":24116,"destBytes":24116,"author":"insider@insider.com (Katie Canales)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f8474c3642e9400180b5575?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn15@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-50-672_a79ca3e70906fd21.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-05-01-063_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn61@2020_4/2020/10/12/17-05-01-347_dcd499e2af94ebd7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn41@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-05-00-275_c86b459de34888eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn68@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-57-018_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wl3UT3_mF2U:hxbkShdVfZQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn69@2020_2/2020/10/12/17-04-54-581_bb17e18f743cd6f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/wl3UT3_mF2U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn5@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-05-03-459_301235639ec5fdc7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522289775},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:49","title":"Google is planning to add new 'hub' offices to provide flexibility for employees, and experts say these networks of satellite offices are the future in Silicon Valley","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-offices-post-coronavirus-hub-spokes-satellite-model-experts-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3c3696b2fa21001d8daa0c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Amazon Boulder headquarters offices\" height=\"1730\" width=\"2307\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Amazon&#39;s office in Boulder, Colorado.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Helen H.

What happens to employees who want to leave Silicon Valley? And what does the future of the office look like?&#160;</p><p>These are the questions that major tech companies are grappling with as the coronavirus crisis stretches into the fall. Many large tech firms, including giants like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-extends-work-from-home-june-2021-coronavirus-2020-8\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-employees-working-from-home-summer-2021-report-2020-7\">Google</a>, have pushed back plans to return to the office until summer 2021, and have said they anticipate a rise in remote work.</p><p>But experts told Business Insider that the office — and Silicon Valley — will look <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/going-back-to-work-office-design-coronavirus-2020-5\">very different</a> by then. With workers <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-bay-area-tech-workers-leaving-remote-survey-2020-8\">leaving</a> the Bay Area and companies wary to have thousands of employees all in one place, San Francisco may not be the central tech headquarters it's been for decades.</p><p>Instead, the experts say, tech companies are going to expand outward, with small satellite offices peppered throughout the US.</p><p>\"We're going to start to see satellite locations rather than singular HQs,\" Melissa Hanley, CEO of the Bay Area design firm Blitz, told Business Insider. \"We might say, 'Hey, you don't have to commute two hours. We're going to have a little satellite office with all the resources you need out in the 'burbs.'\"&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3ec8a642f43f001ddfe1ed?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google Boulder Colorado office worker\" height=\"2000\" width=\"2666\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Google employee at the company&#39;s office in Colorado.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AAron Ontiveroz/The Denver Post via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>A hub-and-spoke model</h2><p>Adam Segal, the CEO of workplace management technology company Cove, said he expects most companies will start to adopt a \"remote-first approach,\" meaning that working at home is the norm, not the exception. While workers might have worked remotely one or two days per week in pre-coronavirus times, in the future, that will be reversed, Segal said.</p><p>\"So what does that mean? You just have less dedicated desks,\" Segal told Business Insider. \"No one misses their desk — that's not why you go to the office. You miss people, the socialization.\"</p><p>Segal agrees with Hanley that the future of the office will be a so-called \"hub-and-spoke\" model: Companies would have a \"hub,\" or headquarters, in a major city, then have \"spokes\" anywhere in America connected by the same technology system. With Cove's system, for example, you'd be able to look up office locations in your area, see which of your colleagues was working there, and book a desk of your choice for the day.&#160;</p><p>Google is planning on a future that includes office hubs, according to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ceo-elaborates-future-office-plans-as-employees-demand-answers-2020-10\">leaked audio obtained by Business Insider's Hugh Langley</a>. During an October 1 all-hands meeting, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is planning on adding new, smaller hub offices, which will give employees more flexibility around where they live.&#160;</p><p>\"In the future when we think about it, we do see the majority of Googlers' roles will continue to be tied to a particular office and that they will live within some reasonable distance of that office,\" Pichai said during the all-hands. \"What we are doing is expanding the number of offices we see as hubs so that people will have a lot more choice in their lives.\"</p><p>Pichai also used the phrase \"hybrid-flexible\" to describe how Googlers will work going forward, which could mean that employees will have the option to both work remotely and report to the office.&#160;</p><p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-san-francisco-office-decentralized-coronavirus-2020-8\">recently hinted at a satellite model</a> for Twitter's workers. Dorsey told \"The Boardroom: Out of Office\" podcast host Rich Kleiman that he's been working on \"decentralizing\" Twitter's workforce, and that many entrepreneurs he talks to aren't interested in a big San Francisco headquarters anymore. \"Here we are, an internet company, that's completely centralizing in San Francisco,\" Dorsey said. \"We're not living up to the ideals of what the internet inspired us to be and what it can show.\"&#160;</p><p>Companies like Amazon are already starting to meet employees where they are. The company recently announced <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-adds-jobs-new-office-hub-locations-2020-8\">a $1.4 billion investment</a> to expand its physical offices in six cities across the US: Dallas, Detroit, Denver, New York, Phoenix, and San Diego. It's also hiring 3,500 new employees, but not at its main headquarters in Seattle — these workers will report into those hubs spread across the US.&#160;</p><p>Tracy Brower, a sociologist and principal in the applied research and consulting group at furniture manufacturer Steelcase, said she's already hearing from clients who are mulling a switch to satellite offices, in part because they would save on real estate costs in major cities.</p><p>But she also sees benefits for employees. For one, satellite offices may be safer; workers wouldn't have to worry about commuting in crowded downtowns or trying to socially distance in the elevator of a high-rise building.&#160;</p><p>There would also be an improvement in quality of life. \"Satellites are really more convenient,\" Brower told Business Insider, arguing that they give workers more choice in how they work. \"I might come to a satellite for great technology that my company offers, and I don't have the same thing at home.\"</p><p>For workers sick of staying at home or feeling creatively stuck without the ability to easily work with others, a satellite office could satisfy some of those feelings, Brower said. \"A lot of times, the reason we want to get together is for new ideas, for new thinking, to be stimulated by the people around us.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3c488942f43f001ddfda45?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Cove office tech examples\" height=\"1250\" width=\"2521\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An example of Cove&#39;s software in action.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Cove</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Bay Area vs. anywhere else</h2><p>Satellite offices aren't a new concept. In the era after 9/11, for example, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1031706785440337155\">the banking industry</a> went the route of satellite offices, setting up hubs outside of lower Manhattan and New York City.&#160;</p><p>The coronavirus may have just sped up a trend that was already percolating in the tech industry over the last few years.</p><p>John Boyd, a principal at corporate location consultancy The Boyd Company, used Uber as an example. In August 2019, Uber announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/technology/2019/08/20/uber-makes-it-official-it-will-set-up-major-hub-in-downtown-dallas-by-end-of-year/\">build a new hub for 3,000 employees in the Dallas area</a>. The new office is expected to become Uber's largest outside of the Bay Area.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Similarly, in November 2019, Apple broke ground on <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-expands-in-austin/\">a brand-new, $1 billion Austin campus</a> that spans 3 million square feet. It's expected to open in 2022 and will house 5,000 employees to start.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3ec7ac42f43f001ddfe1ea?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple Austin satellite office\" height=\"2000\" width=\"2666\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Apple&#39;s campus in Austin, Texas.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Boyd says that while companies may keep headquarters in the Bay Area for prestige, lower labor costs also make satellite offices appealing.</p><p>\"Labor costs in Raleigh, North Carolina, or Tampa, Florida, can be 25 to 30% less than in Palo Alto, California,\" Boyd said. Moving 4,000 or 5,000 jobs to these markets can mean millions in savings for tech firms.</p><p>Tech companies, however, would need to make those satellite offices desirable for people who don't already live there — or who want the lifestyle of places like Palo Alto. \"They need to offer the type of lifestyle amenities that Tesla employees in Palo Alto view as favorable or desirable,\" Boyd said.</p><p>Boyd said there wes a slew of cities well-positioned to welcome a tech workforce: Nashville, Raleigh, Tampa, Miami, Austin, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Phoenix.</p><p>One thing all the experts agreed on: The office isn't going away, it's just changing.</p><p>\"I don't think the office is dead, I think that's hyperbole and sort of ridiculous,\" Hanley of Blitz, the design firm, said. \"People need community, people need culture, they need contact, and that will not go away.\"</p><p>&#160;</p><p><em><br></em><em>The Business Insider Global Trends Festival will take place on the 19th-23rd of October.

The company's stock price has soared alongside four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla.</p><p>How? \"Well number one, they ripped out a lot of robots,\" Munro said. \"I think that Elon thought that somehow robots could take over everything, but in actuality that's been proven wrong in many, many cases.\"</p><p>Musk himself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/984882630947753984\">admitted</a> in April that, while robots are helpful, \"excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake …. Humans are underrated.\"</p><p>But there's another area where Tesla has a leg up on the competition, Munro says: it continually improves on designs.</p><p>\"So what Tesla's done is it's cranked out a product that's probably 90%, 95% there,\" he said. \"But they've got so many ways of investigating what's going on in each car all the time that the feedback can say 'Hey, what I think what we should do is X. Let's make that engineering change and implement it on the vehicles from here going forward, and if or when a customer has a problem, bingo, we don't know how to solve it or we'll replace the parts.'\"</p><p>\"If I had to make a choice between the two — getting to 95% and then basically waiting until customers complained and then changing things rapidly,\" Munro continued. \"I'd rather take that approach.\"</p><p>That approach seems to be working. Tesla's on track to produce nearly 500,000 cars this year, analysts estimate, in-line with the company's guidance. The company has already released delivery and production numbers for the third quarter, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-beats-expectations-for-third-quarter-vehicle-deliveries-2020-10\">which topped expectations and set a record</a>. Now, with the Model Y beginning to come off the production line, Munro is impressed.</p><p>\"I said in the past that Tesla with the Model 3 was probably five to eight years ahead of everybody else,\" he said, \"and now in some cases I think that in some areas of the car, Tesla is 10 years ahead, especially when it comes to the manufacturing.\"</p><p>Tesla will report its third-quarter financials on October 21.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The company also canceled its planned second attempt the following day, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1309465743768027136\">saying</a> it needed to \"verify a fix on a technical issue.\"</p><p>This is the first of two flight tests that Blue Origin will conduct through NASA's Tipping Point program, which awarded six private companies a total of $44 million to help push next-generation technologies over the finish line. Blue Origin got $3 million for the project that's culminating in Tuesday's&#160;test launch.

This system is slated to fly on two commercial lunar robotic missions in 2021, including the lander that will carry <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-picks-astrobotic-deliver-viper-moon-rover-lunar-ice-2020-6\">NASA's new rover to the moon</a> — the first such landing since the Apollo program ended in 1972.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ee258b52618b92ce7025387?format=jpeg\" alt=\"astrobotic griffin moon lander lunar rover viper\" height=\"1462\" width=\"1950\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An illustration shows Astrobotic&#39;s Griffin lunar lander deploying a ramp on the moon&#39;s surface.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.astrobotic.com/media-kit/images\" target=\"_blank\">Astrobotic</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>NASA designed the new technologies so they could work together or separately, allowing the agency to pick and choose the elements required for particular missions. The Blue Origin flight will test how the elements work together in a new spacecraft.</p><p>\"The sensor data is all processed via the descent and landing computer,\" Carson said. \"Lots of other software runs in the background, integrating the different systems, figuring out what needs to run next, and, for this test, synchronizing timing with the Blue Origin flight computer. It's all crucial so the system can run autonomously and provide us with data that we can analyze post-flight.\"</p><p>NASA plans to trial a third sensor system — which would scan the surface of a planet to detect hazards and choose safer landing spots — in future testing.</p><p>Here is Blue Origin's live feed of the test flight, which will start broadcasting 30 minutes before

chief economic advisor at Allianz, said Monday.</p><p>After a brief bout of calmed market volatility, choppy trading resumed earlier this month after President Donald Trump abruptly canceled, and just as surprisingly revived, plans for another stimulus package. While Democrats and the White House have inched closer to reaching a compromise, Senate Republicans have balked at all recent proposals.</p><p>Investors continue to tell themselves \"it's a matter of time\" before Congress passes another massive spending package, El-Erian said on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/12/el-erian-markets-investment-strategy-stimulus-squawk-box.html\">CNBC</a>. Though deal progress has been made in recent weeks, the market's rally rests on an uneasy foundation, he added.</p><p>\"The problem with the 'it's a matter of time' argument is there's ongoing damage to the economy every day, so it really does matter when this will come,\" he said. \"This market is completely behavioral.

Senate Republicans are focused on confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, placing fiscal relief talks on the party's back-burner. Once confirmation hearings end on Thursday, legislators have just two weeks to finalize a deal before Election Day.</p><p>No matter how much investors focus on economic data or Wall Street projections, progress on a spending bill is \"the only thing that matters this week\" to the market's trajectory, El-Erian said.</p><p>The stimulus impasse comes as economic indicators slow their pace of recovery and suggest some damage will linger until well after the coronavirus pandemic ends. Jobless claims data published Thursday showed claims <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-jobless-claims-weekly-unemployment-insurance-benefits-hiring-economic-recovery-2020-10\">falling slightly to 840,000</a>, still sitting well above the worst readings seen during the Great Recession.

Too early relative to what it could be and too early relative to what we need,\" he added.</p><p>To be sure, the US has yet to suffer a crippling wave of corporate bankruptcies. Markets boast enough liquidity and investor demand to offer cheap financing to cash-strapped firms. The avoidance of bankruptcies is the \"one thing that has been really helpful for the marketplace,\" El-Erian said.</p><p><em><strong>Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business

To help, we're answering all the most common questions our readers have regarding the sales event, including dates, competing sales, how to prepare, and more.</p><h3><strong>What is Amazon Prime Day?</strong></h3><p>Introduced in 2015 in part to celebrate Amazon's 20th anniversary, the first Amazon Prime Day was a one-day-only retail holiday for Prime members that sought to overtake Black Friday as&#160;<em>the</em>&#160;sales event of the year.&#160;</p><p>During the event, prices drop to all-time lows, often beating out prices we see over Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The sale covers every product category Amazon offers: tech, beauty, home and kitchen, fashion, and smart home are just a few of the huge variety of items that will be discounted.&#160;</p><p>Last year's Amazon Prime Day was a huge success; during the 48-hour sale event held on July 15-16, Prime members bought more than 175 million items. It was the biggest shopping day in company history until it was surpassed by Cyber Monday shortly after, a familiar pattern of record-breaking.&#160;</p><h3><strong>When is Amazon Prime Day 2020?</strong></h3><p>Amazon Prime Day is scheduled for 12 a.m. PT on Tuesday, October 13 through Wednesday, October 14, 2020, as it was originally postponed due to COVID-19. Prime Day is an annual 48-hour sale where Amazon Prime members can get deals on products such as laptops, TVs, smartphones, wearables, and more.</p><p>Shoppers, however, don't need to wait until then to take advantage of deals. Prime members can shop early deals and offers leading up to Prime Day. In addition to markdowns on Amazon devices, like select Fire TVs and the Fire TV Recast, Prime members can enjoy discounts on subscriptions to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/mdp/gold/annual?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20-2020-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Audible</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1483579440886&tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-200-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Amazon Music Unlimited</a> or<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"> Kindle Unlimited</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/fmc/learn-more?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Amazon Fresh</a>, plus several Amazon clothing brands, like&#160;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/fashion-sales-and-deals/b/?ie=UTF8&node=9538491011&tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20-2020-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">GoodThreads and Daily Ritual</a>.</p><p>Prime members in the following countries can participate in the event: the US, UK, UAE, Spain, Singapore, Netherlands, Mexico, Luxembourg, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, China, Canada, Belgium, Austria, Australia, and — for the first time this year — Turkey and Brazil.</p><h3><strong>Was Amazon Prime Day postponed this year?</strong></h3><p>Prime Day in past years has always taken place during the summer, specifically in July.

We'll be covering the best deals from these retailers, plus other notable stores and companies, during Prime Day, just as we do during the rest of the year.</p><h3><strong>How will this Prime Day be different from years past?</strong></h3><p>With Prime Day happening so close to Black Friday this year, competing sales and the number of overall deals will most likely be fewer in number.</p><p>Rival retailers may do as little as match Amazon's discounts on Amazon products, like&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-device-launch-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"16e575f05c65752d3c4da66f84b5b446\">Kindles and Echo speakers</a>, and a few high-demand products, like Sony headphones or gaming consoles.&#160;</p><p>The larger ripple we expect to see this Amazon Prime Day is less available stock and potentially delayed shipping. Shipping speeds often take a hit during these high-traffic events, and we expect it to be worse than in years past.</p><p>With supply chains still not back up to snuff since prior to the pandemic, high-demand items like&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-webcam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"70fe57f75e514b31e92cb82b28409da4\">webcams</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/work-from-home-essentials-hub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"681886a0fe50e118e0281e3d973cad26\">home office furniture</a>, brand-name&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-hand-sanitizers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"a5ff5c8adfd8453d95b4d2a72bc8064b\">hand sanitizers</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-home-gym\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"0e75c948d3edee2733efcf5907c33ba3\">workout equipment</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-sewing-machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"4cf6fcb02377319a7f0f5f041c15522e\">sewing machines</a>, and the like will probably run out quickly, if they're in stock at all.</p><h3><strong>How do I prepare for Amazon Prime Day?</strong></h3><p>With Amazon Prime Day fast approaching, there are a few steps you can take to get the most out of the big shopping event. This prep can save you a ton of time and effort on the actual deal days and net you nearly $100 in account credit to use on October 13-14.</p><ol><li>Make sure you're an Amazon Prime member ahead of the sales event.</li><li>Download the Amazon app.</li><li>Shop Amazon's physical stores to collect bonus credit, refill your Amazon account balance, and apply for an Amazon.com Store card. Consider that just by shopping for groceries with Amazon, you can collect up to $50 in \"free money\" and adding an Amazon.com Store Card to your wallet will net you a $60 gift card.</li><li>Create a shopping plan and narrow down what you want to buy.&#160;</li></ol><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-shop-amazon-prime-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"31099cc5832d92c7dec90bbf3bbc0c1a\">For more detailed information on how to get ready to shop Amazon Prime Day 2020, read this</a>.</p><p>You can also prepare by reading up on&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/prime-day-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"54b79bcf4c288232757a7795ae3b97c4\">everything Prime Day-related</a>&#160;to learn about what types of deals to expect and how to shop special promotions like Lightning Deals.&#160;</p><p>We recommend holding off on buying Amazon devices and services until deals start to go live, if you can. While we also expect other smart home brands to drop in price considerably, brands like Kindle and Echo are our for-sure bet to drop in price. We also recommend waiting to sign up for any Amazon services or memberships, like&#160;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimitedref_=assoc_tag_ph_1483579440886&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkId=7c1e59d11f5ad56ec72254ff223bbd5d?ots=1&slotNum=46&imprToken=26ba8e8c-b97a-0d2d-e64imprToken=26ba8e8c-b97a-0d2d-e64\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-amzn-asin=\"promotions\" data-uri=\"f1b722e87c8e880ee47a1d1290ca987d\">Amazon Music Unlimited</a>&#160;or&#160;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/signup?ots=1&slotNum=47&imprToken=26ba8e8c-b97a-0d2d-e64&ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1454291293420&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkId=213203c0cd7efa1c6516de594c313a7fkId=213203c0cd7efa1c6516de594c313a7f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"a8ee976b4e6b5ddfdedc6da54541c646\">Kindle Unlimited</a>, as they often drop down to record-breaking lows during Prime Day.</p><p>If one of the products on your wish list didn't receive a discount during Prime Day — don't immediately surrender to the retail price. In a little more than a month after Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday may offer the discount you were hoping for.</p><h3><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">Which is better for deals: Prime Day or Black Friday?</strong></h3><p>2020 has been an unprecedented year for deals events, so making solid predictions based on past years is somewhat difficult. However, we can expect Amazon-branded merchandise (e.g.,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-device-launch-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"16e575f05c65752d3c4da66f84b5b446\">Kindle, Echo, Ring, etc.</a>) to be at all-time lows during Prime Day, the company's own event.&#160;</p><p>We could speculate for days whether or not retailers will be able to offer equally jaw-dropping prices as past years, but with the delays in supply chains and shipping, and demand increases, prices this year between either Prime Day or Black Friday may not be as great as in past years (if there's even enough stock).</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original

to transformations, too: reputation.&#160;</p><p>Walmart, for example, is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-perfects-employee-feedback-loop-on-artificial-intelligence-2019-8\">investing heavily in technology,</a> both as part of its epic battle with Amazon for retail dominance and from a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/10/at-sxsw-this-year-walmart-bills-itself-as-a-tech-company.html\">desire to be viewed as a software behemoth</a>. The company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ai-partners-walmart-working-with-become-a-software-giant-2020-7\">works with a slew of outside vendors</a>, but is developing <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-ai-leader-uses-3-questions-to-guide-its-efforts-2019-10\">many of applications in-house, as well</a> — like its <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-rolls-out-express-delivery-brings-orders-under-two-hours-2020-5\">recent express delivery option</a>. The overhaul is so robust that some Wall Street analysts believe Walmart's stock should be treated more like that of a tech company.</p><p>In the case of Aventiv Technologies — the parent-firm of prison communications company Securus Technologies that's backed by billionaire Tom Gores — new CEO Dave Abel is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/securus-dave-abel-tom-gores-digital-aventiv-prison-controversial-image-2020-9\">relying on a digital overhaul to rebuild a tattered public image</a>.&#160;</p><p>Securus has faced heavy criticism over the past few years for the costs it charges prison inmates to use the services, which lawsuits allege is sometimes as high as $15.99 for a 15-minute call. But Abel is promising sweeping changes and&#160;Securus poured an additional $30 million into its tech budget —&#160;on top of the $50 million it already spends annually.&#160;</p><p>\"We believe that the incarcerated community is worthy of the investment of capital. We believe they're worthy of technology,\" Abel told me. \"Part of our transformation has been convincing and demonstrating to the leadership of our company and within our company that digital transformation has the opportunity for us to refocus personnel in the organization to create greater value.\"&#160;</p><p>Abel says the company reduced the average call cost to 15 cents a minute, a 30% cut from earlier rates, and it provided 26 million free calls during the coronavirus pandemic. But that hasn't stopped some customers from <a href=\"https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/crime-courts/2020/09/20/facing-an-indefinite-ban-on-in-person-visits-families-of-alaska-prisoners-question-paid-phone-calls/\">spending hundreds of dollars a month to talk to family members</a>.</p><p>Below are a few other stories that you may have missed from the last two weeks.

Jemas, entered 2020 expecting to go full steam ahead with a new comics universe. Not only did they have decades of combined experience in the industry, but also financial backing from big-time investors like James Murdoch, the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.</p><p>But it didn't take long before they hit a complication. Their new company, Artists, Writers and Artisans (AWA), debuted its first series in March. Five days after it was released, comics distribution was halted and shops across the country closed due to the pandemic.</p><p>That first series, AWA's \"The Resistance,\" by writer J. Michael Straczynski and artist Mike Deodato Jr., was coincidentally about a virus that kills millions around the world, but gives thousands of others superpowers. It is meant to set up AWA's \"shared universe,\" similar to Marvel and DC's in which characters live in the same universe and can interact with one another.</p><p>The distribution shutdown was painful for AWA.</p><p>\"Knowing that 'The Resistance' was sitting on the racks in the comic shops and people couldn't get it was a nightmare,\" Alonso said.</p><p>But he wouldn't call the pandemic a setback for the company.</p><p>While comics distribution was shut down, AWA released \"The Resistance\" as a free digital comic, boosting awareness for the series for when the comics shutdown ended in May and readers returned to stores.&#160;</p><p>\"You have to look where there's an opportunity to be discovered in a crisis,\" Alonso said. \"People liked it, so when shops opened back up, they flew off the shelves. Comic readers are completionists. Just because they read it online doesn't deter them to buy the comic or graphic novel.\"</p><p>Alonso has experience seeing opportunity in crisis, having started AWA after exiting his position as Marvel's editor-in-chief during a 2017 sales slump.&#160;</p><p>He also has faith that AWA's vision of a new business model for comics, where risk and upside are split between the creator and publisher, will be able to entice creators to build a comics universe to compete with heavyweights Marvel and DC.</p><h2>Alonso's Marvel exit was the catalyst for AWA</h2><p>Alonso is well aware of the irony in that AWA's first series was about a pandemic, but that aligns with one of his missions for the company: reflecting the real world, which was born out of his experience at Marvel.</p><p>Alonso was editor-in-chief starting in 2011, during a time <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/marvel-insiders-describe-lack-diversity-editorial-leadership-2020-7\">when Marvel introduced bold and diverse new characters</a> like Miles Morales, a biracial Spider-Man. But when sales had decreased in 2017, Alonso was ousted.</p><p>\"One of my goals was to introduce more diversity,\" Alonso said of Marvel. \"It deeply offended some long-term fans. But to see Miles Morales on the big screen [in \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\"] was validating. It showed that being topical was a good thing. It's a foolish path to make the fans love you. Now I start the day looking at a blank canvas. You have to take chances, go with your gut, and write about the world as it is.&#160;</p><p>He was contemplating his next move in late 2018 when he got a call from Jemas, another comics veteran.</p><p>Jemas, the former president of Marvel Comics who is often credited for helping dig the company out of bankruptcy in the early 2000s, was exploring a new venture, and he wanted Alonso at his side. Jemas had previously poached Alonso for Marvel from DC in 2000.</p><p>Jemas called Alonso's departure from Marvel the spark for AWA.</p><p>\"Axel is the best there is at what he does,\" Jemas told Business Insider.</p><p>These two former Marvel execs, along with Jon Miller, the cochairman of entertainment website Fandom, joined forces for a comics company at the intersection of titanic publishers like Marvel and DC and creator-owned publishers like Image. Jemas serves as CEO, Alonso as creative chief, and Miller as board chairman.</p><p>\"In comics, you can either go to Marvel or DC and get a page rate but own nothing, or option B is creator-owned,\" Alonso said. \"You can do something original that you own and put out in the market and hope it finds an audience. If you're lucky and your book becomes the next 'Walking Dead,' you have a stable income. If not, you may not make much money.\"</p><p>AWA aims to mitigate the risks for creators when launching a creator-owned comic by guaranteeing them a financial stake in the books. At Marvel or DC, creators take on little risk but own none of the IP. At a publisher like Image, they own their IP, but take on most of the financial risk. AWA aims to split the risk between the creator and the publisher.</p><p>\"We do budget each series to be cash-flow positive, but our publishing business doesn't cover our overhead costs,\" Jemas said. \"We don't expect it to until we build up a solid backlist of graphic novels and hardcover books.\"</p><p>Jemas said that sales have been above projections. \"The Resistance\" issue one landed at No. 65 on industry website Comichron's best-selling comics of March, a list dominated by much larger publishers Marvel and DC, with more than 26,000 copies sold.&#160;</p><p>Alonso said AWA's model allows creators to \"bet on themselves without putting it all on the line.\"</p><p>That's what attracted AWA's \"Year Zero\" and \"Devil's Highway\" writer Benjamin Percy to AWA. Known for DC comics like \"Green Arrow\" and currently Marvel's \"Wolverine,\" Percy got to experiment with AWA.</p><p>\"Writing for DC and Marvel is a privilege and a joy of course, but it also comes with restrictions, because you're often the custodian of a character that's been around for decades,\" Percy told Business Insider.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7f6c3aea74820019ca608a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"AWA\" height=\"1164\" width=\"1742\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A group of AWA characters.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AWA/Mike Deodato Jr</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Hollywood is in AWA's sights</h2><p>At a time when Hollywood is increasingly looking for new IP to mine, AWA's mission attracted major investors.</p><p>They include production company Sister, which was founded by Elisabeth Murdoch (the daughter of Rupert), and Stacey Snider, the former chair and CEO of Fox's film studio; James Murdoch, the son of Rupert, who has distanced himself from his father's media empire that includes Fox News and News Corp; and the venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners.&#160;</p><p>\"There's an arms race for great content right now between Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Disney itself, with Disney Plus,\" Alex Taussig, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, told <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/james-murdoch-is-investing-his-fortune-one-bet-comic-books-11555424725\">The Wall Street Journal</a> last year.</p><p>Both Sister and James Murdoch invested at least $5 million into the company, according to WSJ. Miller, the third AWA founder who is also a former digital chief at News Corp, facilitated Murdoch's investment, WSJ said.&#160;</p><p>\"[James] Murdoch knows comic books and respected our vision,\" Alonso said. \"He loved that we were empowering creators and giving them skin in the game. He liked that creators would be invested in it and he saw potential in that.\"</p><p>The goal is to eventually make the move to Hollywood and discussions have taken place, Jemas and Percy said, but they didn't disclose further details.</p><p>\"Hollywood is hungry for IP,\" Percy said. \"One of the questions you always face with studios is the question, 'What does it look like?' You show them a comic and the whole project is already storyboarded.\"</p><p>The comics will always come first, Alonso said.&#160;</p><p>\"Our goal is to create a respected publisher first,\" he said. \"We have to make comic books first. I'm not a director or screenwriter or showrunner. I make comic books. But I want to make comic books that people would want to see on the screen.\"</p><p>But Alonso also noted, \"No one does comics saying 'I hope we just end here.'\" Once the comics universe has strong enough legs, it's inevitable that AWA will try to make the leap to movies and TV.</p><p>The future plans for those comics?</p><p>Alonso said that the second volume of \"The Resistance\" has already been written and is being drawn. He compared the books to TV seasons, meaning they'll be told in different volumes but will be an ongoing story. Readers can expect work from popular creators like Reginald Hudlin, Garth Ennis, and Frank Cho, who are all on the company's creative council.&#160;</p><p>\"The number one rule when we spoke to investors and amongst ourselves is to be patient,\" Alonso said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/former-marvel-execs-new-comics-company-awa-business-interview-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/giVwGUsBZVc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:21:55 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f7f6cb0ea74820019ca608c?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"10c9547a86ebd832fbf6517cd236ad46","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn1@2020_4/2020/10/12/17-04-53-994_7fb20812a0773641.webp","destWidth":1637,"destHeight":1228,"sourceBytes":68090,"destBytes":68090,"author":"tclark@businessinsider.com (Travis Clark)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f7f69c94c3b2e0019bb9fae?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn95@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-55-729_f0278e03691fba5a.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f7f6c3aea74820019ca608a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn88@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-52-757_21326bb6b84c79e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-05-01-063_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn14@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-05-03-489_6a4878f5360cf615.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn69@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-53-831_099d8c7f610c330c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn68@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-57-018_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=giVwGUsBZVc:LXVUqpraejg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn53@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-53-893_17d065e0ac4f72d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/giVwGUsBZVc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn37@2020_3/2020/10/12/17-05-01-084_95330f7728431ca8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522289791},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:49","title":"Gov.

committing to doing the same on YouTube.</p><p>The YouTube CEO on Monday <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/12/tech/youtube-susan-wojcicki-boss-files/index.html\">told CNN's Poppy Harlow</a> that the company is looking \"very closely\" at videos relating to the conspiracy-theory movement QAnon, but wouldn't say whether YouTube has plans to institute an outright ban, citing the movement's leaderless nature as a factor.&#160;</p><p>\"I think if you look at QAnon, part of it is that it's a grassroots movement, and so you could see just lots and lots of different people who are uploading content that has different QAnon theories,\" Wojcicki said. \"We're very proactive in terms of removing it, and I think you'll see us continue to be so.\"&#160;</p><p>Wojcicki said YouTube has implemented multiple policies to curb the spread of QAnon content, including making changes to its recommendations tool, which she said have resulted in an 80% reduction in views on QAnon videos. In addition, YouTube has already removed \"hundreds of thousands\" of QAnon videos for violating other parts of the platform's policies, like those prohibiting COVID-19 misinformation or hate and harassment, Wojcicki said.</p><p>\"I would say we already implemented a large number of different policies that have helped to maintain that in a responsible way,\" Wojcicki said, adding that YouTube's policies are continuing to evolve. \"It's not that we're not looking at it,\" she said.</p><p>QAnon is a baseless far-right conspiracy theory that claims President Donald Trump is secretly fighting a \"deep state\" cabal of satanic pedophiles and cannibals. The FBI has labeled QAnon a domestic-terrorism threat.</p><p>QAnon emerged on online message boards like 4Chan in 2017 before moving to mainstream social media sites like Facebook and YouTube, as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-still-hosts-qanon-despite-facebook-crackdown-2020-10\">Business Insider's Tom Porter pointed out</a>. YouTube has since become rife with videos promoting the conspiracy theory. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.journalism.org/2020/09/28/many-americans-get-news-on-youtube-where-news-organizations-and-independent-producers-thrive-side-by-side/\">a study from Pew Research Center</a> found that QAnon is the most commonly mentioned conspiracy theory among the most-viewed independent news channels on the platform.&#160;</p><p>When Facebook <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/addressing-movements-and-organizations-tied-to-violence/\">announced its QAnon ban</a> earlier this month, it said that it wouldn't remove individual posts pertaining to the conspiracy theory, only Facebook Pages and Groups, and Instagram accounts representing QAnon. Wojcicki told CNN that YouTube is \"very different\" from Facebook and would need to first define a clear policy around what QAnon is.&#160;</p><p>\"I think the way to approach it is by actually having the policies implemented in the right way,\" she said. \"And our platform is very different from how Facebook works. And so I think each of us will take an approach that makes the most sense for our platforms.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

morning to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett. The hearings kick off an accelerated process to confirm Barrett before the November 3 presidential election.&#160;</p><p>Barrett was nominated by President Donald Trump to fill the seat vacated by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on September 18 at the age of 87 from pancreatic cancer.&#160;</p><p>After opening statements, Barrett will undergo two long long days of questioning on her judicial record and philosophy before the committee goes to a vote.&#160;</p><h2>Who is Amy Coney Barrett?</h2><p>Barrett, a favored pick of social conservatives, was nominated and confirmed to serve as a federal judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago in 2017.</p><p>Previously, she served for fifteen years as a law professor teaching constitutional law, statutory interpretation, and the federal courts at the University of Notre Dame, where she was lauded for her scholarship and beloved by students.&#160;</p><p>A star student in law school, Coney Barrett served in clerkships for Judge Laurence Silberman of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and for former Associate Justice Antonin Scalia of the US Supreme Court, who she now identifies as her top mentor.</p><p>Coney Barrett was one of Scalia's favorite clerks, and largely embodies his judicial philosophy of textualism, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/20/us/politics/supreme-court-barrett.html\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"4c7e5d2677b2d24861e7a7f2a00b5308\">The New York Times reported.&#160;</a></p><p>At age 48, Coney Barrett could serve decades on the court if confirmed. She is also the mother of seven children and would be the first mother of school-aged children to serve on the high court.&#160;</p><h2>How long will hearings run?&#160;</h2><p>Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham said that the first day of the hearings will consist of opening statements, in which every member and Barrett herself will have ten minutes to speak.</p><p>The first day of statements is set to wrap up Monday afternoon. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Barrett will undergo two intense days of questioning from members about her judicial philosophy, her record on the bench so far, and how she might rule on future cases — especially those related to healthcare.</p><p><a

Democrats are expected to put a narrow, laser-focus on Barrett's position on the Affordable Care Act, the landmark 2009 healthcare legislation that is currently being challenged in court by Republicans.&#160;</p><p>On Thursday, the Committee will hear from a number of outside witnesses and legal experts testifying in favor of and against Barrett's confirmation to the Court.&#160;</p><p>After four days of hearings, Graham said, the Judiciary Committee will go to markup to vote on advancing her confirmation to the Senate floor on October 22.&#160;</p><h2>Where can I

ranks of competing Amazon Prime Day 2020 sales and offer discounts during a deal event. The sale starts on October 13 and runs through to October 14, just like Prime Day. During Best Buy's sale, we are likely to see discounts on, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-laptop-deals-windows-gaming-chromebook-amazon-prime-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">laptops</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-tv-streaming-box-stick-deals-prime-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">big-screen TVs</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-kitchen-deals-amazon-prime-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen appliances</a>.</p><p>Best Buy is calling its competing sale a \"Black Friday\" event, which may be confusing seeing as Black Friday is usually in November around Thanksgiving. The retailer decided to have it early this year \"to help shoppers start their shopping season early — and safely.\"</p><p>Best Buy promises that customers will have \"more ways to shop safely than ever before, including contactless curbside pickup\" plus new safety guidelines in-store.&#160;</p><bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents-sticky\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents: Masthead Sticky</bi-shortcode><h2>What deals should I expect?</h2><p>While Best Buy has yet to reveal all the discounts for the event, it highlighted a few upcoming deals.

Historically, Best Buy's Black Friday sales event occurs directly after Thanksgiving Day, so this sale is much earlier than usual.</p><p>Earlier this year, Best Buy announced that it <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/retailers-closing-their-doors-on-thanksgiving-full-list-2020-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">would be one of several companies that would close stores during Thanksgiving</a> and claimed that it would offer holiday deals earlier to accommodate for its closure.&#160;</p><p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether the deals we see on October 13 and 14 will represent the entirety of Best Buy's Black Friday sale.&#160;</p><h2>Why should I shop at Best Buy instead of Amazon?</h2><p>There is one big benefit to shopping Best Buy over Amazon: its lower price guarantee. Best Buy says that if any qualifying item purchased during Best Buy's competing sale sees a lower price before November 28, the day after Black Friday, Best Buy will refund the difference.</p><p>Purchases made from Best Buy within the holiday time frame come with a much larger return window than the usual <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Freturn-exchange-policy%2Fpcmcat260800050014.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat260800050014&subid2=1602501933080amrepvfzs&subId3=xid:fr1602501936312gdg36312gdg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">15-day limit</a> the store typically offers.

The action comes after the US military <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/cyber-command-trickbot-disrupt/2020/10/09/19587aae-0a32-11eb-a166-dc429b380d10_story.html\">escalated its efforts</a> to take down Trickbot earlier this month.</p><p>\"We have now cut off key infrastructure so those operating Trickbot will no longer be able to initiate new infections or activate ransomware already dropped into computer systems,\" Microsoft vice president of security Tom Burt wrote in a <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/12/trickbot-ransomware-cyberthreat-us-elections/\">blog post</a> on the matter.</p><p>Trickbot had used malicious code to infect more than a million devices across the globe. The hackers behind the botnet would sell their services to other hackers, using the bots to deploy Ryuk ransomware that's used to take a target's computer systems offline until they agree to pay a ransom.</p><p>Last month, Ryuk was <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uhs-hospitals-hit-by-reported-country-wide-ryuk-ransomware-attack/\">reportedly used</a> to take down the computer systems of Universal Health Services, one of the largest hospital chains in the US.

Burt said Trickbot's spam campaigns have previously used messages about COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter protests to grab people's attention and get them to click on malicious links.</p><p>The botnet could eventually resurface despite Microsoft's action, but Burt said the company plans to pursue further court orders to preempt such a revival.</p><p>\"We fully anticipate Trickbot's operators will make efforts to revive their operations, and we will work with our partners to monitor their activities and take additional legal and technical steps to stop them,\" Burt said.</p><div

Then SoulCycle battled parent company Equinox over control and branding of the product that delayed its release, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/soulcycle-scandal-ceo-melanie-whelan-spin-bullying-peloton-equinox-2020-9\">sources said.</a></p><p>As instructors bristled at pay cuts and corporate employees engaged in a culture war with Equinox during the first half of 2019, a home spin bike to challenge Peloton's provided a ray of hope, sources said.</p><p>\"SoulCycle was struggling to really innovate,\" one former senior employee said. \"The home bike was one attempt of many to try and reinvent SoulCycle.\" Many sources asked to remain anonymous for professional reasons. Their identities are known to Business Insider.</p><p>Employees said there was a major tech effort to create an internet-connected bike that could stream SoulCycle classes into riders' homes. SoulCycle executives believed the rival Peloton bike wasn't sturdy enough, its music wasn't prominent enough, and the experience was metrics-based, lacking SoulCycle's unique communal spirit that bred fiercely loyal customers.</p><p>On August 7, 2019, the day the bike was announced, news broke that Stephen Ross, the billionaire chairman of the Related Companies, which owns Equinox and SoulCycle, was&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/equinox-soulcycle-face-backlash-over-chairmans-trump-ties-2019-8\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"92c261729a695108d5a6b37a16b1b2fd\">hosting a fundraiser for President Donald Trump</a>&#160;at his Hamptons estate.</p><p>Many SoulCycle devotees&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/equinox-soulcycle-face-backlash-over-chairmans-trump-ties-2019-8\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"92c261729a695108d5a6b37a16b1b2fd\">felt betrayed</a>, with celebrities including&#160;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1159192308077563904\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"5e4772ccbc469155f7511d92f144a325\">Chrissy Teigen calling for riders to quit</a>, and riders protesting outside studios.</p><p>\"The Trump fundraiser news breaking the day they announced the home bike was an omen of many bad things to come,\" a former high-ranking SoulCycle executive said.</p><p>A corporate tug-of-war over the home bike ensued. As the tech team finished work on the first big SoulCycle product to live beyond the studios, Equinox's rapacious financial eye narrowed on the target, employees said.</p><p>Equinox chief Harvey Spevak plucked the home bike from SoulCycle and dropped it into Equinox ownership. He wanted control of the new digital product so that Equinox could extend it across its various fitness companies, former employees said. Spevak declined to comment.&#160;</p><p>\"There was a lot of drama. We wanted to do it ourselves. We didn't want to sell it. It sold it for way below ask,\" the SoulCycle insider said, adding that it was ultimately purchased at cost, for about $10 million. (Equinox, a majority owner of SoulCycle, bought the intellectual property rights in order to compensate the other minority investors.)</p><p>Key members of the home-bike team, including chief technical officer Jeremy Landis, were irate, sources said. Morale plummeted as the team watched its work get swiped by a separate company for far below value.

surprised to hear she runs a company that promotes reading and education among children.</p><p>Tuchman spent more than two years as the executive director of Teach for America's Miami-Dade branch starting in 2013. She also previously managed education projects under Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, and Michelle Ree, the former D.C. public schools chancellor.</p><p>But it wasn't until 2016 that Tuchman and her co-founder began building Caribu, a video calling app on iOS, Android, and the web that lets children read and play games with family members remotely.</p><p>In fact, the idea originated from a photo the two came across of a soldier video-chatting on a laptop in a coffee shop.&#160;</p><p>\"You see him holding up this huge picture book and facing it toward the laptop,\" Tuchman said to Business Insider. \"There should be better technology in this day and age for families who are distant from their kids to be able to share that ritual of reading a bedtime story together.\"</p><p>While the app may be best known for its wide selection of children's books that adults and children can read together virtually, Caribu also offers coloring sheets, games, drawing tools, and recipes that kids and relatives can cook together. The app comes with 15 free books or activities per calendar month and offers unlimited access for $10 per month, or $100 per year.</p><p>The company says the app is being used in more than 200 countries and territories around the world.&#160;</p><p>Caribu may not be new, but it boomed in 2020 as grandparents, aunts, and uncles were unable to visit their grandkids, nieces, and nephews for months in the pandemic's early days. The app grew by more than half a million users during the pandemic, the company says.&#160;</p><p>According to Tuchman, this was a tenfold increase that occured overnight.</p><p>\"You could say that I haven't slept since March 13,\" Tuchman said.</p><p>It's no surprise that an app like Caribu would see increased demand at a time when children were unable to attend playdates with friends, attend school in person, or visit relatives. After all, video conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet also saw a massive uptick in the first half of 2020.</p><p>Tuchman is confident that Caribu will continue to grow and is starting to pitch Caribu as an employer benefit, which can be useful for parents who may begin working remotely permanently even after the pandemic. Caribu couldn't disclose the companies it's working with to potentially offer its service as a benefit, but it did say they include financial services companies and startups.&#160;&#160;</p><p>There certainly appears to be interest in more flexible work arrangements that include at least some remote work. Even when the coronavirus is no longer a top concern, 83% of office workers say they want to work from home at least one day per week, according to a June <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/us-remote-work-survey.html\">survey from PwC</a>.&#160;</p><p>Plus, large tech firms like Twitter and Shopify have said that they will allow employees to work remotely permanently if they wish.&#160;&#160;</p><p>\"You don't need access to a gym right now,\" Tuchman said. \"You don't need access to a happy hour every Friday. You don't need free snacks. You need something like Caribu which is virtual babysitting.\"</p><p>Those digital tools are becoming increasingly important for parents and relatives who may be home-schooling their children this year.</p><p>The company also recently launched Caribu on the web and made its subscription free to teachers for the 2020-2021 school year so they can use it as a tool in virtual classrooms this fall.&#160;</p><p>Interaction that includes a lot of back-and-forth participation can be crucial for developing children's social skills, according to Kathryn Hirsh-Pasek, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a faculty fellow in Temple University's psychology department.&#160;</p><p>When reading to children, for example, parents, grandparents, and teachers don't just read the text — they connect the story to real-life experiences. Continuing these types of interactions even in virtual environments is important, Hirsh-Pasek said.</p><p>\"I like to think of it as going beyond the cover,\" Hirsh-Pasek said. \"We ask questions like, 'Oh, remember we saw a monkey at the zoo? Curious George is a monkey like that.' And the minute you connect it to personal experiences and personal narratives, you have significantly broadened the power of the interaction.\"</p><p>COVID-19 changes aside, there are always going to be frequently-traveling parents or long-distance relatives looking for ways to keep in touch with the kids in their lives, Tuchman said.</p><p>\"We help people stay connected and feel connected and feel like they're together even when they can't be,\" Tuchman said. \"We've existed in a pre-pandemic world too.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/caribu-app-reading-bedtime-stories-boomed-during-covid-19-pandemic-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/sKsHOGveWcI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:21:09 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f68d9b757b7da001ee12d73?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"a823e52e42dd1bd7963234fce3f2fed4","destWidth":3532,"destHeight":2649,"sourceBytes":283288,"destBytes":283288,"author":"leadicicco@businessinsider.com (Lisa Eadicicco)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f64f745323fc4001e0d72c1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn23@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-59-422_dc21735b04063f27.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-05-01-063_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn55@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-05-02-154_4a49efec29134808.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn1@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-04-57-709_73adb6fcc3524b04.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn68@2020_5/2020/10/12/17-04-57-018_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=sKsHOGveWcI:2CrOLjDgIuk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_1/2020/10/12/17-05-02-063_f8fb9f0b8483ec71.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/sKsHOGveWcI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn97@2020_6/2020/10/12/17-04-52-780_c97608c03283862d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602522289907},{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 01:04:49","title":"I have determined the Toyota RAV4's greatest feature: these little rubber cubbies for all of your stuff","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/2021-toyota-rav4-prime-best-interior-feature-rubber-lined-cubby-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f809dcaea74820019ca6451?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Toyota RAV4 XSE AWD_KL_52\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The very good 2021 Toyota RAV4 Prime XSE AWD.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kristen Lee/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The current generation Toyota RAV4 made a wonderful addition to its interior: rubber-lined cubbies for the driver and front passenger.</li>\n<li>There's a small one for the driver and a bigger one for the passenger.</li>\n<li>Most cars don't offer extra storage space for loose items other than door pockets or the cupholders, neither of which are ideal.

And it's not even an optional feature you have to pay extra for. It comes standard.</p><p>Essentially, it's this: a handy little cubby introduced with the <a href=\"https://jalopnik.com/the-2019-toyota-rav4-can-almost-do-it-all-1834282110\">current-generation RAV4</a>, which has been around for a few model years now.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f809dc5ea74820019ca6439?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Toyota RAV4 XSE AWD_KL_32\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Look, I&#39;m creature of simple taste.

Or are you just dumping all your knick-knacks into a cupholder and calling it a day?</p><p>It's true that cupholders are for drinks, but drinks aren't the only loose items we bring into cars. Most of us are forced to stick phones, wallets, sunglasses, pens, change, keys, lip balm, moisturizer, garage key cards, charging cables, hand sanitizer, face masks, ketchup packets, and vapes (hey, I don't know your life) into whatever free space we can find in our cars for safekeeping while we drive.</p><p>More often than not, stuff ends up in the cupholders.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f809dc5ea74820019ca643c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Toyota RAV4 XSE AWD_KL_64\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>What would you put here?\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kristen Lee/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>For its fifth and current generation, the RAV4 does away with that forced packing. It gives us two rubber-lined cubbies that run along the dashboard. There's a long one for the front passenger and a short one for the driver, and it's a wonderful use of otherwise dead space.</p><p>In the 10 or so days that I spent with the RAV4 Prime — which was excellent, and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rav4-toyota-plug-in-hybrid-first-drive-review-suv-mpg-2020-10\">you should read the full review</a> — I made full use of those cubbies. As everyone who carries a purse knows, you don't always want to take it with you everywhere, especially if you're just running out for a quick errand.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f809dc4ea74820019ca6436?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Toyota RAV4 XSE AWD_KL_37\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This is perfect for car keys or a phone.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kristen Lee/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Sometimes you just want to bring your wallet and your phone. Both of these fit perfectly in the cubby, as does the RAV4's key. The cubby is also far more convenient than putting things in door pockets, since those tend to be deep and it's easy to forget you've put something there.</p><p>The RAV4's cubbies are eye-level so you can easily see if you've left anything there. The rubber lining makes them both easy to clean and able to keep the items you put there from sliding around so much. A little lip helps prevent&#160;things from rolling out onto the floor.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f80c9cd4c3b2e0019bba4b3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2018_Toyota_RAV4_Adventure_18_C37AC3A0E0DB83995045655A6EBA83522CB28268\" height=\"1431\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The interior of the previous-gen RAV4: Cubby-less.

Real people carry stuff with them, and that stuff needs a place to go.</p><p>With the RAV4, you can have a spot for your stuff <em>and </em>both you and your passenger can still have a cupholder apiece. You can have your cake and eat it, too.</p><p>The next time I get into a cramped sports car with zero storage space — where I've wedged my wallet between the seat and the door, I'm sitting on my phone, and the keys are God knows where — I'll be thinking back wistfully to a cubby-lined RAV4 that treated me right.</p><figure>\n\t<img

After the Cold War ended, however, it was converted to carry conventional munitions and is no longer officially designated as a nuclear delivery system — though it could be reconfigured for this purpose at any time.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.military.com/equipment/b-2-spirit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">B-2 Spirit</a>, with its distinctive flying-wing design, was the first US bomber built with \"stealth\" capabilities (meant to avoid detection by enemy radar systems) and is configured to carry both nuclear and conventional weaponry.

Six months into the pandemic, if you haven't set up a proper home office yet, it's time to step away from the kitchen table and create a real, dedicated work space.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>The number one priority — from my lens as an engineer and the CEO of a <a href=\"https://www.diffagency.com/\">100-plus person agency</a> — has to be <em>intentionality</em>. Being deliberate about the office you set up is critical. In fact, the opportunity to do this is one of the unexpected boons of this entire work-from-home experience. The fact is the traditional<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/brit-morse/remote-work-survey-owl-labs.html\"> office environment — from 9-5 to cubicles to dress codes — didn't work for everyone</a>. If there's one unexpected benefit of the massive shift to work from home, it's that it has given us a unique chance to personalize how, where and even when we work.&#160;</p><p>At home, we're free to tailor our space to what suits us and our needs. Here's a glimpse into my own set-up — not as a model to emulate, but as an example of what personalization and being deliberate can look like in practice.&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Invest in stuff you really need — and stuff that makes you really comfortable</strong></h2><p>As an engineer, I try to be pragmatic: You don't need the latest tech toy, but quality tools you really like will keep you dialed in. I've learned that simplicity goes a long way when paired with a few luxurious touches.&#160;</p><p>Obvious one here, but an ergonomic chair might be the best investment you'll make. It will make your workday easier on your body and you'll be able to sustain longer work sessions and feel happier doing it. (At my company, we've provided <a href=\"https://www.humanscale.com/products/seating\">Humanscale ergonomic chairs</a> to all employees for exactly this reason.)</p><p>That low-res monitor? It's a waste of desk space. Cycling through windows (or worse, relying on multiple monitors) is unproductive and frustrating. With a high res monitor, I find that I don't have to split my attention as much. Even stuff like the right mouse and keyboard matter. I have an <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA22LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english\">Apple Magic Keyboard</a> that is light, wireless and portable so I can switch up my setting when I need a change of scenery.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Building a great home office doesn't mean you have to spend a lot on gear. In fact, some of the things that make me happiest working from home are low-cost, but intentional, touches. My leather keyboard pad and mouse pad are small things, but whenever my hands hit the surface in front of me, it's a grounding reminder of where I am. I also have a <a href=\"https://www.yeti.com/en_CA/drinkware/rambler-414-ml-mug/70000000335.html#start=1\">Yeti coffee mug</a> that keeps my coffee warm for hours.&#160;</p><p>And let's not forget about art — <em>your art</em>, not some generic office art. I've got an art deco take on Sunset Strip on my wall that's a family heirloom. Contemplating art that moves you can actually help your focus, make you<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/11/795010044/feeling-artsy-heres-how-making-art-helps-your-brain\"> more hopeful</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/abstract-art-mindset-study\">improve your decision making</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>Outsmarting distraction</strong></h2><p>Whatever gear or decor you choose, your home office will fall short without one additional step: insulating yourself from distraction.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Before the pandemic struck, employees were<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/06/a-plan-for-managing-constant-interruptions-at-work\"> interrupted every six to 12 minutes</a>. Now, it's got to be far worse, between juggling personal and work lives under the same roof, yet another Zoom meeting, and constant coronavirus updates. For all these reasons, building and sustaining focus is one of the most important parts of remote work.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Step one: turn your notifications off. You don't have to go so far as giving up your smartphone<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-ceo-give-up-smartphone-dumb-phone-better-leader-2019-11#limited-contact-equals-better-leadership-2\"> like I did</a>, but be disciplined about giving your<a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/science-clear-multitasking-doesnt-work/\"> undivided attention to the task at hand</a>. Quick hack: I've started using a <a href=\"https://bulletjournal.com/\">bullet journal</a> instead of relying on digital schedulers or to-do lists. When I think of something I need to come back to, or an item for my to-do list, I jot it down by hand. An analog notebook <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90469534/how-to-use-a-bullet-journal-to-kickstart-your-mindfulness-practice\">keeps me mindful</a> without derailing my focus.&#160;</p><p>I've even found that it's important to be more intentional with my media consumption so I don't get overwhelmed by all the bad news. In the early days of quarantine it was easy to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200505-coronavirus-how-much-news-is-too-much\">fall prey to information overload</a>. Forty-three percent of Americans say the news makes them <a href=\"https://www.journalism.org/2020/04/29/about-seven-in-ten-u-s-adults-say-they-need-to-take-breaks-from-covid-19-news/\">feel emotionally worse</a> and I can relate. Particularly in a time of crisis, it's important to guard your mental space. Now I spend 10 to 20 minutes cycling through news from a few different trusted sources every couple of days. I focus on what I'm interested in and that's it — no more mindless <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2020/09/22/doomscrolling-isnt-helping-our-well-being-warn-experts/\">doom scrolling</a>.&#160;</p><p>Ultimately, work-from-home success depends on something we've largely forgotten how to do: monotask. More than any technique, this is a mindset: the understanding (backed by science) that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/fashion/monotasking-drop-everything-and-read-this-story.html\">we get way more done</a> when we're doing one thing at a time. Working from home can actually nurture this kind of focus if you take control of your environment.&#160;</p><p>This also means setting clear boundaries for when work stops. Without the cues of the office, working hours have become more nebulous. During the pandemic's early weeks, <a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/you-re-right-you-are-working-longer-and-attending-more-meetings\">the average workday increased</a> by 8.2% worldwide. To keep my personal life separate from my work life, I think about how many hours a day I'm going to work and, when I meet them, I'm done. Communicate your working hours to your team and invite them to do the same for you. When your workday is over, turn your computer off — like all the way off, not just to sleep — to signal to yourself that you've clocked out.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Getting to know your team beyond the water cooler</strong></h2><p>Remote work has reinforced the fact that we're all individual people, not cogs in a machine, and<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00963/full\"> we work better</a> when we're treated as such. As a leader, I've realized how counterintuitive it was to expect everyone to thrive in the<a href=\"https://www.thearticle.com/the-death-of-the-office\"> traditional office environment</a>. What's needed, more than anything, is choice.&#160;</p><p>This experience has actually transformed how I approach my team. Instead of fixating on getting back to the office, at my company we are doing what we can to help people thrive at home. For starters, we've allowed anyone to take any gear from the office that they want to use at home, and we're also moving away from blanket policies that treat everyone like they're the same. We're working to find ways to meet our organizational goals by being more respectful of people's singular needs. This means being open to different work schedules or hours for different people on the team.</p><p>For all the challenges of working from home, we have a golden opportunity to start to redefine work on our terms. How we set up our home office is a big part of that. Whether that means fancy gear, cool art, or extra soundproofing, the point is that the choice is yours. Take it.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-crudo/\"><em>Ben Crudo</em></a><em> is CEO of </em><a href=\"https://www.diffagency.com/?utm_medium=pr&utm_source=csuite&utm_campaign=benpublicationsications\"><em>Diff Agency</em></a><em>.

consequences</a>. But, an army of teens is rising to combat misinformation. Trained through <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/teen-fact-checking-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Poynter's MediaWise Teen Fact-Checking Network</a>, they have learned how to discern fact from fiction online.</p><p>The teen fact-checkers warn that misinformation typically provokes a strong emotional reaction from its consumers — and, combined with falsehood and inaccuracy, the false \"facts\" only serve to stoke long-held divisions and fuel political polarization. Often defined as digital natives, these Gen Z-ers view it as their responsibility to spread awareness about the dangers of believing what you read online.</p><p>Poynter's MediaWise Teen Fact-Checking Network, targeted toward middle- and high-schoolers, teaches Gen Z teens how to spot and debunk misinformation online. With the help of the Google News Initiative, the MediaWise program has trained over 100 teens since the program began in 2018. Together, they've produced more than 400 fact-checks in line with <a href=\"https://www.ifcncodeofprinciples.poynter.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">editorial standards from the International Fact-Checking Network</a>.</p><p>In July, MediaWise fact-checker Thea Barrett, 18, came across an infographic-style image that quoted US Education Secretary <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/betsy-devos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Betsy DeVos</a> as saying that \"only 0.02%\" of K-12 children would die if they went back to school amid the coronavirus pandemic. The post's point: 0.02% still meant 14,740 children would die. When Barrett first saw the post on her feed, she immediately believed it. She didn't share it on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook where it was rapidly spreading, but for days talked about it with friends and family.&#160;</p><p>Then she <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY880KBDBnc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fact-checked it for MediaWise</a>.</p><p>\"No part of it was true,\" she said. \"Every single part of it was false. And I just believed it because it spiked emotion in me, and it agreed with my reality, but I didn't even think about the fact that those numbers were made up. It was a false quote.\"</p><p>As Barrett and outlets such as <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/devos-only-student-deaths/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Snopes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/07/14/fact-check-devos-never-said-only-0-02-kids-die-if-schools-open/5433134002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USA Today</a> found, not only was the 14,740 number incorrect (0.02% of total US K-12 students would actually be about 11,000 children), but so was the entire statement attributed to DeVos. Despite there being no record of DeVos ever making that claim, the piece of misinformation went viral — it wasn't just shared by Gen Z-ers, but also by teachers, students, and concerned citizens across generations.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f778de2282c500018c7866d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"thea barret fact check\" height=\"953\" width=\"536\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>With the help of MediaWise, Thea Barrett created a YouTube tutorial fact-checking the viral claim attributed to Betsy DeVos.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Grace Eliza Goodwin/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>MediaWise's fact-checking program trains teens to look out for widely circulated claims like this one. According to Katy Byron, program manager at MediaWise, the three most common types of online misinformation come in the forms of manipulated videos and photos (including what's commonly referred to as \"cheap fakes\"), manipulated infographics, and screenshots of content from one platform that get cross-posted to another platform and manipulated along the way. The network encourages its fact-checkers to ask three critical questions when they encounter any information online, no matter how reputable the source may seem: who is behind the information, what is the evidence, and what do other sources say.&#160;</p><p>It's not just teens who believe false information shared online. According to a <a href=\"https://www.journalism.org/2016/12/15/many-americans-believe-fake-news-is-sowing-confusion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study conducted by Pew Research Center in 2016</a>, about a quarter of Americans say they have shared inaccurate or false news online, whether they were aware of it or not. In fact, a misconception about misinformation is that it's only an older generation that succumbs to inaccurate or out-of-context claims online.&#160;</p><p>But according to Byron, \"a lot of people assume that teenagers — because they're digitally savvy and grew up with the internet — are better at identifying misinformation. But that is not true.\" MediaWise believes that regardless of one's generation, upbringing, or level of access to technology, media literacy is something that must be taught.&#160;</p><p>According to Barrett, what was so effective about the false Betsy DeVos statement was that it sparked a strong emotional reaction in those who believed and shared it, and it confirmed their existing beliefs by providing facts and numbers — however untrue they turned out to be — about the danger of reopening schools. Barrett believes that because misinformation triggers emotion and stirs confirmation bias, it can fuel the deeply polarized divide between political parties, or anyone of opposing viewpoints.&#160;</p><p>\"Misinformation really does just start to seep into our communities, and so I think that plays a huge role in causing that divide to grow. Because if there's already a gap, and then you're putting false information out to grow that gap, and you're adding a lot of uncertainty or a lot of emotion into that,\" she said, \"of course that's going to make two parties separate even more.\"</p><p>For one of MediaWise's current teen fact-checkers, Bridgette Adu-Wadier, 17, misinformation feels exacerbated by a fast-paced news climate where consumers devour information without stopping to think critically.&#160;</p><p>\"Media literacy involves knowing how to fact-check information on your own, as well as being aware of how the media shapes public opinion, especially through bias,\" she said. \"I think a lot of people overlook how impactful headlines can be and how they can shape people's perceptions and prejudices, especially involving reports on police brutality, and how they describe people of color involved in those events.\"</p><p>Adu-Wadier views it as her responsibility, and everyone's, to take control of their news consumption by slowing down and fact-checking. A self-described history nerd, she believes that \"misinformation is so harmful because at a certain point, this present that we're living in is going to be in those history textbooks that students read. Facts are important because they fuel history as well as journalism. And facts help combat misinformation and biases that can keep people from understanding the bigger picture.\"</p><p>Barrett and Adu-Wadier have used their training to help others understand that just because something is portrayed as news online, doesn't mean it's true. Although it's one small corner of the internet they're shaping, they're hopeful that it will lead to lasting change.&#160;</p><p>\"We're not changing the world right here, but we are slowly making people more aware of the information they're putting out into the world. And that is how we stop the spread of misinformation,\" Barrett said. \"I believe that it's on all of us to be critical thinkers. And so, I am hopeful that one day we will be at a point where we don't have to stress about the amount of misinformation in our world.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a
