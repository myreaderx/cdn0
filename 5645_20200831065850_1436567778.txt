The considered systems are bicrystal with Σ5[010] tilt plane boundary, spherical grain with initial curvature radius 5 nm, and polycrystalline 30 nm × 30 nm × 30 nm block. The motion of three types of GBs (flat, spherical, and polycrystalline) at constant temperatures and no applied forces is studied. The obtained values of activation energy are 0.45, 0.11, and 0.57 eV for flat, spherical, and polycrystalline types of GBs, respectively. These values are smaller than those that are reported in experimental works, which is a common issue for atomistic simulations of GB migration. Possible sources of such disagreement and ways to overcome it are discussed. The particular part of this work is devoted to the development of the automated analysis of polycrystalline structure. This analysis provides detailed information on grain size distribution and its evolution in time.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 17:36:30 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bbee89a7-686a-4cff-8a9a-dc3de5f5aa76/adem202000115-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"fbdac1e7a6904307b74701e0b4af9a2b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn32@2020_5/2020/08/31/06-57-18-047_f6029e70f44c4d6a.webp","destWidth":382,"destHeight":394,"sourceBytes":248365,"destBytes":20130,"author":"\nMariia A.

However, the reduction of ZnO particles by molten Mg destroys the crystal structure and restricts its refinement efficiency. Herein, alumina/silica sol–gel coatings are prepared on the surface of micrometer‐sized ZnO, forming a ZnO core sol‐coating shell structure to improve the thermal stability of the ZnO. Experimental observations indicate that the refining effect of ZnO is significantly enhanced by the presence of alumina‐silica sol (ASS) coatings and the core‐shell structure. The addition of 1.5 wt% ASS‐coated ZnO particles to Mg reduced the grain size from ≈3200 to 65 μm. The grain size of the Mg‐3wt%Al‐1 wt%‐Zn alloy (AZ31) can also be refined from 145 to 82 μm. Scanning electron microscopy and X‐ray powder diffraction reveals that the sol coating partly maintain the crystal structure of ZnO. More unreduced ZnO and related solid redox products are reproducibly observed within the refined Mg grains, which promote heterogeneous nucleation of Mg. Zn, and Al solute produced by relative reduction and unreduced ZnO on grain boundaries also contribute to refinement. In addition, the ASS coating also increase the refining efficiency of ZnO for Mg and AZ31 at various cooling rates.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 17:51:18 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d7eadd2c-01c3-446b-9604-ba540b303a7c/adem202000329-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"6581f180138add2acc5a88679a19769a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn99@2020_1/2020/08/31/06-57-24-130_ed2f4145888e6f86.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":369,"sourceBytes":207168,"destBytes":31574,"author":"\nRui Cao, \nMeng Meng\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d7eadd2c-01c3-446b-9604-ba540b303a7c/adem202000329-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn99@2020_1/2020/08/31/06-57-24-130_ed2f4145888e6f86.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035077},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Dynamic Tensile Deformation of High Strength Aluminum Alloys Processed Following Novel Thermomechanical Treatment Strategies","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000193?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1903fa37-75fd-4ec6-b332-aa37186fa7ce/adem202000193-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Dynamic Tensile Deformation of High Strength Aluminum Alloys Processed Following Novel Thermomechanical Treatment Strategies\"/>\n<p>The effects of different cooling rates within a novel thermomechanical process on the microstructural evolution and dynamic tensile deformation behavior of two aluminum alloys are investigated.

The proposed functionally graded phononic crystals are formed by an array of unit cells with different topological geometries, where the topological geometries of the unit cell are tailored to obtain the frequency bandgap guided by the wave destructive interference. Meanwhile, the frequency bandgap with a target width is obtained by combining the design concept of the gradient‐index phononic crystals.

The investigated alloys are based on Ti‐45Al‐5Nb‐0.2B‐0.2C with varying aluminum content. Sintering at 1500 °C/2 h led to low porosity and good mechanical properties at room and high temperatures. Compression creep at 800 °C/350 350 MPa indicated that the effect of porosity is secondary to colony size.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>The effect of Al variations in the sintering behavior and creep resistance is investigated in powder‐metallurgy‐processed titanium aluminides based on the alloy TNB‐V5 (Ti‐45Al‐5Nb‐0.2B‐0.2C at%). Two compositions are prepared with Al‐contents of 43 and 47 at%, varying Al‐content by ±2 at% relative to the reference material TNB‐V5. Specimen preparation is conducted by metal injection molding using feedstock prepared with mixtures of prealloyed and elemental powders. The sinterability of alloys with addition of elemental powders decreases in comparison to the reference material, according to dilatometry experiments. However, in experiments with the sintering furnace, it is possible to obtain porosity with values of ≈10% by sintering at 1450 °C, whereas sintering at 1500 °C decreases the porosity to less than 1% in case of 43 at% and 45 at% of Al. Even though the alloy containing 47 at% Al shows higher porosity of about 7%, the creep resistance is superior to 43 at% Al, which can be attributed to a larger colony size. In tensile tests at room temperature, the effect of porosity is very detrimental leading to significantly reduced tensile strength and total elongation. Nevertheless, in compressive creep tests, the effect of porosity is secondary to colony size.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:54:09 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/26e094b6-8332-45e2-aa27-4846656c2fc6/adem202000377-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"c6e14e47e50399209543b68344e10d06","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/31/06-57-22-724_d61eb6aa88b917de.webp","destWidth":427,"destHeight":394,"sourceBytes":225610,"destBytes":32844,"author":"\nJuliano Soyama, \nWolfgang Limberg, \nThomas Ebel, \nFlorian Pyczak\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/26e094b6-8332-45e2-aa27-4846656c2fc6/adem202000377-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/31/06-57-22-724_d61eb6aa88b917de.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035074},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Potential of Graphene‐Polymer Composites for Ligament and Tendon Repair – A Review","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000492?af=R","description":"\n<p>Tendon/ligament injuries are debilitating conditions that affect the life quality of a great percentage of the adult population. Several challenges still need to be addressed regarding the repair of these tissues, as current treatments show limited success. The use of biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric scaffolds could potentially help accomplish a complete and long‐term functional repair but, unfortunately, these materials lack adequate mechanical properties to be used in such demanding applications. Graphene has been a subject of interest for tissue‐repair applications due to its electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. If incorporated adequately, it may significantly improve the physical properties of the composite, even at small loadings. Furthermore, graphene presents a biocompatible surface that may enhance cell adhesion proliferation and differentiation and has demonstrated promising outcomes in several <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> biological applications. Therefore, in this review, it is explored the potential of graphene materials for the reinforcement of biodegradable polymers of interest for tendon/ligament repair. The effect of graphene on relevant features such as mechanical properties, biodegradability and biocompatibility is revised, in order to understand the feasibility of these composites to fulfill the requirements associated with these tissues and conclude how their applicability can be extended to this field.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.

The GO bulk prepared by vacuum infusion using a porous GO sponge as a frame is smashed in the resin by the large shear force generated through the high‐speed stirring method. It is found that GO sheets have a highly dispersion in the BMI resin.

The β phase existing in TiAl alloy can improve the hot‐workability, but deteriorates the creep properties. Preparing a β phase‐containing TiAl base alloy to enhance the hot‐workability before hot deformation and eliminating the β/B2 phase by post‐heat treatment to improve the service performance is a good strategy. In this paper, a significant volume fraction of β phase was obtained in the Ti‐46Al‐4Nb‐0.1B alloy by the elemental powder metallurgy (EPM), and the β/B2 phase was eliminated by the subsequent heat treatment. The results demonstrate that the microstructure of the EPMed Ti‐46Al‐4Nb‐0.1B alloy predominantly consists of α<sub>2</sub>/γ lamellar colonies, equiaxial γ grains, and some randomly distributed β phase and σ‐Nb<sub>2</sub>Al phase. The β/B2 phase formed at the Nb‐enriched regions caused by insufficient diffusion. The EPMed Ti‐46Al‐4Nb‐0.1B alloy had a relatively low thermal deformation activation energy (<i>Q</i>, 410 kJ/mol), showed a well hot‐workability. The existence of the β phase is advantageous to harmonize the deformation of α<sub>2</sub>/γ lamellar grains and to improve the deformability of the TiAl alloy.

The polymers and natural materials e.g. poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene)‐poly(styrenesulfonate), shellac dielectric and β‐carotene, indigo semiconductor inks were implemented using jettable formulations, that are either commercially procured or self‐formulated, designed explicitly to deposit fundamental layers for capacitors and TFTs. Several crucial parameters were evaluated and adjusted to precisely define a layer's thickness, topology and geometry, matching with the properties of a fully bio‐degradable Ormocere® substrate, explicitly developed for the specific biological applications. Furthermore, these parameters support in acquiring the intended electrical properties of layers i.e. conductivity, insulation, semi‐conductivity, capacitance, and current vs. voltage characteristics. The entire manufacturing process of electronic devices was accomplished fully on the bio‐degradable Ormocere® substrate under ambient conditions and maximum curing temperature of 60 °C. The results exhibit that the electrical characteristics of the printed functional layers and devices show direct influence to the physical geometry of the printed features. A fully printed capacitor demonstrates an average capacitance of 10 pF/mm<sup>2</sup>(1 nF/cm<sup>2</sup>), whereas the TFTs show p‐type (β‐carotene) and n‐type (indigo) characteristics with maximum channel current of 0.18 – 5 µA and field effect mobility in range of 6×10<sup>‐4</sup> to 7×10<sup>‐2</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/ V·s. These electrical properties of the manufactured devices allow their implementation into medical applications, where they would work for a defined time‐frame.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.

To adjust the grain microstructures in the initially twin‐roll cast feedstocks, they are differently treated to generate different grain sizes in the near‐surface areas. Semi‐finished products of the same near‐surface microstructure are then joined by warm roll‐bonding. In industrial applications, it is common to influence the bond strength of clads by applying a post heat treatment. Therefore, a part of the samples was annealed after warm roll bonding. Post‐treated samples with coarser grain size exhibit up to two times higher peel strength than untreated samples. Higher peel strengths of the post‐treated samples can be explained both by improved diffusion bonding due to heat exposure, and by recrystallization and grain coarsening of microstructure in the interface of sheets. Increase in peel strength of the composites made of feedstocks with coarser grains can be the result of stronger grain rotation, which damages oxide layer on the interface. To summarize, twin‐roll cast and soaked material with the coarsest grains in the near‐surface areas is the best feedstock for roll‐bonding, if an additional heat treatment is applied.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:54:09 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/276b5478-fa84-4e5f-9c2f-4f4bb74b55dd/adem202000130-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"20acad12ade2f9dd387aaadcd3a40289","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-18-228_202104fa7b9d4e3c.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":386,"sourceBytes":96473,"destBytes":20184,"author":"\nOlexandr Grydin, \nManuel Matzelt, \nAnatolii Andreiev, \nYaroslav Frolov, \nMirko Schaper\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/276b5478-fa84-4e5f-9c2f-4f4bb74b55dd/adem202000130-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-18-228_202104fa7b9d4e3c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035074},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Superparamagnetic manganese ferrite and strontium bioactive glass nanocomposites: Enhanced biocompatibility and antimicrobial properties for hyperthermia application","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000275?af=R","description":"\n<p>In this report, the strontium bioactive glass with ferrite composites are studied for the application of biocompatibility and magnetic hyperthermia.

The morphology and material composition influence the effective thermophysical properties of macroporous ceramic structures and interphase transport in interactions with the working fluid. Therefore, tailoring these properties can enable significant performance enhancements by modulating thermal transport, reactivity, and stability. However, conventional ceramic‐matrix fabrication techniques limit the ability for tailoring the porous structure and optimizing the performance of these systems, such as by introducing anisotropic morphologies, pore‐size gradations, and variations in pore connectivity and material properties.

The benefits of pore‐structure tailoring are illustrated experimentally for interstitial combustion in a porous‐media burner operating with a smoothly graded matrix structure.

The microstructure and magnetic properties of as‐cast alloy, unoriented (UN), and oriented (OR) composite materials are examined by X‐ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and strain gauge method. The results show that the Pr‐doped Fe–Ga as‐cast samples consist of A2 matrix phase and rare‐earth‐rich phase. As the Pr content increases, the grain sizes of A2 matrix phase decrease. The OR composite materials show significant magnetic anisotropy. Compared with as‐cast and UN composite materials, the magnetostriction of OR composite materials increase.

The electrical behavior of seven screen‐printed electrodes (Ag, Ag/PEDOT:PSS, Ag/AgCl, Ag/AgCl/PEDOT:PSS, C, C/AgCl, and PEDOT:PSS) is compared to two commercially available gel electrodes (3M RedDot 50 and Philips NeoLead) which represent the state‐of‐the‐art. After basic standard electrical characterization (electrode–electrode impedance, direct current [DC] offset voltage, defibrillation recovery, bias stress, and noise), it is shown that layers such as AgCl or PEDOT:PSS help to reduce the contact impedance of dry electrodes. However, the quality of the electrical signal is primarily governed by the skin impedance, which, without physical disruption or preparation, maintains a high impedance. For this reason, the impedance of all screen‐printed dry electrodes allows the collection of electrocardiograms with a quality equal to that of gel electrodes. Dry electrodes, while capable of obtaining similar electrical signal quality also bring the advantages of reusability, comfort, and the capability for long‐term measurements.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 17:32:24 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/36f6bcd9-dbb1-4d27-9919-cadcb10e18de/adem202000714-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"618a9d5960a1dbe0b8891a1e9eda2c6a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_2/2020/08/31/06-57-18-213_4067c3e3fa6c22b0.webp","destWidth":355,"destHeight":394,"sourceBytes":93930,"destBytes":2194,"author":"\nPeter Zalar, \nMilan Saalmink, \nDaniele Raiteri, \nJeroen van den Brand, \nEdsger C.

The low homogenization temperature (440 °C) also contributes to the size reduction and increases the number density of dispersoids. Air cooling after homogenization (holding temperature ≥500 °C) results in Q‐AlCuMgSi precipitation, which depends on the precipitated substrate of the α‐AlFeMnCrSi dispersoids.

Although drag reduction of aqueous flows in lithographically patterned microchannels has been widely explored, herein drag reduction of oil flows within macroscopic tubing spanning several feet in length is demonstrated. Multiscale texturation is derived from the introduction of micron‐sized pits during electroless deposition of nickel and is augmented by nanoscale texturation derived from the incorporation of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) beads within the coating. Further functionalization with a monolayer of 1<i>H</i>,1<i>H</i>,2<i>H</i>,2<i>H</i>‐perfluorooctanephosphonic acid yields a surface that is not wetted by water or viscous oils, yielding 17% drag reduction under laminar flow for castor oil and a slip length that approaches 329 μm. The results demonstrate a promising solution for obtaining robust plastronic architectures embedded within the inner walls of macroscopic tubing. The performance of such coatings is constrained primarily by the robustness of plastrons and molecular properties of the flow liquid with the latter modifying the solid/liquid interface energy as a result of surface adsorption.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:54:09 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fba1a532-fde8-435b-b286-770e5f5e1a71/adem202000333-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"84c271fc7fdc1998f11e08d76ab94482","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn53@2020_5/2020/08/31/06-57-19-834_93f0f12ee95333d8.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":91,"sourceBytes":71666,"destBytes":10946,"author":"\nNicholas Cool, \nLacey Douglas, \nSubodh Gupta, \nSarbajit Banerjee\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fba1a532-fde8-435b-b286-770e5f5e1a71/adem202000333-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn53@2020_5/2020/08/31/06-57-19-834_93f0f12ee95333d8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035073},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Deformation Behavior of Superalloy Powder Compact under Hot Isostatic Pressing","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000534?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/73d7d940-0f81-4e67-94e8-9ce44b6ed306/adem202000534-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Deformation Behavior of Superalloy Powder Compact under Hot Isostatic Pressing\"/>\n<p>This work demonstrates the deformation behavior of a superalloy powder compact under hot isostatic pressing (HIP) using a finite element method.

The coefficients of the constitutive model are obtained from interrupted HIP experiments. Finite element calculation results for the shape change of the powder compact under HIP agree well with the experimental results. Isothermal HIP and containerless HIP, both of which are based on finite element simulations, are conducted to study the dependence of the deformation on the container and temperature gradient. The stress state in all of the regions in the powder body deviates from the isostatic state of the compact even under isostatic pressing, due to the introduction of von Mises stress under the strong influence of the container. The temperature gradient is affected by the characteristic thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of the porous powder body and container. Nonuniform temperature and stress distribution result in nonuniform densification, which eventually results in uneven powder compact shrinkage.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 17:30:40 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/73d7d940-0f81-4e67-94e8-9ce44b6ed306/adem202000534-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"defa01ae909fa5a6b538e26996db6d96","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_1/2020/08/31/06-57-15-621_60ff145aca64328c.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":380,"sourceBytes":129752,"destBytes":20566,"author":"\nZonghong Qu, \nPingxiang Zhang, \nShujin Liang, \nYunjin Lai, \nCheng Luo\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/73d7d940-0f81-4e67-94e8-9ce44b6ed306/adem202000534-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_1/2020/08/31/06-57-15-621_60ff145aca64328c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035076},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Benchmarking of Inkjet Printing Methods for Combined Throughput and Performance","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000679?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/97e6be40-8945-4ddf-8eff-42b53aeda46c/adem202000679-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Benchmarking of Inkjet Printing Methods for Combined Throughput and Performance\"/>\n<p>A silver‐based ink, having Ag nanoparticles of an average size of 10 nm and uniformly dispersed, is deposited on a Desmopan 9370AU substrate using inkjet printing to allow precise deposition of the droplets.

The bottom layer consists of coarsely near‐equiaxed β grains with martensite α′ and basket‐weave structure, and the columnar β grains grow perpendicularly from middle layer to top layer.

Also, the complex deformation mechanisms are analyzed. It is found that, as the strain is gradually increased, the flow stress first rises, and then the stable stress appears without a tangible peak. The microstructures exhibit large elongated grains, and only a few small new grains appear under most deformation conditions. It is because the dynamic recovery (DRV) is the dominat softening mechanism. Based on the measured data, both the original Johnson–Cook (O–JC) model and modified Johnson–Cook model (M–JC) are built for the tested aluminum alloy. However, there are different deviations between the experimental and the predicted true stresses by O–JC model, as well as M–JC model. Considering the obvious DRV features, an enhanced Johnson–Cook (EH–JC) model is proposed by introducing the stress–dislocation relation. The accuracy of the EH–JC model is validated since the correlation coefficient between the experimental and predicted results is as high as 0.997, while the average absolute relative error is merely 2.84%.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.

Herein, a novel accessible methodology is provided for integrating waste wood fibers, a versatile renewable resource of cellulose, into polylactic acid (PLA) polymers to produce sustainable wood‐fiber reinforced PLA (WF‐PLA) filaments and then to 3D print high‐performance architected cellular composites. The experimental results demonstrate increased stiffness (18%), ultimate strength (9%), fracture strain (15%), toughness (44%), thermal conductivity (23%), and reduced overall density (10%) for 3D‐printed composite dogbones made of optimum wood‐fiber contents, compared with the PLA counterpart. Following the growing interest in architected cellular solids, a rising class of advanced materials with superior multifunctional properties, WF‐PLA filaments are used to 3D print two quasi‐isotropic cellular materials, hexagonal and novel mixed square (“isomixed”) microarchitectures. The WF‐PLA isomixed cell exhibits considerably enhanced stiffness (91%) and ultimate strength (48%) compared with the PLA hexagonal honeycombs. The WF‐PLA architected composites offer a first‐of‐a‐kind strategy to additively manufacture sustainable advanced materials with enhanced thermomechanical properties out of low‐cost waste materials through an optimized material composition and the rational design of underlying microarchitectures.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 09:46:19 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c346c7a3-6376-4fa1-b495-3a55b58cd531/adem202000565-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"ea7dd8c7d8320a7ae8c57e0015f2b721","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn28@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-17-109_91627a640a4a35cb.webp","destWidth":428,"destHeight":394,"sourceBytes":229573,"destBytes":37408,"author":"\nEhsan Estakhrianhaghighi, \nArmin Mirabolghasemi, \nYingnan Zhang, \nLarry Lessard, \nAbdolhamid Akbarzadeh\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c346c7a3-6376-4fa1-b495-3a55b58cd531/adem202000565-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn28@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-17-109_91627a640a4a35cb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035075},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Processing of large‐scale microporous group on copper foil current collectors for lithium batteries using femtosecond laser","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000710?af=R","description":"\n<p>Owing to thin thickness (∽8 μm) and soft nature of copper foil current collectors, it is extremely difficult to process large‐scale micro‐nano holes on their surface. In this study, trepanning drilling of copper foil current collector with a 1030‐nm femtosecond laser system was investigated with emphasis to develop the processing technology of copper foil current collectors with different entry and exit sizes while maintaining good hole quality. The effects of laser parameters on the processing quality of copper foil current collectors were comprehensively studied. The relationship between geometric morphology and processing parameters as well as the formation mechanism are fully discussed. The smallest hole taper was found at a defocusing amount of −1.8 mm. Consequently, a group of holes with 250,000 microporous were obtained on a (2 cm × 2 cm) current collector, demonstrating the high efficiency and high quality of femtosecond laser‐based processing.

These two opposite properties are well balanced by engineering microparticles of silk fibroin in combination with bioceramics, i.e., hydroxyapatite and calcium sulfate, and fulfill the need of different patient's clinical conditions as a biocompatible, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive biomaterial.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Preparation of 3D scaffolds for bone tissue engineering (BTE) is a challenging task as it requires appropriate pore size and porosities, mechanical properties, and controlled bioerosion rate. The focus of this work is the fabrication of silk fibroin (SF) 3D microparticle scaffolds with the incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HA) and calcium sulfate (CaS) as bioceramics. Physicochemical characterization shows ≈30% filler loading and ≈40% optimum porosity with &gt;100 μm pore size for these filled/unfilled scaffolds. Nanoindentation studies show improved Young's modulus at microparticle level with the incorporation of bioceramics. SF‐HA scaffolds showed three fold increase in Young's modulus, whereas SF‐CaS showed two fold increase. In vitro bioerosion study results in early bioerosion with SF‐CaS scaffold, whereas prolonged bioerosion with SF‐HA scaffold. In vitro osteoregenerative potential is analyzed by estimating alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone morphogenetic protein‐2 (BMP‐2), and osteocalcin (OCN). SF CaS supports early stage differentiation while SF 50% HA predominantly supports late stage. The expression of TNF‐α suggests a reduced risk of immune rejection. This work, therefore, concludes that although SF supports bone tissue regeneration, the choice of bioceramic enhances the applicability in various clinical scenarios by providing a controlled bioerosion rate, tunable speed of osteoregeneration, and improved load bearing capacities.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 17:34:51 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f54149a2-53b5-4834-be1d-a5f9fc5f0b96/adem202000458-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"688edddfe6019bc933e21d8a524d7bfa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn32@2020_1/2020/08/31/06-57-15-687_67e3fef15f410d5c.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":201,"sourceBytes":90440,"destBytes":15700,"author":"\nNimisha A.

A bimodal lamellar structure, consisting of fine dynamically recrystallized grains, lots of shear bands and fine precipitates, was obtained after the second‐pass HSRR. Three formation mechanisms of shear bands were studied in depth. The results showed that the formation of shear bands were closely related to the high‐density intersected twin lamellae, boundaries of initial coarse grains and extensive dynamic recrystallization, respectively. It was also clarified that the HSRR process of the AM60B magnesium alloy with coarse grains (223.52 μm‐586.63 μm) was dominated in succession by twinning deformation stage and the following shear bands flow stage. Dynamic precipitation behavior was induced in the double‐pass HSRR process. The dynamic recrystallization was promoted by fine precipitates, resulting in local refinement of the HSRR‐ed microstructure. Moreover, weak basal texture was obtained with peak intensity less than 10. High‐density twins, dynamic recrystallization and shear bands were suggested as the main reasons causing the weakening of the basal texture. An outstanding matching between tensile strength and ductility at room temperature are obtained owing to the bimodal lamellar structure and the weakened basal texture.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.

The analyzed surfaces, treated with varying burst energies and focus positions, show several shapes of surface modifications. By linking the surface modifications to intrinsic properties, roughness of the cut edge or mechanical strength predictions of these properties are possible. The given guidelines help adjust the laser parameters accordingly.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>The process of laser filament cutting produces a practical nongap cut which ensures high precision in lateral dimensions at the micrometer scale. Commercially available OptiWhite soda lime silicate glass is filamented using a 1064 nm picosecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser with varying burst energies and focus positions. The filaments are characterized perpendicular to the incident laser beam using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Maximum roughness <i>R</i>\n<sub>z</sub> evaluated with laser scanning microscopy is measured on the cut sides. The characteristic mechanical strength <i>σ</i> of glass cleavage is decreased by a factor of 6 with the presence of the filaments. This <i>σ</i> obtained in the four‐point‐bending setup decreases with the increase in energy deposited in the material by the laser. It is found that the cleaving cracks are guided by the filament only if the network of microcracks is sufficiently developed.

The hot deformation characteristics of GH4065 alloy are studied here for the first time.

The microstructure evolution and DRX mechanism are investigated by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique.

X‐ray analysis of severely deformed mechanically alloyed (MAed) powders shows that the as‐milled nano‐sized crystallite size increases with annealing associated with the sharp drop of dislocation density. At the same time, by annealing MAed powders γ′ precipitates above 300 °C, and depending on the aging treatment regime, Vickers microhardness changes mainly due to γ′ distribution and dislocation release. The thorough evaluation of γ′ morphology in the microscale shows that in contrast to the spherical shape of γ′, after heat treatment of solutionized MAed ODS superalloy, irregular‐shaped γ′ exist in the MAed ODS superalloy due to severe plastic deformation during mechanical alloying. However, a unique nanostructured lamellar morphology forms in the γ′ precipitates with different lamellae directions. This structure is stable in all subsequent processing steps with γ′ lamellae of (011¯) planes and intervals of 20–30 nm.

Monolithic ZrB<sub>2</sub> and 20 vol.% SiC reinforced ZrB<sub>2</sub> with SiC of two different particle sizes are consolidated via spark plasma sintering. Wear tests conducted on spark plasma sintered samples for examining multi‐length scale performance include fretting (micro‐wear), micro‐scratching (meso‐wear) and ball‐on‐disk (macro‐wear), under dry and unlubricated conditions. The damage assessment and wear mechanism operative at each length scale are characterised via scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry. Hertzian tensile cracking occurred in all the samples at loads ≥ 5N during micro‐scratching. Nonetheless, wear volume, wear rate and cof decreased with SiC reinforcement during macro‐wear test. Though coarse‐SiC performed better than monolithic ZrB<sub>2</sub> under meso‐wear at 5N load, the fine SiC reinforced ZrB<sub>2</sub> composite showed least cracking at loads ≥ 5N owing to its highest indentation fracture toughness (4.6 MPa.m<sup>1/2</sup> as compared to 2.1 MPa.m<sup>1/2</sup> in coarse SiC‐reinforced ZrB<sub>2</sub> and 3.9 MPa.m<sup>1/2</sup> in monolith ZrB<sub>2</sub>).

The mathematical statistical metrics, mean absolute error, mean relative error, determination coefficient, correlation coefficient, mean square error, root mean square error, and relative root mean square error, are used to assess the model capability, which puts a theoretical foundation for the prediction and simulation of IPMC and promotes the further development and practical application of IPMC.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 19:39:49 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/745b5e23-cabd-40ea-8b7f-d7c13a8d4ac2/adem202000537-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"d0e4c21e49dbf065cae564c41b6bb6d1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn76@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-30-177_348fa5cd31201960.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":392,"sourceBytes":184014,"destBytes":32076,"author":"\nLiang Yang, \nDongsheng Zhang, \nHong Wang, \nXining Zhang\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/745b5e23-cabd-40ea-8b7f-d7c13a8d4ac2/adem202000537-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn76@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-30-177_348fa5cd31201960.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035075},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Influence of Iron Boride Coating on Flow‐Accelerated Corrosion of Carbon Steel","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000354?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/aa97d22e-e01e-4299-bd05-f348f6afb3c8/adem202000354-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Influence of Iron Boride Coating on Flow‐Accelerated Corrosion of Carbon Steel\"/>\n<p>Resistance of bare and boronized steel to flow‐accelerated corrosion (FAC), i.e., to action of corrosive fluids at extremely high flows (&gt;200 L min<sup>−1</sup>) and turbulence, is compared. While bare steel piping experiences quick surface dissolution and degradation, carbon steel piping with the iron boride protective layer demonstrates significantly lower surface degradation after testing in the designed FAC loop.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Flow‐accelerated corrosion (FAC) often occurs in piping systems made of carbon steels and other steels and alloys in power generation and mineral processing, when the products are subjected by extremely high‐velocity corrosive fluid flows. Under these extreme conditions, dissolution and subsequent degradation and thinning of the metallic surfaces occur due to corrosion–erosion resulting in a quick rupture of the piping products. Herein, iron boride‐based coatings obtained through the proprietary thermal diffusion process are selectively applied onto the inner surface of carbon steel A106B piping sections to protect the steel against FAC. The coated and uncoated steel piping sections are tested using the high‐turbulence corrosion loop device with flow rates up to 120 gal min<sup>−1</sup> (≈450 L min<sup>−1</sup>) in boric acid‐based solutions. Changes of wall thickness of the piping sections and their structures are examined and evaluated. The pipe sections with iron boride coatings demonstrate significantly lower degradation in the studied FAC conditions compared with the bare carbon steel. Promising behavior of the coating can be explained by its well‐consolidated double‐layer structure composed of iron borides with high hardness, chemical inertness, and strong diffusion‐induced bonding between the protective layers and the steel substrate.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:54:09 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/aa97d22e-e01e-4299-bd05-f348f6afb3c8/adem202000354-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"23d16b46191012cd10263c14dcc138b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_2/2020/08/31/06-57-16-254_c79c401258082c45.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":102,"sourceBytes":98442,"destBytes":10086,"author":"\nEugene Medvedovski, \nMohsen Roghanizad, \nGerardo Leal Mendoza, \nWenjun Cai, \nRobert W.

The discharge performance of nano‐NiS<sub>2</sub> becomes better first and then worsens, as the grain size decreases. The NiS<sub>2</sub>‐20 h (70 nm) shows the best discharge performance with a specific capacity of 831 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Nanocrystallization can shorten the Li<sup>+</sup> transport distance, resulting in the enhancement of electrochemical activity for cathode materials. However, nanocathode materials tend to be thermally unstable, further leading to poor electrochemical performance of a battery system. This disadvantage can be especially detrimental for thermal batteries because they are often operated at high temperatures (≥450 °C). Herein, the decomposition character of NiS<sub>2</sub> at 500 °C is investigated. The decomposition temperatures of NiS<sub>2</sub> are found to decrease from 510 to 350 °C with the grain size decreasing to 39 nm, due to the dramatically increased surface energy. The decomposition product is confirmed to be NiS, evidenced by a high‐temperature X‐ray diffractometer. The useful mass of the cathode will reduce once the discharging temperature is higher than 500 °C. Namely, although the small grain size shorthens the Li<sup>+</sup> transport distance, the discharge performance of the NiS<sub>2</sub> cathode may also decrease due to its inferior thermal stability. For the Li‐B/LiF–LiCl–LiBr/NiS<sub>2</sub> system, the NiS<sub>2</sub> with the grain size of 70 nm shows the highest specific capacity of 831 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> under the discharging temperature of 500 °C, with the cut‐off voltage of 0.5 V, compared with other grain sizes from 39 to 112 nm.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 17:48:20 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7ad2f69a-2f46-41da-b904-0f0601c6c122/adem202000299-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"b1629ddd531daa4d167a2bec8f535b0f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn96@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-19-106_a1a297a1c3ed1925.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":325,"sourceBytes":62099,"destBytes":22132,"author":"\nWenju Yang, \nLingping Zhou, \nZeshunji Luo, \nJiajun Zhu, \nWulin Yang, \nDeyi Li, \nLicai Fu\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7ad2f69a-2f46-41da-b904-0f0601c6c122/adem202000299-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn96@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-19-106_a1a297a1c3ed1925.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035076},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Integrated Structures from Dissimilar Materials: The Future Belongs to Aluminum–Polymer Joints","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000007?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1ad28080-a400-4bee-8be3-6d90532f0181/adem202000007-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Integrated Structures from Dissimilar Materials: The Future Belongs to Aluminum–Polymer Joints\"/>\n<p>The state of the art in joining and surface preparation technologies available for aluminum–polymer hybrid structures is reviewed.

Herein, the most important surface preparation methods and joining processes, with which the surface structure of aluminum can be modified and aluminum and polymer structures can be joined, are reviewed. For both topics, a new classification method is introduced: surface preparation methods are grouped based on the method of creating surface structures, whereas joining technologies are grouped according to heat input and structural changes in the polymer material. Herein, “hot” joining technologies (in which so much heat is formed that the polymer material is melted) are reviewed. This grouping category includes techniques based on friction and induction, ultrasonic and laser welding, and some in situ joining technologies. With these, materials with highly different chemical structures and melting temperatures are joined in fast cycles, in a reliable manner. In the coming years, more integrated structures containing aluminum–polymer joints manufactured with fast, automatable joining techniques (such as ultrasonic and laser welding, in compliance with the requirements of Industry 4.0) will be used throughout the industry.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:54:09 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1ad28080-a400-4bee-8be3-6d90532f0181/adem202000007-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"1e9c1a4e870db28a93affd2d5928f76f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/31/06-57-15-805_9d961055facaf64b.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":394,"sourceBytes":83438,"destBytes":20518,"author":"\nTamas Temesi, \nTibor Czigany\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1ad28080-a400-4bee-8be3-6d90532f0181/adem202000007-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/31/06-57-15-805_9d961055facaf64b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035074},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Eu(II)‐Activated Silicates for UV Light‐Emitting Diodes Tuning into Warm White Light","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202070036?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/98083de6-d9b1-4bbc-aaed-720308a3e8f3/adem202070036-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Eu(II)‐Activated Silicates for UV Light‐Emitting Diodes Tuning into Warm White Light\"/><p>Despite the current maturity and reliability of white‐light‐emitting diodes (WLEDs), the control of the correlated color temperature (CCT) is still a challenge, arising from the lack of the red color which is often associated with dysregulations of the human circadian rhythm.

Here, inspired by the Power amplified biological systems, beneficial with the advantages of 3D integrated molding technology, we proposed an integrated SMA‐PDMS composite structure (SPCS), which can achieve periodic heterogeneous actuation only by controlling the SMA phase transformation and the PDMS strain potential energy distribution states. To test the feasibility of the mechanism, we conducted a theoretical model of SPCS deformation. The results of numerical feasibility analysis showed that the factors affecting SPCS deformation mainly involve the excitation current strength of SMA 、PDMS structure thickness and its distribution state. The experimental results show that the current intensity mainly affects the deformation rate of SPCS, and the thickness of PDMS is not only the key to realize the periodic deformation of SPCS, but also the orderly arrangement of PDMS structure thickness is helpful for SPCS to achieve periodic heterogeneous deformation. These demonstrated that the proposed mechanism can inspire the design of soft actuators, smart wearable equipment, and medical devices.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.

Chloride ions from the environment bind with the hydrated cementitious phases in the form of bound chlorides. The contribution of chemically bound chlorides toward increasing the service life of concrete structures is vital as they help in slowing down the chloride diffusion in the concrete thereby delaying reinforcement depassivation. The authors attempt to increase the chloride binding capacity of concrete by adding a small amount of Mg–Al–NO<sub>2</sub> layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with the objective to delay reinforcement corrosion and by this to considerably extend the service life of concrete structures situated in harsh environments. This study presents numerical and experimental analysis of the action of LDH in concrete. Formation factor is used to determine the effective chloride diffusion coefficient. In addition, the chloride binding isotherms together with Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations are used to model the chloride ingress.

However, establishing correlations between fabrication parameters, CNT distributions, and SE properties is a challenging task due to the restrictions on the traditionally implemented CNT network detection techniques and qualitative CNT distribution descriptors. Here is presented a SE enhancing methodology for single‐walled carbon nanotubes/polyimide (SWCNT/PI) nanocomposites films in which AC sinusoidal voltages (5V, 10V, 15V at 10Hz) are applied during processing to control CNT distribution. The prepared nanocomposite samples are characterized using scattering‐parameter measurements for SE estimation and second harmonic electrostatic force microscopy (2ω<sub>e</sub>‐EFM) for subsurface CNT network detection. The detected CNT networks are described by implementing the uniform‐distancing (<i>CNT</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>D</i>\n</sub>), agglomeration (<i>CNT</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>A</i>\n</sub>), and shielding (<i>CNT</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>S</i>\n</sub>) quantitative CNT descriptors. The results show enhancement on the nanocomposite SE values with the increment on the <i>CNT</i>\n<sub>\n   <i>S</i>\n</sub> descriptor, which increases with lower applied voltages during processing. The SWCNT/PI nanocomposite studied here exhibits a predominant absorption SE mechanism, which makes it a candidate for potential EMI absorber material applications.

Superhydrophobic ceramic coatings with self‐cleaning properties and stability at high‐temperatures (up to 300 °C) are eco‐friendly alternative to aggressive surface cleaning agents. Despite the wide range of possible applications for hydrophobic surfaces, the practical implementation of currently used polymeric fluoro‐silanes is restricted by their low thermal stability, which is an essential figure of merit. Herein, a non‐adhesive coating with an exceptionally low surface‐energy (contact angle ∽ 180°) was developed by chemical conjugation of MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> spinel nanoparticles with perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (FDTS). The cross‐conjugation of FDTS and MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was substantiated by condensation reactions between the surface‐rooted hydroxyl groups and chloride ligands of fluorosilane.

Addition of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles to MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> sol unified the ultrahydrophobicity of FDTS@MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with UV‐absorption properties of TiO<sub>2</sub> to produce a new UV‐ and temperature‐resistant ultrahydrophobic coating system.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.

Results show that the flow stress of the two alloys decreases with increasing deformation temperature and decreasing strain rate. Some of the flow curves manifest obvious discontinuous yielding and flow softening, both of which are strongly affected by the deformation conditions. The flow stress behaviour of these two alloys can be described very well by a hyperbolic‐sine Arrhenius equation. When deforming in the α+β phase region, the deformation mechanism is governed by the bending or globularization of the α phase. When deforming in the pure β phase field, the flow behavior is mainly determined by dynamic recovery or recrystallization.

The potential of using this structure as an air‐cooled heat sink for electronic devices and an integrated thermal protection system (ITPS) is tested and systematically compared with three conventional structures based on wavy, pyramid, and cylindrical pin fin geometries. When cooling a hot spot (100 × 100 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup>) subjected to heat flow (250 W), and given the same solid volume fraction, the wavy and cuttlebone structures reduce the maximum temperature to 57 °C, which is 13 and 19 °C lower than for the pin fins and pyramid structures, respectively. Concerning the ITPS application, the cuttlebone exhibits the most isometric deformation with a 0.062 mm maximum standard deviation among its four corners. Moreover, the cuttlebone outperforms the other structures in terms of compressive strength (20%, 17%, and 219% increase compared with the wavy, pyramid, and pin fin structures, respectively). More importantly, the simulations indicate that the cuttlebone structure undergoes a graceful failure process due to the sequential buckling of the vertical walls compared with other structures.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 08:32:08 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/86fb770a-8a7a-4359-8583-219aabb3ca58/adem202000371-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"d26047640ed535992d24ddbfbbc848a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-16-894_cac8e6c5eda0f257.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":89,"sourceBytes":64937,"destBytes":11644,"author":"\nEurydice Kanimba, \nTing Yang, \nScott T.

Therefore, the manufacturing of shape‐transforming constructs can be simplified to the construction of foldable products that can be programmed simply by applying mechanical forces. Origami can then be used as a simple platform in which the shape‐transforming of a programmed construct is via the folding of material through the thinner sections (hinges).

The mechanical properties of metal rubber are studied from the micro‐tribological point of view, and the relationship between the different preparation parameters and the mechanical properties of materials is constructed. Finally, it is verified by quasi‐static experiments.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Metal rubber (MR) is an elastic porous material with a complex spiral network structure, which is widely used in aerospace, aviation, navigation, medical biomaterials, and other fields. The traditional preparation processes depend on multiple tests or artificial experience, which leads to time‐consuming and laborious. Herein, a virtual manufacturing method is proposed to realize the spatial multipoint dynamic contact analysis of a complex spiral network structure, that is, to study the mechanical properties of MR from the micro‐tribological point of view. Through real‐time capturing the spatial distribution characteristics of each contact point and the number of contact pairs and contact mode, it is found that the number of dry friction contact points between the wires is nonlinear positive correlation with the damping energy dissipation characteristics of MR. The preparation parameters, such as the wire diameter, the spiral wire pitch, and the blank winding angle, are selected to be investigated, and the controlling variable method is used to analyze the single factor influence in the virtual preparation process. The results show that the damping and energy consumption characteristics of MR can be improved effectively by reducing the wire diameter, by reducing the spiral wire pitch, or by increasing the winding angle of the blank. However, too small or too large preparation parameters cause stress concentration and affect the mechanical properties of the actual materials. The quasi‐static compression test is carried out through the preparation of the products, and the error between simulation and experiment results is &lt;8%. Herein, the mechanism of contact friction between wire turns in MR is expounded. Also, this method can effectively guide the production of MR material, reduce the time of material design, and promote the popularization and application of the material.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:54:09 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/57004811-609d-4d6c-ab22-468a6f5ded5a/adem202000382-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"d0065c32c21c639afc96a529eaed4f16","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/31/06-58-15-428_83223f3a411bf512.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":373,"sourceBytes":125694,"destBytes":125694,"author":"\nZhiying Ren, \nLiangliang Shen, \nHongbai Bai, \nLing Pan, \nJie Xu\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/57004811-609d-4d6c-ab22-468a6f5ded5a/adem202000382-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/31/06-58-15-428_83223f3a411bf512.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035074},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Phase Formation and Densification Peculiarities of Hf–C–N Solid Solution Ceramics during Reactive Spark Plasma Sintering","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000482?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0d4d32ff-99f3-438b-afc0-e8ed74fbecc9/adem202000482-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Phase Formation and Densification Peculiarities of Hf–C–N Solid Solution Ceramics during Reactive Spark Plasma Sintering\"/>\n<p>Herein, how to obtain the most refractory material is discussed.

An attractive feature with both ALD and MLD is that the film grows in a conformal manner on the textile fibers so that the entire textile piece becomes an active part of the device, corresponding to a remarkable coating‐thickness increase. The voltage generated can also be increased by combining more TE pairs (even by just increasing the number of pairs by cutting the TE pads into smaller pieces).

This article addresses important aspects related to the electrical performance of aerosol jet printed conductors including current‐carrying capacity and temperature coefficient of resistance.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Printed conductors are the main building blocks of printed flexible electronic circuits. With the advancement and growing demand for printed and flexible electronics, researchers are focused on assessing the mechanical reliability of interconnects. Even more important is, often, the electrical performance or the current‐carrying capacity of the interconnects. A mechanically reliable interconnect has limited use if it cannot meet the current‐carrying requirements. However, current‐carrying capacity curves and circuit design guidelines such as those available for conventional copper conductors have not yet been established for printed interconnects, i.e., there is a technological gap in this domain. The present work focuses on assessing the maximum allowed current through an aerosol jet printed silver nanoparticle‐based conductor on a 75 μm thick polyimide substrate. The temperature coefficient of resistance for the printed ink is experimentally determined. The effect of printed ink microstructure on the temperature coefficient of resistance is also investigated. Standard curves are generated that would guide designers to determine the trace width required for an allowed temperature increase. Furthermore, the effect of sintering temperature on the current‐carrying capability is evaluated.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f96ec069-590a-4387-8035-75c0cc7783ce/adem202000520-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"137724b61e6bd496f0c4e76e49cff01e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn4@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-17-749_24dc0e5520486737.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":307,"sourceBytes":91035,"destBytes":16284,"author":"\nMohammed Alhendi, \nRajesh S.

When it comes to crush applications, these loading profiles create the need of well‐defined compression and tensile properties for a range of densities and strain rates. In this study, static and dynamic tension tests are conducted on EPS foam dog‐bone samples for material characterization. The target of the study is to obtain stress‐strain curves for a range of densities spreading from 60 g/l to 120 g/l. For the low strain rates, tensile testing machines are used while for the high strain rates, a modified drop tower set‐up was used. The influence of the strain rate on the stress‐strain behavior, the dynamic strength, Young's modulus and energy absorption capacities for different foam densities is measured.

Limiting the kinetics of reactions at elevated temperatures proves to be key to developing composites with intriguing microstructures and high strength.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>Herein, boron nitride nanotube (BNNT)–reinforced Ti alloy composites with 1 wt% BNNT (3 vol%) are successfully fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS). This study addresses two challenges affecting the performance of BNNT–metal matrix composites: i) the dispersion of high‐surface‐energy BNNTs by an ultrasonic‐assisted technique and ii) the control of reactions at the metal/nanotube interface. High‐energy ultrasonic vibrations were effective in the dispersion of entangled BNNTs, and sintering at low (750 °C and 555 MPa) and high (950 °C and 60 MPa) temperature regimes resulted in relative densities of 97% and 99%. Reducing sintering temperatures by up to 35% compared to those used in conventional sintering is effective in minimizing brittle interfacial products. Also, the composites sintered at high‐temperatures/low‐pressure benefit from the rapid densification (10 min) achieved in the SPS process limiting the extent of reactions (TiB<sub>2</sub>, TiB). Compressive properties show composites sintered at low and high temperatures exhibit increases of 46% and 50% in yield strength, respectively, as compared to the Ti alloy. Strain hardening exponents of 0.8 and 0.5 characterize the capabilities of the composites to arrest plasticity in the presence of BNNTs, reaction phases, and twin boundaries pinning dislocations. This study unravels the potential of a low‐temperature/high‐pressure processing window for Ti‐BNNT composites.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 19:00:00 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2be030da-b78c-46a4-bd5b-0db95cef84ee/adem202000702-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"33dc5ebb3e34404dafaef6edae774c28","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/31/06-57-17-565_171af748ec21ebec.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":386,"sourceBytes":185574,"destBytes":27208,"author":"\nJenniffer Bustillos, \nXialong Lu, \nPranjal Nautiyal, \nCheng Zhang, \nBenjamin Boesl, \nArvind Agarwal\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2be030da-b78c-46a4-bd5b-0db95cef84ee/adem202000702-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/31/06-57-17-565_171af748ec21ebec.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035075},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Phase Selection, Lattice Distortions, and Mechanical Properties in High‐Entropy Alloys","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000466?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5876b924-d7d3-4b4b-b780-d3f0704cb9c3/adem202000466-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Phase Selection, Lattice Distortions, and Mechanical Properties in High‐Entropy Alloys\"/>\n<p>The core effects are summarized and the principles and parameters governing phase formation in high‐entropy alloys (HEAs) are reviewed.

The design concept and unique microstructure make them exhibit a wide range of attractive properties, promoting them suitable for most structural and functional applications. HEAs have four core effects: severe lattice distortion, high entropy, sluggish diffusion, and cocktail effects, which are all interconnected. Among these core effects, severe lattice distortion is seen as the most key factor in determining the properties of HEAs. Recent findings prove that phase selection in HEAs cannot be described by the maximized entropy theory alone. As such, the phase formation principles in terms of single‐phase and multiphase formation criteria are summarized. Severe lattice distortion affecting the mechanical properties and polymorphism of HEAs is reviewed. Several strategies, which have recently been successfully applied in overcoming the “strength–ductility trade‐off” in HEAs, are discussed. Some key unsolved questions concerning the lattice distortion in HEAs which could be interesting research topics in the future are suggested.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 09:09:03 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5876b924-d7d3-4b4b-b780-d3f0704cb9c3/adem202000466-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"be035d2aa5c8b7f5004433a0ff44befb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_1/2020/08/31/06-57-17-087_426c8d4f6a784a8a.webp","destWidth":363,"destHeight":394,"sourceBytes":115470,"destBytes":23354,"author":"\nRaymond Kwesi Nutor, \nQingping Cao, \nXiaodong Wang, \nDongxian Zhang, \nYunzhang Fang, \nYong Zhang, \nJian-Zhong Jiang\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5876b924-d7d3-4b4b-b780-d3f0704cb9c3/adem202000466-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_1/2020/08/31/06-57-17-087_426c8d4f6a784a8a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035076},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Significantly Enhanced Mechanical Strength by the Hollow Structure of Conductive Stretchable Silver Nanoflower‐Polyurethane Fibers","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000674?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b25ce2c3-d35f-4ab9-9b08-534649bb2b43/adem202000674-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Significantly Enhanced Mechanical Strength by the Hollow Structure of Conductive Stretchable Silver Nanoflower‐Polyurethane Fibers\"/>\n<p>The hollow structure of conductive nanocomposite fibers is designed to significantly shorten solvent extraction paths and decrease air voids inside the fibers. This increases the tensile strength of the nanocomposite fibers by 100% [29 MPa at a concentration of silver nanoflower‐shaped particles (AgNFP) of 36 vol%] while reasonably maintaining electrical conductivity.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>The conductive stretchable nanocomposite fibers, synthesized by the wet spinning technology, are typically composed of conductive nanofillers and polymer matrix to achieve both high electrical conductivity and stretchability. However, the inclusion of nanofillers blocks the solvent extraction passages, resulting in large voids (&gt;3 μm<sup>2</sup>) and decreasing mechanical strength. Herein, hollow fibers synthesized using a coaxial spinneret with double concentric needles are presented. The dope mixture of silver nanoflower‐shaped particles (AgNFPs, 36 vol%), polyurethane (PU), and dimethylformamide is extruded through the outer nozzle, whereas the coagulant is supplied to the inner nozzle. This significantly shortens the maximum solvent diffusion length from 127.5 μm of solid fibers to 18.5 μm of hollow fibers. Resultantly, the large void becomes negligible in the hollow AgNFP‐PU fiber, and the mechanical strength increases by 100% (29 MPa) compared with that of the solid AgNFP‐PU fiber (14.5 MPa). The initial electrical conductivity (≈10 990 S cm<sup>−1</sup>) and rupture strain (≈120%) of both hollow and solid fibers are similar. Furthermore, the change in resistance decreases by 50% at 50% strain when the inner space is filled with liquid metal. This demonstrates that versatile functionality can be implemented by filling the gap with functional materials.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 18:31:06 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b25ce2c3-d35f-4ab9-9b08-534649bb2b43/adem202000674-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"8df2eabbb1236f00c3ed4993a830be21","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn11@2020_1/2020/08/31/06-57-17-802_896d48ba7d612da3.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":334,"sourceBytes":187268,"destBytes":22700,"author":"\nSeonghyun Bae, \nC.

In this work, the Ce‐modified SAF2507 super duplex stainless steel (Ce‐SAF2507) was deformed at different levels from 30% to 90% at a cryogenic temperature (‐196 <sup>o</sup>C) to achieve superior mechanical performances. Cryogenic rolling rose fiber texture and induced ultra‐fine grain refinement which brought grains to ∽ 10 nm in the selected steel. The high‐density dislocations and deformation twins in the cryogenically rolled Ce‐SAF2507 led to the nucleation and growth of martensite. Increases of the martensite volume fraction and nanoscale grain refinement occurred at higher deformation levels. Cryogenically rolled deformation resulted in the overall increase of the Ce‐SAF2507 hardness. A higher hardness increment of austenite‐martensite dual‐phase compared to that of ferrite was ascribed to the austenite‐martensite's higher work hardening ability. Further, the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength increased with the deformation level, but the elongation decreased. Observed microstructural evolutions induced by cryogenic rolling enunciated the superiority of the present method over conventional ones to promote steel’ mechanical properties.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.

Moreover, precipitates containing Cu shift from adhering to the (Al, Si) phases to Fe‐rich intermetallic. In additionally, primary Si particles and Al–Si eutectic phases decrease. Noteworthily, travelling magnetic fields can reduce nucleate radius and generate intense long‐range directional melt flows, further to distribute temperature and solute uniformly and break up Fe‐rich intermetallic, so as to optimize them.

Particularly, the unique characteristics of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) lattice structures make them desirable in many leading application areas. However, the full‐scale adoption of lattices is limited by the lack of a standard numerical model that can reliably predict and assess their mechanical and failure response. Most of the studies follow a unique methodology that differs greatly from their counterparts. In this context, this paper presents a review of the numerical methods developed specifically to analyze the mechanical behavior of lattice structures while showcasing the potentials and the limitations of each model. The numerical models' key differences are identified, and their impacts on the finite models are highlighted. Correlations between the relative density and the compressive mechanical properties of the collected data are established following the Gibson‐Ashby model. Additionally, an overview of the lattice's designs, properties, performance, and defects is presented. Overall, this review is intended to provide the reader with comprehensive knowledge about lattice structures and accelerate the process of developing a reliable yet computationally inexpensive standardized numerical model.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.

By increasing hierarchical complexity, following biological principles, it is possible to achieve a simultaneous increment in impact energy absorption and flexibility (protecto‐flexibility) on synthetic systems, bringing the constructive principles of nature to the next generation of impact‐resistant materials.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<p>The search for impact‐tolerant, light‐weight flexible materials has challenged materials scientists and engineers for decades. In this quest, many researchers have focused on studying natural armor as a guide to propose bioinspired materials with enhanced properties. The energy dissipation and flexibility mechanisms activated at different hierarchical structural levels of natural systems are used here as a guide to improve the energy and flexibility of synthetic materials. In particular, fish scales and osteoderms are selected as proper biological models to develop a novel family of cost‐effective bioinspired protecto‐flexible (Pf) materials. Furthermore, a bullet‐proof protecto‐flexible prototype is manufactured and tested. The ballistic tests suggest that under real stringent conditions, the system is capable of absorbing high levels of energy while remaining flexible enough to allow movement to the user. Remarkably, the material system developed allows its implementation into realistic high volumes of production with low added costs. Consequently, the proposed strategy for developing bioinspired Pf materials will enable the development of the next generation of high‐performance impact‐resistant materials.</p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 19:54:09 +0000","feedId":5645,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/37f8a9a4-c890-4d23-8e8c-a6e8b42f2efd/adem202000006-blkfxd-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"6a352a478c6c12f4f94c23c4cad5c5f9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn59@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-23-503_7994939b688f0e12.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":134,"sourceBytes":105125,"destBytes":13642,"author":"\nSusana Estrada, \nAlex Ossa\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/37f8a9a4-c890-4d23-8e8c-a6e8b42f2efd/adem202000006-blkfxd-0001-m.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn59@2020_3/2020/08/31/06-57-23-503_7994939b688f0e12.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598857035073},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 14:57:15","title":"Eu(II)‐Activated Silicates for UV Light‐Emitting Diodes Tuning into Warm White Light","link":"https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202000422?af=R","description":"<img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8218ef1b-066e-4fcd-a494-e7397af76077/adem202000422-blkfxd-0001-m.png\"\n     alt=\"Eu(II)‐Activated Silicates for UV Light‐Emitting Diodes Tuning into Warm White Light\"/>\n<p>Despite the maturity and reliability of white‐light‐emitting diodes (WLEDs), the control of the correlated color temperature (CCT) is still a challenge, arising from the lack of red color, which is associated with dysregulations of the human circadian rhythm.

Despite the current maturity and reliability of the solid state‐lighting field, the control of the correlated color temperature (CCT) tuning is still a challenge, arising from the lack of red emission color in the current design of commercial WLEDs. Moreover, as this aspect is often associated with dysregulations of the human circadian rhythm, the need for novel WLEDs is of enlarged societal relevance.

As the amount of S2S increases in the phosphor mixture, the CCT values of the WLEDs decrease from 6500 K (ideal for daylight application) to 4000 K (ideal for night light application), with a luminous efficacy of radiation of 404 lm W<sup>−1</sup>, among the best figures of merit for WLEDs.

The microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of Mg‐Li alloy sheets during CGP are investigated. The optimum mechanical properties are achieved at 373 K after two passes. The tensile strength and yield strength are 157 MPa and 145 MPa, respectively, with a moderate elongation to failure of 12.4%, and the average micro‐hardness is about 63 HV. At 373 K, high density dislocations induced by CGP are preserved to enhance the strength and micro‐hardness. The cross‐orientation procedure improves the deformation homogeneity and results in strength increase and ductility recovery at the later stages. Increasing temperature weakens the homogeneity improvement and grain refinement with strain accumulation. The β‐Li phase is refined faster than α‐Mg phase, and grain sizes about 1 μm are observed in β‐Li phase. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) firstly occurs in the soft and ductile β‐Li phase at 423 K. The grain refinement induced by DRX in β‐Li phase is counteracted by grain coarsening in α‐Mg phase, which causes no obvious enhancement of mechanical properties at higher temperatures of 423 K and 473 K.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.

To this purpose, the present article applies three different types of heat treatment on Ti6Al4V as‐received samples produced by SLM: 1) annealing stress relieving, 2) solubilization super‐β transus, and 3) sub‐β transus followed by a tempering. Then, the related microstructures, mechanical resistance, residual stresses, and corrosion resistance are studied. The results identify a set of heat treatment parameters (super‐β transus followed by tempering), which guarantee the required properties.

This work investigates the mechanical and energy absorption performance of an elastomeric hybrid structure polyurea foam in response to low‐velocity impact. The examined polyurea foams are synthesized using a novel self‐foaming process that leads to the development of a semi‐closed cellular structure. The quasi‐static response of the foam is first characterized by measuring the global stress‐strain and energy absorption characteristics. The evolution of the foam's Poisson's ratio is also characterized by <i>in situ</i> digital image correlation (DIC) measurements. The same properties are also studied in dynamic loading conditions by subjecting the foam samples to controlled impact tests. A strain‐dependent rate sensitivity parameter is used to quantify differences between the quasi‐static and dynamic strength and energy absorption responses of the foam. The examined foam shows significant enhancement in strength at increased strain rates while retaining its excellent energy absorption capacity. This unique characteristic of the examined foam is discussed in terms of the concurrent effects of entrapped gas and the rate sensitivity of the parent polymer.</p>\n<p>This article is protected by copyright.
