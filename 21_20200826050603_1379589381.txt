Based on an upcoming graphic novel from writer <strong>James Patrick</strong> and artist <strong>Rem Broo</strong>, <em>The Kaiju Score</em> will come to us courtesy of Sony Pictures.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633597\"></span></p>\n<p><em>The Kaiju Score</em> graphic novel hasn&#8217;t even hit shelves yet, but Sony has already snapped up the film rights, per <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aftershock-comics-the-kaiju-score-picked-up-by-sony\">THR</a>. And you can see why: the premise is cool as hell. The story follows &#8220;four criminals attempting the perfect heist in the middle of a giant monster attack on the city.&#8221; Co-created by writer James Patrick and artist Rem Broo, the graphic novel will arrive in November, and the film adaptation is being developed by Escape Artists and AfterShock at Sony Pictures.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The truth is that the whole thing has been wonderful and surreal, but I&#8217;ve also found myself kind of having not digested it because it happened so fast,&#8221; said James Patrick. &#8220;I’ve tried to not be excited about it and just focus on my work, but I&#8217;ve failed at that. I&#8217;m excited. Period. Excited because it will hopefully bring more eyes to the book since it won&#8217;t come out until November, excited for people to read the book and see how much more it is than just a good hook, and excited if it brings more attention to my other work and to [co-creator] Rem Broo&#8217;s wonderful art and his other books.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a previous statement, Patrick described <em>The Kaiju Score</em> as &#8220;a Quentin Tarantino film taking place in some corner of a Godzilla movie,&#8221; adding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have this giant canvas of a kaiju attack occurring, and as it happens there&#8217;s this more personal story going on. And after that setup, it explores how these four characters, who are in just the worst situation in their lives, believe the only way out is to do this impossible thing. This crazy crime. It&#8217;s about that desperation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>No writer or director is mentioned in the THR story, but Sony&#8217;s <strong>Drew Reed</strong> and <strong>Jake Bauman</strong> are described as being &#8220;instrumental&#8221; in making the film deal happen, while AfterShock Comics&#8217; <strong>Lee Kramer</strong> and <strong>Jon Kramer</strong> will produce, with <strong>Jiao Chen</strong> overseeing the project for Sony Pictures.

But before <em>Tiger King</em> there was <em>Joe Exotic</em>, a Wondery podcast that covered the same story last year and quickly got picked up for a TV series adaptation. In November 2019, it was reported that <strong>Kate McKinnon</strong> was set to star in the series as Carole Baskin, the owner of Big Cat Rescue and the mortal enemy of Joe Exotic. Nearly a year later, the <em>Joe Exotic</em> TV series has been picked up straight to series by not one, but three different platforms: NBC, the streaming service Peacock, and USA.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633631\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that the limited series <em>Joe Exotic</em> (working title) is receiving an unprecedented three-platform rollout across three different NBCUniversal properties: the broadcast network NBC, the streamer Peacock, and the basic cable network USA. The <em>Joe Exotic</em> series was originally sent up at Universal Content Productions last year, based on the second season of Wondery&#8217;s <em>Over My Dead Body</em> podcast, and with interest in the story spiking due to the sensational popularity of Netflix&#8217;s <em>Tiger King</em>, it is getting this unprecedented multi-platform rollout.</p>\n<p>Written by <strong>Etan Frankel</strong>, the limited series is based on &#8220;true events following Carole Baskin (McKinnon), a big cat enthusiast, who learns that when fellow exotic animal lover Joe &#8216;Exotic&#8217; Schreibvogel is breeding and using his big cats for profit, she sets out to shut down his venture, inciting a quickly escalating rivalry. But Carole has a checkered past of her own and when the claws come out, Joe will stop at nothing to expose what he sees as her hypocrisy. The results prove dangerous.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frankel also executive produces via his overall deal with UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group. McKinnon executive produces along with Wondery’s Hernan Lopez, Marshall Lewy and Aaron Hart.</p>\n<p>McKinnon is set to play Baskin, who was the target of Joe Exotic&#8217;s assassination attempt which would get him arrested and convicted of a felony, for which he is currently serving his sentence. Like Joe Exotic, Baskin has been the source of much public interest too, due to the murky circumstances of her husband&#8217;s death (which many speculated that she had a part in) — a subject that McKinnon&#8217;s <em>Saturday Night Live</em> costar Chloe Fineman poked fun at in a recent episode, <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/carole-baskin-slap-snl-star-chloe-fineman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">much to Baskin&#8217;s chagrin</a>.

Many were wondering if the CBS All Access miniseries adaptation of the <strong>Stephen King</strong> novel about the end of the world might get delayed, what with the far-too-relevant subject matter. But it looks like that&#8217;s not the case, and CBS All Access will debut the adaptation this December.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633620\"></span></p>\n<p>In 1979, Stephen King unleashed <em>The Stand</em> upon the world. Reprinted in an even longer edition in 1990, <em>The Stand</em> is King&#8217;s epic novel about the end of the world brought on by a mutated flu virus. The virus kills off almost the entire world, and the few remaining survivors attempt to rebuild society. In the process, two very different factions form – a &#8220;good&#8221; side in Boulder, Colorado, and an &#8220;evil&#8221; side in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one of King&#8217;s most well-known books, and it was first adapted to the screen via an ABC miniseries in 1994. Since then, there were numerous plans to adapt the book again, specifically for the big screen. Ben Affleck was even going to direct at one point. But after theatrical adaptations failed to materialize, <em>The Stand</em> eventually came back home to TV. The latest miniseries adaptation of <em>The Stand</em> is headed to CBS All Access, with <em>The New Mutants</em> filmmaker <strong>Josh Boone</strong> directing several episodes.</p>\n<p>This latest adaptation has been in the works for a while, but when the coronavirus began to spread, some of us were wondering if the project would end up being delayed, what with the unfortunate connection and all. But now we know it&#8217;s not being delayed, and will arrive on <strong>December 17</strong>. In a statement (via <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/stephen-king-the-stand-date/\">EW</a>), showrunner and executive producer <strong>Benjamin Cavell</strong> said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;During the two years we spent making <em>The Stand</em>, we all felt the responsibility of adapting what may be the most beloved work of one of the world’s most beloved storytellers, but none of us could have imagined that Stephen King’s 40-year-old masterpiece about a global pandemic would come to be so eerily relevant. We&#8217;re honored to tell this sprawling, epic story, including a new coda that Stephen King has wanted to add for decades. We&#8217;re so proud of this show and its attempt to find meaning and hope in the most uncertain of times. We can&#8217;t wait to share it with the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The miniseries stars <strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong> as Mother Abagail, <strong>Alexander Skarsgård</strong> as Randall Flagg, <strong>James Marsden</strong> as Stu Redman, <strong>Odessa Young</strong> as Frannie Goldsmith, <strong>Jovan Adepo</strong> as Larry Underwood, <strong>Amber Heard</strong> as Nadine Cross, <strong>Owen Teague</strong> as Harold Lauder, <strong>Henry Zaga</strong> as Nick Andros,<strong> Brad William Henke</strong> as Tom Cullen, <strong>Irene Bedard</strong> as Ray Bretner, <strong>Nat Wolff</strong> as Lloyd Henreid, <strong>Eion Bailey</strong> as Weizak, <strong>Heather Graham</strong> as Rita Blakemoor, <strong>Katherine McNamara</strong> as Julie Lawry,<strong> Fiona Dourif</strong> as Ratwoman, <strong>Natalie Martinez</strong> as Dayna Jurgens, <strong>Hamish Linklater</strong> as Dr. Jim Ellis, <strong>Daniel Sunjata</strong> as Cobb, and <strong>Greg Kinnear</strong> as Glen Bateman.</p>\n<p>And, as an added bonus, Stephen King himself penned the last episode. When /Film <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-stand-miniseries-update/\">spoke</a> with Josh Boone about the project, Boone said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We were really lucky. I wasn&#8217;t there the whole time. I directed the first and last episode, I wrote the first episode with Ben Cavell and really worked on developing this for years with Knate Lee, my co-writer from New Mutants, and Jill Killington, who&#8217;s my other producing partner. We worked on this with Ben, developing this for CBS once I brought it over from Warner Bros. and got it up and running, cast everything, hired all the directors, and then right at the beginning, I shot the first episode and the last episode. And King wrote the last episode.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>I recently re-read <em>The Stand</em>, and I will say that some of it hits too close to home right now (not so much the virus stuff, but rather how the virus causes parts of society to breakdown). So I&#8217;m very curious to see how this new adaptation will play out. And hey, who knows &#8211; maybe by December the coronavirus will have miraculously gone away! Probably not, though.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-stand-remake-premiere/\">&#8216;The Stand&#8217; Remake Premiere Set For December on CBS All Access</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rfe0psTv1W8:7-_n6rGaCZs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rfe0psTv1W8:7-_n6rGaCZs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rfe0psTv1W8:7-_n6rGaCZs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rfe0psTv1W8:7-_n6rGaCZs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rfe0psTv1W8:7-_n6rGaCZs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rfe0psTv1W8:7-_n6rGaCZs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rfe0psTv1W8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 22:00:18 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-remake-premiere-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"323240b8094199fa33df1c0f29cf78fe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-18-624_c9035ca1cf714412.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":48216,"destBytes":32966,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-remake-premiere-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-18-624_c9035ca1cf714412.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/26/05-05-48-243_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rfe0psTv1W8:7-_n6rGaCZs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn100@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-05-48-277_09ac00c9b4001269.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-49-040_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rfe0psTv1W8:7-_n6rGaCZs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-49-166_cb5d02ebdbeb5df9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rfe0psTv1W8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/26/05-05-48-197_5dbae1fade3f4cb4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598418317945},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","title":"Norwegian Action Adventure ‘Troll’ Coming to Netflix From ‘Tomb Raider’ Director Roar Uthaug","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633587","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633593\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Roar-Uthaug-e1598369532197-700x343.jpg\" alt=\"troll netflix\" width=\"700\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Roar-Uthaug-e1598369532197-700x343.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Roar-Uthaug-e1598369532197-360x176.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Roar-Uthaug-e1598369532197.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Netflix has picked up the next film from <em>Tomb Raider</em> director <strong>Roar Uthaug</strong>.

Destroying everything in its path, the creature is fast approaching the capital of Norway, with city-dweller[s] struggling to stop something they thought existed only in Norwegian folklore.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Troll </em>is a passion project from Uthaug, who said in a statement, &#8220;<em>Troll</em> is an idea that has been developing in the back of my mind for over 20 years. To finally be able to realize it with the enthusiastic and ambitious people at Netflix and Motion Blur is truly a dream come true. I can&#8217;t wait to unleash this Norwegian monster on the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are incredibly proud to bring a Norwegian project of this scale to the world together with Roar Uthaug and Motion Blur,&#8221; added David Kosse, VP of International Original Film at Netflix. &#8220;Roar is an extremely skilled filmmaker and I&#8217;m excited for him to go back to his Norwegian roots with this ambitious, fun film.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Also chiming in were producers Espen Horn and Kristian Strand Sinkerud, who said, &#8220;We are thrilled to bring <em>Troll</em> to life, a Norwegian fairy tale figure, played, directed and produced by Norwegians for the global market. We at Motion Blur are ecstatic to finally announce this collaboration with director Roar Uthaug and Netflix.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Uthaug has built a reputation in his home country of Norway for delivering high-end action on a budget. He broke through with the Scandinavian horror film <em>Cold Prey</em>, which spawned several sequels. But it was the 2015 disaster flick <em>The Wave</em>, Norway&#8217;s first major disaster movie, that earned Hollywood&#8217;s attention, causing Uthaug to be tapped to direct the perfectly middling 2018 <em>Tomb Raider</em> reboot for Warner Bros. and MGM. Here&#8217;s hoping his passion for this project is better translated into the final product.</p>\n<p>Netflix plans to release <i>Troll</i> worldwide on its streaming platform in <strong>2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/troll-netflix-movie-roar-uthaug/\">Norwegian Action Adventure &#8216;Troll&#8217; Coming to Netflix From &#8216;Tomb Raider&#8217; Director Roar Uthaug</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=u8uSScfa2tE:-CgHEALkJDE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=u8uSScfa2tE:-CgHEALkJDE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=u8uSScfa2tE:-CgHEALkJDE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=u8uSScfa2tE:-CgHEALkJDE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=u8uSScfa2tE:-CgHEALkJDE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=u8uSScfa2tE:-CgHEALkJDE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/u8uSScfa2tE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 18:30:08 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Roar-Uthaug-e1598369532197-700x343.jpg","linkMd5":"7307889a45ac56f06a14069a244715ef","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn12@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-05-18-578_ae9fbf6534b93dfe.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":343,"sourceBytes":34711,"destBytes":15606,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Roar-Uthaug-e1598369532197-700x343.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn12@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-05-18-578_ae9fbf6534b93dfe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/26/05-05-48-243_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=u8uSScfa2tE:-CgHEALkJDE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn63@2020_4/2020/08/26/05-05-48-460_9d199132a7c59f66.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-49-040_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=u8uSScfa2tE:-CgHEALkJDE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/26/05-05-48-449_3386169363fe7b8c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/u8uSScfa2tE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn77@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-05-48-235_e9677c1c179a5d27.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598418317942},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","title":"‘Tenet’ Box Office: Christopher Nolan’s Latest Looking at $25 Million Overseas Debut","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633676","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tenet-box-office-overseas.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633690\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tenet-box-office-overseas-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"tenet box office overseas\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tenet-box-office-overseas-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tenet-box-office-overseas-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tenet-box-office-overseas-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tenet-box-office-overseas.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>After months of hype and confusion, <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Tenet</em> </strong>is finally headed to theaters – in select locations. The film will open where it can in the U.S. next week, but this week, it bows overseas. Warner Bros. obviously would&#8217;ve preferred to release this thing worldwide all at once, but since that was an impossibility, they&#8217;re hedging their bets. So how is the potential <em>Tenet</em> box office looking outside the U.S.? Well&#8230;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633676\"></span></p>\n<p>According to Deadline, when <em>Tenet</em> opens this week in the UK, Korea, France, Germany, Australia, Italy, and Spain this week, it stands to take in $25 million. That&#8217;s not <em>bad</em>, but it&#8217;s not exactly worth jumping up and down over. For comparison, <em>Peninsula</em>, a much smaller movie with a lot less hype, took in $20.8 million worldwide when it opened recently.</p>\n<p>Of course, we&#8217;re in a weird new world now, and box office hauls aren&#8217;t going to be what they used to be. For instance, in Korea, <em>Tenet</em> hosted previews last weekend, and took in about $717,000 in previews on 590 screens, which, according to Deadline, &#8220;was off by 70% from the previous session&#8221; in the same market. In total, there should be about 40 markets playing the film come this weekend. And then there will be the U.S. to consider.</p>\n<p>The movie can&#8217;t open everywhere in the States – many states aren&#8217;t ready yet, and it was recently reported that Warner Bros. is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tenet-drive-ins/\">limiting</a> where the film can screen in drive-ins (the story goes that WB doesn&#8217;t want the movie playing at drive-ins in markets where indoor theaters aren&#8217;t open, which just sounds all kinds of dumb). Nolan films usually do very well at the box office, but <em>Tenet</em> has an uphill battle: Warners reportedly spent about $400 million on the film&#8217;s production and marketing, which means it needs to earn about $800 million to break even.</p>\n<p>In the pre-COVID days, that would probably be easy-peasy for Nolan and company. But here, in a world where the coronavirus is still very much lingering, it&#8217;s hard to say how this is going to play out. While some theaters in the U.S. are open right now, it appears the big movie business at the moment is coming from drive-ins (<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/top-venues-for-unhinged-movie-were-all-drive-ins-2020-8\">Business Insider</a> says the recently released Russell Crowe thriller <em>Unhinged</em> earned most of its money so far from five drive-in venues), and if WB really <em>does</em> plan to limit drive-in screenings, it could hurt them in the long run.</p>\n<p>In related news, no virus is too deadly for risk-taker Tom Cruise, who recently went to see <em>Tenet</em> on the big screen and even posted a video about it.

Now the first teaser trailer for the game has arrived, and if you&#8217;re wondering, &#8220;Hmm, does this teaser begin with fish carcasses?&#8221;, then trust me when I say you are going to want to watch this sucker <em>immediately</em>.<span id=\"more-633649\"></span></p>\n<h2>Gollum Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPoKVR7dDvI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I think the biggest question we all have is: will there be a mini-game in which Gollum has to catch fish and smash them against rocks like he does in Peter Jackson&#8217;s trilogy? Because <em>Gollum: Fish Smasher</em> is a game concept I could get behind.</p>\n<p>Previous reports had indicated that this game would take place before the events of <em>The Hobbit</em>, but it turns out those weren&#8217;t exactly true. Instead, the game starts with Gollum traveling to Mordor on the hunt for Bilbo Baggins, who outsmarted him and took his &#8220;precious&#8221; ring in his cave during the story of <em>The Hobbit</em>. The action will play out before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien&#8217;s <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> narrative begins.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The game mixes stealth with vertical climbing parkour,&#8221; the game&#8217;s lead designer, <strong>Martin Wilkes</strong>, told <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/gollum-lord-of-the-rings-game-prince-of-persia-stealth-branching-narrative-exclusive-trailer\">IGN</a> (via <a href=\"https://ew.com/gaming/gollum-lord-of-the-rings-video-game-trailer/?amp=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EW</a>). &#8220;If you want a reference you might think of it as similar to <em>Prince of Persia</em>. It is mostly a non-combat game, but Gollum will be able to stealthily take out enemies. However, this will not be easy and always come with big risks. We want players to carefully weigh these encounters. After all, Gollum&#8217;s strengths lie in cunning, not combat.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Previously, Daedalic&#8217;s CEO <strong>Carsten Fichtelmann </strong>teased how the character&#8217;s dual personalities will inform the gameplay. &#8220;You already have that big conflict in the character, two voices talking to you continuously, which means there is a good reason there are decisions to make in the game: the Smeagol decisions or the Gollum decision,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have the story that we all know from the book, but everything that happens to him before he appears in the book are the main things we will see in our game. We will tell the story before he first appears in the books.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The game will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC sometime in <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/gollum-trailer/\">Gollum Becomes the Hero of His Own Story in &#8216;Lord of the Rings&#8217; Prequel Game Trailer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=TyRI-1Ep0x0:ZgBPkgUyqLg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=TyRI-1Ep0x0:ZgBPkgUyqLg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=TyRI-1Ep0x0:ZgBPkgUyqLg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=TyRI-1Ep0x0:ZgBPkgUyqLg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=TyRI-1Ep0x0:ZgBPkgUyqLg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=TyRI-1Ep0x0:ZgBPkgUyqLg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/TyRI-1Ep0x0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 23:00:52 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Gollum-trailer-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c0bdf7853f708de088adaf240a5cb002","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-18-407_5bedbc4c4c63eb12.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":43992,"destBytes":30646,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Gollum-trailer-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-18-407_5bedbc4c4c63eb12.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/26/05-05-48-243_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=TyRI-1Ep0x0:ZgBPkgUyqLg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn96@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-48-241_dbe9e1ca7964a7ae.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-49-040_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=TyRI-1Ep0x0:ZgBPkgUyqLg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-48-405_b7d5995b4045b058.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/TyRI-1Ep0x0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-48-270_33a60aa08728c3cb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598418317943},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","title":"‘Carnival Row’ Season 2 Wraps Post-COVID Filming in Czech Republic","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633638","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Carnival-Row-Season-2-Wraps.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633674\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Carnival-Row-Season-2-Wraps-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Carnival Row Season 2 Wraps\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Carnival-Row-Season-2-Wraps-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Carnival-Row-Season-2-Wraps-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Carnival-Row-Season-2-Wraps-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Carnival-Row-Season-2-Wraps.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>When the coronavirus hit, many film and TV productions had to shut down. Over the last few weeks, we&#8217;ve seen a handful gear back up again. And now we have news of a production actually finishing here in the post-COVID world: <strong><em>Carnival Row</em></strong> season 2 has wrapped in the Czech Republic. To be clear, the show had already shot most of its second season when it had to shut down in March, and only had about two weeks left. But now, it&#8217;s done.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633638\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/artisans/global/carnival-row-starring-orlando-bloom-and-cara-delevingne-wraps-post-covid-shoot-in-czech-republic-1234745906/\">Variety</a> says that <em>Carnival Row</em> season 2 has wrapped post-COVID filming in the Czech Republic. The second season of the Amazon series starring <strong>Orlando Bloom</strong> and <strong>Cara Delevingne</strong> actually started shooting on November 11, 2019, but had to shut down in March 2020 due to the pandemic. At that point, only two weeks of shooting remained, and now the production has managed to finish those two weeks.</p>\n<p>Producer <strong>David Minkowski</strong> said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Czech film industry was hard hit due to the global coronavirus shutdown. I appreciate that the Czech government acted fast and provided great support in order to restart film production. Since the country re-opened May 7, international production has returned quickly. It’s a testament to the amazing cast and crew of ‘Carnival Row’ that it was one of the first global shows to get back on its feet and complete filming. To be sure, we adopted strict health and safety protocols even though the presence of the virus in the Czech Republic is low.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Showrunner <strong>Erik Oleson</strong> added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The craftsmanship of our Czech crew is second to none, among the best I have ever seen in 30-plus years in the business. The massive sets of <em>Carnival Row</em> are built out in such meticulous detail that you wouldn’t know you’re on a back lot. You can walk its streets and alleys and directly into buildings that are functional working sets of their own. What would be prohibitively expensive to construct and film elsewhere is not only possible in the Czech Republic, the locals make it happen for a reasonable price and with a smile.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While none of this is making me want to finally watch <em>Carnival Row</em>, it is making me want to move to the Czech Republic, so that&#8217;s something. Premiering on Amazon last August, <em>Carnival Row</em> follows &#8220;mythical creatures who have fled their war-torn homeland and gathered in the city as tensions are simmering between citizens and the growing immigrant population.&#8221; Amazon renewed the show for a second season before season 1 premiered.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/carnival-row-season-2-wraps/\">&#8216;Carnival Row&#8217; Season 2 Wraps Post-COVID Filming in Czech Republic</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Sj6uTSizhzw:sv_THzUBVSM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Sj6uTSizhzw:sv_THzUBVSM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Sj6uTSizhzw:sv_THzUBVSM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Sj6uTSizhzw:sv_THzUBVSM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Sj6uTSizhzw:sv_THzUBVSM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Sj6uTSizhzw:sv_THzUBVSM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Sj6uTSizhzw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 21:30:41 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Carnival-Row-Season-2-Wraps-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"81b461c39661904f313471026cf861d6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/26/05-05-18-499_19327ffc26734587.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":34004,"destBytes":21854,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Carnival-Row-Season-2-Wraps-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/26/05-05-18-499_19327ffc26734587.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/26/05-05-48-243_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Sj6uTSizhzw:sv_THzUBVSM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn83@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-48-296_f23892665cad9593.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-49-040_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Sj6uTSizhzw:sv_THzUBVSM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-48-324_0fe05118221419ff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Sj6uTSizhzw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn35@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-48-248_285dbbcb47ea5810.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598418317939},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","title":"‘Upstate’: Ryan Reynolds to Star in and Co-Write Netflix Comedy With John August","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633605","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-633610\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ryan-reynolds-1-e1598373234539-700x331.jpg\" alt=\"upstate\" width=\"700\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ryan-reynolds-1-e1598373234539-700x331.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ryan-reynolds-1-e1598373234539-360x170.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ryan-reynolds-1-e1598373234539-768x363.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ryan-reynolds-1-e1598373234539.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong> is heading <strong><em>Upstate</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>The <em>6 Underground</em> star has struck up his next project with Netflix, teaming with his <em>The Nines</em> director <strong>John August</strong> to co-write an original feature comedy called<em> Upstate</em>, which is being eyed as a starring vehicle for Reynolds.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633605\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline broke the news that Netflix has made a deal with Reynolds and August for the original feature comedy <em>Upstate</em>, which is being set up with the intention for Reynolds to star.

The psychological thriller, which is broken into three chapters centered around three men (all played by Reynolds) who try to uncover the secret about strange happenings in their overlapping lives, also starred Hope Davis, Melissa McCarthy, and Elle Fanning. It was an experimental sci-fi indie film that sounded like a small-budget experiment for both Reynolds and August, who seem to have taken a liking to working together at the very least.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V__BrpVJw44?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>August, who has recently come off penning Disney&#8217;s live-action <em>Aladdin</em> remake, is best known for writing films like <em>Go, Big Fish, Charlie&#8217;s Angels, </em>and <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</em> He also wrote the book series <em>Arlo Finch</em> and the Brett Haley-directed<em> Grease</em> prequel<em> Summer Lovin&#8217;</em> at Paramount.

With pieces of pop culture from that decade ranging from 20 to 30 years old, movies are starting to dig into the 1990s as a retro period of time, and a new documentary coming to Hulu will give us an interesting perspective on the Hollywood of that decade and what life was like in it, thanks to the camcorder of <em>Punky Brewster</em> star <strong>Soleil Moon Frye</strong>.<span id=\"more-633628\"></span></p>\n<p><em><strong>KID 90</strong></em> is a new documentary that has just been picked up by Hulu, and it will give us a personal and eye-opening glimpse into the past from within the world of Hollywood. After finding fame as a young lead of the family sitcom <em>Punky Brewster</em>, <strong>Soleil Moon Frye</strong> attempted to maintain a teen acting career throughout the 1990s. During that time, she made a habit out of carrying around a camcorder and logged hundreds of hours of candid footage from her life, including voicemails, audio recordings, and diary entries.</p>\n<p>Helping to provide a glimpse into life as a young star at the time, Frye&#8217;s friends <strong>David Arquette</strong>, <strong>Balt Getty</strong>, <strong>Brian Austin Green</strong>, <strong>Stephen Dorff</strong>, and <strong>Mark-Paul Gosselaar</strong> will all participate in interviews. Plus, the camcorder footage has glimpses of <strong>Harold Hunter</strong>, <strong>Justin Pierce</strong>, <strong>Danny Boy O’Connor</strong>, <strong>Jenny Lewis</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Brandis</strong>, and many others in all their &#8217;90s glory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I often wondered if things had happened the way that I remembered them and I finally decided to unlock the vault,&#8221; Frye said of the project to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/soleil-moon-frye-to-give-never-before-seen-look-at-90s-hollywood-with-kid-90-documentary-for-hulu-exclusive?utm_source=twitter&#38;utm_medium=social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. &#8220;What started as a documentary about my friends and our lives soon became a coming-of-age story about myself that has changed me forever.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frye is producing the documentary along with Leonardo DiCaprio&#8217;s Appian Way Productions, as well as STX Entertainment, where her husband <strong>Jason Goldberg</strong> will be executive producing. Goldberg added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is a captivating and compelling film that has been a work in progress since the &#8217;90s and has been literally coming together for the last 30 years. What is remarkable is that, Soleil had the presence of mind to know how this footage might be used one day. She has such a natural eye for detail and a caring, loving approach to capturing the lives of the people around her. As a filmmaker, she has brought a unique voice to assembling that footage and recreating that era in this story as she depicts that time and place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The sitcom star is also getting nostalgic about her own show with a reboot of <em>Punky Brewster</em> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/punky-brewster-and-saved-by-the-bell-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">coming to Peacock soon</a>. The series follows her character all grown up and trying to raise three kids as a single mother. When she meets an orphan girl who reminds her of the kid she used to be, she decides to rediscover her own &#8220;Punky Power&#8221; as she helps a new kid get back on her feet.</p>\n<p>Honestly, the documentary sounds much more interesting.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hulu-picks-up-kid-90-documentary/\">Hulu Picks Up &#8216;KID 90&#8217; Documentary, Looking Back at the &#8217;90s Hollywood Life of &#8216;Punky Brewster&#8217; Star Soleil Moon Frye</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sPTkjJeXdZE:l-5SM4UbvnQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sPTkjJeXdZE:l-5SM4UbvnQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sPTkjJeXdZE:l-5SM4UbvnQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sPTkjJeXdZE:l-5SM4UbvnQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sPTkjJeXdZE:l-5SM4UbvnQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sPTkjJeXdZE:l-5SM4UbvnQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/sPTkjJeXdZE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 23:30:02 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soleilmoonfrye-punkyreboot-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"e64c80f30d1b202ca240de45a84e1c4b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-05-18-465_d7e75d6e88d21f23.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":20597,"destBytes":10274,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/soleilmoonfrye-punkyreboot-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-05-18-465_d7e75d6e88d21f23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/26/05-05-48-243_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sPTkjJeXdZE:l-5SM4UbvnQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/26/05-05-48-385_a7642380966c5884.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-49-040_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sPTkjJeXdZE:l-5SM4UbvnQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/26/05-05-48-290_183ff4554f39eb1b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/sPTkjJeXdZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-48-193_edf34b58606780c0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598418317944},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","title":"‘Get Duked!’ Clip: A Group of Teens Gets Lost in the Highlands in New Amazon Comedy","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633617","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-633629 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Get-Duked-clip-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Get Duked clip\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Get-Duked-clip.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Get-Duked-clip-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Later this week, an indie slasher comedy called <em><strong>Get Duked!</strong></em> hits Amazon Prime Video.

Eager to cut loose and smoke weed in the Scottish Highlands, the trio finds themselves paired with straight-laced Ian, a fellow camper determined to play by the rules. After veering off-path into remote farmland that&#8217;s worlds away from their urban comfort zone, the boys find themselves hunted down by a shadowy force hell-bent on extinguishing their futures.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This clip takes place shortly after the boys&#8217; instructor points out the path they&#8217;re supposed to take and sets them off on their journey across the highlands.</p>\n<h2>Get Duked Clip</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/02_z5exu0v4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Writer-director <strong>Ninian Doff</strong>, who directed short films and music videos for artists like Run the Jewels, Miike Snow, Migos, and Mykki Blanco, is making his feature directorial debut with this movie, and his background in music videos becomes evident pretty quickly.

But the film won several awards on the festival circuit, including the Audience Award in the Midnights section at SXSW 2019, and even the worst title can&#8217;t take away the fact that this is a fun and often hilarious movie that&#8217;s absolutely worth seeing, regardless of what it&#8217;s called.</p>\n<p><strong>Samuel Bottomley</strong>, <strong>Rian Gordon</strong>, <strong>Lewis Gribben</strong>, <strong>Viraj Juneja</strong>, <strong>Kate Dickie</strong>, <strong>Kevin Guthrie</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Aris</strong>, <strong>Georgia Glen</strong>, <strong>Alice Lowe</strong>, <strong>Brian Pettifer</strong>, <strong>James Cosmo</strong>, and <strong>Eddie Izzard</strong> star, and <em>Get Duked!</em> lands on Amazon Prime Video on <strong>August 28</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/get-duked-clip/\">&#8216;Get Duked!&#8217; Clip: A Group of Teens Gets Lost in the Highlands in New Amazon Comedy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rYecAe7K0-8:vmAKqiPJ-xE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rYecAe7K0-8:vmAKqiPJ-xE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rYecAe7K0-8:vmAKqiPJ-xE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rYecAe7K0-8:vmAKqiPJ-xE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=rYecAe7K0-8:vmAKqiPJ-xE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rYecAe7K0-8:vmAKqiPJ-xE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rYecAe7K0-8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 21:00:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Get-Duked-clip-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"98e3dc542b0f63ed4569220886a69cd4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-05-18-691_3c148f30ea03fe11.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31631,"destBytes":20494,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Get-Duked-clip-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn20@2020_6/2020/08/26/05-05-18-691_3c148f30ea03fe11.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/26/05-05-48-243_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rYecAe7K0-8:vmAKqiPJ-xE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn78@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-48-368_51842058173c9da8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/26/05-05-49-040_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=rYecAe7K0-8:vmAKqiPJ-xE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/26/05-05-48-229_d39501399ba7860f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/rYecAe7K0-8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn48@2020_3/2020/08/26/05-05-48-298_fca091c94516eef8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598418317939},{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 13:05:17","title":"The ‘Tesla’ Science Advisor Breaks Down the Accuracy of the Electrifying New Biopic","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=633370","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-626075 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tesla-e1598315797638-700x292.jpg\" alt=\"tesla trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tesla-e1598315797638-700x292.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tesla-e1598315797638-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tesla-e1598315797638-768x321.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tesla-e1598315797638.jpg 1439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 is a reminder of just how important science is in every aspect of our lives. With a global pandemic that has lasted for months on end and sadly taken hundreds of thousands of lives prematurely, scientists hold the key to restoring our safety and previous way of life. However, scientists are unfortunately not always respected, let alone believed. And yet, their contributions extend beyond technological advancements and medicine, but into art as well. They are being utilized more and more in film and television, but appreciation can still go unnoticed and unappreciated despite their esoteric knowledge. Thanks to scientific consultants, characters are more realistic, storylines are more probable, and science on screen is more entertaining. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to dive deeper into this process, I recently spoke with scientific consultant </span><a href=\"https://nanolight.me.columbia.edu/\"><b>P. James Schuck</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on his contributions to director </span><b>Michael Almereyda</b>&#8216;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s latest film, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tesla-movie-review/\">the stunning biopic</a> </span><strong><i>Tesla</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-633370\"></span></p>\n<p><b>Can you give a brief overview of your work and how you were brought on to be the scientific adviser for <em>Tesla</em>?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My background deals with electromagnetic radiation and light. In a sense, there’s some remote control of various items and we do that by shining light back and forth these days, not just microwaves and radio waves. My PhD is in applied physics, and I’ve spent a lot of my time working on making antennas for electromagnetic radiation – in particular, light. Tesla’s work has always been near and dear to my heart. That said, I learned a lot about Tesla and I think I only appreciated a fraction of the work he’d done before I started working on this film. I have to give Michael a lot of credit for teaching me many things and kind of realizing what an amazing and complicated person Tesla has been and also how interesting his life has been, which hasn’t really been touched on before this film.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My understanding was that the film was written by Michael either in film school or right out of film school. It’s a project he wanted to do for a long time but didn’t have the right circumstances to make it happen. He eventually got this grant through the </span><a href=\"https://sloan.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SLOAN Foundation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://sffilm.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SFFILM</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and was coming to the Bay Area to work on it. At the time, I was living and working in Berkeley at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab doing my research. I happened to know someone associated with SLOAN and SFFilm. When she found out what Michael was looking for, they immediately called me. They had me at hello (laughs). I mean, I thought the project was amazing. </span></p>\n<p><b>What things did you learn or appreciate more about Tesla from working on the film?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What I was most familiar with was his work on building his AC (alternating current) motors and the fact that that was the technology which won out despite Thomas Edison’s attempt to make DC current be the main power source. By the way – and this is a total tangent – did you know that maybe one of the last Edison DC power stations was finally just discontinued down on Lower Manhattan? They had signed something like a ninety-nine year lease or contract, and it finally ran out.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh wow. No, I didn</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><b>t know that. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yeah! So, there were people still using DC power and there are advantages to DC, but for what everyone else wanted to use it for mostly up until now, AC was clearly the better technology. I was familiar with AC dynamotors and generators, essentially. I knew he was associated with these Tesla coils that have these lighting spikes flying out of his hands into these beautiful spheres that you can find in science museums now. But, I hadn’t fully appreciated what he had done [with] what we think of now as fluorescent lighting and types of wireless power, things like that. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He was certainly a showman and one of his earliest demonstrations was in collaboration with Columbia University, which I hadn’t fully appreciated at the time. He stood in the middle of a room with what was a precursor for a fluorescent light bulb or a fluorescent tube, and showed that it could light up. He ran his Tesla coils along the side which created a huge amount of electromagnetic radiation, basically radio waves, that ran through. I had not really appreciated how he was doing those shows and that’s how people realized that energy could be easily transmitted with these electromagnetic waves through seemingly invisible energy transfer. I can see how that must have been pretty impressive back in the day. I wish I could’ve seen them.</span></p>\n<p><b>What did your involvement process on the film look like? Did you mostly help with script or did you work directly with the actors and perhaps even help with set design?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was mostly involved with the script. I spoke with Michael several times, and I read two or three different versions of the script which, for myself, was really neat to see how things evolved. Nominally, he asked me to go through the scientific content and add any other comments I had. In a sense, I learned a lot from Michael because he pulled a lot of scientific dialogue from original sources. Since the language was completely correct, there wasn’t a lot to fact check since it was pulled from the original scientific sources themselves. That was impressive and it even helped me understand the parallels on how the physics evolved. At the time, they didn’t understand electricity very well. A lot of the words they used like ‘tension’ or ‘flow’ come from things they did understand better. Tension came from cables in pulley systems or flow came from water flow. A lot of the language comes from drawing analogies to systems that were better studied during the turn of the century. I studied that as part of my degree, but it was neat to see those in real context and to see them come from direct sources as opposed to just textbooks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I didn’t work much with the actors, but I did spend a little time with Michael and Ethan Hawke on a panel at Sundance. Michael had found someone who was very good at studying and recreating old scientific instruments. When I saw the instruments in the movie, it was really impressive to see. For example, there was that one scene with the spinning egg. Tesla was somewhat famous for that </span><a href=\"https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles/teslas-egg-columbus\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">spinning egg</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because he just used rotating magnetic fields from his rotating AC current. That was sort of an early version of showing how he can change the phase of his AC currents. I remember looking for that specifically while going through the script and to make sure it was in the film, and sure enough it was. So, seeing that recreated even as a replica was pretty cool. I wish I had the ability to recreate those old instruments. I can build the modern version of what he was doing because that’s what we do in our lab, but it was neat to see those older pieces.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that I appreciated from Michael is that he clearly wanted to get as many diverse inputs and opinions about the film as possible. One of the first times we talked, we talked about the science but he wanted to know what else struck me about the script in terms of the story and characters. We got into some really interesting conversations, and he really wanted to get input from someone with a PhD background. It was really fun giving him my take on the characters, too. We also spoke about the ending and the way that turned out was really great. If there was a time I was going to be able to interact with the actors, that would have been it. Something tells me doing a karaoke scene with Ethan Hawke or even just being there would’ve been pretty cool. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, looking back especially with the company Tesla, you can kind of appreciate Tesla’s life as a whole and it’s not such a sad ending. At the time, it kind of felt as he got older, he was moving from one hotel to another and giving these birthday speeches that were getting more and more far-fetched or out of touch. It was kind of sad to read some of that history and it was in earlier versions of the script, but I think Michael wanted to point out that the Tesla story wasn’t meant to be a sad one in the long run. A lot of what he said turned out to be more right than wrong. There was some crazy tinfoil hat, old man stuff coming out, but I think most scientists are secretly tinfoil hat people that love to have hypotheses and see how far they can push them.</span></p>\n<p><b>That</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><b>s one thing I enjoyed about the film. This movie is really unique in how it</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><b>s filmed in terms of the production and set design as well as breaking the fourth wall. It has a lot of creative and quirky elements to capture Tesla</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><b>s legacy and him as a person.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s accurate, and I agree. I really think he thought a lot about that breaking of the fourth wall and almost as a way to convey how influential he is on everything we have right now. Some might hate it, some might love it. I loved it and thought it was a very creative and ingenious move. It’s one of my favorite parts, and I also loved it when Edison went over the bar and pulled out his cell phone.</span></p>\n<p><b>Oh yeah, that was great. There</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><b>s also this allegory behind it about how art and science can be blended together and woven throughout time to still be relevant. He was also ahead of his time in a lot of ways.</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agreed. It was a really good and unique take that could have been very cliche, but it was a different perspective than I’ve ever seen or heard. It made me appreciate it more. </span></p>\n<p><b>From a scientific point of view, do you think this film coming out right now is timely?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do. Like a lot of life, science is somewhat cyclical and we talk about this in my research group, about how science is like a helix and similar topics come up again and again periodically. What advances are other technologies, tools, capabilities, and so then you can get more and more knowledge on these topics as they come back around. I do think it’s a really timely film. I also think there would have been relevant times twenty years ago as well. Even David Bowie played Tesla at one point, but I think now is particularly important for several factors. One is Elon Musk’s company, but also the internet being where it’s at, people fighting over technologies and people maybe attempting to use disinformation to get their own interests or perspectives across. On maybe a more pragmatic point of view, you know </span><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-current-war-directors-cut-review/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Current War</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a pretty bad representation of Tesla. In fact, I think it’s quite misleading. So, I’m glad this film came out so people can get a better view of Tesla’s important contributions. The main characters [in that movie] are more Westinghouse and Edison while Tesla is portrayed as this sort of a weaselly eccentric in the background. </span></p>\n<p><b>Yeah, Tesla has been portrayed in a few different ways. In reality, he wasn</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><b>t very social and didn</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><b>t prioritize romantic relationships. I liked how this film leaned into portraying him as more of a philosopher and Renaissance Man. I think he spoke eight languages and he also enjoyed poetry and music. It was cool to see a more robust depiction of a famous scientist because that image can be so one-dimensional at times. </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh yeah, I agree. For me, of course, I always appreciate when the scientist is a bit more multi-dimensional. There’s articles out there in the history of science – and someone wrote a thesis about this – on how scientists fit into one of six categories in movies currently and how those types have evolved a little bit. It’s nice to see a little more multi-dimensionality because I think that also helps people not be afraid of science. </span></p>\n<p><b>Can you talk about the need to hire scientific advisers in film and television and how pivotal they are in not only conveying scientific accuracy, but an overall story as well?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think there are a number of reasons! I don’t want to get too political, but just having some appreciation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> people are doing science and what motivates them, aside from some crazy lunatic who is wanting to take over the world or recreate dinosaurs while screwing whatever impact that has on the rest of the world. It doesn’t come through in their academic papers, but I do think scientists get a little obsessed with stories and narratives themselves. I think that’s what drives them to want to investigate and learn about whatever new part of the universe they’re searching for and investigating. So, I think there’s some really compelling stories that come through there. When I talk to scientists or non-scientists and non-experts, I think these stories are still compelling to a lot of people. In the end, it’s still people doing science. So, I think that connection would come through more with additional consulting or dialogue going on. I guess what I’m mostly saying is that we’re all more alike than we think. There are some aspects that can be pulled out more and some similarities between science and even filmmaking beyond just the fact they’re both creative endeavors at their heart. </span></p>\n<p><b>I love that. It was so great speaking with you! Is there anything else you</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><b>d like to add that we didn</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’</span><b>t discuss? </b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of Tesla’s first demonstrations and lectures he did in New York City that he was famous for were sponsored by the society that became The Electrical Engineering Society. A number of them had Columbia University connections, which is where I’m at. Columbia was actually the first university to give Tesla an honorary degree, ahead of Yale. That was something that was wrong in the film and that I gave Michael a hard time about that.

It&#8217;s a first for the Walt Disney Company&#8217;s streaming service, and it could set a new precedent for certain theatrical releases to follow suit. That means Disney has to spread the word about how people can watch the movie through their Disney+ accounts, and the studio hopes a new featurette focusing on star <strong>Yifei Liu</strong> will push audiences to make the effort to figure it out.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, new details on <em>Mulan</em>&#8216;s international Disney+ release have come to light with regards to the pricing of the &#8220;Premier Access&#8221; purchase of the movie, which will be available to watch whenever you want as long as you have a Disney+ subscription. However, there is one international territory who won&#8217;t be seeing <em>Mulan</em> for a while after outcry from their theatrical exhibitors. Watch the <em>Mulan</em> featurette and find out more about the film&#8217;s release around the world below.<span id=\"more-633607\"></span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1vZm87G3jpw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>You couldn&#8217;t ask for better praise for Yifei Liu from the film&#8217;s cast and crew. But then again, none of them are going to be found saying terrible things about her in official promotional materials for the movie. However, the residents of Hong Kong have certainly found <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/boycott-mulan-explained-liu-yifei-hong-kong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">something to be upset with the actress about</a> due to her support of the Hong Kong police during the headline-making protests last year. It remains to be seen if that controversy will have any impact on the film&#8217;s box office over there.</p>\n<p>But many major international markets won&#8217;t be seeing the movie in theaters. Instead, they&#8217;ll watch the movie on Disney+ just as we will in the United States. However, it sounds like they&#8217;ll be paying a little less than we are in America. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/global/disney-mulan-pvod-international-pricing-uk-india-1234747658/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> reports Disney+ subscribers in the UK will only have to pay £19.99 (or $26) for the premium VOD purchase. And that&#8217;s roughly what it will cost in several other international markets. In many European territories such as Spain and Italy, subscribers will pay €21.99 ($26.01). Meanwhile, New Zealand will pay a few cents more at NZ$39.99 ($26.08), and Australia gets the cheapest price at AUS$34.99 (around $25.07).</p>\n<p>However, subscribers in France won&#8217;t have to pay anything extra when <em>Mulan</em> arrives there. Due to vocal outcry from the theatrical exhibitors in the country, Disney will instead release <em>Mulan</em> in the regular Disney+ subscription. However, it will not be available in France at the same time as all the other territories getting the movie on PVOD on September 4. The specific release date in France has not yet been determined.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the movie fares with this new PVOD initiative, especially since some subscribers will probably be a little confused about how to watch. Otherwise, international markets where theaters are already open, such as China, Sinagpore, and Malaysia, will get to see the movie in theaters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"style-scope yt-formatted-string\" dir=\"auto\"><em>Mulan</em> stars <strong>Yifei Liu</strong> as the brave Mulan, <strong>Donnie Yen</strong> as Commander Tung, <strong>Jason Scott Lee</strong> as Böri Khan, <strong>Yoson An</strong> as Cheng Honghui, <strong>Gong Li</strong> as Xianniang, and <strong>Jet Li</strong> as the Emperor.
