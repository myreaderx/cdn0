Instead, the goal should be to foster a true sense of belonging among your team, which is likely filled with people from <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cultural-competence\">all backgrounds</a>.</p>  \n<p>One way to do this is by using inclusive language.</p> \n<p>Whether it's intentional or not, we all carry implicit biases in our everyday language. However, it's important to make a conscious effort to avoid this.</p> \n<p>This isn't <em>just</em> the right thing to do. It also makes good business sense.</p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://learn.joinhandshake.com/employers/70-inclusive-language-principles-that-will-make-you-a-more-successful-recruiter/\">over 70% of students said they prefer a company that is diverse, inclusive and makes them feel included regardless of race, geographic location, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, socioeconomic status, and appearance.</a></p> \n<p>Additionally, creating a sense of belonging can <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/adam-vaccaro/why-letting-employees-express-themselves-is-good-for-business.html\">lead to greater retention rates and even result in higher customer satisfaction</a>.</p> \n<p>So, how can you use more inclusive language?</p> \n<p>Below, we'll review the top tools that can automate this process for you and resources that can help you use more inclusive language.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://betterallies.com/language/\">Better Allies</a></h3> \n<p>During an allyship meeting at HubSpot, we discussed tools that help people use more inclusive language.</p> \n<p>A colleague brought up a Slackbot, Better Allies. This Slackbot can help you shift your language to be more inclusive.</p> \n<p>The tool was inspired by the book Better Allies by Karen Catlin. This book can help you spot situations where you can create more inclusive culture.</p> \n<p>The Slackbot will automatically flag non-inclusive language and make alternate suggestions. You can even customize the tool by adding your own words to avoid and alternate suggestions.</p> \n<p>For example, I want to remove the words \"guys\" and \"crazy\" from my vocabulary. With this tool, I can put those words in the Slackbot and then include suggestions for myself to use instead.</p> \n<h3>2. Inclusive Language Guides</h3> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inclusive-language\">inclusive language</a> guide is a document that will advise you on terms to avoid and alternative terms to use. The goal is to use more inclusive language that doesn't have biases, slang, or discriminatory terms.</p> \n<p>While an inclusive language guide won't help you automate this process, you can use this resource to inform your automation process. For example, you can add terms from an inclusive language guide to your Better Allies Slackbot.</p> \n<p>If your team doesn't have an inclusive language guide, we suggest you create one. Our inclusive language guides at HubSpot have sections on Gender, LGBTQIA+, Race, Ethnicity, Culture, and Accessibility.</p> \n<p>Here are some great examples to get you started:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/inclusive-language-tech/\">Buffer's Inclusive Language Guide for Startups and Tech</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/offensive-phrases-that-people-still-use-2013-11\">Business Insider's Race and Ethnicity Inclusive Language Guide</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/08/alternatives-to-oppressive-language/\">Everyday Feminism's Inclusive Language Guide on Ableism and Homophobia</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://nasaa-arts.org/nasaa_research/inclusive-language-guide/\">NASAA Inclusive Language Guide</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gender-neutral-pronouns\">HubSpot's Guide on Gender Neutral Pronouns</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/socioeconomic-status\">How to Talk About Socioeconomic Status</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://religionstylebook.com/categories\">Religion Stylebook</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.self.com/story/self-weight-health-style-guide\">Self's Weight and Health Style Guide</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation\">Google's Guide for Developers in Writing Inclusive Documentation</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://consciousstyleguide.com/sensitive-style-for-covering-sexual-violence/\">Writing About Sexual Violence</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.knowyourix.org/press-room/guide-for-journalists/\">Gender-Based Violence Language Guide</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.glaad.org/reference\">GLAAD Media Guide</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Company Bots</h3> \n<p>To automate your inclusive language, you can create a bot that will alert you when you use exclusionary terms.</p> \n<p>As you saw above, Better Allies created one to help you on Slack. However, you might want a bot when you're using Google docs or other platforms.</p> \n<p>In that case, you can create your own. At HubSpot, we have a bot that HubSpotters can download on Chrome that will review content for HubSpot's style guide.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://textio.com/\">Textio</a></h3> \n<p>As a company, you produce a lot of content. Your employees have to write a lot. To automate your process, you can use Textio.</p> \n<p>Textio is an augmented writing platform that can give your team a score on the content they write. Plus, it provides suggestions on how to improve.</p> \n<p>This includes bias interruption, expanded language insights, and team analytics. The whole point is to help you write more insightful, inclusive content.</p> \n<p>You can use this for recruiting purposes or just to review your company blogs.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/\">Gender Decoder</a></h3> \n<p>A quick way to check your language for gender bias is to use this gender decoder. You can just copy and paste your content in it and get quick results.</p> \n<p>While this was created to analyze job ads to ensure you use inclusive language, you can put any content in there.</p> \n<p>I even put this blog content in to see the results. The tool told me, \"This uses more words that are subtly coded as feminine than words that are subtly coded as masculine (according to the research). Fortunately, the research suggests this will have only a slight effect on how appealing this is to men, and will encourage women.\"</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/kimberle_crenshaw_the_urgency_of_intersectionality\">TEDTalk with Kimberl√© Crenshaw</a></h3> \n<p>While using tools to help automate your inclusive language process is important, it's also necessary to focus efforts on continued learning.</p> \n<p>That's why we recommend watching this short (only 18 minutes) TEDTalk on the urgency of intersectionality. This talk discusses the reality of race and gender bias so we can understand how the two combine and create more harm.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the goal is to broaden your understanding of intersectionality and implicit bias so you can recognize it when it occurs and speak up for victims of prejudice.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhENGl3XviM\">MTV Decoded</a></h3> \n<p>For an even shorter way to continue your education (5 minutes), you can watch this great video from MTV on phrases that have a racist origin.</p> \n<p>Again, this is an easy and quick way to continue learning about implicit bias so you can adjust your language to be more inclusive.</p> \n<p>You can consider sending these types of short videos to your employees to encourage them to use more inclusive language and continue learning.</p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.tolerance.org/professional-development/test-yourself-for-hidden-bias\">Implicit Bias Test</a></h3> \n<p>A great way to see if you're using inclusive language is to test yourself on implicit biases. This test will measure unconscious bias.</p> \n<p>This is an excellent step to take so you can examine, understand, and recognize your own biases and when you're using exclusionary language.</p> \n<p>We recommend sending this to people on your team as well. This will help your whole team begin to understand and use more inclusive language as a whole.</p> \n<p>Taking active steps to use inclusive language is an important part of allyship. Additionally, it's important for your employees and customers to see that you participate in and encourage others to continue learning about other people's experiences.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftools-inclusive-language&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 08:30:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"530bb725ffca2ef968f037a071020440","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftools-inclusive-language&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn37@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-51-864_d766d35befeb17b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389707},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"How to Implement & Succeed With Marketing Automation","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation","description":"<p>Emails. Social media posts. PPC campaigns. <em>Wait</em> ‚Äî another email. Don‚Äôt miss that new lead that just downloaded your online course!</p>  \n<p>The life of a marketer or business owner is <em>busy</em>. Your brain is constantly swirling with ideas, which doesn‚Äôt help you get to the bottom of your never-ending task list. Believe me ‚Äî as both a marketer and business owner, I know how this feels.</p> \n<p>In the past 20 or so years, new tools and technology have helped simplify some of these tasks ‚Ä¶ but this increase has also served to heighten customers‚Äô expectations: <em>Oh, our audience is expecting abandoned cart emails now? Okay, let me add that to the list‚Ä¶</em></p> \n<p><em></em></p> \n<p>One technology improvement has made marketers‚Äô lives abundantly easier, however ‚Äî marketing automation. This guide will walk you through the ins and outs of marketing automation, including:</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Let‚Äôs dive in.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>If you‚Äôve ever done some midnight shopping (ahem, like me) and <em>immediately</em> received a confirmation email, you‚Äôve been met with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/what-is-marketing-automation-a-beginners-guide\">marketing automation</a>. You didn‚Äôt think there was a poor guy sitting behind his computer at 1:00 AM waiting for new purchases to come through, did you?</p> \n<p>No, that online store likely has some pre-written and scheduled email automations ready to go out when their customers complete certain tasks on their website. We‚Äôll talk more about email marketing automation below.</p> \n<p>Other marketing automations include social media, advertising, and SMS marketing automation, as well as internal automations that help you manage and triage marketing tasks.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/lead-management?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Marketing automation can help you capture and nurture more (and more qualified) leads. Learn more about how to do this in our free HubSpot Academy course.</a></em></p> \n<p>Nearly <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">70% of marketing leaders</a> are currently using a marketing platform. Of those who are automating marketing, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">23%</a> are automating their content delivery.</p> \n<p>Marketing automations can certainly make life easier, but it shouldn‚Äôt replace human touch. As I said in the introduction, a recent increase in technology has been met with increased or changed consumer expectations. Marketing automation is no exception ‚Äî consumers appreciate the timeliness and thoughtfulness of automation, but they also can also read between the lines of bot-written copy or stale imagery.</p> \n<p>Marketing automation should complement your current marketing efforts, not replace them.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What is marketing automation primarily used for?</h2> \n<p>Marketing automation is primarily used to mechanize and automate otherwise manual marketing tasks like sending emails, posting social media messages, collecting information, and managing internal tasks.</p> \n<h3>Benefits of Marketing Automation</h3> \n<p>There are countless <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation-benefits\">benefits of marketing automation</a>. A few I‚Äôd like to highlight include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Wasted time is a marketer‚Äôs nightmare. Marketing automation can help you complete repeatable tasks in an efficient <em>and</em> effective manner.</li> \n <li><strong>Nurtured leads</strong>: It takes a lot of time and energy to effectively nurture every individual lead; however, it‚Äôs too important <em>not</em> to. Marketing automation allows you to nurture your leads on a mass scale while still personalizing each lead‚Äôs experience with your brand. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">70% of the companies</a> report that the most important benefit of automation technology is better-targeted customer communication.</li> \n <li><strong>Increased revenue</strong>: The more you nurture your leads, the more leads that‚Äôll likely convert to users. Marketing automation can result in increased revenue as more leads become paying customers.</li> \n <li><strong>Better reporting</strong>: Marketing automation streamlines important marketing tasks and allows you to review and analyze your activity and its results.</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Types of Marketing Automation</h2> \n<p>Marketing automation can take many forms. Let‚Äôs unpack the different types of automation and how you can use them in your marketing.</p> \n<h3>Email Marketing Automation</h3> \n<p>Email marketing automation is perhaps the most common use case for automation. From welcome emails to post-purchase emails and re-engagement emails, there‚Äôs a lot that goes into email marketing. Without <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-automation-examples\">email marketing automations and workflows</a>, email would be an otherwise <em>very</em> manual process.</p> \n<p>Email automation is typically <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/triggered-emails-marketing-automation\">triggered</a> by <strong>time</strong> or <strong>action</strong>. Time-based emails are sent on certain occasions, such as a customer‚Äôs birthday (don‚Äôt you love those free birthday drinks from Starbucks?) or a holiday (Black Friday discounts, anyone?).</p> \n<p>Action-based emails are a bit more involved. These automated emails are triggered by actions taken by a website visitor, lead, or customer who then receives an email or series of emails related to that particular action.</p> \n<p>Let‚Äôs return to my midnight shopping example. Instead of completing my purchase and receiving the subsequent confirmation email, let‚Äôs say I exit the site with items still in my cart‚Äîand within 30 minutes, I receive an email reminding me about the forgotten items. This is called an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/ecommerce/shopping-cart-abandonment-reasons-solutions\">‚Äúabandoned cart‚Äù email</a>, and many online stores deploy them in hopes that shoppers return and complete their purchases. This is an example of an <em>action-based</em> email marketing automation.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image1-Sep-28-2020-08-09-25-32-PM.png?width=188&amp;name=image1-Sep-28-2020-08-09-25-32-PM.png\" alt=\"marketing automation abandoned cart email\" width=\"188\" style=\"width: 188px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><em><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/abandoned-cart-email\">Source</a></em></span></p> \n<p>Email automation campaigns are among the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">top three tactics</a> used by email marketers to improve performance, and email marketing automation has many benefits. The best one (in my opinion) is how it saves precious time and energy by otherwise <em>priceless</em> tasks. Automated emails can help you generate leads and increase revenue, but that doesn‚Äôt mean your marketing team has to spend all their time sending and monitoring them. That‚Äôs what marketing automation is for.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-guide-retargeting-campaigns?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Learn everything you need to know about email marketing in our free HubSpot Academy course.</a></em></p> \n<h3>Digital Marketing Automation</h3> \n<p>Although email marketing is a common use case for marketing automation, it‚Äôs not the only one. Let‚Äôs talk about other forms of digital marketing automation (both external and internal).</p> \n<h4>Social Media Marketing Automation</h4> \n<p>Anyone who works in marketing knows how time-intensive <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29340/how-to-automate-your-social-media-marketing-like-the-pros.aspx\">social media marketing</a> can be. If you‚Äôre going to do it right, you‚Äôve got to do, well, nonstop. Thankfully, marketing automation can help. Tools like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox\">HubSpot</a> and <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\">Hootsuite</a> allow you to schedule content, set social media monitoring filters, and even automate the response process ‚Äî although this should never replace genuine, human interaction with your followers and customers.</p> \n<h4>Advertising Automation</h4> \n<p>You‚Äôve heard of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-guide-retargeting-campaigns\">retargeting</a>, yes? Now ‚Ä¶ could you imagine having to go into every advertising platform and change the copy, graphics, and timing based on each customer‚Äôs individual actions or behavior? Whew, that‚Äôd be a lot. Retargeting is an example of advertising automation, as it automatically shifts and smartens its strategy in response to consumer behavior. If a customer visits your website, your retargeting automation will respond by displaying relevant ads on the sites they browse next.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image3-Sep-28-2020-08-09-25-35-PM.png?width=340&amp;name=image3-Sep-28-2020-08-09-25-35-PM.png\" width=\"340\" style=\"width: 340px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"marketing automation retargeting\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><em><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/crm-automation\">Source</a></em></p> \n<h4>Mobile Marketing Automation</h4> \n<p>As SMS marketing becomes more popular and effective, companies are adding <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28776/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-mastering-mobile-marketing.aspx\">mobile marketing</a> to their marketing automation tool belts. Like emails, text messages can also be automated and triggered based on time or actions, and they tend to have a higher (and faster) open rate than emails.</p> \n<h4>CRM with Marketing Automation</h4> \n<p>Ah, the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm\">CRM</a>‚Äîa marketer‚Äôs best friend. Thankfully, your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/crm-automation\">CRM and marketing automation</a> can go hand-in-hand. A simple update in your database can trigger a whole host of internal tasks, including lead scoring and alerting your sales team to new prospects. You can also use your CRM to trigger email workflows, either based on user data or user actions.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image2-Sep-28-2020-08-09-25-82-PM.png?width=600&amp;name=image2-Sep-28-2020-08-09-25-82-PM.png\" alt=\"marketing automation crm \" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation-software-tools\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source</span></a></em></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Automation Software</h2> \n<p>As a marketer, your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-build-a-marketing-stack\">marketing technology stack</a> may or may not be your best friend ‚Ä¶ I know mine sure is.</p> \n<p>Do you have a favorite tool or two? Let me guess ‚Äî a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation-software-tools\">marketing automation software</a> (if you‚Äôre currently using one) just crossed your mind.</p> \n<p>I don‚Äôt blame you. These tools sure make our lives easier and our customers happier. If you‚Äôre looking for new tools to add to your list, or you‚Äôre wanting to check out marketing automation for the first time, take a look at the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation-software-tools\">marketing automation software tools we‚Äôve compiled in this article</a>. Here are a handful of of my favorites:</p> \n<h3>HubSpot</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm\">HubSpot CRM</a>, as mentioned above, provides many marketing automation features. As a standalone tool, HubSpot‚Äôs marketing automation allows you to automate a variety of tasks, from setting up simple email workflows to building a complex network of rules to target users with tailored emails, live chats, and more.</p> \n<h3>Drip</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.drip.com/\">Drip</a> specializes in e-commerce marketing automation. It‚Äôs mostly used for email marketing and provides email automation workflows, multi-channel marketing, full campaigns, and more.</p> \n<h3>ManyChat</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://manychat.com/\">ManyChat</a> allows you to extend your marketing automation strategy beyond email. Use this tool to build a smart bot to engage with prospects and customers on Facebook Messenger and over SMS. While your marketing automation shouldn‚Äôt replace a human touch, ManyChat can help you get the conversation started with prospects ‚Äî it also captures information from prospects and adds it to your CRM.</p> \n<h3>Sprout Social</h3> \n<p>I had to include at least one social media marketing automation tool on this shortlist. <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/\">Sprout Social</a> can help lighten the load of manual social media tasks ‚Äî responding to messages, tracking engagement, and measuring audience sentiment. Moreover, Sprout Social provides easy onboarding documentation and resources so you can hit the ground running.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Automation Strategy</h2> \n<p>Your marketing automation strategy should vary depending on what tools you use and what goals you set. For example, if you choose to use HubSpot to nurture leads that download a free ebook, your strategy would focus on converting those leads using information relevant to why they perhaps downloaded the ebook‚Äîand how your product or service could help meet those needs.</p> \n<p>Regardless of your marketing automation strategy, however, make note of these few marketing automation best practices:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Know your audience. </strong>You can‚Äôt create personalized marketing ‚Äî whether automated or not ‚Äî without knowing what your audience‚Äôs pain points are and how you can meet them. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona\">Build your buyer personas</a> to get to know your audience before building your marketing automation workflows.</li> \n <li><strong>Know your customer journey.</strong> A key determinant of successful marketing automation is meeting your lead wherever they are. You can‚Äôt do this unless you know their journey to become your customer. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-journey-map\">Map out your customer journey</a> and match your marketing automation to those lead stages.</li> \n <li><strong>Review on a regular basis. </strong>Although marketing automation is pretty hands-off, it is not a one-and-one strategy. Review your marketing automation workflows on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis.

(In 300 Words or Less)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33696/7-inspiring-examples-of-real-time-marketing-in-action.aspx","description":"<p>While it might seem like people use delayed media (like streaming services or podcasts) more often, real-time media hasn't come to a halt.</p> \n<p>Real-time marketing is still a great way to get in front of and convert your audience.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://oursocialtimes.com/real-time-marketing-increases-conversion-rates-by-26/\">a new report from Monetate and Econsultancy concludes that UK marketers report a 26% increase in conversion rates from real-time marketing</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/lieblink/outlook-2013-marketing-advertising-social-media-trends\">a study found real-time marketing not only positively impacts standard marketing goals -- word-of-mouth, attention, preference, likelihood to try or buy -- but it also turbocharges other marketing initiatives, including paid and owned media effectiveness</a>.</p> \n<p>As marketers, those stats are impossible to ignore.</p> \n<p>Below, let's learn more about real-time marketing, and then we'll see what it looks like in action.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This type of marketing occurs when your company reacts, instead of planning or strategizing a marketing plan for months. That's not to say that you won't have a real-time marketing plan, but it'll be a quicker turnaround.</p> \n<p>The objective? To connect with your audience and communicate your brand position.</p> \n<p>You might be able to plan real-time marketing if there's an event or ongoing trend. For example, if you strategize an ad around a current fad, your company might become more appealing to your audience because you understand them.</p> \n<p>Real-time marketing helps you provide relevant messaging that is tailored to your audience's wants, interests, and needs.</p> \n<p>One way for marketers to implement a real-time marketing strategy is to have an active social media presence.</p> \n<p>Your social media team will often be the first people to know about a current fad or trend if they're implementing <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/social-listening\">social listening</a> (which they should be).</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can learn more about your audience and their current interests by looking at your own data.</p> \n<p>For instance, you can look at your website or social media analytics to discover the most popular topics of conversation. You can also learn what questions your audience is asking through <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/social-listening-tools\">social listening tools</a>.</p> \n<p>Having a team actively look at this information every day can be helpful in planning and strategizing a real-time marketing plan.</p> \n<p>When you want to implement a paid real-time marketing ad, you can use social media and search engine targeting tools to ensure you reach the right audience. That type of personalization in marketing has elevated real-time marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, to effectively implement a real-time marketing plan, you should always listen to your audience, monitor industry trends, and know where the conversation is taking place.</p> \n<p>Then, you need to react. Respond to your audience on social media and create assets to discuss what's going on.</p> \n<p>Before you implement a real-time marketing campaign, think about your audience and what you want to achieve with your reaction. Once you know the goal, you can create your message, whether it's a social media comment, an email, or an ad.</p> \n<p>Now that we know more about real-time marketing, let's review some examples.</p> \n<h2>Real-Time Marketing Examples</h2> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">1. <a href=\"https://www.responsiveinboundmarketing.com/blog/ice-bucket-challenge-a-lesson-in-real-time-marketing\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">ALS Ice Bucket Challenge</a></h3> \n<p>One of the greatest lessons in real-time marketing is the ice bucket challenge from 2014. This phenomenon went around the globe and every company or celebrity who took part in the challenge was participating in real-time marketing.</p> \n<p>Taking part in the challenge was a way to raise awareness and money for ALS. But since it was a current event and trend, companies were able to increase brand sentiment and awareness by participating.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.inbound.com/\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">INBOUND</a></h3> \n<p>Every year, INBOUND attracts thousands of business professionals from almost every industry to learn more about marketing, sales, and customer service.</p> \n<p>During this three-day event, businesses and professionals are active on social media and commenting on the live events, such as HubSpot product updates and the keynote speech.</p> \n<p>All of these social media posts and comments about the live breakout sessions or speeches are real-time marketing in action.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tacobell\" style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Taco Bell</a></h3> \n<p>Taco Bell has built a reputation as a great company to follow on social media through their <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-communication-strategy\">crafted brand messaging</a>.</p> \n<p>The reason? On social media, Taco Bell's strategy is to take part in enthusiastic real-time marketing. They respond to messages on Twitter almost twice an hour every day.</p> \n<p>The company has made it a priority to listen to their customers online and to interact and connect with them, no matter what is happening that day.</p> \n<p>Real-time marketing is a great strategy to connect with your customers right now. However, to implement this type of marketing, it's important to measure conversations and sentiment to determine how real-time programs will develop. To get started, you can use free monitoring tools, or invest in one of the many paid social media monitoring technologies.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33696%2F7-inspiring-examples-of-real-time-marketing-in-action.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 21:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"138df802f7746516f686d21dd17d856d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33696%2F7-inspiring-examples-of-real-time-marketing-in-action.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn52@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-48-929_cf3b8d24fba0718e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389713},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Successfully Livestreaming From Home","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/livestream-from-home","description":"<p><em>This post is written by Kerry Shearer, \"The Livestream Expert\". Kerry is a conference speaker, workshop presenter, online course creator and smartphone video trainer based in Sacramento, California.&nbsp;</em></p> \n<p>In 2020, the way we work, shop and entertain ourselves has been completely up-ended.</p> \n<p>Work and school transitioned online, placing many people in unfamiliar situations with frustrating technical challenges as they livestream from home.</p> \n<p>The results have sometimes been cringe-worthy.</p> \n<p>On live webinar meetings, for example, we've been treated to up-the-nose camera angles, inadvertently-shared bathroom breaks, echo-y audio and dark, grainy webcam video.</p> \n<p>Not the best way to make an impression!</p> \n<p>The good news is that it's actually pretty easy to give your viewers an outstanding experience, whether you're participating in an online meeting on Zoom or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-live-stream-checklist\"><span>livestreaming on popular platforms</span></a> like Facebook Live, Twitter Live, Periscope or Instagram Live.</p> \n<p>When you have the right mindset, the right approach, and the right accessories, you can absolutely look and sound like a pro.</p> \n<p>Here, I'll share my best practices when it comes to live streaming, including the platform(s) you should consider when livestreaming, and all the equipment you need to get started.</p> \n<p>But first ‚Äî let's dive into the benefits of livestreaming for businesses.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Benefits of Livestreaming</h2> \n<p>I've spoken with many entrepreneur and communications colleagues, and months of lockdown have definitely taken an emotional toll.</p> \n<p>Staying motivated when your lifestyle and habits have been disrupted means it's more important than ever to get exercise, eat well, and practice self-care so you can be your best self in these trying circumstances.</p> \n<p>And it also means you need to put yourself in the place of your customer or client.</p> \n<p>When livestreaming, it's critical to remember that it's not about you ‚Äî it's about the difference you're going to make in the life of the person you're impacting with the information you're delivering!</p> \n<p>Many of us are doing two types of livestreaming these days: online meetings or webinars with colleagues, and livestreams related to promoting our products or services.</p> \n<p>For our purposes we'll focus on the second type of livestreaming: promoting a product or service.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Livestreaming is a powerful tool to help entrepreneurs and small businesses differentiate themselves and connect with customers (or potential ones).</p> \n<p>And doing it well can make a huge difference in your impact ‚Äî and your earnings.</p> \n<p>Vancouver therapist <a href=\"http://www.juliakristina.com/\"><span>Julia Kristina</span></a>, who holds a Master's degree in Psychology, used live video as a springboard to create a thriving online business to compliment her existing in-person clinical practice.</p> \n<p>She told me, \"I began showing up live on Periscope and Facebook, nearly every day at first, doing short talks about different mental wellness topics.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"Doing all those unscripted livestreams, either from home or from my office downtown, made me an even better public speaker. At the same time, it grew a loyal audience whose lives were being impacted by what I was teaching.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Kristina eventually began creating and selling live online group coaching and recorded video courses on topics such as having healthy boundaries, overcoming anxiety, and building confidence.</p> \n<p>Last fall, Kristina launched her membership program, \"<a href=\"https://courses.juliakristina.com/ss-cv-waitlist-sign-up\"><span>The Shift Society</span></a>,\" which features both live video coaching and recorded video content for members.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FJuliaCounsellor%2Fvideos%2F1093071547544970%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>\"Livestreams don't need to be perfect,\" Kristina says. \"You just need to show up, be yourself, and let your passion for the topic be the magnet that draws your ideal audience in.\"</p> \n<p>Particularly in 2020 when many brick-and-mortar shops needed to shift largely online, livestreaming can provide opportunities for small businesses to connect with their customers and prospects in real-time.</p> \n<p>Miranda Pinto, owner of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/la.piccolina.ca/\"><span>La Piccolina Baby Boutique</span></a> in Lincoln, CA, turned to Facebook Live in an effort to keep sales afloat after having to close her doors to walk-in customers.</p> \n<p>Initial livestream attempts were hampered by poor internet upload speeds at her store, so she and an assistant grabbed piles of clothing and headed to Pinto's house to do their first big online sale.</p> \n<p>\"I felt totally out of my element as a video host, but I know my product, so I just kept talking and describing each item.\"</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 267px; max-height: 476px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 178.28%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fla.piccolina.ca%2Fvideos%2F1733482893467152%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=267\" width=\"267\" height=\"476\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Pinto says the sales just kept coming in. \"We use a subscription-based tool called 'Comment Sold' to track sales and send invoices.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"I credit livestreaming with saving my business and giving homebound moms an easy and fun way to shop locally for baby clothing.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Pinto says each sale she conducts on Facebook Live lasts 1-2 hours, and creates the income normally earned in 2-4 days of walk-in sales when the store is open.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Live Streaming Platforms&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>So if these stories have inspired you, it's time to choose a livestreaming platform to focus on. That involves figuring out where your potential audience is (or, upon which platform you want to build a presence). There are more choices than ever, but it's better to get started with one.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Next, let's go over a brief overview of each popular livestreaming platform.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">1. Facebook Live</h3> \n<p>Facebook is undeniably the most popular social platform worldwide, with more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/\"><span>2.7 billion monthly active users</span></a>.</p> \n<p>Facebook Live allows you to broadcast to the world in real-time, and live video is more often prioritized by the algorithm and shown in your news feed.</p> \n<p>Facebook Live is an effective way of providing training and information in Facebook Groups, and many <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/pages\"><span>Business Pages</span></a> use it to reach out to followers with how-to demonstrations, product unboxings, trainings, and sales events.</p> \n<p>It's easy to go live via the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana&amp;hl=en_US\"><span>Facebook app</span></a> on your phone, or through <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/creatorstudio/\"><span>Facebook Studio</span></a> on a desktop or laptop.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2. Twitter and Periscope</h3> \n<p>Periscope is Twitter's live broadcasting app, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/13/how-periscope-works/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEcr6kSqJ9unugxhxWxWLh3NTf5Q5wHsWMGO_eLqobQ975KDJ1iAgdsfGDH4hxtvzqyi8TmQJNlxrZhvPUPSOQunWnb0wszmhsFjs_oV9fSHOBDF6oMMbN6jI7DsOizofydY9-heqKNCAs12hXObOPznteYgQ2QsXuf-uLro6UAI\"><span>launched in March 2015.</span></a> When you go live, you broadcast to the app and your followers get a push notification that you're live.</p> \n<p>Your livestream is also shown in user's Twitter feeds if your accounts are linked with the same username.</p> \n<p>For this reason, use of hashtags in the broadcast title can result in a bigger audience.</p> \n<p>You can also broadcast directly from the Twitter app using the \"Live\" button. Twitter is known as the place to go for \"what's happening now\", so livestreams involving timely events are popular.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">3. Instagram Live</h3> \n<p>2020 marks Instagram's 10<sup>th</sup> year of operation, and the service has about <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/\"><span>1 billion active users</span></a>.</p> \n<p>That userbase could grow even more with Instagram's <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-reels-announcement\"><span>recent release of Reels</span></a>, its answer to Tik Tok for creating short videos that can go viral.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-go-instagram-live\"><span>Instagram Live also offers a feature</span></a> that lets you bring one guest at a time into the broadcast.</p> \n<p>Instead of expiring after 24 hours, any Instagram Live broadcasts that you want to save can now be shared to your Instagram TV channel.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Best Livestreaming Equipment</h2> \n<p>Once you've chosen the right platform for your needs, you'll need to ensure you have the equipment necessary to create high-quality live videos.</p> \n<p>Livestreams don't have to be perfect, but it <em>is</em> critical to have good lighting, great audio, and a steady shot. Here are some of the options I recommend regularly to clients who want to put on a great broadcast.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">1. Lighting</h3> \n<p>Natural light on your face always looks great, so if your computer desk faces a window that lets in ambient outdoor light (rather than direct, harsh sunlight), it will provide a natural look.</p> \n<p>If natural light isn't available, you can add LED lighting. Dimmable LED ring lights are popular, and the better ones are bi-color.</p> \n<p>That means they have control knobs to let you \"warm\" the color of the light to match the tone of the room, or \"cool\" the color to mimick the look of outdoor light.</p> \n<p>Ring lights, such as the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3279ZJM\"><span>Dracast Halo 180</span></a>, come in a popular 18\" size, which generally requires mounting on an aluminum light stand.</p> \n<p>A smartphone or video camera can be mounted inside the ring and set at eye-level, giving your face a nice, even glow.</p> \n<p>There are also smaller desktop ring lights available, such as the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/34ea5SS\"><span>Neewer 10\" ring light</span></a>, or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2E3od6w\"><span>GVM rectangular ring light</span></a>, which can hold your smartphone or serve as a webcam light by peeking over the top of your computer monitor.</p> \n<p>The Lume Cube company <a href=\"https://lumecube.com/collections/best-sellers/products/video-conference-lighting-kit-for-remote-workers\"><span>has created LED lighting</span></a> specifically for video conferencing, including a rectangular light with a suction mount that sticks to the back of your computer monitor.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2. Audio</h3> \n<p>Viewers will often put up with less-than-perfect video quality, but if the audio is poor, don't expect them to hang around your livestream for long.</p> \n<p>Poor audio is an issue for either smartphone broadcasting ‚Äî where the built-in microphone picks up lots of annoying background noise ‚Äî or for streaming from a laptop computer, where the cheap internal mic often produces thin-sounding audio that's hard to listen to for long periods of time.</p> \n<p>One solution for smartphones is a simple wired lavaliere smartphone mic, such as the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/322wRKF\"><span>YouMic</span></a>.</p> \n<p>The mic clips onto your shirt, blouse or blazer, and the cord connects to the audio jack on your smartphone.</p> \n<p>If you have an iPhone 7 or newer, you'll also need the Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone adapter that came with your phone.</p> \n<p>Connect your mic to the adapter, and the adapter to the Lightning port.</p> \n<p>If you'd prefer to go wireless, a dependable lightweight system like the <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1471382-REG/rode_wireless_go_compact_wireless.html\"><span>Rode Wireless Go</span></a> is a great solution. The receiver and transmitter are very small and operate for seven hours on built-in rechargeable batteries.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the transmitter has a built-in mic, so you can just clip it to your jacket.</p> \n<p>Or, to be more discreet, Rode's plug-in Lavaliere Go mic can be purchased separately so you can ditch the transmitter in a pocket and use the small clip-on microphone.</p> \n<p>Another option is the similar <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aFYTQa\"><span>Pixel</span></a> wireless lavaliere microphone.</p> \n<p>If you've had experiences sitting on a Zoom call for hours, you know how hard it can be on the brain to listen to tinny audio from participants speaking from echo-y home offices.</p> \n<p>A solution for this is to use a plug-in USB microphone with your laptop or desktop computer so you can get your voice closer to a microphone.</p> \n<p>One option is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/348Kivf\"><span>Fifine wired clip-on lavaliere</span></a> USB microphone. Simply plug the connector into any available USB port on your computer, and then change the audio selection in your webinar software or livestreaming app to the new audio source.</p> \n<p>Another high-quality option would be a USB microphone typically used for recording podcasts.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3276K55\"><span>Audio-Technica ATR-2100X</span></a>, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2DXjeEJ\"><span>Fifine PC Microphone</span></a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1057722-REG/rode_rodntusb_versatile_usb_condenser_microphone.html\"><span>Rode NT USB</span></a> microphones are all examples of podcasting-style mics that connect quickly to your computer and will skyrocket the quality of your audio.</p> \n<p>Note that although these microphones all come with small desktop stands, the best approach is to mount them to an articulating <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YfwEmb\"><span>boom arm</span></a> that clamps to the edge of your desk. That will prevent the mic stand from transmitting any thumps and bumps created by your hands or elbows tapping your desk surface.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">3. Tripods</h3> \n<p>Shaky video can be incredibly distracting and frustrating when someone is watching a livestream.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there are lots of options to help you have a steady shot. If you already have a video or camera tripod and will be livestreaming from a smartphone, you can simply attach a smartphone mount.</p> \n<p>My favorites are the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gawUJs\"><span>Square Jellyfish</span></a> metal smartphone mount, or the <a href=\"https://www.arkon.com/product/RVRM1420-phone-tripod-mount.html\"><span>Arkon Road-Vise</span></a> heavy duty smartphone mount.If you don't have a tripod, one place to begin is with a mini-tripod that sits on a desk and has an extendable middle column.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EcPK5i\"><span>Benro BK-15</span></a>, when placed on a desk, will extend to the equivalent of full standing height for standup presentations or interviews.</p> \n<p>The advantage to a small tripod like this is that you can easily move it from room to room, walk with it while you talk, or throw it in your messenger bag so you're always prepared to livestream.</p> \n<p>For other uses, you might need a floorstanding tripod. The least expensive option is to buy a basic tripod like this <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Q1Gio0\"><span>Endurax</span></a> aluminum tripod. It extends to 66 inches.</p> \n<p>Tripods in this price range often have a plastic pan/tilt assembly, which is fine if your camera will be locked down and not moved, but often doesn't allow for smooth camera movement.</p> \n<p>If you'll be panning and tilting and following the action during your livestream, go for a more expensive tripod that has a fluid head.</p> \n<p>A fluid head mechanism gives very smooth camera movements which look professional. One of my personal favorites is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3kVSO6B\"><span>Manfrotto Be Free</span></a> aluminum Lever Lock video tripod. It is only 16\" long when folded for transport.</p> \n<p>And for livestreaming on the go, there's nothing like a 3-axis electric smartphone gimbal. A gimbal holds your smartphone level and steady while you walk, giving you silky-smooth Steadicam-like results.</p> \n<p>I use the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3h9moU3\"><span>Benro 3XS</span></a> gimbal, and one of the main reasons I love it is because it does not block the Lightning port on a smartphone like many gimbals do ‚Äî that's important if you want to connect a microphone to the port do to a walk-and-talk narration during your livestream.</p> \n<p>A single push of a button rotates the phone from horizontal to vertical, and the mounting arm also folds for compact storage.</p> \n<p>New equipment is constantly coming out for smartphone video shooting and livestreaming, allowing you to ensure that your video will be wonderfully watchable.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">On-Camera Confidence</h3> \n<p>Assuming you have selected your platform, have a smartphone mic, LED light and tripod, it's time to curate your confidence so you come across well on video. Keep in mind the following tips:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>No, you don't look weird or sound weird on video, so stop judging yourself!</li> \n <li>We usually need to ramp up our energy a bit for video. If it helps, before you go live play a favorite song from your playlist that gets you pumped up. Dance around like a crazy person for a couple of minutes. Anything to get the blood moving and get a dose of energy!</li> \n <li>Remember, like I told you earlier, it's not about you. Focus on the people you're helping.</li> \n <li>If you're livestreaming from a laptop, do whatever you need to do to get the webcam lens at eye level. That may require propping your laptop up on a box or a stack of books if you're using the unit's internal webcam.</li> \n <li>Be sure to smile (as appropriate). You want to appear open, approachable, and authentic.</li> \n <li>If you normally gesture wildly as you talk, reel it in so your movements are appropriate for a tighter webcam image.</li> \n <li>If you're in charge of the livestream and are primarily the one presenting information, do whatever you can to keep people engaged. Ask questions and tell viewers to put their answers in the chat. You can also \"flag\" important points, by saying things like: \"If you're multi-tasking right now, come back to me because I'm about to give you some really important information.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Remember, livestreaming is a mix of using your best presentation skills and some smart tech to make sure that you're communicating clearly and effectively.</p> \n<p>It is also a skill that you can develop over time.

Poor formatting. Poor grammar. Poor word choice. Poor shareability.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The most pervasive problem? <strong>Poor flow.&nbsp;</strong>The post jumps from one idea to the next to the next and then circles around again for a split second to the first idea, then back to the fourth, and so on. Or the post reads like a stream of consciousness -- but it wasn't a stylistic choice.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Luckily, you have a simple solution.&nbsp;Before diving headfirst into writing your post, you can create an outline.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I'm not talking about jotting down a few quick bullet points -- even experienced writers can go astray with just a few talking points. I'm talking a fully fleshed-out outline with enough details that make it virtually impossible for your writing to go off the deep end. And it's pretty easy to do.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Below is my method for outlining posts and organizing my thoughts. You may prefer to switch up some of the steps depending on your writing style, but your end goal should always be to get an outline detailed enough that its result is a cohesive, logical piece. Here's one way you can do that.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>1. Nail your working title.</h3> \n<p>This is the most important step of this entire process. You want to have a clear understanding of what you're going to write before you start outlining.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>My colleague Corey wrote an awesome post about how to pick a great working title. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-choose-solid-topic-next-blog-post-ht\">Go read it</a>, now. I won't go too much into the weeds here (that's why you should read her post), but a great working title is specific. It's \"How to Use Images to Generate Leads on Twitter,\" not \" Twitter lead generation.\"</p> \n<p>Spend time getting your working title to something specific and easy to tackle in a blog post format -- but don't waste time getting nitpicky. You can refine your title later. The goal here is to have a title that gives you a very clear idea of what the whole piece is about. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht\">You can make it sound catchy later</a>. &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. Write down as many distinct takeaways from the article as you can.</h3> \n<p>Next, you get to brain dump. Write down all the things you want your readers to get out of the article. These won't always be the main sections of your article -- it's just all the things you want your readers to know by the end of reading your post.</p> \n<p>This is the only time in the whole process you're not worried about organization -- just let your ideas flow naturally. You need to get out all of your wild and crazy ideas now so they won't muck up your post later in the process.</p> \n<p>Let's use the previous example to show you what I mean. If my working title was \"How to Use Images to Generate Leads on Twitter,\" I'd probably want readers to know:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What sets a good image apart from a bad one on Twitter</li> \n <li>Where they can find images to use legally&nbsp;</li> \n <li>How they can create images on their own</li> \n <li>What sizes they need to make images</li> \n <li>How often they should tweet images</li> \n <li>How to actually upload an image to Twitter</li> \n <li>How they can generate a lead on Twitter</li> \n <li>How long their tweet should be with the image in it</li> \n <li>What results they should expect to get&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Notice how these are really unfiltered and all over the place. That's okay. We'll wrangle it all in in the next step.</p> \n<h3>3. Break up those takeaways into larger sections.</h3> \n<p>Now, we'll take that jumble of ideas and place them into overarching sections. Think of it like sorting laundry -- each thought belongs to a different pile. From your brainstorm, you should come up with a few big themes.&nbsp;Sometimes, one of your brainstorming bullets will be a theme in itself, but usually several bullets will fall under one overarching theme. You may also realize that there's a theme that you may not have any bullets for, but the post definitely calls for it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lots of people recommend sticking to 3-4 larger sections, but it really depends on what type of post you're writing. If you're writing something that's long and comprehensive, you might need more. If it's a quick post, fewer sections would be ideal. But if you need a benchmark, 3-4 sections are fine.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So if we're writing that post about generating leads on Twitter using images, we'd bucket my ideas into the following buckets:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Intro</li> \n <li>Crafting a Twitter Image Lead Gen Strategy \n  <ul> \n   <li>How they can generate a lead on Twitter</li> \n   <li>How often they should tweet images</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>How to Create the Perfect Lead Gen Tweet \n  <ul> \n   <li>How long their tweet should be with the image in it</li> \n   <li>How to actually upload an image to Twitter</li> \n   <li>What sizes they need to make images</li> \n   <li>How they can create images on their own</li> \n   <li>Where they can find images to use legally&nbsp;</li> \n   <li>What sets a good image apart from a bad one on Twitter</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>Measuring Your Strategy's Success \n  <ul> \n   <li>What results they should expect to get</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ol> \n<h3><strong>4. Add more takeaways to some sections.&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<p>At this point, you should have a pretty weird looking outline. Mine is. Some sections have lots of little bullet points, others have only a few, and others have nothing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now's the time to fill in the holes. <strong>What did you miss in your initial brainstorm?</strong> Thinking about what's missing is always hard, but it will help improve your final post significantly.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Don't forget to beef up your intro here, too. Have a great point you think would set the stage for the article? Add a little reminder below that section so you don't forget it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Below shows how my outline's evolved. I italicized all the things I added, and the outline is becoming closer and closer to being a post:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Intro \n  <ul> \n   <li><em>Images work really well on Twitter (find study)</em></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>Crafting a Twitter Image Lead Gen Strategy \n  <ul> \n   <li>How they can generate a lead on Twitter</li> \n   <li>How often they should tweet images</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>How to Create the Perfect Lead Gen Tweet \n  <ul> \n   <li>How long their tweet should be with the image in it</li> \n   <li>How to actually upload an image to Twitter</li> \n   <li>What sizes they need to make images</li> \n   <li>How they can create images on their own</li> \n   <li>Where they can find images to use legally&nbsp;</li> \n   <li>What sets a good image apart from a bad one on Twitter</li> \n   <li><em>Should you tag people in images</em></li> \n   <li><em>Should you use photo collages</em></li> \n   <li><em>What colors you should use to stand out</em></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>Measuring Your Strategy's Success \n  <ul> \n   <li>What results they should expect to get</li> \n   <li><em>Which metrics to look at</em></li> \n   <li><em>How to find them in your analytics</em></li> \n   <li><em>How to adjust the above to get better results</em></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ol> \n<p>Essentially, you're re-doing the second step, but in a more controlled, organized manner.</p> \n<h3>5. Revise, remove, and reorganize details in each section.</h3> \n<p>Now comes the fun part: editing your outline. You've already done the hard part of actually thinking of your ideas. Now, you're tightening up your outline to include only the most relevant information, revising the sub-bullets to actually make sense, and reorganizing the sub-bullets to tell the most logical story.</p> \n<p>First, let me show you what I'd cut -- shown in bold.&nbsp;</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Intro \n  <ul> \n   <li>Images work really well on Twitter (find study)</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>Crafting a Twitter Image Lead Gen Strategy \n  <ul> \n   <li>How to generate a lead on Twitter</li> \n   <li>How often they should tweet images</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>How to Create the Perfect Lead Gen Tweet \n  <ul> \n   <li>How long their tweet should be with the image in it</li> \n   <li><strong>How to actually upload an image to Twitter (This is a pretty basic step that someone would already know if they're reading this post.)</strong></li> \n   <li>What sizes they need to make images</li> \n   <li>How they can create images on their own</li> \n   <li>Where they can find images to use legally&nbsp;</li> \n   <li>What sets a good image apart from a bad one on Twitter</li> \n   <li>Should you tag people in images</li> \n   <li>Should you use photo collages</li> \n   <li><strong>What colors you should use to stand out (Don't believe there's hard data on this, just speculation. Let's cut it.)</strong></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>Measuring Your Strategy's Success \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>What results they should expect to get (The study in the first part should cover this bullet point.)</strong></li> \n   <li>Which metrics to look at</li> \n   <li>How to find them in your analytics</li> \n   <li>How to adjust the above to get better results</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ol> \n<p>I cut things usually because the sub-bullet didn't add value to the post or the reader would already know it. That's a pretty good benchmark to remember if you're not sure whether to cut something.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Next, we'll reorganize the remainder of the sub-bullets and rework them to sound like actual takeaways. We'll also turn some of the sub-bullets into sub-sub-bullets. Here's what this outline looks like now:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Intro \n  <ul> \n   <li>Images tend to work really well on Twitter (find study)</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>Crafting a Twitter Image Lead Gen Strategy \n  <ul> \n   <li>How to generate a lead on Twitter</li> \n   <li>How lead generation fits in with the rest of your Twitter strategy</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>How to Create the Perfect Lead Gen Tweet \n  <ul> \n   <li>How to choose the right image \n    <ul> \n     <li>Creating it on your own&nbsp;</li> \n     <li>Finding images to use legally</li> \n    </ul> </li> \n   <li>Optimizing the image for Twitter \n    <ul> \n     <li>Sizing images for Twitter</li> \n     <li>Tagging people in images</li> \n     <li>Using Photo Collages</li> \n    </ul> </li> \n   <li>Optimizing the rest of your tweet \n    <ul> \n     <li>How long the tweet should be with the image in</li> \n    </ul> </li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>Measuring Your Strategy's Success<strong><br></strong> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Which metrics to look at</li> \n   <li>How to find them in your analytics</li> \n   <li>How to adjust your strategy to get better results</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ol> \n<p>Ta-da! A much more comprehensive outline that makes your post easy to write.</p> \n<h3>6. Include links to your examples and/or data.</h3> \n<p>This is purely a time-saving trick. After you've fully fleshed out and then trimmed your outline, you should look for examples and data to support these claims. Once you find a source to support your arguments, just add them as a note underneath the section -- that way, when you go to write it, it's all organized for you. &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>7. If any details come to you that you don't want to forget, add them in.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Last, but certainly not least, spruce up the outline with anything you don't want to forget while writing. Maybe you're writing the post right away -- or maybe you won't have time to actually start for a few more days. Regardless, having these details in your outline will make sure you're not missing a thing. I do this often if I think of a terrible pun or pop culture reference while outlining ... and trust me, that's something I definitely wouldn't want to forget. ;)</p> \n<p>Here's my final outline:&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Blog Post Outline Example</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Intro \n   <ul> \n    <li>Images tend to work really well on Twitter</li> \n   </ul> </li> \n  <li>Crafting a Twitter Image Lead Gen Strategy \n   <ul> \n    <li>How to generate a lead on Twitter</li> \n    <li>How lead generation fits in with the rest of your Twitter strategy \n     <ul> \n      <li>Reference Anchorman line: \"Come and see how good I look.\"</li> \n     </ul> </li> \n   </ul> </li> \n  <li>How to Create the Perfect Lead Gen Tweet \n   <ul> \n    <li>How to choose the right image \n     <ul> \n      <li>Creating it on your own&nbsp;</li> \n      <li>Finding images to use legally</li> \n     </ul> </li> \n    <li>Optimizing the image for Twitter \n     <ul> \n      <li>Sizing images for Twitter</li> \n      <li>Tagging people in images</li> \n      <li>Using Photo Collages</li> \n     </ul> </li> \n    <li>Optimizing the rest of your tweet \n     <ul> \n      <li>How long the tweet should be with the image in</li> \n     </ul> </li> \n   </ul> </li> \n  <li>Measuring Your Strategy's Success \n   <ul> \n    <li>Which metrics to look at</li> \n    <li>How to find them in your analytics</li> \n    <li>How to adjust your strategy to get better results</li> \n   </ul> </li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<p>And that's it! Feel free to take that methodology and apply it to other types of posts. Once you have a solid outline, writing the actual post should be a breeze. It's even easier if you work from a template.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em></em></p> \n<p><em></em></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May 2014 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-write-blog-post-outline&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"cb949ab0af385c26fc42e252bec278a1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"gsoskey@hubspot.com (Ginny Mineo)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-write-blog-post-outline&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn7@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-50-760_be6df9fe271f6c9a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389709},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"The 11 Best ClickFunnels Alternatives & Competitors in 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/clickfunnels-alternatives","description":"<p>The marketing technology landscape is <a href=\"https://chiefmartec.com/2020/04/marketing-technology-landscape-2020-martech-5000/\">expanding rapidly</a>, and it's becoming cheaper and easier for marketers to run powerful campaigns on their website or other channels.</p>  \n<p>So, if you want to build a powerful inbound marketing engine, what do you need?</p> \n<p>Well, first off, you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-make-a-website\">need a website</a>.</p> \n<p>It also helps to have dedicated landing pages, sales pages, splash pages, and lead capture forms.

But if you're going to become a marketing manager one day, you first need to learn what the role demands.</p>  \n<p>Moving up in ranks means becoming more involved in the marketing process, and eventually becoming the principal implementor.</p> \n<p>As a marketing manager, you‚Äôd be in charge of a team. Employees will look up to you as you once looked up to your manager.</p> \n<p>However, accepting this position comes with increased responsibility. It can feel rewarding to watch your strategies come to life, but it‚Äôs important to understand what the role entails.</p> \n<p>Below, we'll go over what a marketing manager is, what a marketing manager does, the management process, and the skills and education you'll need to become one.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>What does a marketing manager do?</h3> \n<p>Marketing managers have a variety of responsibilities. While there are industry-specific standards, there are common tasks that all marketing managers will do:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Conduct market research to understand the public interest and determine the marketability of products and services.</li> \n <li>Design creative and unique marketing strategies across multiple channels like social media, tv, billboards, and newspaper articles.</li> \n <li>Create marketing plans detailing outcomes and goals.</li> \n <li>Create comprehensive budgets and cost estimates.</li> \n <li>Negotiate with potential clients and partners to prepare sales and advertisement contracts.</li> \n <li>Handle public relations and troubleshoot internal and external issues as they arise.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Marketing managers are also responsible for training their team members on campaign-specific marketing plans. They‚Äôll hire new employees to join their team, selecting those they believe will meet intended goals for executing brand strategy. They&nbsp;collaborate with all team members, motivating them to meet goals while providing guidance and delegating tasks.</p> \n<h2>Marketing Management Process</h2> \n<p>To succeed in their&nbsp;responsibilities, marketing managers follow a similar process. Each step in that process requires a unique approach depending on the product, service, or business.</p> \n<h3>Idea Generation</h3> \n<p>Marketing managers approach the idea generation stage with an intended product in mind or an idea for a product or service that a business hopes to create.</p> \n<p>They'll conduct market research to understand current trends and customer interest. If a new product is launching, are there competitors? How successful are they? What are consumers saying about available products, and how can they be improved?</p> \n<p>Understanding consumer interests and behaviors is key to beginning this process.</p> \n<h3>Marketing Plan</h3> \n<p>After identifying markets and understanding trends, marketing managers will develop a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-plan-template-generator?_ga=2.100934337.170348021.1600364963-337050714.1600364963\">marketing plan</a>&nbsp;that they'll use to implement their strategy. This plan identifies the target audiences, campaign-specific tactics, budget, and goals.</p> \n<p>They'll work with different teams, like UX product design, financial departments, and sales engineers, to develop a strategy that &nbsp;will allow the product to meet its intended goals. While a marketing manager is the chief decision maker, there may be financial aspects that they are not aware of. Collaboration between all teams ensures that the marketing plan is as comprehensive as possible.</p> \n<p>The marketing manager will likely conduct tests with intended audiences to ensure that the final marketing plan will drive the most revenue before implementation. This may take the form of focus groups, personal modeling, or consumer interviews.</p> \n<h3>Implementation and Results</h3> \n<p>At this point, the marketing manager will work with their team to implement the finalized marketing plan. Timelines will be set for tracking <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/essential-marketing-metrics?_ga=2.100934337.170348021.1600364963-337050714.1600364963\">campaign metrics</a>, using data to adapt the strategy if necessary.</p> \n<p>Regardless of campaign&nbsp;outcomes, all research and data will inform future marketing processes.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Skills to Become a Marketing Manager</h2> \n<p>Most companies require their marketing professionals to have a bachelor's degree. Still, since the marketing industry adapts quickly, companies don't necessarily need their marketers or marketing managers to have specialized degrees in specific fields. Some companies may require professional degrees or memberships in professional associations.</p> \n<p>However, there is one universal requirement to become a marketing manager ‚Äî a three- to five-year track record of consistently performing to your potential and achieving your goals. If you want to become a marketing manager one day, your performance as an individual contributor matters more than anything.</p> \n<p>For instance, if the main goal is to manage a company‚Äôs blog team, one would need to prove that they‚Äôve consistently written quality content that has met their manager‚Äôs expectations.</p> \n<p>There are basic soft skills&nbsp;that a marketing manager should possess, like creativity, critical thinking, and leadership. However, a combination of these skills along with well-developed hard skills are crucial for job success. There are six essential skills an aspiring marketing manager should work to develop.</p> \n<h3>1. Communication</h3> \n<p>A marketing manager's job revolves around communicating with different audiences by developing creative content for advertisements, videos, and articles. This content must also be consistent with the tone, branding, and voice outlined in the marketing plan.</p> \n<p>The marketing manager will also be in conversation with their own managers, team members, and external stakeholders.</p> \n<p>Understanding how to confidently communicate with different audiences is critical for this role.</p> \n<h3>2. Budgeting&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Marketing Managers handle all kinds of resources, from campaign budgets to pay-per-click ads to influencer marketing. All of these actions require budgeting skills.</p> \n<p>A marketing manager also handles &nbsp;internal budgets for their team, ensuring that everyone has the resources they need.</p> \n<h3>3. Negotiation</h3> \n<p>After creating the marketing plan, the marketing manager will need to convince internal stakeholders of its value. They‚Äôll need to identify the right teams, and convince them of the benefits to the business and intended customers. Without internal buy-in, the campaign may cause internal confusion if all teams aren‚Äôt on the same page.</p> \n<p>The marketing manager may need to negotiate with other teams if they believe changes need to be made. They may agree with some suggested changes, but they‚Äôll also need to know when to negotiate and advocate for certain elements of their plan if they are called into question.</p> \n<p>Externally, the marketing manager may be involved in financial negotiations with outside stakeholders to ensure that budgets aren‚Äôt over-spent.</p> \n<h3>4. Planning and Execution</h3> \n<p>Long term planning and goal setting are two important skills to be a marketing manager. They need to understand intended outcomes, plan for intended results, and execute the strategy to meet those outcomes. For example, is the ultimate goal to gain 1,000 Instagram followers? How will that happen? What steps need to be taken along the way to reach the goal?</p> \n<p>When managing multiple marketing channels and entire teams of people, understanding how much time to dedicate to all aspects of a campaign is essential.</p> \n<p>Can you create comprehensive plans to manage your tasks? Can you meet deadlines? Can you deliver high-quality work under said deadlines? These are questions that might be asked when interviewing for a marketing management position. &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>5. Collaboration and Delegation</h3> \n<p>Marketing managers lead an entire marketing team. Size may vary, but there are several people who will work under their direction.</p> \n<p>They need to work well with others and enjoy building relationships with internal teams and external stakeholders. However, it's still important to be a leader that can step in and assign tasks when necessary. For example, the marketing manager would ensure that their team members are assigned the right tasks for their skillset, and that individual performance aligns with task expectations.</p> \n<h3>6. Adaptability</h3> \n<p>Customer behavior and markets can be volatile, so adapting to changing industry standards is a must. For example, a strategy may need to be adapted after falling short on expected outcomes. Instead of giving up, the marketing manager should devise a plan with their team to come up with alternative options.</p> \n<h3>7. Empathy&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Understanding markets means understanding consumer needs and predicting what they want and how they'll react to your service. This requires a significant amount of emotional intelligence.</p> \n<p>On their teams, marketing managers are responsible for balancing role expectations with team member‚Äôs capabilities. For example, if someone on&nbsp;their team is stressed because they aren‚Äôt meeting deadlines, it‚Äôs the marketing managers job to address the issue with empathy. An effective marketing manager would be able to recognize their stress and work with them to come up with effective ways to meet their goals.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, marketing managers develop unique, ambitious marketing strategies for products,&nbsp;</p> \n<p>businesses, and services. They create comprehensive marketing plans, and work with their teams to execute them successfully.</p> \n<p>A marketing manager ensures that products, services, and businesses have the best chance to thrive in their intended markets, satisfying both companies and consumers.</p> \n<p>Anyone who works to develop the skills outlined in this piece will be successful in their role as marketing manager.</p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-management&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"feb139340a2a87644bc068a1d59007d5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"fneedle@hubspot.com (Flori Needle)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-management&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn31@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-48-814_4b6c5443621753f2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389711},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"Everything Marketers Need to Know About Instagram Reels","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-reels","description":"<p>Throughout the past two years, two of the most popular apps used by <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gen-z-stats\">Gen Z</a> and younger millennials were Instagram and TikTok.</p>  \n<p>While Instagram steadily pulled in <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/instagram-marketing\">more than 1 billion active users</a> since its 2016 debut, TikTok made news when it surpassed <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tiktok-stats\">1 billion global downloads</a> within 18 months of its launch.</p> \n<p>Both networks have solid benefits and entertainment factors.. While Instagram's visual layout allows users to see images, videos, Stories, and live streams from their favorite accounts, TikTok provides an endless feed of short, entertaining video clips.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>But, late this summer, as countries including the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/13/tiktok-privacy/\">considered banning TikTok due to privacy concerns</a>, Instagram launched a handful of new audio and video editing features that are quite similar to what users would find on TikTok. This new set of mobile features, which can be accessed in the Stories section of the Instagram app, has been dubbed Instagram Reels.</p> \n<p>Aside from allowing users to record videos with sound or audio overlays, the Reels camera and editor also includes the following features:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>More editing tools</strong>: These include augmented reality effects, transitions, and the ability to speed up or slow down videos.</li> \n <li><strong>Audio attribution</strong>: If a user uploads native audio, other users can overlay the sound in their videos while the app credits the original user's account for it.</li> \n <li><strong>Stitchable takes</strong>: This enables users to share a video with just one long take or a combination of quicker takes.</li> \n <li><strong>Shareability on the Instagram Feed, Explore, Stories, and your profile: </strong>Depending on the privacy settings of your profile, you can share Reels with just friends on your Stories or profile, or publicly in the Reels area of Explore.</li> \n <li><strong>Mobile-only: </strong>Unlike Instagram profiles and Stories, you can‚Äôt view or upload Reels on a desktop.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Right now, it's worth noting that ads are not yet supported in the Reels area of Instagram Explore. But since Reels show up in this public part of the app, and can be seen by people who don't follow your brand, your business has the opportunity to reach new audiences across the globe.</p> \n<p>At the time of this post, we also don‚Äôt know how the Instagram algorithm works for presenting Reels to audiences. But, based on our exploration of the Reels feed within Explore, it seems much like TikTok in that it prioritizes posts by location, people you follow, and content similar to what you've engaged with recently.</p> \n<h2>Why Instagram Launched Reels</h2> \n<p>According to Instagram -- which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/#:~:text=Following%20Lasso's%20tests%2C%20Instagram%20released,parts%20of%20Europe%20in%202020.\">started testing Reels in Brazil in November 2019</a> and launched the feature globally this August -- the brand wanted to give users more content creation opportunities on its app.</p> \n<p>\"We‚Äôre excited to introduce Instagram Reels: a new way for anyone ‚Äî people, creators, and businesses ‚Äî to create and discover short, entertaining videos on Instagram,\" notes an August <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/announcing-instagram-reels\">announcement from Instagram</a>.</p> \n<p>While Instagram hasn't acknowledged TikTok's success or competition as a reason for launching Reels, several tech journalists have suggested that this was a strategic move.</p> \n<p>\"Instagram's short-form video feature, Reels, launched Wednesday. Instagram is swooping in at a vulnerable time for its largest competitor, TikTok. Reels allows users to create 15-second clips, like TikTok, and share them publicly or with friends within the Instagram app,\" wrote <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/facebook-launches-tiktok-competitor-instagram-reels.html\">CNBC's Jessica Bursztynsky</a>.</p> \n<p>While Reels is Instagram's first attempt at launching similar features to TikTok, this certainly isn't the first time a Facebook-owned company has launched similar video editing offerings.</p> \n<p>In 2018, amid TikTok's early success, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18080280/facebook-lasso-tiktok-competitor-app\">Facebook quietly launched</a> a competing app called Lasso.</p> \n<p>Lasso, which offered similar portrait-style feed and video editing tools to TikTok, had fewer than 80,000 app downloads by June 2020. In July, one month before the launch of Reels, Lasso was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/lasso-facebook-tiktok-shut-down/#:~:text=Facebook%20is%20no%20longer%20betting,Lasso%20alerted%20users%20on%20Wednesday.&amp;text=Lasso%20allowed%20users%20to%20shoot,videos%20and%20overlay%20popular%20songs.\">discontinued</a>.</p> \n<p>\"We place multiple bets across our family of apps to test and learn how people want to express themselves. One of these tests was Lasso, our stand-alone short-form video app, which we have decided to shut down. We thank everyone who shared their creativity and feedback with us, which we‚Äôll look to incorporate in our other video experiences,‚Äù a Facebook spokesperson told <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/lasso-facebook-tiktok-shut-down/#:~:text=Facebook%20is%20no%20longer%20betting,Lasso%20alerted%20users%20on%20Wednesday.&amp;text=Lasso%20allowed%20users%20to%20shoot,videos%20and%20overlay%20popular%20songs.\">TechCrunch</a>.</p> \n<p>At this point, knowing the history mentioned above, some marketers might wonder, \"Will Instagram Reels be a great TikTok alternative for my brand, or will it fail like other TikTok competitors?\"</p> \n<p>The question above is fair. After all, as a marketer, you'll only want to invest time and money into platforms with a solid track record, loyal audience, and great brand awareness opportunities, rather than those that could be discontinued a short time later.</p> \n<p>While Reels might have been flocked to by Gen Z if TikTok were banned, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/20/914032065/tiktok-ban-averted-trump-gives-oracle-walmart-deal-his-blessing\"><span>TikTok's partnership deal with Oracle and Walmart</span></a> has ensured that this app will remain active in many countries -- at least for now. This means that even if Reels is successful, some audiences might still spend all of their time surfing TikTok.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, Instagram is a widely-used platform that has successfully launched competitive social media features before. Remember when <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/preferred-story-platforms\"><span>the brand launched Stories</span></a> and eventually <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-social-media-demographics\"><span>surpassed the user count of Snapchat</span></a>, which launched this feature first?</p> \n<p>At the moment, it's not clear whether Reels will be as successful as TikTok. But, since the feature only requires you to expand your Instagram strategy, rather than building out TikTok tactics from scratch, it could still be a great place for brands to test out highly experimental short-form content.</p> \n<p>If you're intrigued by Instagram Reels and ready to try it out, below I'll walk through how brands are already using the feature, steps for creating Reels content, and a few takeaways marketers should keep in mind as they build it into their Instagram marketing.</p> \n<h2>How Brands Already Use Reels</h2> \n<h3>Emmy Mae Bridal</h3> \n<p>Fashion and beauty are perfect for Reels, as is evident by this Reel from Emmy Mae Bridal in Queensland, Australia.</p> \n<p>In Emmy Rae's Reels, the brand presents videos and imagery of their wedding attire to the sounds classy music. Although we can't embed Reels, here's a screenshot of recent content the company posted.</p> \n<div style=\"\"> \n <img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/mSuWBwbWKXzpvzFmKdknmT.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"433\" style=\"display: block; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; width: 200px; height: auto;\" alt=\"Bridal Instagram Reels\"> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Earth Official</h3> \n<p>The travel industry is also finding Reels to be an excellent way to reach people. In this piece of Reels content, Earth Official, an account that highlights travel content, deals, and influencers, shows beautiful footage of Thailand's lantern festival with native audio.</p> \n<div style=\"\"> \n <img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/BHPQRHNgJ39RuULLAUQqc3.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"433\" style=\"display: block; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; width: 200px; height: auto;\" alt=\"Instagram Reels Travel EarthOfficial\"> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Critical Care Now</h3> \n<p>If your business isn‚Äôt exactly consumer-facing, Reels might still fit into your Instagram strategy, depending on how well you‚Äôve cultivated your audience and how creative your content team is.</p> \n<p>In the Reels post below from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/criticalcarenow/?hl=en\">CriticalCareNow</a>, an informative Instagram account run by resuscitation expert Haney Mallemat, Mallemat educates viewers about central and peripheral arterial lines used in the emergency response field.</p> \n<div style=\"\"> \n <img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/FipyGHAkjeY1N2K7sigtzZ.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"433\" style=\"display: block; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; width: 200px; height: auto;\" alt=\"critical care Instagram Reels\"> \n</div> \n<p>Think the topic of the Reel above was too informative or formal for Instagram's audience? Think again. At the time this blog post was written, this Reel had more than 30,200 views. Pretty amazing for content that isn‚Äôt the latest dance move.</p> \n<p>Haney's Reel might be so engaging because he's done a great job of building a large, niche audience of over 24,000 Instagram followers and learned what types of content they value. While more followers could certainly get you more views, creating Reels around what your audience and similar users want to watch can also take your engagement a long way.</p> \n<h3>1. Enter Reels mode within Instagram Stories.</h3> \n<p>To get started with Reels, open the Instagram Stories camera and tap Reels.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-2.gif?width=200&amp;name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-2.gif\" alt=\"Instagram Reels can be found within Instagram Stories on the mobile app\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>2.

Then Reels will automatically film for the amount of time you designated.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Hold Record to begin filming, or upload a pre-recorded video.</h3> \n<p>Once you press and hold the record button, you'll start filming a clip. If you let go of the record button, but still have time left in your Reel video, you can hold the record button again to start a second clip that will begin immediately after the first ends.</p> \n<p>As you record one or multiple clips for your Reel, the progress bar at the top of the screen shows you how much recording time you have left.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor.gif?width=200&amp;name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor.gif\" alt=\"Progress bar in Instagram Reels\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Alternatively, if you've already recorded a great video or TikTok that you think will be engaging on Reels, you can tap the camera icon to upload clips from your camera roll.</p> \n<h3>4. Add last-minute effects.</h3> \n<p>If you didn't add effects before the video started recording, but want to after seeing how it came out, you can add stickers, drawings, and text to your Reel before publishing.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-Sep-16-2020-05-57-04-92-PM.png?width=200&amp;name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-Sep-16-2020-05-57-04-92-PM.png\" alt=\"Adding last-minute effects after recording video in Reels\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>When you are finished, tap the arrow at the bottom when you‚Äôre ready to publish.

View your Reels.</h3> \n<p>Once you've published one or more Reels, this content will appear on the Explore page, as well as a tab on your profile.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-3.png?width=200&amp;name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-3.png\" alt=\"Where to find Instagram Reels on your profile\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>7. Share your Reels.</h3> \n<p>Along with posting Reels for Explore audiences, you can also post them to your feed which will also cause them to appear on your main profile grid. Reels can also be sent as direct messages or even posted to your Instagram Stories. Unless you share a Reel so it appears on your main grid, the content will behave like a Story and disappear within 24 hours.</p> \n<h3>8. Monitor your performance.</h3> \n<p>Currently, to view any insights for a Reel, you need to view the post itself. At this time, there isn‚Äôt a way to view the analytics of your Reels within Instagram Insights. Instead, look at the likes and comments to get a sense of engagement.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-1.png?width=200&amp;name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-1.png\" alt=\"engagement metrics on Instagram Reels\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>9. Watch Reels from other accounts.</h3> \n<p>To access Reels, simply go to search and you‚Äôll see a featured Reel. Tap that and then you can easily scroll through the clips. From there, you can follow users and like, share, and comment on reels directly. You can find Reels on specific topics by searching for hashtags.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-Sep-16-2020-05-57-05-93-PM.png?width=200&amp;name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Instagram%20Reels,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Academys%20Social%20Media%20Professor-Sep-16-2020-05-57-05-93-PM.png\" alt=\"Where to find Instagram Reels content in Instagram Explore feed\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h2>What to Keep in Mind with Instagram Reels</h2> \n<p>As you consider Reels, TikTok, and other emerging social media platforms in your marketing strategy, it's important to weigh the pros, cons, and key marketing takeaways when determining if a channel or feature is right for your team.</p> \n<p>Here are just a few things to remember as you consider Reels:</p> \n<h3>Reels competes against a unique, viral sensation:</h3> \n<p>Although Instagram has a huge audience that is loyal to its platform, many Gen Z users are used to going to TikTok for viral videos and general entertainment. Because the app has pulled in astounding fan loyalty in its short lifespan, you might find that Reels don't have the same viral opportunities that TikTok videos might have.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>What works on TikTok might not work on Reels</h3> \n<p>TikTok is a highly experimental platform with a younger, but huge, global audience. Because of these factors, there aren't many rules about what you should and shouldn't post on there. Meanwhile, Instagram has been around for years, has a slightly older audience, and has some content norms or audience expectations set in place</p> \n<p>If you've already posted a handful of TikTok videos and want to test them on Reels, you can consider uploading a few, watching how they perform, and learning more about what works well on both platforms.</p> \n<p>However, as you learn the differences between TikTok and Instagram audiences, you might find that high-performing TikToks aren't as engaging to your Reels audience. If this is the case, you might want to consider creating specialized content for Reels.</p> \n<h3>There aren't ad opportunities just yet.</h3> \n<p>Although you'll want to keep the points above in mind as you consider testing out Reels, you'll also want to remember the opportunities it offers. For example, Reels might be a great option for you if you've mastered Instagram, know what content your audiences want, and are eager to test out TikTok-styled content without using time and resources to build a full TikTok app strategy.</p> \n<p>If you do begin to test out Reels, it can't hurt to brush up on your Instagram marketing skills and Instagram platform knowledge to ensure that your profile, other content, and -- ultimately -- your Reels will be on point for your brand and optimized for brand awareness.</p> \n<p>Be sure to check out our <a

every night, I have to set about five alarms for the morning.</p> \n<p>I'm just the type of person that needs a lot of reminders to wake up on time.</p> \n<p>In a similar vein, marketers use reminder advertising to stay top-of-mind with potential customers.</p>  \n<p>And it makes sense.</p> \n<p>In the world of sales, <a href=\"https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/\">80% of sales require 5 follow-up calls after a meeting.</a> For marketers, it's no different.</p> \n<p>Essentially, you have to nurture and continuously remind your audience who you are to convert leads.</p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/\">companies excelling at lead nurturing generate 50% more sales-ready leads at 33% lower cost</a>.</p> \n<p>Below, let's learn more about reminder advertising and see what it looks like in action.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Reminder advertising is a paid method of marketing that targets people in your audience who are in the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">consideration stage of the buying process</a>.</p> \n<p>During this stage, users are reviewing their options. They're aware of their problem and the companies that might be able to help them. Now, they're trying to figure out which solution is the right way to go.</p> \n<p>In this stage, it's important to stay at the forefront of your audience's mind. That's where reminder advertising comes in.</p> \n<p>Another way to use reminder advertising is if you own a retail or ecommerce store. With a reminder ad, you can inspire customers to buy more products from you.</p> \n<p>In this case, reminder advertising can help customers remember that they like your store and products.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can use reminder advertising when you're at the end of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/product-life-cycle\">product life cycle</a>. For example, if a product has launched and you're done with the growth phase, then you can use reminder advertising to keep people interested.</p> \n<p>At this point, you might've noticed that this type of advertising doesn't introduce a new product. Instead, these ads are targeted at customers who are already aware of your brand and the products you offer.</p> \n<p>Also, these types of ads won't contain a lot of information. Rather, they'll just reinforce key messages and brand awareness. For instance, while you might include brief testimonials, usually just the name of the brand and product with a visual is enough.</p> \n<p>The objective is to hopefully serve as a reminder for potential customers and increase demand for your product or service.</p> \n<p>So, what tactics can you use for reminder advertising? Let's take a look at a quick list below.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Retargeting:</strong> <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide\">Retargeting</a> is when users who were on your website or social media page start seeing ads for your company on other pages they visit online. The whole point of retargeting ads is to remind customers of a product or service they were looking at and didn't buy. Retargeting is essentially a targeted reminder ad.</li> \n <li><strong>Abandoned cart emails:</strong> If a potential customer is on your website, adds a product to their cart, but doesn't complete the purchase, you don't want to lose that sale. To get them to complete their purchase, you can send them an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/ecommerce/shopping-cart-abandonment-reasons-solutions\">abandoned cart email</a> and remind them that they have items in their cart they may want to buy.</li> \n <li><strong>Email newsletters: </strong>An email newsletter is a great way to stay top-of-mind with your customers. If you're regularly sending them valuable information and perhaps including special offers, they'll be more likely to purchase from you.</li> \n <li><strong>Display ads: </strong>Display ads on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc\">Google</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-paid-ad-checklist\">Facebook</a> are another excellent option for reminder advertising. You can create a reminder ad that can help reinforce brand awareness.</li> \n <li><strong>Content:</strong> One of the best ways to keep your brand in your audience's mind is to produce content on your website and social media. If someone sees your posts on social media or on your blog, they'll have you in their mind when it's time to purchase.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now that we know more about reminder advertising, let's look at some examples.</p> \n<h2>Reminder Advertising Examples</h2> \n<h3>1. Coca-Cola</h3> \n<p>Since Coca-Cola is an established brand, any ad that isn't aimed at a new product launch serves as a reminder ad.</p> \n<p>Take the ad below, for instance.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mKFF5K4aUI\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>In this ad, Coca-Cola isn't introducing any new product. All they're doing is trying to remind you that their brand exists and you might be thirsty.</p> \n<p>This is a great reminder ad because you're probably not thinking about Coke all day. By seeing these types of messages, you're more likely to purchase a Coke the next time you can.</p> \n<h3>2. Zillow</h3> \n<p>Zillow is another brand that benefits from reminder advertising. With Zillow, you can look to buy or rent a new apartment, condo, or house. However, people don't make these big purchases all the time. Instead, Zillow needs to rely on reminder ads so their audience chooses Zillow when it's time to buy a new house.</p> \n<p>In the ad below, even the tagline reads, \"When you're ready for a change, we're ready to help.\"</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_-GI13YihME\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>This is a great example of a reminder ad. This shows that Zillow isn't trying to show you anything new, but rather remind you that they'll be there when you're ready to buy a house.</p> \n<h3>3. McDonald's</h3> \n<p>Again, McDonald's is a globally recognized brand. If they aren't launching a new product, almost any ad you see from them is a reminder ad.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yz2Gi8nHdgo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>In this McDonald's ad, the company isn't trying to launch any new menu items or tell you about something new.</p> \n<p>Instead, they're just reminding you that the company exists. And hopefully, they made you hungry enough to go buy some French fries.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, reminder ads are a great way to stay top-of-mind with your audience. Since most people need to come in contact with your brand several times before they purchase, reminder ads are an excellent way to convert leads.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Freminder-advertising&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:30:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a461a7e5c20a4f2467053179d3c1aebc","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Freminder-advertising&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389708},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"How to Create Facebook Video Ads, According to HubSpot Advertisers","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-facebook-video-ads","description":"<p>During the last few years, Facebook has emerged as a real contender for the online video platform throne. In wake of several new video features being introduced and a <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245818\">heavy video focus</a> from Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant has <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics#:~:text=Over%20500%20million%20(half%20a,every%20day%20(via%20Forbes).\">over 500 million people watching Facebook videos every day</a>.</p> \n<p>Facebook's increased focus on video isn't only because users like to watch it (although they clearly do) -- it's also because more <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/03/facebook-video-traffic/\">marketers are shifting their budgets</a> from TV to mobile video. The allure for advertisers lies in Facebook's hyper-surgical targeting possibilities and <a href=\"http://insights.fb.com/2015/04/02/measuring-facebook-video/\">the results Facebook videos can deliver</a>.</p> \n<p>If you're one of those marketers who wants to dive into advertising with Facebook videos -- but isn't sure where to start -- keep on reading.</p> \n<p>Below we'll review the types of Facebook video ads and how to create an effective ad with tips from HubSpot advertisers. Then, we'll look at some examples to put it all into practice.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Slideshow</h3> \n<p>You might think that recording and creating a video for a Facebook ad is a daunting task. However, with slideshow ads, all you need to do is create a video using only photos and text.</p> \n<p>Whether you use your own photos or stock images, slideshow ads are easier to put together and don't take too much time.</p> \n<p>This is a great way to engage audiences without spending time and money on creating a video.</p> \n<h3>2. Stories</h3> \n<p>If you've created a video for your Facebook feed, you can repurpose the same content as an ad that will play in Facebook stories.</p> \n<p>Story ads are a great way to reach your audience where they're at.</p> \n<h3>3. In-stream</h3> \n<p>In-stream ads are the closest way to replicate traditional TV advertising on social media.</p> \n<p>For this type of ad, you'll create a video that will play when people are watching Facebook videos. If you've ever watched native content that was interrupted by an ad, that was an in-stream ad.</p> \n<p>Now that you know the type of ads, let's discuss how you'll create and launch an effective Facebook video.</p> \n<h3>1. Set your objectives.</h3> \n<p>The first step of any marketing effort is to decide what you want to accomplish. In your Facebook video ad campaign, are you trying to increase brand awareness or drive conversions? Choosing what you're going to prioritize should affect what kind of video you should create and how you should distribute it.</p> \n<p>So choose your KPIs and plan accordingly. Below I've organized some common KPIs around three categories: engagement, audience reach, and brand lift.</p> \n<h4>Conversion KPIs</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Clicks</li> \n <li>CTR</li> \n <li>Revenue Generated</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Engagement KPIs</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Engagement (Share, likes, comments)</li> \n <li>Audience Retention (How much of your video the viewer watch)</li> \n <li>Relevance Score (How relevant your video is to your audience)</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Audience Reach KPIs</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Impressions (How many people viewed your video)</li> \n <li>Percent of In-Target Audience (What percent of your target audience you reached)</li> \n <li>Brand awareness</li> \n</ul> \n<p>By choosing which metrics you want to track and what goals you're trying to reach before you actually start creating your video, you're more likely to be successful.</p> \n<h3>2. Choose your target audience.</h3> \n<p>Who are you targeting with your video ad campaign? Yankee fans between 30-40? Newlyweds who shop at Costco? Millennials who play Minecraft? Or the people who already like your Facebook page?</p> \n<p>The true power of video advertising on Facebook is the targeting capabilities. Forget spray and pray -- you need a hyper-targeted group of people for your ad's audience. Narrowing your target group will give you less overall views, but because you're reaching only the people who are relevant, your CTR is likely to be higher.</p> \n<p>Leticia De Bortoli, a principal video editor at HubSpot, says, \"Think like a user. People don't go on Facebook to watch ads, and most people actually want to avoid ads at all cost. With that in mind you have to invest in your ad. Take the time to create something very compelling that can act as a thumbstopper, otherwise people will scroll right by your ad.\"</p> \n<p>She adds, \"Take the time to learn about your target audience. You might find specific interests and behaviors that can inform your creative and help you develop more compelling ads.\"</p> \n<p>Which targeting options you should have is dependent on what target audience you have, but here are some key targeting options for an effective Facebook video ad campaign:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Gender</li> \n <li>Age</li> \n <li>Location</li> \n <li>Interests</li> \n <li>Behavior</li> \n <li>Relationship status</li> \n <li>Work (Job title, Office type)</li> \n <li>Financial income</li> \n <li>Home (Type, Value, Ownership)</li> \n <li>Market segment (Ethnicity, Generation, Household composition)</li> \n <li>Parents (Age of children)</li> \n <li>Life events</li> \n <li>Device owner</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you go to the \"Audience Insights\" page in the Facebook Ads Manager, you can play around with the different options to define your target audience. Hopefully you have a pretty good idea about who your target market is based on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/everything-marketers-need-to-research-create-detailed-buyer-personas-template.aspx\">your buyer persona research</a>, but finding the best audience for your video ads might require a few attempts.</p> \n<p>This is a prime opportunity to really confirm your optimal target audience. What target audience has the highest CTR? What target audience has the highest LTV? Use the data you get from your campaigns to evaluate both your Facebook campaigns <em>and</em> your larger marketing strategy.</p> \n<h3>3. Plan the video creative.</h3> \n<p>With your KPIs and target audience decided, you know what you want to accomplish and the people you want to reach. Now it's time to plan your video creation. A good, solid plan for your video will increase the chances of it coming out looking good. Here are the things you should decide before you even touch a camera.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What is your topic? For example, if you're in the boat paint business, you might choose a topic like \"How to buy the right environmentally friendly boat paint.\"</li> \n <li>What will your key takeaway be? What message do you want to convey to your audience? For example, \"Our metal-free bottom paint lasts longer than normal paints and is more environmentally friendly.\"</li> \n <li>What is your CTA? For example, \"Use this code to buy our metal-free bottom paint for 20% before August 1st!\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>De Bortoli says to keep in mind that less is more.</p> \n<p>\"In social media advertising, one second is a lot of time. Have one clear message and one clear story that will center all the other elements of your ad,\" she says. \"Focus on delivering that central message in a very interesting way, instead of having multiple messages fighting to coexist in a few seconds.\"</p> \n<p>Megan McCall, a motion designer at HubSpot, agrees.</p> \n<p>\"Make the first 5 seconds the most compelling part of the ad. It's tempting to leave the pay-off of the ad until the end, but it's likely a user will catch your ad while scrolling, so you want to appeal to them early and make it clear what your company is about,\" McCall adds. \"That's why we often try to put the UI early, along with a mention of our brand and a clear value prop.\"</p> \n<p>Keeping all this in mind, it's time to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-video-script-ht\">write the script</a>. Write up what you want to say, how you're going to say it (if you're doing a voice-over), and what graphics and text you need. Make sure that your message is on point and not too long. It should sound natural when read aloud. And try to keep what you say to a minimum -- when it comes to online video ads, \"less is more\" is a better approach.</p> \n<h3>4. Create the video.</h3> \n<p>This is where things can get a little bit complicated. What kind of gear you need all depends on your experience level and how often you're planning to do videos in the future.</p> \n<p>For most beginners, a good smartphone and a microphone could be enough to get some decent photos or videos. But if you are devoting more resources to video, you might consider trading up to some higher quality gear and thinking about lighting and studio set up.</p> \n<p>McCall says, \"When you create a video, include your logo or a mention of your brand in the first 5 seconds. Monday.com does a great job at this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ELpzmNeS4M&amp;list=PLutcJfNEwNkTrn8024aA5-g8sx894xUTW&amp;index=6\">here.</a>\"</p> \n<p>Additionally, she says to consider adding burned in captions for viewers who don't use sound.</p> \n<p>Rex Gelb, the director of acquisition analytics and paid advertising at HubSpot, says, \"The best video ads on Facebook tend to grab people's attention in the first couple of seconds. People are busy and scrolling through their feeds fast -- you have about 2 seconds and 2 inches of real estate to engage them before they fly by. Make it count!\"</p> \n<p>If you are looking to easily create videos from the product photos you've already got, check out <a href=\"http://blog.shakr.com/how-to-take-product-photos-that-rock/\">this guide</a>.

Set up your Facebook campaign.</h3> \n<p>Once you've created your video, it's time to set up your Facebook video ad campaign. Setting up a video ad on Facebook is relatively straight-forward process, especially if you're used to setting up normal Facebook ads. Facebook does a good job of walking you through the process of setting up the campaign through either the Ad Manager or the Power Editor. Here are the basic steps you need to go through:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Start creating an ad and choose \"Video Views\" as your objective. You could choose to \"Boost Post\" as well, but choosing \"Video Views\" will give you a lower cost per view.</li> \n <li>Choose your audience. Like I mentioned before, you have a wealth of targeting options at your disposal. You can also <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-campaigns-beginner-guide\">retarget previous website visitors</a> or use any of the Custom Audiences you might already have, like your email list or app users. You can also target the fans of your Facebook page.</li> \n <li>Set budget and pricing. Choose how much you want to spend, over what time, and what you want to optimize your ad for.</li> \n <li>Upload your video. Be sure to choose your video thumbnail carefully -- it could affect your views.</li> \n <li>Edit your ad copy. Add the text copy and your CTA. Choose where you want your ad to be served, on web or mobile or both.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>6. Track your campaign.</h3> \n<p>Here are a few ways to track the different metrics I mentioned earlier in the post.</p> \n<h4>Conversion KPIs</h4> \n<p>Use a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">URL with UTM codes</a> to track the traffic from the ad to your website. Your marketing software should make it easy for you to track incoming traffic and subsequent conversions, and compare your video campaign to other campaigns you've run.</p> \n<p>You can also use Facebook Conversion Pixels to see the long-tail effect of your video campaign. For example, if someone visits your site after watching an ad, leaves, and then comes back, that information would be shown in the conversions column of your Facebook ad analytics.</p> \n<h4>Engagement KPIs</h4> \n<p>Tracking your engagement KPIs is a relatively straightforward process. Just go into the Ads Manager, choose \"Campaigns,\" and click on your ad to see how it performed.</p> \n<h4>Audience Reach KPIs</h4> \n<p>Similar to engagement, audience reach is simple to track on Facebook. On the \"Campaign Report\" page, see how many people viewed your ad and what your Relevance Score is. The Relevance Score will help you evaluate if your target audience actually liked your video. If your Relevance Score is poor compared to scores for other ads shown to your audience, Facebook will limit the reach of your video. The better the video and the better the targeting, the better your Relevance Score will be.</p> \n<h3>7. Evaluate your campaign.</h3> \n<p>After your video campaign is over, it is time to take a step back and evaluate how successful your campaign was. Go back and check your KPIs and see if you hit your goals.</p> \n<h4>Conversion KPIs</h4> \n<p>How many conversions did you get from your video campaign? Did people who clicked through to your website bounce quickly, or did they convert on your content? Did retargeted visitors convert at a later stage?</p> \n<h4>Engagement KPIs</h4> \n<p>Did people who saw your video engage with it? How many shares, likes, and comments did you get? How many of those were from organic sharing?</p> \n<h4>Audience Reach KPIs</h4> \n<p>Did you plan on reaching 10,000 people with your video/budget, but only reached 7,000 people because your Relevance Score was too low? You might want to think about how good your video is and how well it is aligned with your audience's wants. A good idea is to keep track of your videos' performance in a spreadsheet -- <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/analyze-social-media-with-excel/\">Social Media Examiner has a great template you can use.</a> That way, you can compare and evaluate your different campaigns, and figure out what kind of videos actually resonates with your audience.</p> \n<h3>8. Iterate.</h3> \n<p>After you've evaluated your video campaign's performance, it is time to do it again! Think about what went well and what you could improve. Is the video content you're putting out good enough? Is your targeting on point? When you have enough data from previous campaigns, you can easily compare them to see what works and what doesn't -- and then make changes on future ads.</p> \n<p>To really dive in deep, you might consider taking some lessons or classes on Facebook video ads, like the one <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/facebook-advertising-training\">HubSpot</a> has.</p> \n<h2>Examples of Compelling Facebook Video Ads</h2> \n<h3>1. Monday.com</h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ELpzmNeS4M\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>This is a great Facebook ad because it mentions the brand/logo in the first few seconds. As a user, you immediately know what you're getting.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the script is easy-to-understand. There are plenty of quick cuts, which makes it more interesting to watch.</p> \n<h3>2. Colgate</h3> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FColgate%2Fvideos%2F1109763475785392%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=476\" width=\"476\" height=\"476\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n<p>This is one of the best ads I've seen on Facebook. Colgate chose a very compelling topic, <em>\"What would you do with your Tooth Fairy money?\"</em> In the first few seconds, you're introduced to an engaging question and you can see that kids are going to be the ones answering the question.</p> \n<p>Besides puppies, showcasing wholesome content is a great way to get people to stop and watch your video.</p> \n<h3>3. Squarespace</h3> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsquarespace%2Fvideos%2F10156083341074731%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n<p>This Squarespace ad is compelling because the company showcased a celebrity partner. When you're fighting in the first 2 seconds to get people to stop scrolling, showcasing their favorite celebrities is a great tactic.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, creating Facebook ads is an important marketing tactic to consider. You can reach a lot of people in your audience, because most people watch videos on the social media site every day.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2015 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<div></div> \n<div></div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-create-facebook-video-ads&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 21:45:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"485fd1de197f80109dddeac9528cb3e4","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhow-to-create-facebook-video-ads&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389709},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"5 Brand Partnership Fails [+Co-Marketing Mistakes to Avoid]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-partnership-fails","description":"<p>When you were in school, did you ever work on a group project?</p> \n<p>If so, you probably remember that some went well, and others weren't as synergistic.</p> \n<p>The same thing is true with brand partnerships.</p> \n<p>Sometimes co-marketing works because each brand pulls in a new audience and the two are able to learn from one another.</p>  \n<p>However, this isn't the case with all partnerships.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review some brand partnerships that have failed and discuss <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/co-marketing-campaign\">co-marketing</a> mistakes to avoid.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>5 Brand Partnership Fails</h2> \n<h3>1. Kendall Jenner and Pepsi</h3> \n<p>A few years ago, a major brand partnership that failed was between Kendall Jenner and Pepsi. Pepsi featured Jenner in a commercial where she offers a soda to a policeman at a protest.</p> \n<p>Here's the commercial:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwvAgDCOdU4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>The reason this partnership failed was because audiences thought the two brands were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad.html\">making light of serious social and civil rights issues</a>.</p> \n<p>Essentially, this commercial was perceived as being done in poor taste and didn't showcase social consciousness.</p> \n<h3>2. Target and Neiman Marcus</h3> \n<p>In 2013, Target and Neiman Marcus partnered on a new clothing line.</p> \n<p>However, Target's customers search for cost-efficient, mass trend clothing options, while Neiman Marcus is a luxury brand that offers expensive, edgy clothes.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, this collection didn't take Target's target audience into account. The clothing line ended up being <a href=\"https://business.time.com/2013/01/02/epic-retail-fail-where-did-the-target-neiman-marcus-collection-go-wrong/\">too expensive and edgy for Target's audience.</a></p> \n<p>Usually, if a high-end brand is partnering with Target, the prices would be lower, so customers can get trend-setting designs at an affordable price.</p> \n<p>This partnership failed because the brands couldn't make both target audiences' happy with their collection.</p> \n<h3>3. Kraft and Starbucks</h3> \n<p>A partnership that had lasted for years ended in a major court battle.</p> \n<p>When this partnership was successful, Kraft was able to help Starbucks grow by offering distribution services and helping the coffee brand build a presence in grocery stores.</p> \n<p>According to William Neuman of \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/business/07coffee.html\">The New York Times</a>,\" \"Kraft claims that Starbucks unilaterally decided to end their agreement, and Starbucks says that Kraft failed to aggressively promote its brands, which include Seattle's Best Coffee, in stores.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, this brand partnership failed because of poor communication, and possibly poor execution as well.</p> \n<h3>4. Forever 21 and Atkins</h3> \n<p>Last year, Forever 21 decided to partner with Atkins by sending out Atkins snack bars to customers who had ordered online.</p> \n<p>However, Forever 21's target market didn't appreciate the brand sending them weight loss bars. In fact, customers complained that the brand was body-shaming them.</p> \n<p>Additionally, since the partnership wasn't explained to customers, some people assumed the bars were being sent to plus-size customers who ordered online.</p> \n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/business/forever-21-atkins-bars/index.html\">partnership failed</a> because it didn't make sense for the audiences and the brands' missions didn't align.</p> \n<h3>5. Shell and LEGO</h3> \n<p>Another example of brands that had worked together for years (about 50 years to be exact), Shell and LEGO had a falling out.</p> \n<p>At first, it made sense that LEGO would partner with an oil company because they could use the credibility of Shell with their race cars and gas station sets.</p> \n<p>However, LEGO eventually became a global children's entertainment brand, and the partnership didn't make sense anymore because of the oil company's reputation of poor environmental practices and oil drilling.</p> \n<p>Eventually, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/09/lego-ends-shell-partnership-following-greenpeace-campaign\">this partnership failed</a> because of the public outcry from LEGO's audience and the impact on the brand's reputation.</p> \n<p>Now that we've reviewed some brand partnerships that have failed, let's discuss why they didn't do well and look at some common co-marketing mistakes to avoid.</p> \n<h3>1. Poor communication.</h3> \n<p>When you're working with another brand, it's important to communicate effectively and efficiently with each other.</p> \n<p>You need to be honest about what you're both going to give and get from the partnership since it has to make sense for your brands.</p> \n<p>Margot Mazur, a senior marketing manager in charge of co-marketing for HubSpot, says, \"Co-marketing is all about negotiation ‚Äî you give some, and you get some from your partner. Make sure to come into the negotiation from a place of positivity, and instead of focusing on what you're going to get ‚Äî whether it's promotional materials, ad spend, or placement ‚Äî focus on what you can give the partner to make sure that they're finding value from the relationship.\"</p> \n<p>She added, \"On the other side of that email, there's a human being trying to do their best work, just like you. Focus on strengthening that relationship, being honest and clear about expectations and needs, and your co-marketing offer is sure to succeed.\"</p> \n<h3>2. The brand stories don't align.</h3> \n<p>Before you partner with another brand, think about your brand messaging and your story. Personify your brand and think of it as a person -- who is your brand?</p> \n<p>Now, when you choose a partner, your brands should have the same values and similar brand messaging.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're an eco-friendly brand working with an oil company, those stories don't make sense together.</p> \n<p>Your brand stories need to align, otherwise your customers will notice and call you out.</p> \n<h3>3. The partnership doesn't consider the customers.</h3> \n<p>As we saw with some of our examples, it's important that a brand partnership makes sense for both target audiences.</p> \n<p>In fact, three out of the five examples failed because the brand partnership didn't make sense for the audience.</p> \n<p>Before you begin a co-marketing relationship with another brand, consider your audience. Will this partnership make sense to them? What would they think of your partnership?</p> \n<p>It's important to answer these questions before moving forward with a co-marketing campaign.</p> \n<h3>4. Badly written agreements.</h3> \n<p>Unfortunately, for a couple of our examples above, there were issues over contracts and agreements.</p> \n<p>If you don't have a detailed, well-written agreement, then you could end up in court for not upholding your end of the deal.</p> \n<p>Each partner should agree to every part of the partnership so no one is left disappointed.</p> \n<h3>5. Executed poorly.</h3> \n<p>Another reason that a partnership might fail is because it's executed poorly. If the implementation is misguided, then you could do serious damage to your reputations.</p> \n<p>If you're going to partner with another brand, make sure that both parties are committed to it and will execute the agreement with 100% effort.</p> \n<p>So, now that we've discussed why brand partnerships might fail, how can you avoid these mistakes?</p> \n<h2>Avoiding Co-Marketing Mistakes</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/co-marketing-partner-tips\">Co-marketing can be greatly beneficial</a> for both brands if it makes sense and provides value for your audience.</p> \n<p>To <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-cobranding-partnerships\">avoid these mistakes</a>, make sure that you communicate with your partner and consider your customers.</p> \n<p>To learn more about co-marketing, check out our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34188/what-in-the-heck-is-co-marketing.aspx\">ultimate guide</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-partnership-fails&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 08:30:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a3cd9f74495dbc18cf95e64856803229","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-partnership-fails&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn22@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-49-415_b2d01c19d25a4896.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389710},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"How To Do a Poll on Instagram: A Beginner's Guide","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-poll-instagram","description":"<p>I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, but checking Instagram is one of the first things I do in the morning.</p> \n<p>But, I know I'm not alone.</p> \n<p>Did you know that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-use-instagram\">Instagram went from one million users in December 2010 to over one billion in 2020</a>?</p>  \n<p>In fact, it's one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. So, you might be wondering, <em>\"How can I use this platform?\"</em></p> \n<p>Well, a great way to engage with your audience is through an Instagram poll.</p> \n<p>According to HubSpot research, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-formats\">quiz or poll stickers are one of the most popular Instagram Story formats</a>.</p> \n<p>Polls are a great way to keep in touch with your audience and even conduct market research.</p> \n<p>In this post, let's learn how to set up a poll on Instagram and discuss how you can use this feature.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Open Instagram and swipe left.</h3> \n<p>To get started with Instagram polls, the first thing you need to do is open the app. Then, you'll swipe left. This will take you to the screen where you can post on your Stories.</p> \n<h3>2. Make sure you're posting to Story (underneath the record button).</h3> \n<p>Once you're here, make sure that you're posting to your Story. Underneath the record button, you'll see whether you're posting a Story, a Reel, or going Live.</p> \n<p>To post a poll, make sure you're posting to your Story.</p> \n<h3>3. Take the video or picture you want to post.</h3> \n<p>Now, just take the video or picture you want to post.</p> \n<p>If you have it saved, you can just select the content from this screen by clicking on the picture icon on the bottom left. This will take you to your camera roll where you can select a video or image.</p> \n<h3>4. Click the sticker icon on the top right.</h3> \n<p>To add the poll, click on the sticker icon on the top right. It's the third icon from the left.</p> \n<h3>5. Scroll down and choose poll or look for the sliding poll.</h3> \n<p>Now you should see different sticker options including location, time, questions, and more. Scroll down and choose the poll icon.</p> \n<p>You can either do a question and answer poll, or a sliding poll. To choose a sliding poll, you'll want to scroll until you find the slide bar option.</p> \n<h3>6. Type in the question and responses.</h3> \n<p>If you chose the question and answer poll, it's time to type in your question and the possible responses.</p> \n<p>If you chose the slide bar, you'll want to type in your question and then add an emoji to the sliding bar.</p> \n<h3>7. Click \"Send To\" and then share your poll to your Story.</h3> \n<p>Now all that's left to do is post. To do this, just click \"Send To\" and then share the post on your Story.</p> \n<h3>8. Track results.</h3> \n<p>Once you've posted a poll, it's time to wait for the responses. To view the results, you'll want to watch your Stories.</p> \n<p>Then, click the \"Seen by\" icon in the bottom left corner. This will show you who voted and the results.</p> \n<p>Here, you'll also see a button to \"Share Results.\" You can click that and post the results to your Story to let your viewers know the outcome of the poll.</p> \n<p>When you're creating a poll, remember to place it strategically.</p> \n<p>You don't want people to have problems voting because of the placement. Make sure your poll is placed near the center, and not too high or low that the other Story icons block it.</p> \n<p>As you can see, posting a poll on Instagram is a simple process. But, how do you use this feature?</p> \n<p>Here are some of the top ways you can use Instagram polls:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Learn about your audience. </strong>Polls are a great way to talk to your followers. You can learn about their interests and opinions using a simple poll.</li> \n <li><strong>Market research. </strong>Instagram polls can also help you discover what your audience wants to see from your brand. For example, I've seen a powder protein company ask questions on what flavors customers want to see and then deliver on those flavors. This makes your audience feel like they're a part of a community and like you value their opinion.</li> \n <li><strong>Gather feedback.</strong> If you want to know what your customers think, why not just ask them? You can use polls to gather feedback and information from your followers.</li> \n <li><strong>Share your content.</strong> Instagram polls are a great way to get your audience interested in the content on your site. Hopefully, the poll will strike enough interest that your followers go to your site to see a blog.</li> \n <li><strong>Enter a giveaway. </strong>I've seen plenty of influencers use the sliding bar to gather giveaway entries.

Let's get started. <br /></p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Email Design</h2> \n<p>Email recipients often scan information and abandon emails that don't offer them value or simply appear to be too dense. That‚Äôs why having great email design is so important ‚Äî it'll help you capture the attention of, and engage, your email recipients.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Your email design should be attention-grabbing, aesthetically-pleasing, and on-brand, among other things ‚Äî let's dive into those things next with these 13 best practices for email deign.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. Craft a strong subject line.</h3> \n<p>Your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-email-subject-line?_ga=2.76553621.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">email subject line</a> is the first thing anyone sees when you send them an email. It‚Äôs the brief statement that‚Äôs supposed to pique the interest of your recipients. It should capture their attention so they <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">want</span> to open your email and continue reading.</p> \n<p><strong>Here‚Äôs what a subject line looks like in your email inbox:</strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email%20subject%20line%20example-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=email%20subject%20line%20example-1.png\" alt=\"email subject line example from email on desktop\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Here‚Äôs what a subject line looks like in your mobile device‚Äôs email inbox:</strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Email%20subject%20line%20on%20mobile.jpeg?width=1500&amp;name=Email%20subject%20line%20on%20mobile.jpeg\" alt=\"Email subject line example  from email on mobile\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-email-subject-lines-list\">great subject line</a> will have these characteristics:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Grab the attention of your readers in as few words as possible (remember: <em>less is more</em>).</li> \n <li>Provide value for the recipient that makes them want to open the email.</li> \n <li>Summarize what recipients are going to read and/ or see once they open the email.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Write an attention-grabbing pre-header.</h3> \n<p>Your email pre-header is a preview of what the email is about, similar to the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/meta-descriptions\">meta description</a> of a web page. It‚Äôs the second thing recipients see.</p> \n<p>Rather than rewriting the first sentence of your email, you can customize the pre-header to provide an inside look into what your recipients are about to read in your message.</p> \n<p><strong>Here‚Äôs what a pre-header looks like in your email inbox:</strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email%20preheader%20example.png?width=1500&amp;name=email%20preheader%20example.png\" alt=\"email preheader example in desktop email inbox\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Here‚Äôs what a pre-header looks like in your mobile device‚Äôs email inbox:</strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email%20preheader%20example.jpeg?width=1500&amp;name=email%20preheader%20example.jpeg\" alt=\"email preheader example from a mobile device\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>3. Be concise.</h3> \n<p>How many times throughout the day do you find yourself opening an email thinking, <em>I can‚Äôt wait to sit down and take the next 5-10 minutes to really dive into this email from Business X!</em></p> \n<p>If you're anything like me, your answer is likely rarely or never.</p> \n<p>Give email recipients the information they want and need from you without getting into the weeds. This will show them you value their time which has the potential to help you improve email subscriber retainment.</p> \n<h3>4. Keep your email on-brand.</h3> \n<p>When your email recipients open your message, they should know the email was sent from your company. Meaning your email should be branded.</p> \n<p>To <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding?_ga=2.76553621.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">keep your email on-brand</a>, consider using the following tactics:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use a tone in your emails that complements your other content and marketing materials (like your website and social media).</li> \n <li>Incorporate the same colors and fonts that you use in your other branding and marketing materials.</li> \n <li>Include your logo, a link to your website, links to your social media accounts, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-design#calls-to-action\">calls-to-action (CTAs)</a> that are relevant to your products or services. This is a great way to increase brand awareness while also boost conversions.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Use the layout to enhance your email‚Äôs user experience.</h3> \n<p>Nobody wants to read a cluttered and unorganized email ‚Äî this makes recipients feel overwhelmed and can lead to increased abandonment.</p> \n<p>Instead, organize your layout with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ux-user-experience?_ga=2.76553621.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">user experience (UX)</a> in mind ‚Äî meaning, leave empty/ white space and strategically place your written and visual content so it‚Äôs organized and easy to consume and navigate.</p> \n<h3>6. Personalize every email.</h3> \n<p>When you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/personalize-emails-with-smart-content\">customize an email</a> and tailor it to your recipient, it'll feel more thoughtful, professional, and personal. Email personalization also helps you humanize your brand. This touch helps you foster a relationship between your business and email recipients and boost retention rates.</p> \n<h3>7. Incorporate unique visual content.</h3> \n<p>If recipients open an email and only see paragraphs of information, it‚Äôs likely going to be difficult to hold their attention and keep them interested in your message. Rather, incorporate on-brand and engaging images, videos, GIFs, animations, etc. to break up the written content and create a memorable experience.</p> \n<p>And speaking of incorporating creative and unique visual content in your emails, let‚Äôs talk emojis.</p> \n<h3>8. Don‚Äôt be afraid to use emojis. üß°</h3> \n<p>At first, emojis may seem like an unnecessary or unprofessional addition to an email. While this may be a fair assumption, it‚Äôs actually untrue in a number of scenarios.</p> \n<p>In fact, when you <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/email/can-i-use-emojis-in-the-subject-line-of-my-emails?_ga=2.76553621.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">add emojis to your email subject line</a> and/ or email copy, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-emojis?_ga=2.142563762.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">increase your open and click-through rates</a>. But remember: When using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emojis?_ga=2.142563762.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">emojis for marketing</a> purposes, make sure you know the meaning and connotation of the specific one(s) you incorporate. üòÉ</p> \n<h3>9. Use a responsive design.</h3> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/responsive-web-design?_ga=2.142563762.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">responsive design</a> means your email changes format to fit the screen it‚Äôs being viewed on, whether it's on a desktop, laptop, or mobile device. Recipients will be able to read your emails with ease no matter where or how they‚Äôre viewing them. By incorporating a responsive design, you'll be able to enhance UX and improve email retention across all devices.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>10. Optimize your email with CTAs.</h3> \n<p>Calls-to-action (CTAs) are used to convert your email recipients. For instance, you can use a CTA to get recipients to follow you on social media, visit your website, chat with a sales rep, or become paying customers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples?_ga=2.142563762.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">CTAs</a> should be visible, enticing, and clearly show why they‚Äôre valuable to click. Additionally, you might choose to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/personalized-calls-to-action-convert-better-data?_ga=2.142563762.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">personalize your CTAs</a> to tailor them towards specific recipients ‚Äî this tactic has been proven to increase conversions.</p> \n<h3>11. Add an \"unsubscribe\" button.</h3> \n<p>Email marketing is highly effective as long as you‚Äôre providing relevant content to your recipients. The unfortunate but true reality of email marketing is that your recipients and customers change over time ‚Äî especially as your business grows and evolves. Therefore, your content may not always be relevant to certain audience members.</p> \n<p>For this reason, allow your recipients to leave (or unsubscribe from your emails) on a good note so they can remember your business in a positive light ‚Äî who knows, they may need your email content, products, or services again in the future. To do this, simplify their lives with an easy-to-use and visible \"unsubscribe‚Äù button.</p> \n<p>In addition to offering a better experience for users, you're actually required by law to add that unsubscribe button.</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\">Federal Trade Commission and CAN-SPAM Act</a>, you‚Äôre <i>legally</i> required to include a ‚Äúclear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt-out of getting emails from you in the future‚Äù. Meaning, that unsubscribe button <em>isn‚Äôt</em> an option.</p> \n<p>(If you need some inspiration, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-unsubscribe-pages?_ga=2.142563762.1076171011.1568210823-1493293515.1553017609\">check out these effective unsubscribe pages.)</a></p> \n<h3>12. A/B test your design.</h3> \n<p>Similar to most marketing efforts, email design is an iterative process. You might determine you need to make changes and updates to get the most out of your email design.</p> \n<p>Whether it‚Äôs modifying your CTA, colors, images, layout, or tone, don‚Äôt be afraid to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing\">A/B test </a>designs to determine which one works best in terms of ability to reach, resonate with, and convert the greatest number of recipients.</p> \n<h3>13. Design an email signature.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/professional-email-signatures\">Great email signature design</a> is another way you can establish a professional and personal feel over email. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-email-signature\">Email signatures</a> shouldn't just include your name ‚Äî they should contain other defining and memorable characteristics about you, your role, contact information, and company.</p> \n<p>Here are some specifics you can include in your email signature:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>First and last name</li> \n <li>Contact information (and secondary contact information)</li> \n <li>Job Title / Role</li> \n <li>Company Name</li> \n <li>Link to your meeting calendar</li> \n <li>Social media links (e.g. LinkedIn profile)</li> \n <li>Pronouns</li> \n <li>Photo</li> \n <li>Industry disclaimer or legal requirements</li> \n</ul> And \n<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator\">here's a free email signature generator tool</a> to help you design your signature. \n<br> <p>A great way to streamline the process of working on and incorporate all 13 of the above best practices is to use <strong>email design tools and software</strong>.</p> <p>In fact, many of the best practices we reviewed will come up naturally while you‚Äôre designing, writing, and planning your messages with email design software.</p> <a></a> <h2>Email Design Tools</h2> <p>There are a number of email design tools with a wide range of capabilities (some completely unrelated to email design!) ‚Äî here are some popular examples.</p> <h3>1.

Along with the statistical benefits seen above, there are a number of other qualitative perks such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Audience exposure: </strong>Through co-marketing and cross-promotion, your content or brand information will be shared with your audiences as well as your brand partner's. This enables your brand to gain increased reach. For example, when local or online stores launch Google Ads showing that they carry Est√©e Lauder fragrances, fans of the perfume brand might visit or follow that store for the first time.</li> \n <li><strong>Increased trust and favorability: </strong>If a prospect trusts the brand you partner with, they might trust you when that brand promotes your name, logo, or content. For example, when <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-cobranding-partnerships\">Adidas teamed up with Kanye West</a> to create the Yeezy line, people might have bought a pair of Yeezys because they trusted Adidas' quality and West's sense of style.</li> \n <li><strong>Cost-effective content:</strong> When you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/co-marketing-partner-tips\">team up with another brand</a>, you might be able to make an agreement where you split time or production costs, or you can trade one brand strength for another. For example, if you're a small brand partnering with a larger brand, you might be able to utilize the bigger brand's budget and gain more exposure on their channels. Meanwhile, the bigger brand might be able to leverage your niche social media audience..</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now that you've learned about the benefits and stats related to co-marketing, get inspiration from <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-cobranding-partnerships\">these successful real-world examples of the tactic.</a> For more on how to find the right co-marketing partner, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/co-marketing-partner-tips\">check out this handy guide</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fco-marketing-stats&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"00edf87b795a7509dc3c7cbba6972013","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"pbump@hubspot.com (Pamela Bump)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fco-marketing-stats&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn43@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-47-753_0815ccbd920f2e9b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389708},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"What is Trading Up, and Why It Matters for Marketers","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/trading-up","description":"<p>To understand what the term \"trading up\" means, let's start with a scenario.</p> \n<p>You wake up early and jog to the Starbucks on the corner of your street. There, you wait in line to order a pumpkin-spiced latte, as you skim emails on your iPhone.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, you return home, put on your new Lululemon workout apparel, and hop on your Peloton for an at-home workout.</p> \n<p>In this scenario, you've \"traded up\" in a variety of consumer categories: including coffee, technology, clothing, and even workout gear.</p> \n<p>Why, for instance, did you feel the need to head to Starbucks and pay $6 for a drink, as opposed to making a quick pot of coffee in your Keurig? Alternatively, why not purchase workout apparel from Marshalls or Target?</p> \n<p>(No judgment on any of these decisions: I've made them, too.)</p> \n<p>Ultimately, trading up refers to a consumer's tendency to pay <em>more </em>for a higher-quality, more expensive product or service from a brand to which they've formed an emotional attachment, and feel a sense of loyalty.</p> \n<p>But trading up doesn't just refer to a consumer's behavior in the marketplace at-large: it also refers to a consumer's decision to upgrade their product for a newer model with additional features.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, it's critical you understand the concept \"trading up\" to discern how you might evoke brand loyalty in a crowded marketplace ‚Äî or, how you might market a new version of your product to existing consumers.</p> \n<p>Here, let's explore what trading up means, as well as what it means specifically for marketers.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>What does trading up mean?</strong></h2> \n<h3><strong>Trading up in the industry at-large. </strong></h3> \n<p>There are two contexts in which you'll find the term \"trading up\" used: within a marketplace at-large, and within your company's own product suite.</p> \n<p>To start, let's explore what trading up means within an entire marketplace.</p> \n<p>In this context, trading up refers to a consumer's decision to purchase a more expensive product because of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding\">brand</a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding\"> value</a> they feel it delivers. This is why consumers will purchase a car for 10X the normal price if it's marked with BMW, but why they might not make the same decision for a car from a lesser-known brand.</p> \n<p>There are a few reasons why a consumer will trade up in the marketplace. For one, a consumer might trade up because the brand meets their aspirational vision of who they want to be. There is undoubtedly a different vision that comes to mind when a consumer thinks of Starbucks versus Dunkin' ‚Äî in exchange for this vision, a consumer might be willing to pay more for a coffee.</p> \n<p>These top-of-the-line brands often feel \"premium\" and luxurious, incentivizing consumers to pay more than they would for another version of that product in the marketplace from a lesser-known or lower-quality brand.</p> \n<p>However, that isn't to say that consumers purchase products from certain companies entirely based on brand name alone. No matter how impressive Starbucks' brand image is, it doesn't do much good if the coffee is disgusting.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, you can't have one without the other. A brand like Starbucks, BMW, or Apple rises to the top of their industries because they provide high-quality, well-engineered products ‚Äî not just because they have a good brand image to match.</p> \n<p>Additionally, these brands have built a good deal of trust with existing consumers, which leads to positive word-of-mouth marketing. Considering over <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/how-online-word-of-mouth-marketing-is-changing\">90% of consumers</a> trust family and friends' suggestions more than advertising, this is important.</p> \n<p>For instance, nowadays, Apple doesn't need to appeal to consumers with constant commercials and billboards ‚Äî instead, they can trust their loyal brand advocates to do the heavy-lifting (just consider the jokes you find on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%22green%20bubbles%22&amp;src=typd\">Twitter when you search \"green bubbles\"</a>, which signifies a non-Apple user).</p> \n<p>Suggestions from friends and family is the second powerful reason a consumer will trade up. Perhaps you've never considered purchasing a Peloton, until you heard your friends raving about the product.</p> \n<p>Friends will only suggest a product if it's truly high-quality and meets their needs above all other competitors in the marketplace.</p> \n<p>Which is why, ultimately, you need both a strong brand <em>and </em>a powerful product or service for consumers to feel they're trading up from the \"status quo product\" that exists in your industry.</p> \n<p>Next, let's explore what it means for a consumer to trade up at <em>your</em> company in particular.</p> \n<h3><strong>Trading up within a company's product suite. </strong></h3> \n<p>The second context for trading up is within a company, and is also known as upgrading.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say you sell a starter version of your software, but you've just released a new professional version, with higher-quality features. If your consumers choose to upgrade to the new version of your product, they're \"trading up\".</p> \n<p>In many ways, this mirrors the first definition. You might think of your starter version as a used car, and your professional version as this year's latest model.</p> \n<p>To encourage consumers to trade up, you'll want to demonstrate how the new features of your product are powerful and necessary ‚Äî not just \"nice to haves\" but \"need to haves\".</p> \n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/cross-selling\">Cross-Selling and Upselling: The Ultimate Guide</a> for more information on this.</p> \n<h2><strong>Trading Up in Marketing</strong></h2> \n<p>Now that we've explored what trading up means for a consumer, let's explore what it means as a marketer.</p> \n<p>Understanding the reasons a consumer might trade up can help you leverage your brand and products to incentivize consumers to feel they're trading up when they purchase <em>your </em>products or services.</p> \n<p>How? Through good brand recognition (and a high-quality product, of course).</p> \n<p>While I used some major brands in my examples, you don't need to be a large corporation for consumers to feel they're trading up. For instance, consider my new favorite coffee shop, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bittersweetboston/\">Bittersweet Shoppe</a>, on Newbury Street. The cozy cafe is filled with sunflowers and offers fantastic customer service ‚Äî now, when I go there, I feel like I'm trading up from Starbucks. Ultimately, I like the <em>experience</em> of entering their coffee shop, which is what a good brand image is all about.</p> \n<p>If you work for a small business, there are plenty of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding\">strategies you might implement to create a strong brand</a>, including building a brand strategy, prioritizing consistency, and using a strong mission or vision statement to guide all your decisions.</p> \n<p>Additionally, encouraging consumers to trade up, or upgrade, from <em>within</em> your product suite involves strong messaging, sales and marketing alignment, and a true understanding of what your consumers need and how your newer version can meet those challenges, particularly as consumers out-grow your first product.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, people don't trade up from brands and products they love. Ensure you're meeting your consumers needs, both through your brand <em>and</em> your products, and they'll tell their friends and family.

An Exploration of Brand Portfolios","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-portfolio","description":"<p>Do you know how you have siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles? Well, brands kind of do too ‚Äî only their fellow brands probably don't get way too aggressive about the conspiracy theories they believe in while everyone's just trying to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner like <em>somebody's</em> Uncle Gary does every year.</p>  \n<p>While brands don't go through<em> that </em>kind of situation that totally doesn't apply to me, they're still generally related ‚Äî falling under umbrellas set by larger, overarching firms. And if we're running with the whole family analogy, the family trees those umbrellas set are known as brand portfolios.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll get a more thorough understanding of brand portfolios, see the different kinds of brands that can compose one, and explore some prominent brand portfolio examples.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Firms generally create, expand, and maintain brand portfolios to gain footholds in multiple markets and appeal to a wider variety of prospects. This trend has a presence in virtually every industry. For the sake of example, let's imagine a firm that runs a single fast-food chain.</p> \n<p>That flagship brand serves typical fast-food fare at bargain prices. That chain is doing well, but executives at the firm are noticing a significant shift in consumer preferences. Now, a solid segment of the chain's market is starting to err towards healthier options.</p> \n<p>The flagship brand's identity has been firmly established as a value-oriented albeit not-so-healthy franchise ‚Äî so much so that making its menu healthier might alienate the majority of its customers who <em>aren't</em> interested in health-food.</p> \n<p>In this case, the firm could explore the possibility of creating a new restaurant ‚Äî one with an emphasis on healthy options. If it decides to take that route, it would add another brand to its brand portfolio.</p> \n<p>The brands contained within your average brand portfolio tend to fall into four main roles: flanker brands, cash cow brands, low-end entry-level brands, and high-end prestige brands. Each category serves a purpose, and in many cases, a firm will create and maintain brands that fulfill different roles to complement one another.</p> \n<h3>1. Flanker Brand</h3> \n<p>A flanker brand is a brand a company releases in a product category in which it already has an existing brand. The hope is that the new brand helps increase the company's market share within that product category and serves the needs of prospects the original brand might not cover.</p> \n<p>For instance, alcoholic beverage company Molson Coors leverages a flanker brand strategy in its approach to the low-calorie beer market. The company has released multiple brands ‚Äî including Miller Lite, Coors Light, and Keystone Light ‚Äî that all occupy a similar niche.</p> \n<p>Still, the brands are distinct enough to appeal to different consumers and suit different situations. Even though they're technically competing, flanker brands <em>complement</em> more than they <em>cannibalize</em>. They're designed to help a company flesh out its market presence and crowd out competitors.</p> \n<h3>2. Cash Cow Brand</h3> \n<p>A cash cow brand is one that has reached a certain level of maturity with respect to its market presence and ability to make money. These brands can generate enough profit to essentially sustain themselves ‚Äî keeping themselves afloat after businesses recoup their initial investments from them.</p> \n<p>It's much less expensive to sit back and let these brands continue to bring in cash than to launch any sort of new product to replace them. As a result, they're rarely removed from the market.</p> \n<h3>3. Low-End Entry-Level Brand</h3> \n<p>A low-end entry-level brand is one that's added to a brand portfolio to be offered at a lower price than the other products or services that portfolio covers. The principle behind low-end entry-level brands has to do with hooking customers.</p> \n<p>The idea is that consumers will buy the low-end entry-level brand initially ‚Äî effectively introducing them to that brand's broader portfolio. Once a customer has engaged with and been impressed by the company behind the low-end entry-level brand, they'll be inclined to explore the broader suite of products in its portfolio.</p> \n<h3>4. High-End Prestige Brand</h3> \n<p>High-end prestige brands are ones designed to create the impression of premium quality and luxury. The hope is that some of the esteem the brand creates will trickle down onto the other brands within the company's broader portfolio.</p> \n<p>These kinds of brands are tailored to lead consumers to think, <em>\"If this company can create a product of its caliber, maybe its other ones are high quality in their own right.\"</em></p> \n<p>1. <a href=\"https://www.coca-colacompany.com/brands\">Coca Cola</a></p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Whats%20Sprite%20to%20Coca%20Cola%3F%20An%20Exploration%20of%20Brand%20Portfolios-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.coca-colacompany.com/brands\" style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: none;\">Image Source: Coca Cola</a></p> \n<p>Coca Cola's brand portfolio is about as eclectic, far-reaching as they come ‚Äî certainly when it comes to the food and beverage industry.

Almost all of them are a part of a broader brand portfolio, so virtually every brand has a firm, company, or conglomerate at the top of its lineage.</p> \n<p>That's important to bear in mind when taking actions like trying to be ethical with your dollar. Any brand you use starts somewhere. If you can navigate that product's portfolio back to a company whose values and actions don't sit well with you, you'll know to avoid it.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-portfolio&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Whats%20Sprite%20to%20Coca%20Cola%3F%20An%20Exploration%20of%20Brand%20Portfolios-1.png","linkMd5":"a81edb721fc60b35458886c1227bc302","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn99@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-31-850_e01f07d85d683ef6.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":1280,"sourceBytes":954858,"destBytes":954858,"author":"jfuchs@hubspot.com (Jay Fuchs)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Whats%20Sprite%20to%20Coca%20Cola%3F%20An%20Exploration%20of%20Brand%20Portfolios-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn99@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-31-850_e01f07d85d683ef6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Whats%20Sprite%20to%20Coca%20Cola%3F%20An%20Exploration%20of%20Brand%20Portfolios.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-51-618_1c09bc760f79e0be.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Whats%20Sprite%20to%20Coca%20Cola%3F%20An%20Exploration%20of%20Brand%20Portfolios-2.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn83@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-45-860_1ceb8af3f51a74a7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Whats%20Sprite%20to%20Coca%20Cola%3F%20An%20Exploration%20of%20Brand%20Portfolios-1.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn45@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-33-47-192_e7c308517bdeb1ee.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-portfolio&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn40@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-49-550_27f282a710dde349.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389708},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Google Ads [Examples]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc","description":"<p>If you‚Äôre considering spending any amount of money on ads to reach your target audience, you‚Äôd better spend it in the right place.</p> \n<p>That is, somewhere with over <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/1001/google/\">259 million</a> unique visitors and <a href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/\">4.8 billion</a> daily interactions.</p> \n<p>Somewhere like ... <strong>Google.</strong></p> \n<p>Google Ads was launched just two years after what has become the <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/topsites\">most popular website</a> in the world: Google.com. The advertising platform came on the scene in October 2000 as <strong>Google Adwords</strong>, but after some rebranding in 2018, it was renamed <strong>Google Ads</strong>.</p> \n<p>Given Google‚Äôs expansive reach, chances are you‚Äôve seen (and probably clicked on) a Google ad ‚Ä¶ and so have your potential customers.</p> \n<p>In this guide you'll discover how to begin advertising on Google. We‚Äôll cover features specific to the platform and teach you how to optimize your campaigns to achieve the best results with your ads.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>It's no secret that, these days, the stronger and more focused your paid campaigns are, the more clicks you generate ‚Äî leading to a greater probability of obtaining new customers.</p> \n<p>This is why Google Ads has become increasingly popular among businesses across all industries.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What is Google Ads?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://ads.google.com/home/\">Google Ads</a> is a paid advertising platform that falls under a marketing channel known as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\">pay-per-click (PPC)</a>, where you (the advertiser) pays per click or per impression (CPM) on an ad.</p> \n<p>Google Ads is an effective way to drive qualified traffic, or good-fit customers, to your business while they're searching for products and services like the ones you offer. With Google Ads, you can boost your website traffic, receive more phone calls, and increase your in-store visits.</p> \n<p>Google Ads allows you to create and share well-timed ads (via both mobile and desktop) among your target audience. This means your business will show up on the search engine results page (SERP) at the moment your ideal customers are looking for products and services like yours via Google Search or Google Maps. This way, you reach your target audience when it makes sense for them to come across your ad.</p> \n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Ads from the platform can span across other channels too, including YouTube, Blogger, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-display-network\">Google Display Network</a>.</p> \n<p>Over time, Google Ads will also help you analyze and improve those ads to reach <em>more</em> people so your business can hit all of your paid campaign goals<i>.</i></p> \n<p><i><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/ads?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>Discover how HubSpot can help you better manage your Google ads.</em></a></i></p> \n<p>Additionally, no matter the size of your business or your available resources, you can tailor your ads to suit your budget. The Google Ads tool gives you the opportunity to stay within your monthly cap and even pause or stop your ad spending at any point in time.</p> \n<p>Now, onto another important question: Is Google Ads <em>really</em> effective? To answer this, let‚Äôs consider a few statistics:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Google Ads have a click-through rate of nearly 8%.</li> \n <li>Display ads yield 180 million impressions each month.</li> \n <li>For users who are ready to buy, paid ads on Google get 65% of the clicks.</li> \n <li>43% of customers buy something they‚Äôve seen on a YouTube ad.</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Why advertise on Google?</h3> \n<p>Google is the most used search engine, receiving over <a href=\"http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/\">5 billion search queries</a> a day. Not to mention, the Google Ads platform has been around for nearly two decades, giving it some seniority in the area of paid advertising.</p> \n<p>Google is a resource used by people around the world to ask questions that are answered with a combination of paid advertisements and organic results.</p> \n<p>And, according to <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/economicimpact.google.com/en//static/reports/2016/ei-report-2016.pdf\">Google</a>, advertisers make $8 for every $1 they spend on Google Ads. So, there are a few reasons why you‚Äôd want to consider advertising on Google.</p> \n<p>Need another reason? Your competitors are using Google Ads (and they might even be bidding on your branded terms). <a href=\"https://idatalabs.com/tech/products/adwords\">Hundreds of thousands</a> of companies use Google Ads to promote their businesses, which means that <strong>even if you‚Äôre ranking organically for a search term, your results are being pushed down the page, beneath your competitors</strong>.</p> \n<p>If you‚Äôre using PPC to advertise your product or services, Google Ads should be a part of your paid strategy ‚Äî there‚Äôs no way around it (except maybe <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing/facebook-lead-ads\">Facebook Ads</a>, but that‚Äôs another article).</p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Google Ads Best Practices</h2> \n<p>If you‚Äôve tried unsuccessfully to advertise on Google, don‚Äôt give up. There are many reasons why your Google Ads could be underperforming. Let‚Äôs cover some common Google Ads best practices.</p> \n<h3>1. Avoid broad keyword terms.</h3> \n<p>You really need to nail it when it comes to your keywords, which is why testing and tweaking should be a part of your strategy. If your keywords are too broad, Google will be placing your ad in front of the wrong audience which means fewer clicks and a higher ad spend.</p> \n<p>Review what‚Äôs working (i.e. which keywords are generating clicks) and adjust them to best match your ads with your target audience. You likely won‚Äôt get the mix right the first time, but you should keep adding, removing, and tweaking keywords until you do.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip</strong><strong>: </strong>Review the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc#keyword-strategy\">keyword strategies that we cover below</a>.</p> \n<h3>2. Don't run irrelevant ads.</h3> \n<p>If your ad doesn‚Äôt match the searcher‚Äôs intent, you won‚Äôt get enough clicks to justify your ad spend. Your headline and ad copy need to match the keywords you‚Äôre bidding on, <em>and</em> the solution your ad is marketing needs to solve whatever pain point that searcher is experiencing.</p> \n<p>It‚Äôs a combination that will yield the results you‚Äôre looking for, and it may just be a few tweaks away. You have the option to create multiple ads per campaign ‚Äî use this feature to split test which ads work best. Or, better yet, use Google‚Äôs <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7684791?hl=en\">Responsive Search Ads</a> feature.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Read our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc#ad-copy\">best practices for ad copy</a>.</p> \n<h3>3. Improve your Quality Score (QS).</h3> \n<p>Your Quality Score (QS) is how Google determines how your ad should rank. The higher your rank, the better your placements. If your quality score is low, you‚Äôll have fewer eyeballs on your ad and fewer chances to convert. Google will tell you your Quality Score, but improving it is up to you.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep reading to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc#quality-score\">learn how to improve your QS</a>.<em><br /></em></p> \n<h3>4. Optimize your ad landing page.</h3> \n<p>Your efforts shouldn‚Äôt stop with your ad ‚Äî the user experience <em>after</em> a click is equally important.</p> \n<p>What does your user see once they click your ad? Is your landing page optimized for conversions, meaning does it use the same keywords? Does the page solve your user‚Äôs pain point or answer their question? Your user should experience a seamless transition through to the conversion.</p> \n<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Review <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-best-practices\">landing page best practices</a> and implement them to increase your conversion rate.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>These common terms will help you set up, manage, and optimize your Google Ads. Some of these are specific to Google Ads, while others are related to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\">PPC</a> in general. Either way, you‚Äôll need to know these to run an effective ad campaign.</p> \n<h3>1. AdRank</h3> \n<p>Your AdRank determines your ad placement. The higher the value, the better you‚Äôll rank, the more eyes will fall on your ad, and the higher the probability that users will click your ad. Your AdRank is determined by your maximum bid multiplied by your Quality Score.</p> \n<h3>2. Bidding</h3> \n<p>Google Ads is based on a bidding system, where you as the advertiser selects a maximum bid amount you‚Äôre willing to pay for a click on your ad. The higher your bid, the better your placement. You have three options for bidding: CPC, CPM, or CPE.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>CPC</strong>, or cost-per-click, is the amount you pay for each click on your ad.</li> \n <li><strong>CPM</strong>, or cost per mille, is the amount you pay for one thousand ad impressions, that is when your ad is shown to a thousand people.</li> \n <li><strong>CPE</strong>, or cost per engagement, is the amount you pay when someone takes a predetermined action with your ad.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>And, yes, we‚Äôll review <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc#bidding-strategy\">bidding strategies below</a>.</p> \n<h3>3. Campaign Type</h3> \n<p>Before you begin a paid campaign on Google Ads, you‚Äôll select between one of three campaign types: search, display, or video.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Search ads</strong> are text ads that are displayed among search results on a Google results page.</li> \n <li><strong>Display ads</strong> are typically image-based and are shown on web pages within the Google Display Network.</li> \n <li><strong>Video ads</strong> are between six and 15 seconds and appear on YouTube.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Click-Through Rate (CTR)</h3> \n<p>Your CTR is the number of clicks you get on your ad as a proportion of the number of views your ad gets. A higher CTR indicates a quality ad that matches search intent and targets relevant keywords.</p> \n<h3>5. Conversion Rate (CVR)</h3> \n<p>CVR is a measure of form submissions as a proportion of total visits to your landing page. Simplistically speaking, a high CVR means that your landing page presents a seamless user experience that matches the promise of the ad.</p> \n<h3>6. Display Network</h3> \n<p>Google ads can be displayed on either search results pages or a web page within <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2404190?hl=en\">Google‚Äôs Display Network (GDN)</a>. GDN is a network of websites that allow space on their webpages for Google Ads ‚Äî these ads can be text-based or image ads and are displayed alongside content relevant to your target keywords. The most popular Display Ad options are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-shopping\">Google Shopping</a> and app campaigns.</p> \n<h3>7. Extensions</h3> \n<p>Ad Extensions allow you to supplement your ad with additional information at no additional cost. These extensions fall under one of five categories: Sitelink, Call, Location, Offer, or App; <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc#ad-extensions\">we‚Äôll cover each of these ad extensions below</a>.</p> \n<h3>8. Keywords</h3> \n<p>When a Google user types a query into the search field, Google returns a range of results that match the searcher‚Äôs intent. Keywords are words or phrases that align with what a searcher wants and will satisfy their query. You select keywords based on which queries you want to display your ad alongside. For example, a searcher that types ‚Äúhow to clean gum off shoes‚Äù will see results for advertisers that targeted keywords like ‚Äúgum on shoes‚Äù and ‚Äúclean shoes.‚Äù</p> \n<strong>Negative keywords</strong> are a list of keyword terms that you do \n<em>not</em> want to rank for. Google will pull you from the bid on these keywords. Typically, these are semi-related to your intended search terms but fall outside of the realm of what you offer or want to rank for. \n<br> <h3>9. PPC</h3> <p>Pay-per-click, or PPC, is a type of advertising where the advertiser pays per click on an ad. PPC is not specific to Google Ads, but it is the most common type of paid campaign. It‚Äôs important to understand the ins and outs of PPC before launching your first Google Ads campaign.</p> <h3>10. Quality Score (QS)</h3> <p>Your Quality Score measures the quality of your ad by your click-through rate (CTR), the relevance of your keywords, the quality of your landing page, and your past performance on the SERP. QS is a determining factor in your AdRank.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/google-adwords-ppc?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Click to get our free guide on how to use Google Ads.</a></em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/google-adwords-ppc\"></a></p> <a></a> <h2>How does Google Ads work?</h2> <p>Google Ads displays your ad to potential leads or customers who are interested in your product or service. Advertisers bid on search terms, or keywords, and the winners of that bid are placed at the top of search results pages, on YouTube videos, or on relevant websites, depending on the type of ad campaign selected.</p> <p>Many factors impact your ability to create effective and high-performing Google Ads. Let‚Äôs cover them below, plus some Google Ads examples.</p> <a></a> <h3>AdRank and Quality Score</h3> <p>AdRank determines the placement of your ads, and Quality Score is one of the two factors (the other being bid amount) that determines your AdRank. Remember, your Quality Score is based on the quality and relevance of your ad, and Google measures that by how many people click on your ad when it‚Äôs displayed ‚Äî i.e. your CTR. You CTR depends on the how well your ad matches searcher intent, which you can deduce from three areas:</p> \n <ol> \n  <li>The relevance of your keywords</li> \n  <li>If your ad copy and CTA deliver what the searcher expects based on their search</li> \n  <li>The user experience of your landing page</li> \n </ol> <p>Your QS is where you should focus most of your attention when you first set up your Google Ad campaign ‚Äî even before you increase your bid amount. The higher your QS, the lower your acquisition costs will be and the better placement you‚Äôll get.</p> <h3>Location</h3> <p>When you first set up your Google Ad, you‚Äôll select a geographical area where your ad will be shown. If you have a storefront, this should be in a reasonable radius around your physical location. If you have an ecommerce store and a physical product, your location should be set in the places where you ship. If you provide a service or product that is accessible worldwide, then the sky's the limit.</p> <p>Your location settings will play a role in placement. For instance, if you own a yoga studio in San Francisco, someone in New York that enters ‚Äúyoga studio‚Äù will not see your result, no matter your AdRank. That‚Äôs because Google‚Äôs main objective is to display the most relevant results to searchers, even when you‚Äôre paying.</p> <a></a> <h3>Keywords</h3> <p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht\">Keyword research</a> is just as important for paid ads as it is for organic search. Your keywords need to match searcher intent as much as possible. That‚Äôs because Google matches your ad with search queries based on the keywords you selected.</p> <p>Each ad group that you create within your campaign will target a small set of keywords (one to five keywords is optimal) and Google will display your ad based on those selections.</p> <h4>Match Types</h4> <p>Match Types give you a little wiggle room when it comes to your keyword selections ‚Äî they tell Google whether you want to match a search query exactly or if your ad should be shown to anyone with a search query that‚Äôs semi-related. There are four match types to choose from:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Broad Match</strong> is the default setting that uses any word within your keyword phrase in any order. For example, ‚Äúgoat yoga in Oakland‚Äù will match ‚Äúgoat yoga‚Äù or ‚Äúyoga Oakland.‚Äù</li> \n  <li><strong>Modified Broad Match</strong> allows you to lock in certain words within a keyword phrase by denoting them with a ‚Äú+‚Äù sign. Your matches will include that locked-in word at the very least. For example, ‚Äú+goats yoga in Oakland‚Äù could yield ‚Äúgoats,‚Äù ‚Äúgoats like food,‚Äù or ‚Äúgoats and yoga.‚Äù</li> \n  <li><strong>Phrase Match</strong> will match with queries that include your keyword phrase in the exact order but may include additional words before or after it. For example, ‚Äúgoat yoga‚Äù can yield ‚Äúspotted goat yoga‚Äù or ‚Äúgoat yoga with puppies.‚Äù</li> \n  <li><strong>Exact Match</strong> maintains your keyword phrase as it is written in the exact order. For example, ‚Äúgoat yoga‚Äù will not show up if someone types ‚Äúgoats yoga‚Äù or ‚Äúgoat yoga class.‚Äù</li> \n </ul> <p>If you‚Äôre just starting out and don‚Äôt know exactly how your persona will be searching, move from a broad match to a more narrow approach so you can test which queries yield the best results. However, since your ad will be ranking for many queries (some unrelated) you should keep a close eye on your ads and modify them as you can gain new information.</p> <a></a> <h3>Headline and Description</h3> <p>Your ad copy can be the difference between a click on your ad and a click on your competitor‚Äôs ad. It‚Äôs important that your ad copy matches the searcher‚Äôs intent, is aligned with your target keywords, and addresses the personas pain point with a clear solution.</p> <p>To illustrate what we mean, let‚Äôs review an example.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/baby%20swim%20lessons%20-%20Google%20Search%202019-03-02%2011-17-04.png?width=1500&amp;name=baby%20swim%20lessons%20-%20Google%20Search%202019-03-02%2011-17-04.png\" alt=\"google ads copy and headline\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>A search for ‚Äúbaby swim lessons‚Äù yielded this result. The copy is concise and uses the limited space wisely to convey their message and connect with their target audience.</p> <p>The Swim Revolution knew to put the keyword in their headline so we instantly know that this ad matches what we‚Äôre looking for. The description tells us why this is the best option for swim lessons because it addresses the concerns of their persona ‚Äî a parent looking to enroll their baby in a swim class.</p> <p>They use words like ‚Äúskills,‚Äù ‚Äúfun,‚Äù ‚Äúconfidence,‚Äù and ‚Äúcomfort in the water‚Äù to ease our nerves about putting a baby in a pool and to prove to us that we will get what we want out of this class ‚Äî an infant that can swim.</p> <p>This kind of ad copy will get you clicks, but conversions will result from carrying this level of intention into your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-best-practices\">landing page copy</a>.</p> <a></a> <h3>Ad Extensions</h3> <p>If you‚Äôre running Google Ads, you should be using Ad Extensions for two reasons: they‚Äôre free, and they give users additional information and another reason to interact with your ad. These extensions fall within one of these five categories:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Sitelink Extensions</strong> extend your add ‚Äî helping you stand out ‚Äî and provide additional links to your site that offer users more enticing reasons to click.<br><br><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-02-28%20at%202.26.34%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-02-28%20at%202.26.34%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads sitelink extensions\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></br></br></li> \n  <li><strong>Call Extensions</strong> allow you to incorporate your phone number in your ad so users have an additional (and instant) way to reach out to you. If you have a customer service team that is ready to engage and convert your audience, then include your phone number.<br><br><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-02-28%20at%202.29.00%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-02-28%20at%202.29.00%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads call extensions\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></br></br></li> \n  <li><strong>Location Extensions</strong> include your location and phone number within your ad so Google can offer searchers a map to easily find you. This option is great for businesses with a storefront and it works well for the search query ‚Äú...near me.‚Äù<br><br><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-02-28%20at%202.30.27%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-02-28%20at%202.30.27%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads location extensions\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></br></br></li> \n  <li><strong>Offer Extensions</strong> work if you‚Äôre running a current promotion. It can entice users to click your ad over others if they see that your options are discounted compared to your competitors.<br><br><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-02-28%20at%202.33.13%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-02-28%20at%202.33.13%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads offer extensions\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></br></br></li> \n  <li><strong>App Extensions</strong> provide a link to an app download for mobile users. This reduces the friction from having to perform a new search to find and download the app in an AppStore.<br><br><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_2202.PNG%202019-03-02%2011-41-54-2.png?width=500&amp;name=IMG_2202.PNG%202019-03-02%2011-41-54-2.png\" alt=\"google ads app extensions\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></br></br></li> \n </ul> <h3>Google Ads Retargeting</h3> <p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/retargeting-ideas\">Retargeting</a> (or remarketing) in Google Ads is a way to advertise to users who have previously interacted with you online but have not yet converted. Tracking cookies will follow users around the web and target these users with your ads. Remarketing is effective since prospects need to see your marketing at least seven times before they become a customer.</p> <a></a> <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"></span></p> <p>You can select from one of five campaign types on Google Ads. Let‚Äôs cover the optimal uses for each and why you might choose one over the other.</p> <h3>1. Search Ad Campaigns</h3> <p>Search ads are text ads that are displayed on Google results pages. As an example, a search for ‚Äúpocket squares‚Äù returns sponsored results:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.42.25%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.42.25%20PM.png\" alt=\"types of google ads search ads campaigns\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>The benefit of search ads is that you‚Äôre displaying your ad in the place where most searchers look for information first ‚Äî on Google. And Google shows your ad in the same format as other results (except for denoting it as an ‚ÄúAd‚Äù) so users are accustomed to seeing and clicking on results.</p> <h4><strong>Responsive Search Ads</strong></h4> <p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7684791?hl=en\">Responsive search ads</a> allow you to enter multiple versions of headlines and ad copy (15 and four variations, respectively) for Google to select the best performers to display to users. With traditional ads, create one static version of your ad, using the same headline and description each time.</p> <p>Responsive ads allow for a dynamic ad that is auto-tested until you arrive at the version that is best suited for your target audience ‚Äî for Google, that means until you get the most clicks.</p> <h3>2. Display Ad Campaigns</h3> <p>Google has a network of websites in various industries and with an array of audiences that opt in to display Google Ads, known as the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2404190?hl=en-GB\">Google Display Network</a>. The benefit to the website owner is that they‚Äôre paid per click or impression on the ads. The benefit to advertisers is that they can get their content in front of audiences that are aligned with their personas.</p> <p>These are typically image ads that draw users attention away from the content on the webpage:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-02-27%20at%207.30.46%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-02-27%20at%207.30.46%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads display ad\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://alittlebitoflacquer.blogspot.com/\" style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><em>Source</em></a></p> <h3>3. Video Ad Campaigns</h3> <p>Video ads are displayed before or after (and sometimes in the middle of) <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-video-advertising-guide\">YouTube videos</a>. Remember, YouTube is a search engine, too. The right keywords will place you in front of a video, disrupting the user‚Äôs behavior just enough to grab their attention.</p> <p>Here's a video advertisement that pops up in the middle of another video on how to tie a tie:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-15%20at%204.19.59%20PM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-15%20at%204.19.59%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads video ads youtube\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-video-advertising-guide\"><em>Source</em></a></p> <h3>4. App Ad Campaigns</h3> <p><a href=\"https://ads.google.com/home/campaigns/app-ads/\">Google App Campaigns</a> promote your mobile application through an ad displayed on Google Search Network, YouTube, Google Play, Google Display Network, and more. You can run ads that encourage your audience to install your app or, if they already use it, to take a certain action within your app.</p> <p>Unlike other ad types, you don't design an App ad campaign. Instead, provide Google with your app's information and audience, and place a bid. Google does the rest to get your app in front of the right eyes:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.38.58%20PM-1.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.38.58%20PM-1.png\" alt=\"types of google ads app ads campaigns\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://marketingland.com/search-ads-in-google-play-store-go-live-globally-136919\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source</span></em></a></p> <h3>5. Shopping Ad Campaigns</h3> <p>Another type of Google Ad is Google Shopping Ad Campaigns. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-shopping\">Shopping campaigns</a>, like these other types of ads, are displayed on SERPs and include detailed product information such as price and product imagery. You can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/2660968?hl=en\">run a Shopping campaign</a> through Google Merchant Center, where you input specific product information that Google pulls from to create your shopping ads.</p> <p>Instead of marketing your brand as a whole, Shopping Ads allow you to promote specific products and product lines. That's why, when you search for a particular product on Google, you'll see ads for different brands pop up along the top and/or side. This is what I see when I search \"running shoes.\" The ads at the top are Google Search ads, but the specific products advertised on the side are Shopping ads optimized for the keyword \"running shoes\":</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.49.19%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.49.19%20PM.png\" alt=\"types of google ads google shopping ads\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <a></a> <h2>How to Use and Create Google Ads</h2> <p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33283/a-simple-guide-for-setting-up-your-first-google-adwords-campaign.aspx\">Setting up your paid campaigns</a> on Google is relatively easy (and quick), mostly because the platform takes you through the setup and provides helpful hints along the way. Once you visit the <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/\">Google Ads site</a> and click ‚ÄúStart Now,‚Äù you‚Äôll be taken through a series of steps to get your ads up and running. If you have your ad copy and/or images created, set up should take you no more than 10 minutes.</p> <p>What may be less obvious are all the additional things you need to do to make sure your ads are optimally set up and easily trackable. Let‚Äôs cover these together. These are the steps you‚Äôll take once your ads are submitted for review.</p> <h3>1. Link Google Analytics.</h3> <p>You likely have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-install-google-analytics-tracking-code-website-ht\">Google Analytics set up on your website</a> so you can track traffic, conversions, goals, and any unique metrics. You also need to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6209127?hl=en\">link your Analytics account to Google Ads</a>. Linking these accounts will make tracking, analyzing, and reporting between channels and campaigns much easier because you can view these events in one place.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.55.29%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.55.29%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads link google analytics\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <h3>2. Add UTM codes.</h3> <p>Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) codes are used by Google to track any activity associated with a specific link. You‚Äôve probably seen them before ‚Äî it‚Äôs the part of a URL that follows a question mark (‚Äú?‚Äù). UTM codes will tell you which offer or ad led to a conversion so you can track the most effective parts of your campaign. UTM codes make it easier to optimize your Google Ads since you know exactly what‚Äôs working.</p> <p>The trick, though, is to <a href=\"https://adespresso.com/guides/google-ads-beginners/account-setup/\">add your UTM codes at the campaign level</a> when you set up your Google Ads so you don‚Äôt have to do so manually for each ad URL. Otherwise, you can add them manually with <a href=\"https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/\">Google‚Äôs UTM builder</a>.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.56.02%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.56.02%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads set up utm codes google campaign url builder\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <h3>3. Set up conversion tracking.</h3> <p>Conversion tracking tells you exactly how many customers or leads you‚Äôve acquired from your ad campaigns. It‚Äôs not mandatory to set up but, without it, you‚Äôll be guessing the ROI of your ads. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722054?hl=en\">Conversion tracking</a> allows you to track sales (or other activities) on your website, app installs, or calls from your ads.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.56.55%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.56.55%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads conversion tracking\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/template-managing-and-organizing-google-adwords-campaigns?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Manage and organize your ads with our free Google Ads Kit and Templates</a>.</em></p> <h3>4. Integrate your Google Ads with your CRM.</h3> <p>There is something to be said about keeping all of your data in one place where you can track, analyze, and report on it. You already use your CRM to track contact data and lead flows. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/google-ads\">Integrating Google Ads with your CRM</a> gives you the ability to track which ad campaigns are working for your audience so you can continue marketing to them with offers that are relevant.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.57.54%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-17%20at%201.57.54%20PM.png\" alt=\"google ads integration hubspot crm\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/advertising/google-ads\"><em>Source</em></a></p> <a></a> <h2>Google Ads Bidding Strategies</h2> <p>Once you‚Äôve set up your ad campaigns and have tracking in place, it‚Äôs time to start bidding. Remember, your ability to rank in Google Ads depends on how you bid. While your bid amount will depend on your budget and goals, there are a few strategies and bid settings you should be aware of when launching your paid campaign.</p> <h3>Automated vs. Manual Bidding</h3> <p>You have two options when it comes to bidding on your keywords ‚Äî automated and manual. Here‚Äôs how they work:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Automated Bidding</strong> puts Google in the driver‚Äôs seat and allows the platform to adjust your bid based on your competitors. You can still set a maximum budget, and Google will work within a range to give you the best chance at winning the bid within those constraints.</li> \n  <li><strong>Manual Bidding</strong> let‚Äôs you set the bid amounts for your ad groups and keywords, giving you the chance to reduce spending on low-performing ads.</li> \n </ul> <h3>Bidding on Branded Search Terms</h3> <p>Branded terms are those with your company or unique product name in them, like ‚ÄúHubSpot CRM.‚Äù There is much debate on whether to bid on your branded terms or not. On one side of the debate, bidding on terms that will likely yield organic results could be seen as a waste of money.</p> <p>On the other side, bidding on these terms gives you domain over these search results pages and helps you convert prospects that are further along the flywheel. For instance, if I‚Äôve been doing research on live chat tools and am heavily considering <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/live-chat\">HubSpot‚Äôs Live Chat</a>, then a simple search for ‚ÄúHubSpot live chat software‚Äù will yield exactly the result I‚Äôm looking for without the effort of scrolling.</p> <p>The other argument in favor of bidding on your branded terms is that competitors may bid on them if you don‚Äôt, thereby taking up valuable real estate that should belong to you.</p> <h3>Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)</h3> <p>If the idea of spending money to convert prospects into leads makes you uneasy, then you can set a CPA instead and only pay when a user converts into a customer. While this bidding strategy could cost more, you can take comfort in knowing that you only pay when you acquire a paying customer. This strategy makes it easy to track and justify your ad spend.</p> <h2>Additional Resources to Optimize Your Google Ads</h2> <p>Your ad copy and headline is not the only component that will make your paid campaign successful. Getting a user to click is only the beginning ‚Ä¶ they should arrive on a landing page that‚Äôs optimized for conversion and then be taken to a <em>Thank You</em> page that tells them what to do next.</p> <p>If you want your Google Ads to produce qualified leads and customers, then check out these additional resources and use them as guidelines as you set up your Google Ads campaign.</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-best-practices\">Landing Page Best Practices</a> will teach you how to set up a landing page that‚Äôs prime for conversions so you don‚Äôt waste those precious clicks.</li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30650/the-anatomy-of-conversion-optimized-thank-you-pages.aspx\">Optimized ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù Pages</a> shows you what to do with your new lead post-conversion, how to keep them on your site, and ways to maintain their attention.</li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/enhanced-campaigns-how-to-create-mobile-ads-in-adwords\">Tips for Mobile Google Ads</a> teaches you the key differences between desktop and mobile ads and how to optimize both.</li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-ads-cost\">Optimizing Google Ads Costs</a> will show you how we, at HubSpot, maximize our Google Ads spend to get the best ROI.</li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/build-the-best-google-adwords-campaign\">Quality Google Ads Examples That Convert</a> shares examples of Google advertising campaigns that got it right.</li> \n </ul> <h2>Start Your Campaign</h2> <p>Given its reach and authority, Google Ads should be a part of your paid strategy.

That's the dream, right?</p> \n<p>While we don't live in a perfect world, we do live in a world where inbound marketing and account-based marketing (ABM) exist. And, when these two strategies work together, this dream can become a reality.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>You may be pretty familiar with <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing?_ga=2.69531664.1432473745.1588546996-940436819.1565181751\">inbound marketing</a> ‚Äî creating content that attracts, converts, and delights customers.</p> \n<p>You may also know a thing or two about account-based marketing: aligning marketing and sales to deliver a consistent, personalized buying experience for prospects. But, because of their definitions, perhaps you think you have to choose between the two.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, you don't have to choose. In fact, instead of thinking \"ABM <em>versus</em> inbound,\" you should be thinking \"ABM <em>and</em> inbound.\"</p> \n<p>To clarify, let's define the two and offer some tactics around how to work these strategies into your existing marketing campaign.</p>  \n<h2>What is account-based marketing?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-guide?_ga=2.69531664.1432473745.1588546996-940436819.1565181751\">Account-based marketing</a> is a highly-targeted, focused growth strategy. It works by aligning marketing and sales functions to create a personalized experience for accounts, rather than an individual buyer.</p> \n<p>Instead of treating each of those buyers as an individual entity, ABM is a strategy that says, <em>\"Let's make sure we plan how to market and sell to all of those buyers as one account.\"</em></p> \n<p>This starts with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tried-and-true-sales-marketing-alignment\">aligning Sales and Marketing</a> to mutually choose a select set of accounts. Then, together they create marketing and sales strategies that target each account. This saves time for marketing and sales and delivers a far more consistent buying experience for the customers within each account.</p> \n<p>Businesses that are typically a good fit for using an ABM strategy are those that sell high-value products or services to other businesses, like B2Bs.</p> \n<p>The alignment of Sales and Marketing when using an ABM strategy helps you make more streamlined business decisions. It eliminates the time you would spend trying to sort out the best accounts to target, and instead, speeds up the process of delighting those prospects.</p> \n<p>ABM treats accounts as if they're individual buyers, and because of this, you'll be able to delight the key decision-makers with a personalized content strategy.</p> \n<p>So, ABM is a go-to strategy for shortening sales cycles, increasing ROI, and effectively selling to your highest value accounts in the way they each prefer to buy ‚Äî but how is it comparable to inbound marketing? Let's talk about that next.</p> \n<h2>Account-Based Marketing and Inbound Marketing</h2> \n<p>ABM allows you to delight high-value accounts with a focused approach. Inbound marketing lets you attract customers through the creation of valuable, SEO-optimized content ‚Äî it provides audiences with the information that's important to them in an organic manner.</p> \n<p>But what do they have in common?</p> \n<p>Both strategies require a deep understanding of your target buyer to inform what type of content you're creating &amp; how you choose to deliver it. This increases discoverability by that target.</p> \n<p>According to HubSpot's ABM Product Marketer, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-batter-10855537/\">Ryan Batter</a>, \"Every growth story begins with the same foundational elements of inbound marketing ‚Äî building great content, crafting a publishing strategy, optimizing search presence to enable discovery of your brand and generate leads.\"</p> \n<p>You can repurpose content and use the same channels for ABM as you've already put into place with inbound. ABM is often just taking that foundational content and personalizing it even more.</p> \n<p>Both inbound and ABM are focused on delivering a great buying experience across the entire flywheel. ABM helps accelerate the flywheel once inbound foundation is in place.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Additionally, the two strategies focus on targeted, personalized content. ABM hones in on delighting the right customers through content that is specifically created to cater to their challenges, an essential function of inbound marketing.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Finally, the two help with the happiness and retention of your customers. Because an ABM strategy focuses on a set of specific accounts, you'll have more opportunity to focus on the happiness and retention of those clients, which is another essential part of the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel\">inbound marketing flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p>That's not all, though ‚Äî you can also use the two in a partnership to elevate your entire strategy.</p> \n<p>\"For some stories, companies benefit immensely by complementing their inbound foundation with account-based strategies that provide more personalized, tailored buying experiences for a subset of high-value leads,\" Batter says.</p> \n<p>Put another way: inbound marketing helps you attract the right customers. Then, account-based marketing uses marketing and sales to speed up the process of the flywheel and provide a valuable customer experience. In the end, both strategies enable you to win those target accounts.</p> \n<p>It's critical you approach your account-based marketing, the inbound way: provide valuable content and customer experiences to those high-value accounts.</p> \n<p>Using the two together helps you offer a more robust strategy. Plus, software, like the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">HubSpot CMS</a>, allows you to experiment with the creation of campaigns that align with your businesses' goals.</p> \n<h2>How to Do Account-Based Marketing</h2> \n<p>To ensure you keep customers at the center of your account-based marketing strategy, stick to the principles. Make your account-based marketing strategy center around tailoring the way you communicate with your target company.</p> \n<p>There are five primary stages to account-based marketing that work hand-in-hand with inbound marketing. Let‚Äôs walk through each and detail how you can conduct ABM in a human-friendly way.</p> \n<h3>1. Identify</h3> \n<p>Account-based marketing begins with sales and marketing identifying and selecting relevant accounts. When beginning this selection process, data, such as company size, number of employees, location, and annual revenue, can give you an understanding of accounts you may want to target.</p> \n<p>Similar to inbound marketing, you can also use <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona\">buyer personas</a> to understand the day-to-day lives and challenges of your target buyers, then determine content and channels to approach them.</p> \n<h3>2. Expand</h3> \n<p>In sales where ABM is typically used, buying decisions are generally made by numerous individuals within a company. ABM helps establish a relationship with each potential buyer and engages them in the purchase decision.</p> \n<p>At the expand stage, creating unique, company-specific content that interests each potential buyer within the organization is important. Whether your product is for marketers, operations leaders, or anyone else, ensuring that you identify and engage with everyone in the buying decision is crucial to winning a customer.</p> \n<p>Consider the challenges each of your stakeholders faces in order to create compelling content. For example, Finance may be concerned with pricing, while Operations might be focused on user access, ease of use, and security. With this context, you can create targeted content and interactions that match each individual's concerns and challenges.</p> \n<h3>3. Engage</h3> \n<p>Here‚Äôs where sales and marketing come together and join the party to engage with stakeholders across various channels. For example, if one of your stakeholders prefers email, then equipping salespeople to reach out to that person with a helpful and relevant message can get a conversation started. This stage is largely about developing relationships with and getting to know all the buyers who will make the final decision.</p> \n<h3>4. Advocate</h3> \n<p>Next, you want to nurture bonds with a few stakeholders who can serve as advocates within the organization. The modern buyer can tune out information they don‚Äôt want to hear. So it‚Äôs up to both marketing and sales here to provide value ‚Äî and talk about the product when and where necessary.</p> \n<h3>5. Measure</h3> \n<p>Finally, reporting at the account level can give you data on what's working, what's not, and how to improve over time. With <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/abm-software\">HubSpot ABM software</a>, you can report on company growth, revenue, job titles, engagement levels, and much more ‚Äî all at the account level.</p> \n<p>For more information about how to align ABM with inbound, as well as some tactics for stellar account-based marketing tactics, be sure to check out this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-guide?_ga=2.132102159.1432473745.1588546996-940436819.1565181751\">ultimate guide.</a></p> \n<p>If you're a company that sells into a smaller addressable market and has its sights on a handful of highly critical accounts, you can learn more about <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/can-account-based-marketing-and-inbound-marketing-co-exist-webinar?_ga=2.208636694.546617602.1588269536-940436819.1565181751\">building an ABM strategy without abandoning your inbound philosophy in this webinar.</a></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faccount-based-marketing-vs-inbound-marketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 20:06:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2c8ba48b599af129787cd10fdb721932","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faccount-based-marketing-vs-inbound-marketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn48@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-52-503_f175d0116c8dab2a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389713},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"36 Account-Based Marketing Stats to Know in 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-stats","description":"<p>As marketers, we've become experts in our target audiences.

For instance, you might optimize your posting times to ensure maximum engagement, partner with an influencer to spread awareness, or designate a content creator to craft more compelling content.</p> \n<p>Additionally, to delight your current followers and attract new visitors to your page, you might consider hosting an Instagram giveaway.</p> \n<p>Simply put, an Instagram giveaway allows you to offer something for free in exchange for an Instagram like, comment, or other pre-determined requirement.</p> \n<p>For instance, take a look at this giveaway from Fabletics:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/7%20Tips%20for%20Running%20Engaging%20Instagram%20Giveaways,%20Plus%20Examples%20and%20Ideas-1.png?width=600&amp;name=7%20Tips%20for%20Running%20Engaging%20Instagram%20Giveaways,%20Plus%20Examples%20and%20Ideas-1.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Fabletics hosts an Instagram giveaway.\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcz55frHurn/?taken-by=fabletics\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>There are a few reasons why this giveaway works -- first, Fabletics partnered with Blissworld, which enables both businesses to reach the other brand's audience. Second, Fabletics asked viewers to \"tag your bestie\" and follow both brands. This doubles the reach they might've had if they'd only asked one follower to comment.</p> \n<p>When done correctly, giveaways can help you establish your brand on Instagram, cultivate a loyal following, and share your impressive products or services with a larger audience than you could organically.</p> \n<p>Here, we've created a complete guide on how to run your own giveaway, to ensure you're able to delight and engage both new and existing followers on Instagram.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Choose the prize for your giveaway.</h3> \n<p>The first thing you'll want to do is decide on the product, service, or experience you'll giveaway as your prize. This will vary depending on your goal -- if you want to spread awareness around a product launch, for instance, you'll likely want to giveaway that specific product as your prize.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, perhaps you want to partner with a brand and create a unique prize that will appeal to each of your audiences.</p> \n<p>Lastly, you might try offering an experience instead of a specific product or service -- like a weekend trip, a spa day, or the chance to meet a leader in your industry.</p> \n<h3>2. Determine the entry-criteria for your contest.</h3> \n<p>Your entry-criteria depends, again, on your ultimate goal. For instance, if you simply want to spread brand awareness, you might ask each participant to like your post and comment with the name of a friend -- this allows you to increase your reach quickly, and could result in new followers.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, maybe you want to draw attention to your blog, or another page on your website. If this is the case, you might ask participants to go to your blog or web page to find entry-criteria there -- such as a question you then want them to answer in your Instagram comments section.</p> \n<p>Lastly, perhaps you've partnered with a brand and, in exchange for one of their products as a prize, they've asked you to include a request to follow <em>their </em>brand as part of your entry-criteria.</p> \n<h3>3. Decide on a goal for your Instagram contest.</h3> \n<p>By determining a specific goal, you're able to tailor your strategy more specifically and keep track of whether or not your giveaway was successful.</p> \n<p>Your goal might be an increase in website traffic, more followers, an increase in engagement, or a boost in sales -- it's to you to choose what makes the most sense for your brand.</p> \n<h3>4. Consider a brand partnership.</h3> \n<p>To explore the benefits of brand partnerships for Instagram giveaways, I spoke with Conor Janda, an Associate Manager of Marketing Partnerships at <a href=\"https://chomps.com/\">Chomps</a>. He told me, \"A giveaway is a nice way to align with peer brands and partners, and drive traffic to your account.\"</p> \n<p>Janda also mentioned giveaways are particularly successful when new brands partner together. \"For instance, a brand might post a recipe, and then mention specific brands in the ingredients section,\" he told me. \"A successful giveaway is typically when a brand partners with a content creator or influencer to make something specific, and then they push that prize out through both of their channels.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a giveaway could allow you to reach a similar brand's followers, and vice-versa -- a win, win.</p> \n<h3>5. Select a campaign hashtag.</h3> \n<p>On Instagram, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-hashtags?_ga=2.119948040.1808936424.1555102735-644648569.1551722047\">hashtags help your content surface</a> on Explore channels, and oftentimes increase visibility on the platform. Consider creating a compelling and unique campaign hashtag to help spread awareness of your giveaway. For instance, along with #giveaway, you might include #winitwednesday #[yourbrand]giveaway #[yourbrand]contest, or something of similar nature.</p> \n<h3>6. Put a time-limit on your contest.</h3> \n<p>Tell your participants how long they have to complete your requirements by putting a time limit in your caption, and then adding \"Giveaway Closed\" at the end of that time. For instance, you might put, \"Giveaway! Over the next 24 hours, please tag a friend in the comments and include your favorite place to travel for a chance to stay overnight at one of our resorts.\"</p> \n<p>The time-limit will ideally create a sense of urgency, and incentivize followers to engage with your post more quickly -- which will also help your giveaway stay at the top of your followers' Instagram feeds.</p> \n<h3>7. Launch and promote your Instagram contest.</h3> \n<p>Once you've chosen your prize, entry-criteria, potential partners, hashtag, time-limit, and goal, you're finally ready to launch and promote your post! Remember, Instagram users <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-best-time-post?_ga=2.119948040.1808936424.1555102735-644648569.1551722047\">favor posts during a certain time in the day</a>, so you'll want to plan wisely.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you'll likely attract further attention to your giveaway if you also post giveaway details on a blog post, Facebook page, or another social channel. Consider where else you can promote your giveaway for optimal results.</p> \n<h2><strong>Instagram Giveaway Rules</strong></h2> \n<p>Instagram's rules are relatively simple when it comes to giveaways.</p> \n<p>First and foremost, it's critical you include a statement like the following, so viewers know your promotion is not tied to Instagram:</p> \n<p><em>\"Per Instagram rules, this promotion is in no way sponsored, administered, or associated with Instagram, Inc. By entering, entrants confirm that they are 13+ years of age, release Instagram of responsibility, and agree to Instagram's terms of use.\"</em></p> \n<p>Additionally, you'll want to ensure you don't ask participants to tag themselves in your content, or tag something that isn't in the photo -- Instagram will penalize you for this.</p> \n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/179379842258600\">Instagram's promotion guidelines</a> for a full list of rules and regulations.</p> \n<h2><strong>Instagram Giveaway Ideas</strong></h2> \n<p>Once you're ready to post your giveaway, there are a few different action items you might ask your participants to accomplish in exchange for the chance to win.</p> \n<p>Here's a list of some of the more common giveaway ideas:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Like to win</strong>: Have followers like your post for a chance to win a free product or service. This helps you boost engagement.</li> \n <li><strong>Tag a friend to win</strong>: Have followers tag one of their friends in the comments section for a chance to win. This allows your brand to reach new potential leads on Instagram and grow your audience.</li> \n <li><strong>Like and share to win</strong>: You might ask followers to like your giveaway and repost it on their own channels for the chance to greatly expand your brand's reach -- if ten followers with 100 followers each re-post, that's a chance to reach 1,000 new people.</li> \n <li><strong>Follow to win</strong>: Ask followers to follow your brand, or a partner (or both) for the chance to win. This is a popular tactic since it's an easy way to increase your follower count.</li> \n <li><strong>Photo contest</strong>: Ask participants to upload a photo of themselves using your product or service. This is another easy opportunity to spread brand awareness, since your participants' posts will be seen by their own network of followers and friends. You should ask participants to include your brand's hashtag, or tag your brand, for optimal visibility.</li> \n <li><strong>Caption this</strong>: Some brands post images and leave the caption section blank with a \"Caption this for a chance to win\" command. Your participants will enjoy the chance to offer creative captions for your image, and you'll be able to add the caption to your post with credit to the winner once your giveaway ends.</li> \n</ol> \n<h2><strong>Instagram Giveaway Picker Tools</strong></h2> \n<p>Once you've closed your giveaway contest, it's time to pick a winner -- but how can you do that and ensure fairness?</p> \n<p>There are a few tools you can use to truly randomize your winner. Here are a few options:</p> \n<h3>1. Use a free number generator.</h3> \n<p>While admittedly tedious, particularly if you have hundreds of entries, you might consider counting the total number of participants who engaged with your giveaway, and then using a number generator to select your winner.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say you count 500 participants in your comments section. Go to Google and type \"random number generator\" into the search box, and Google's number generator will appear as a box in the search results (you can also use another number generator tool, if you want).</p> \n<p>Your minimum should stay 1, and your maximum should be the total number of participants. When you click \"Generate\", the tool will provide a random number. Now, simply go back to your comments section and count until you land on the username that matches that number.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/7%20Tips%20for%20Running%20Engaging%20Instagram%20Giveaways,%20Plus%20Examples%20and%20Ideas-4.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h3>2. Use Easypromos' Instagram Sweepstakes App.</h3> \n<p>You might consider using a tool like <a href=\"https://www.easypromosapp.com/instagram-sweepstakes/\">Easypromos' Instagram Sweepstakes App</a> to organize your giveaway, which can help you ensure fairness and efficiency when choosing a winner.</p> \n<p>With Easypromos' app, you can filter finalists based on number of mentioned friends. Once you've closed your giveaway, the tool can randomly select between one and 1,000 winners, and alternate winners automatically. The tool provides a test run that you can try before the final draw.</p> \n<p>Best of all, Easypromos' offers a link to a certificate of validity that guarantees the draw has been random, ensuring a level of transparency and honesty between you and your participants. You can customize the certificate for your brand.</p> \n<h3>3. Use a random name picker.</h3> \n<p>This last option is likely the most tedious, but if your giveaway participant pool is relatively small, you could consider using a random name picker to choose your winner by username instead of number. Particularly if you've already compiled your list of names into a spreadsheet, this could be a good option for you.</p> \n<p>To use a random name picker, go to a website like <a href=\"https://www.miniwebtool.com/random-name-picker/\">Miniwebtool.com</a> and input all usernames, each on a separate line, into the text box. Then click the \"Pick a name\" button.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.wishpond.com/hashtag-contest/\">Wishpond</a></h3> \n<p>Wishpond is a great tool that can help you organize and track your Instagram giveaways.</p> \n<p>With Wishpond, you can run an Instagram hashtag giveaway and view all the entrants on your dashboard. You can even add a voting capability for users to vote on the best entry.</p> \n<p>The goal of this type of tool is to help you take your giveaway and promotions to the next level. If you want to run regular contests on Instagram, it might make sense to invest in a platform like this.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.easypromosapp.com/\">Easypromos</a></h3> \n<p>Similar to Wishpond, Easypromos makes running an Instagram giveaway or contest a seamless process.</p> \n<p>This tool will help you track comments on one or several posts. It will help you determine if people tagged the right amount of friends in the comments section and help you randomly choose the winner.</p> \n<p>The basic plan is affordable, with no-frills added. This is a great option if you want to run simple giveaways without adding on landing pages or marketing automation.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, if you are running enterprise level giveaways, there are other paid options that will include the features you need.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://woobox.com/\">Woobox</a></h3> \n<p>With Woobox, you can easily create and run successful contests, giveaways, polls, coupons, forms, and more.</p> \n<p>You can download your Instagram comments and pick one or several random winners. Additionally, this tool allows you to easily collect winner contact info and export Instagram comments.</p> \n<p>If you're looking to use an affordable tool, this is an excellent option. There is a free plan for smaller giveaways, but also an enterprise level power plan for larger contests.</p> \n<p>Using a tool is a great way to organize and track your giveaways. Now, let's see what a giveaway looks like in action.</p> \n<h2><strong>Instagram Giveaway Examples</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dominos/\">Domino's</a></h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/7%20Tips%20for%20Running%20Engaging%20Instagram%20Giveaways,%20Plus%20Examples%20and%20Ideas.png?width=600&amp;name=7%20Tips%20for%20Running%20Engaging%20Instagram%20Giveaways,%20Plus%20Examples%20and%20Ideas.png\" alt=\"Dominos Instagram giveaway.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>One of the more impressive giveaways in this list, Domino's offered the chance to win $10,000 for any participant who followed @Dominos, posted a picture to prove they're a superfan, and used the hashtag #PieceofthePieContest.</p> \n<p>With simple, clear instructions, I'm willing to bet this was a successful giveaway as followers quickly spread the word about their love for Dominos -- and likely incentivized followers to order a pizza from the brand.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alifedotowsky/\">Ali Fedotowsky</a></h3> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/7%20Tips%20for%20Running%20Engaging%20Instagram%20Giveaways,%20Plus%20Examples%20and%20Ideas-6.png?width=600&amp;name=7%20Tips%20for%20Running%20Engaging%20Instagram%20Giveaways,%20Plus%20Examples%20and%20Ideas-6.png\" alt=\"Ali Fedotowsky hosts an Instagram giveaway.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Ali Fedotowsky, a lifestyle and fashion blogger and ex-Bachelorette, partnered with Sole Society to giveaway a pair of loafers and a purse.

That's chronic overwork -- and it can have extremely negative impacts on your health, happiness, and overall quality of life.</span></p> \n<p>But w<span>orking overtime has become the norm for most people. And, now that multiple offices have embraced remote work, the lines between the end of the work day and the start of personal time can get even blurrier.</span></p> \n<p><span> It's&nbsp;</span>one of those things everyone knows is bad for us, but no one really listens. Trouble is, failure to prioritize a healthy balance isn't just bad for the employees -- it's actually bad for employers, too.</p> \n<p>There are numerous research studies out there showing how overwork -- and its resulting stress -- can lead to many health problems.

In the short-term, lack of sleep <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-requirements\">can have significant effects</a> on the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in memory creation and consolidation.</p> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span><span><span><span>Think you're one of those \"lucky people\" who can get by fine with only five or six hours of sleep?

But how does this happen?</p> \n<p>First, overworking and lack of sleep slows activity in the areas of our brains responsible for ranking different foods based on what we want and need.</p> \n<p>Second, little sleep also causes an increase in the brain's amygdala, which is responsible for controlling the salience of food. Over time, poor food choices can lead to weight gain and even obesity.</p> \n<h3><span class=\"content-post__body\">3. Overworking is bad for your heart.</span></h3> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1005/10051205#sthash.ljtjvuTF.dpuf\">A&nbsp;long-running study of more than 10,000 civil servants in London found</a> that white-collar workers&nbsp;who worked three or more hours longer than a normal, seven-hour day had a 60% higher risk of heart-related problems than&nbsp;white-collar workers who didn't work overtime. Examples of heart-related problems included&nbsp;death due to heart disease, non-fatal heart attacks, and angina, a condition caused by low blood supply to the heart.</p> \n<p><span><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22952309\">A follow-up study of over 22,000 participants found</a> that people who worked long hours were </span>40% more likely to suffer from coronary heart disease<span> than those who worked standard hours.</span></p> \n<p>And even after that, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/news/20180716/working-yourself-to-death-long-hours-bring-risks\">reports from health sites like WebMD</a> still tell stories of people who developed heart conditions through overworking.</p> \n<p>What about overworking might be causing heart disease, specifically?</p> \n<p>The link between overworking and heart disease might have something to do with your personality. In fact, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-b-personality-types\">the \"Type A vs. Type B\" personality test </a>was&nbsp;<span>originally aimed to determine&nbsp;how likely it was that a person would develop coronary heart disease.

In the study, a group of researchers put together a dataset of over 330,000 workers across 14 different countries.</p> \n<p>They found that&nbsp;48 hours of work per week was the magic number: When people worked more than 48 hours per week, they were more likely to engage in \"increased risky alcohol use.\" Risky alcohol use was defined as more than 14 drinks per week for women and more than 21 drinks per week for men.</p> \n<p>Aside from alcohol consumption, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/news/20180716/working-yourself-to-death-long-hours-bring-risks\">researchers have also found</a> that long hours link to bad smoking habits.</p> \n<p>And a 2018 paper from Welltory added to the list of bad habits by showing that overworking can also lead to <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hNEZpNrVhtH0ITpRxQLHQHYqT-bf5JRD/view\">more social media consumption</a>, which can danger your level of stress recover when you're not working.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><span class=\"content-post__body\">5. It causes higher risks for low-income workers.</span></h3> \n<p>Way back in 2015, a group of researchers investigated the role of long working hours as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587%2814%2970178-0/abstract\">They found that the link between longer working hours and type 2 diabetes is apparent in individuals in the low socioeconomic status groups. This was true regardless of age, sex, obesity, and physical activity, and remained even when they excluded shift workers from the analysis. Shortly after, another study showed an association between long hours and type 2 </a><a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587%2814%2970178-0/abstract\">diabetes</a><span> in low-income workers.</span></p> \n<p>Overall, these findings show how strong of a relationship a person's mental state can have on physical health.</p> \n<h2>Why Overworking is Bad for Business</h2> \n<p>If better health and happiness isn't enough of an incentive to do something about chronic overwork, it turns out overworking can have a legitimately negative impact on a business' bottom line. Sarah Green Carmichael of <em>Harvard Business Review</em> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies\">calls the story of overwork</a> \"the story of diminishing returns\": keep overworking, and you'll keep making avoidable mistakes and getting lost in the weeds -- all while not actually producing more.</p> \n<h3>6. More input doesn't necessarily mean more output.</h3> \n<p>Do longer work hours equate to&nbsp;more work getting done?&nbsp;From time to time, yes -- but not when \"overtime\" becomes \"all the time.\"</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.hcgexperts.com/scheduled-overtime-effect-on-construction-projects.php\">Research by the Business Roundtable found</a> employees saw short-term gains when they pushed their workweek to 60 or 70 hours for a few weeks at a time if, for example, they needed to meet a critical production deadline. But increasing the number of hours worked in the office from 40 to 60 hours doesn't result in more output: \"In fact, the numbers may typically be something closer to 25‚Äì30% more work in 50% more time,\" <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/03/14/bring_back_the_40_hour_work_week/\">writes Sara Robinson for&nbsp;</a><em><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/03/14/bring_back_the_40_hour_work_week/\">Salon</a>.</em></p> \n<p>Why? Robinson&nbsp;explains that most people do their best work between hours two and six of working in a given day. By the end of an eight-hour day, their best work tends to be behind them -- and by hour nine, fatigue begins to set in and productivity levels drop. They won't be able to deliver to their full potential -- especially if they aren't invigorated by something like a rare, critical deadline -- and they'll end the day completely exhausted.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2015.0975\">one study out of Boston University's Questrom School of Business found</a> that managers actually couldn't tell the difference between employees who actually worked 80 hours per week and those who just pretended to. What's more, managers tended to punish employees who were transparent about working less -- but there was no evidence that those employees actually accomplished less, nor were there any signs that the overworking employees accomplished more.</p> \n<h3>7. You're more likely to make mistakes.</h3> \n<p>Speaking of exhaustion, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617405/\">researchers have found</a> that overwork -- and the resulting stress and exhaustion -- can make it far more difficult to do everything that a modern office requires, including interpersonal communication, making judgment calls, reading people, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/emotional-intelligence-tips\">managing one's own emotional reactions</a>. Aside from small office slip ups, research from NCBI even shows that overworking can lead to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6617405/\">physical injuries in the workplace</a>.</p> \n<h3>8. You lose sight of the bigger picture.</h3> \n<p>Have you ever worked on a project so long that you began to obsess over it and forget about everything else related to your role or personal life? Many marketers have been there.</p> \n<p>The breaks we take to recharge, eat meals, or spend time with the people we love help us step back from our work and stay mindful of how our work contributes to our goals.</p> \n<h3>9. Overworking hinders creativity.</h3> \n<p>As marketers, we're sought after for our creative and colorful ideas, messaging, and content. But, this type of work takes a lot of time, energy, and open-mindedness.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/losing-sleep-creativity.html\">lack of sleep, stress, and other issues</a> caused by overworking can drain your energy, motivation, and, ultimately, your level of creativity.</p> \n<p>If you want to stay fresh and creative, it's important to limit your work hours, get a good night's sleep, and take time off when you feel like your mind is being drained of creative thoughts.</p> \n<p>When you do take time off, be sure to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-stay-creative-under-pressure\">keep a notepad or a phone recording </a>app nearby. Sometimes, creative ideas can strike when you're most relaxed -- and you'll want to take them down somewhere.</p> \n<h3>10. It makes multitasking harder.</h3> \n<p>As we mentioned above, overworking raises the risk of making silly mistakes. This risk gets even higher when you're working on multiple projects all at once.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Multitasking is one of the commodities of a modern marketing role. Each day, we might send out an email, update social media, write a long-form blog post, attend multiple video meetings, and monitor the analytics of what we're doing.</p> \n<p>When you're tired, low on energy, and not primed to pay attention to detail, it will be harder to complete all of your tasks correctly -- let alone one of them.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Who's to Blame?</h2> \n<p>Chronically overworking isn't fun.&nbsp;It doesn't feel<em>good;</em>to&nbsp;realize you have to work through yet another family dinner or relaxing weekend.</p> \n<p>So why do people do it? Is it because our bosses told us to?&nbsp;Or because we want to make more money? Or do we have some deep-seated psychological need? In <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies\">her article for</a><em><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies\"> Harvard Business Review</a>,</em> Carmichael asks, \"who's to blame?\"</p> \n<h3>Over-ambitious managers?</h3> \n<p>In many cultures,&nbsp;bosses want and expect employees to put in long days, make themselves available on email 24/7,&nbsp;and work nights, weekends, and during vacation without protest. In this version, writes Carmichael, we overwork because we're told to.</p> \n<p>This is&nbsp;<span>especially evident in the three countries in which employees </span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/02/21/5-things-you-get-from-working-too-hard/\">work the longest hours</a><span> of all advanced countries in the world:&nbsp;<span>America, South Korea, and Japan.</span></span></p> \n<h3><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span><span>... Or ourselves?</span></span></span></span></h3> \n<p>Some of us overwork even when our managers don't want us too, And, truthfully, most of us can't put all the blame on others.</p> \n<p>More often than not, working long hours is a way for us to prove something to ourselves. Maybe working late makes us feel ambitious or important. Maybe it's because we think it's the only way to get a promotion, make more money, or avoid falling behind. Maybe we straight up feel guilty when we get up and leave at 5 P.M.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/07/15/330191097/when-work-becomes-a-haven-from-stress-at-home\">Several studies have even shown</a> some of us consider w<span>ork a safe haven -- a place in which we feel confident and in control as compared with stresses&nbsp;outside the office.</span></p> \n<p>And who could blame us? More and more, working beyond normal business hours has become something people brag about. In some cases, it becomes an addiction.</p> \n<p><span class=\"content-post__body\"><span>\"We live in a competitive society,\" <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203358704577237603853394654\">writes Laura Vanderkam for </a><em><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203358704577237603853394654\">The Wall Street Journal,</a>&nbsp;</em>\"and so by lamenting our overwork and sleep deprivation -- even if that requires workweek inflation and claiming our worst nights are typical -- we show that we are dedicated to our jobs and our families.\"</span></span></p> \n<h2>Know When It's Time to Log Off</h2> Sometimes, working long hours can feel rewarding -- even invigorating. Other times, especially when we make a habit out of it, it can make us feel stressed, mad, lonely, and generally unhealthy. \n<p>The key is paying attention to how it makes you feel. If it's interfering with your mental, physical, or emotional help, it may be time to&nbsp;reprioritize.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This blog post was originally published in June 2016, but was updated for comprehensiveness and freshness in October 2020.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Foverwork-bad-health&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 21:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f722274a025082f99067d2b59346de87","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich Cox)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Foverwork-bad-health&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn81@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-48-414_9e5905fb38002ccf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389706},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"Why Consumers Sign Up for Webinars [New Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-consumers-sign-up-for-webinars","description":"<p>In 2020, brands are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/run-successful-virtual-conference\">leveraging virtual events</a> more than ever.</p>  \n<p>And, although some marketers once believed that \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/are-webinars-dead-how-to-make-a-webinar\">webinars were dead</a>,‚Äù many are now rethinking that statement as they find themselves scheduling and promoting this exact type of event.</p> \n<p>Webinars, or online events often modeled like a class or seminar, often include a lesson, slide deck, interactive elements such as polls, and, occasionally, time for audience members to virtually ask questions.</p> \n<p>Because of their educational format, webinars can offer a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/are-webinars-dead-how-to-make-a-webinar\">number of great perks to brands</a>.</p> \n<p>First, you can build a sense of credibility by hosting a webinar on a topic your company has expertise in. Second, webinars can enable your fans to interact with you digitally.</p> \n<p>Lastly, and most importantly, webinar signups can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/are-webinars-dead-how-to-make-a-webinar\">lead to a bigger contact list, more prospects, or purchasing conversions</a>.</p> \n<p>But webinars <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/are-webinars-dead-how-to-make-a-webinar\">aren't always easy to plan and execute</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Because webinars require viewers to sign up and remember to tune in, it takes <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-promote-a-virtual-event\">clever marketing</a> to ensure that a large audience actually attends. Additionally, with most brands going virtual in 2020, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-promote-a-virtual-event\">a number of competitors in your space</a> might very well be planning a similar webinar that your audiences might be more drawn to.</p> \n<p>Luckily, by researching your target audience, and learning more about what drives attendees to sign up for webinars, you can create and promote an event that effectively pulls in and delights your audiences.</p> \n<p>So, where do you start?</p> \n<p>To help you research the best webinar tactics for your brand, I surveyed 400 consumers about their webinar preferences and what motivates them to attend these virtual events. In this blog post, I'll highlight a few key findings that you can keep in mind as you develop and promote your webinar content.</p> \n<h2>What Consumers Say About Webinars in 2020</h2> \n<h3>People want webinars that help them explore their passions.</h3> \n<p>When choosing which webinars to sign up for, are people drawn mostly to events that help them elevate their career, or are they attending them for more recreational purposes?</p> \n<p>To learn more about consumers' motivations for attending a webinar, I asked 400 consumers, \"Which webinars are you most likely to attend in 2020?\", 27% chose, \"Webinars that teach me more about a passion or hobby;\" while 24% chose, \"Webinars that entertain me.\"</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Why%20Consumers%20Sign%20Up%20for%20Webinars%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png?width=600&amp;name=Why%20Consumers%20Sign%20Up%20for%20Webinars%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png\" alt=\"which webinar would you sign up for?\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://luc.id/\" style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;\">Data Source</a></p> \n<p>If you have a webinar strategy or series that aims to help people boost their careers or work tactics, don't panic. Nearly one-fifth of the group (18%) said they wanted to attend webinars that helped them learn more about their career or industry, while 22% said \"All of the above.\" These results indicate that consumers will definitely still sign up for a webinar that tackles career, work, or industry-related topics.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you should also keep in mind that this survey was delivered to a small general consumer pool of all ages and career levels. Had this been given primarily to executives or B2B business reps, the results might have leaned towards industry-related content.</p> \n<p>Regardless of what industry you're in, or the size of this survey pool, marketers should keep the data above in mind when creating and promoting a webinar. Because people are naturally curious and want to learn, your webinar promotions should intrigue them by clearly stating what they'll learn, noting any experts that might be featured, and highlighting how attendees will be able to use the knowledge they'll gain from the event.</p> \n<h3>Webinar viewers sign up to learn something -- but prefer certain teaching styles over others.</h3> \n<p>Just like any in-person class, each professor -- or webinar host -- might have a slightly different teaching style.</p> \n<p>While some hosts might come in with a great slide deck presentation, others might bring in an expert and have the audience ask them questions. Or, they might bring in a few experts and host a panel discussion where the audience just listens rather than asking questions.</p> \n<p>There are many ways to format an informative webinar, but which teaching style actually intrigues people enough to get them to sign up?</p> \n<p>When I asked, \"Which webinar format sounds most engaging to you?\", 30% of participants said, \"A presentation that teaches me how to do something specific.\" Meanwhile, 20% said \"All of the above.\"</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Why%20Consumers%20Sign%20Up%20for%20Webinars%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-2.png?width=600&amp;name=Why%20Consumers%20Sign%20Up%20for%20Webinars%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-2.png\" alt=\"Which webinar format is most engaging?\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://luc.id/\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Data Source</a></p> \n<p>The results above hint that a simple how-to webinar with fewer frills could still engage audiences if you're feeling low on bandwidth and creativity. However, if you have the time to coordinate a webinar that feels more like a live Q&amp;A, this could also be a great formatting option. 39% of people said they were drawn to one of the webinar formats that included a Q&amp;A.</p> \n<p>Although a more basic presentation or lecture styled webinar will still catch the attention of potential viewers, content marketers should still make sure their presentations educate audiences on something specific -- like a strategy -- rather than discussing an incredibly broad or very vague topic -- like an entire industry. Only 12% of respondents say they're driven to webinars that will feature a presenter discussing a broad topic.</p> \n<p>Odds are, a person attending a webinar already knows the basics of their hobby, industry, or passion. But, they want to learn more or become an expert at something related to it. For example, as a content marketer, I might not attend a webinar with a broad topic of \"Marketing,\" but I might attend webinars like, \"Advanced Blogging Tips from Managing Editors,\" or \"The Basics of SEO in Marketing.\"</p> \n<p>As a marketer or webinar creator, you'll need to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">build a buyer persona</a> for your target audience to determine the best expertise level to create valuable content around. If your audience is filled with beginners in a topic, you might want to create more granular webinars that discuss basic tasks or tactics. If your audience is made up of topic experts, your webinars might need to be more advanced.</p> \n<h3>Interactive Content: The Key to an Engaging Webinar?</h3> \n<p>In the modern classroom, teachers will often zest up a number of different class outlines by adding opportunities for students to interact or test their knowledge. These could include polling the class by asking them to raise their hands, pop quizzes, or allowing them to ask questions.</p> \n<p>When it comes to online events, a number of tools and video software enable marketers to make their webinars more interactive and engaging. And, based on our research, it seems like consumers enjoy interactive webinars.</p> \n<p>When asked, \"Which element would you most like to see in a webinar?\", \"A host or presenter that takes questions from the audience,\" received 22% of the votes, followed by \"No preference as long as the webinar feels interactive,\" with 19% of the votes. Another 20% say they'd like to see polls or quizzes.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Why%20Consumers%20Sign%20Up%20for%20Webinars%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png?width=600&amp;name=Why%20Consumers%20Sign%20Up%20for%20Webinars%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png\" alt=\"Which element would you like to see in a webinar?\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://luc.id/\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Data Source</a></p> \n<p>If you're a marketer who regularly creates webinars, it might be worth it to consider where you can make your programming more interactive.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're hosting an expert, consider leaving time for the audience to ask questions in the webinar tool's chat area. Or, if you're discussing a strategy that's common in your field, poll your audience to see if they've used the tactic.</p> \n<p>Although polls or Q&amp;A might seem like a super basic webinar element, they might make your audiences listen more actively and enjoy the content they're consuming more. This ultimately could lead to them engaging more with your brand, signing up for future webinars, or converting to a customer.</p> \n<p>If you're marketing a webinar that has interactive content in it, be sure to promote that aspect. For example, in your messaging, emails, and follow-up emails, directly tell your audiences they'll be able to actively participate in quizzes, polls, or a Q&amp;A during your event.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-promote-a-virtual-event\">competitive webinar pool</a>, anything you can do to make your webinar seem more active and engaging than others that are more basic could help boost signups and attendance during the actual event.</p> \n<h2>Creating and Promoting a Successful Webinar</h2> \n<p>While creating a unique and engaging webinar will be one crucial step in your virtual event strategy, the proper promotional tactics will also be vital.</p> \n<p>Once you've created a webinar plan that will inform audiences, allow them to interact with you, and fuel your contact list, be sure to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-promote-a-virtual-event\">promote all of the great things your online event will cover</a>.</p> \n<p>As you promote your webinar, don't forget to note aspects that will make your event stand out -- such as polls or Q&amp;As.

Consider, for instance, the ad I saw on my Facebook feed a few hours after completing a purchase on <a href=\"https://www.freepeople.com/\">Free People's</a> website:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-4.png?width=267&amp;name=Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" style=\"width: 267px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Despite my recent Free People purchase (and dwindling clothing budget ‚Ä¶ ) I couldn't help but click. I'd just been on their website, but I hadn't seen <em>these </em>clothes yet.</p> \n<p>Which leads me to my point: the power of targeted advertising.</p> \n<p>With over <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6128/the-ultimate-list-100-facebook-statistics-infographics.aspx\">7 million advertisers on Facebook</a>, it can be difficult for brands to stand out on Facebook amidst the masses.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll dive into the various Facebook ad targeting options you might consider to get the highest ROI on your campaigns ‚Äî plus, Facebook advertising tips from HubSpot's Paid Ads specialist, Nicole Ondracek.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2><strong>Facebook Ad Targeting Options</strong></h2> \n<p>It's important to note, you'll find all these ad targeting options within your <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/accounts/\">Facebook Ads Manager</a>. Once you begin creating a new ad campaign, you'll have the option to \"Create New Audience\" or \"Use Saved Audience\".</p> \n<p>If you opt to create a new audience, you'll see a field for \"Custom Audiences\" at the top (in which you can add a custom or lookalike audience, both of which are described below), a section for demographics (including Location, Age, Gender, and Languages), and sections for more detailed targeting or connections.</p> \n<h3>1. Demographic</h3> \n<p>Demographic Facebook ad targeting options include the opportunity to segment your audience(s) based on age, location, language, work, education, and more. If you sell a product or service that pertains primarily to a certain demographic, this is a good ad targeting option for you.</p> \n<p>For instance, maybe your audience is primarily millennial females, people who work in the medical industry, or anyone who lives in Spain ‚Äî all of these factors can help you hyper-target to ensure you're reaching the prospects who are most willing to buy your product or service based on an ad they see on Facebook.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h3>2. Interests</h3> \n<p>Consider how much you're able to learn about someone from their Facebook activity.</p> \n<p>For instance, in the last six months I've Liked pages of various restaurants in Boston, MA; I've watched yoga videos via Facebook Live; and I've shopped for clothing on Facebook Marketplace.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All of these activities suggest the types of hobbies I'm interested in, and, tangentially, what types of products or services I'd be interested in purchasing.</p> \n<p>Perhaps you sell a product or service that doesn't pertain to an audience's demographic as much as it pertains to an audiences' <em>interests</em>.</p> \n<p>A good example of this? Workout gear. Sure, you can <em>guess</em> that your audience is primarily 20 to 30-year-old women, for instance, but a more powerful opportunity for targeting would simply be to target anyone who's Liked fitness pages, or engaged with fitness videos, over the last couple months.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-Sep-16-2020-03-33-05-33-PM.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h3>3. Behavior</h3> \n<p>There are plenty of user behaviors you'd want to keep track of before sending a Facebook ad their way ‚Äî for instance, consider my example earlier, in which I'd shopped on Free People's website before receiving a Free People ad on Facebook.</p> \n<p>Additionally, it's often most effective to target prospects who've already shown interest in your brand. For instance, you might find your Facebook ads perform better with audiences who've already read some of your blog posts or followed you on social media.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, \"behavior\" can help you target audiences who've consumed certain types of content, visited certain websites, used certain browsers or devices, or even donated to certain charities.</p> \n<p>This is a particularly good targeting option for ecommerce re-engagement ads, in which you display ads to users who've added items to their check-out cart on your website. Alternatively, you might consider serving ads to users who've visited a certain landing page on your website.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-2.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h3>4. Connections</h3> \n<p>If you have a specific page, app, or event listed on Facebook that attracts visitors to whom you'd like to serve ads, you're in luck. With \"Connections\", you can do exactly that.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say you recently held a networking event and added 300+ users to the event-specific Facebook page ‚Äî after-the-fact, you might consider sending specific ads towards those users, who are now more aware of your brand and likely interested in your offerings.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can expand your ad's potential by sending the ad to <em>friends </em>of people who've attended your event, as well.</p> \n<h3>5. Custom Audiences</h3> \n<p>If you already have a good list of leads in your database and want to reach them on Facebook, you could simply create a Custom Audience to attract and convert those leads.</p> \n<p>A Custom Audience enables you to provide specific information you've gathered about your leads, such as a phone number or email, and then target those leads with ads.</p> \n<p>This is a good targeting option if your goal is to up-sell to existing customers. For instance, perhaps you have a database of customers who currently use your product, but you've recently released new features in a Professional version.</p> \n<p>One of the best opportunities to attract and convert existing customers is to use Custom Audiences to serve your Professional-product Facebook ads to those customers already in your database.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-Sep-16-2020-03-33-05-74-PM.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Lookalike Audiences</h3> \n<p>Lookalike Audiences is a fantastic opportunity to perform cold outreach towards prospects who look similar to your existing prospects and customers. As the name implies, Lookalike Audiences allows you to target ads towards users who match similar characteristics to people who've shown interest in your brand.</p> \n<p>To further understand what it means for an audience to \"look\" like your existing database, consider the following example: let's say you upload your email subscriber list to Facebook as a custom audience.</p> \n<p>Facebook then identifies the following consistent features about your list: users are primarily in their mid-to-late thirties, they live in the United States, they work in banking, <em>and </em>they've shown an interest in travel.</p> \n<p>Facebook could then find users on Facebook who match all of these qualifications, since users with those criteria seem most interested in what your brand has to offer.</p> \n<p>Similar to Custom Audiences, you'll need to upload a custom audience for Lookalike Audiences to work ‚Äî for instance, perhaps you upload a list of email subscribers, event attendees, or website visitors.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-Sep-16-2020-03-33-05-97-PM.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<h2><strong>Facebook Ad Targeting Tips</strong></h2> \n<h3>1. Repurpose your highest-performing content as a Facebook ad.</h3> \n<p>If you have a few high-performing pieces of content that already attract <em>and </em>convert leads, why not put some paid ad spend behind it?</p> \n<p>We've seen success with this strategy at HubSpot. For instance, each quarter I send a list of top-performing and high-converting content to the paid ad team, and they reformat it into an advertisement for Facebook.</p> \n<p>Ondracek adds, \"This can apply to different goals throughout a customer's lifecycle. For example, if our goal is to drive more brand awareness to our site, we'll test a blog post that generates a large amount of site traffic. On the other hand, if our goal is more focused on generating leads and submissions, we'll instead test a high-converting content offer, since we care more about conversions than traffic.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Ondracek told me, \"It's all about finding the right content that matches up to your campaign objective.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Of course, not <em>every</em> piece of content that performs well organically will perform well as a social ad, which is why you want to be highly selective and pay attention to metrics like social media views when choosing posts.</p> \n<p>But, nonetheless, choosing these high-performers is a good starting point and ensures you're providing new audiences with content that already delights your existing audience.</p> \n<h3>2. Retarget ads to prospects most likely to convert.</h3> \n<p>With Facebook advertising, you're able to target prospects who've already shown interest in your content, which could be more effective than cold-targeting Facebook users who haven't shown any interest in your brand.</p> \n<p>With retargeting, you can send ads towards prospects who've already watched a product demo, interacted with a blog post, or downloaded an ebook ‚Äî which are all signs they're intrigued by your brand and could be interested in learning more.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say you work in the ecommerce industry and sell athletic apparel. You might consider creating a gated video on fitness tips from top health experts. Once you've collected an email list of users who've downloaded that video, you can target a follow-up \"Top Workout Routines\" Facebook to those same video viewers.</p> \n<p>Ondracek says, \"Retargeting is a really powerful approach, and we've found it works best when used to go after an audience similar to the seed list. For example, we've seen success retargeting visitors who have previously visited our pricing page with direct response product ads since they're already in that consideration stage and more likely to buy.</p> \n<p>She adds, \"On the flip side, when we tried retargeting awareness video ad viewers with these types of down funnel ads, we saw worse performance since these two audiences have completely different behaviors.\"</p> \n<p>Of course, it's vital to note, you'll want to retarget ads that align well with your products or services. If people have shown interest in content that isn't high-converting and doesn't align with your product, you likely don't want to retarget those viewers, since there's no evidence they'll turn into qualified leads.</p> \n<h3>3. Leverage existing fans of your business.</h3> \n<p>Similar to the tip above, it's often more worthwhile to target users who've demonstrated their appreciation for your brand by liking your Facebook's business Page. Consider how you might convert those users by retargeting ads towards them.</p> \n<p>For instance, Facebook Ads expert Jon Loomer found his ads <a href=\"https://www.jonloomer.com/2013/08/21/facebook-ads-roi/\">ROI increased dramatically when he targeted fans</a>, rather than non-fans. In fact, his fan-targeted ads returned 129 conversions and resulted in <a href=\"https://www.jonloomer.com/2013/08/21/facebook-ads-roi/\">$9,481.50 in revenue ‚Äî 45.9X ROI</a>. When he targeted non-fans, he didn't convert at all.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-3.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-Sep-16-2020-03-33-05-46-PM.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><a href=\"https://www.jonloomer.com/2013/08/21/facebook-ads-roi/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Ultimately, it's much less obtrusive to target ads towards people who <em>want</em> to see content from your brand and have demonstrated an interest in your company. Save time and money by targeting your brand's fans first.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Ondracek told me, \"You can also get creative and try layering on some criteria here. For example, you could try targeting fans of your page who haven‚Äôt purchased a product to try and influence some buying power. Or on the other hand, you could try targeting fans who have previously purchased a product if you sell something that can be purchased multiple times ‚Äîlike clothing in the FreePeople ad.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Take advantage of custom audiences to up-sell and build loyalty with existing customers.</h3> \n<p>Targeting Facebook ads isn't just effective for attracting new prospects to your business ‚Äî it's also a good strategy for retaining and up-selling your existing customers.</p> \n<p>And, considering it's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/cross-selling\">5-25X more expensive to acquire a new customer</a> than it is to retain an existing one, it makes sense to leverage the customers in your database already rather than only sending ads to brand-new prospects.</p> \n<p>To up-sell via Facebook ads, think about your existing customers who might benefit from an additional feature, product, or service that you can offer them. For instance, perhaps you've just released new features on a Pro version of your product. More than likely, users of your free or beginner product would be interested in learning about those features, particularly if they're enjoying your product and considering an upgrade.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, maybe you simply want to target helpful content towards existing customers to increase brand loyalty. You might consider creating a Custom Audience list of customers who've read your social media blog posts, for instance, and then serve ads on your upcoming social media webinar to that audience.</p> \n<h3>5. Create lookalikes of top-performing audiences to keep improving upon what works best.</h3> \n<p>Ondracek suggests that, once you find an audience that works well following the tips above, you can always create a lookalike of the same audience.</p> \n<p>She says, \"If, for example, you find targeting people who like your page works best, you can create a Lookalike of this same audience to test. This new audience allows you to expand your reach to new prospects and might even perform better.\"<br><br>Additionally, Ondracek told me, \"At HubSpot, we tend to see the most positive results and improvements when testing with Lookalike Audiences. As digital platforms become more and more automated, you'll find yourself having to put more faith into the algorithms.\"</p> \n<p>\"And what's pretty cool is that these algorithms tend to work! When you upload a list of customers to Facebook and create a lookalike from them, Facebook's algorithm is going to do its best to target your ads to people most similar to your existing customers.\"&nbsp;<br><br>Ondracek adds that you'll want to make sure you have some conversion tracking setup on your campaigns, so that Facebook will be able to tell who's actually converting and optimize to find more people similar to those users.</p> \n<p>Of course, if you don't have enough data or conversions for the system to optimize, it's going to be harder for this approach to work ‚Äî which is why you'll want to aim to run an audience test for at least two weeks, so there's enough data to work with.<br><br>Additionally, Ondracek says, \"What's also great about Lookalikes is that if you find a Lookalike audience performing well, you can increase the size of it to test if a larger audience performs better or worse than a smaller one. In the Facebook interface, you have the option to test between 1-10% Lookalike audiences. The smaller the size, the more similar the audience is supposed to be to your seed list.\"</p> \n<h3>6. Keep an eye out for frequency.</h3> \n<p>Finally, when targeting your ads, you'll want to keep an eye on the frequency metric to make sure someone isn‚Äôt seeing your ad too often.</p> \n<p>Ondracek advises, \"If the frequency is too high, you risk hurting your brand perception. We can all name that one brand we see <em>way</em> too many ads for. On the other hand, it can be beneficial for someone to see your ad more than once to increase your brand awareness. You'll have to play around with a sweet spot that works best for your company, but aiming for a frequency of 3-4 can be a good place to start.\"<br><br>Ondracek adds, \"If you do start to see the frequency increase, there are a few ways to solve for this. First, you can create a larger-sized lookalike audience as mentioned above, which will expand your reach. Second, you can create new custom audiences to add to your campaign. And, finally, you can add in interest or behavioral targeting since those are large pools of audiences to begin with.\"</p> \n<p>\"Additionally, you can swap out with new creative so the same audience is at least seeing some new fresher content.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"One of the most exciting parts of paid advertising is being able to continuously test and find what works best. There are so many different options and ways to target, so if you find an audience not working, don‚Äôt be afraid to try a new one.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Undoubtedly, there are endless opportunities for increasing customer lifetime value by retargeting Facebook ads in an effort to demonstrate your brand's empathy and commitment to helping customers with all their various needs.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffacebook-advertising-targeting-options&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9adc663abde854a63457c33d212d8b90","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-4.png?width=267&name=Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn20@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-45-850_ebadffd8a2f28962.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog.png":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn4@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-47-781_57248bae1f678d0a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-Sep-16-2020-03-33-05-33-PM.png":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-46-635_83957621306b714f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-Sep-16-2020-03-33-05-74-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn25@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-49-374_691c4654fb27a072.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-Sep-16-2020-03-33-05-97-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn98@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-52-944_0a3b2c9a59c1529f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-45-794_3a9561b3602483e6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Ad%20Targeting%20Blog-Sep-16-2020-03-33-05-46-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn58@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-48-083_3e50c7f4f3502ad7.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffacebook-advertising-targeting-options&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn85@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-48-523_ca13b76cf55112dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389703},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"7 Tips for Hosting a Virtual Brainstorm, According to HubSpot Marketing Managers","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/virtual-brainstorm-tips","description":"<p>At HubSpot, we love brainstorms</p>  \n<p>Getting your team together in one room to come up with ideas not only allows you to identify creative content or strategies that you might not have thought of, but it also can improve feelings of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychological-safety-according-to-edmondson\">psychological safety</a> as people who might not be high-level managers are invited and encouraged to offer their input.</p> \n<p>Brainstorming is one of the most productive team-building activities we use at HubSpot. But, recently, when we had to leave our physical offices and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tips\">embrace remote work</a>, many managers wondered how they‚Äôd recreate the same in-person communication, productivity, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychological-safety-according-to-edmondson\">sense of psychological safety</a> virtually.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Luckily, many of our managers were able to adapt quickly, leading a number of successful virtual brainstorms in 2020.</p> \n<p>To help managers build solid idea-generation techniques -- even from home -- here are a few steps HubSpot employees on the blog, acquisition team, and DI&amp;B team take when coordinating remote brainstorms.</p> \n<h2>How to Run a Virtual Brainstorm</h2> \n<h3>1. Give your team a headstart.</h3> \n<p>If your teammates already know the goal of the brainstorm, the prompts they'll be given, and their idea generation instructions, they'll come ready and eager to immediately make suggestions.</p> \n<p>Before the brainstorm, consider sending a detailed email or a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creative-brief\">creative brief</a> about what you'd like to achieve during the session.</p> \n<p>\"I‚Äôve found that giving members of your brainstorm a chance to prepare in advance results in higher quality ideas presented in the brainstorm,\" says Emmy Jonassen, Sr. Director of Marketing at HubSpot. \"A creative brief will also help you make the best use of your time, so you'll focus on the act of brainstorming rather than discussing the assignment.\"</p> \n<h3>2. Designate a facilitator before the brainstorm.</h3> \n<p>When you're attending a brainstorm in person, it's easier to determine who's talking, who's being asked questions, and who's running the meeting simply by body language and other social cues.</p> \n<p>When you're on a video call, some cues can be harder to notice. You might not know who should be answering a question, who you should ask questions to, and who is trying to keep the meeting on schedule. That's why it's helpful to clearly designate a host or facilitator.</p> \n<p>\"The trick to having a great brainstorm is getting everyone involved,\" Jonassen explains. \"A facilitator can help create an environment where everyone feels comfortable chiming in. They can also help keep the conversation going through awkward silences, keep the group on track, and bring people into the conversation who tend to be more reserved.\"</p> \n<p>Once you've planned your brainstorm and designated yourself or someone else as a facilitator, be sure to note this information in the brainstorm's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creative-brief\">creative brief</a>, calendar invite, or at the beginning of the session. If you choose to use breakout rooms -- which we'll discuss in step four -- consider having a facilitator for each of them.</p> \n<h3>3. Take virtual notes.</h3> \n<p>During in-person brainstorms, it's easy to look down and type on your computer while still talking and engaging with others. But, on a video call, you might want to stare less at your notes and more at your camera so it doesn't look like you're losing interest. And, if you must take notes, you might worry about missing something as you toggle between screens. Because of these issues, notes can get pretty muffled.</p> \n<p>That's why Alexandra Garnier, a French automation marketing manager, says brainstorm coordinators should, \"Either use a virtual whiteboard, a shared online notes document, or (if needed) a designated note-taker.\"</p> \n<p>By creating joint notes or designating a note-taker, everyone can have a shared source of information to look back on and can focus on the discussions at hand, When selecting a note-taker, it's best to pick a fast typer or an attendee who isn't tasked with coming up with ideas, such as a co-coordinator. This will allow them to focus on the notes without heavily missing out on a great team activity.</p> \n<h3>4. Embrace virual breakout rooms.</h3> \n<p>During a large in-person brainstorm, you might be asked to break into small groups, go to another room, and come back with a few ideas to offer from your group. Luckily, many video call tools have been able to mimic this experience with breakout room features.</p> \n<p>\"It‚Äôs harder to get everyone to participate if you have more than five or six people involved,\" Jonassen says. \"If I have a big group, I‚Äôll typically use this feature to break people into smaller groups and brainstorm for a set period of time. After that time has ended, I‚Äôll have everyone rejoin the larger group to share their ideas.\"</p> \n<p>Garnier similarly added, \"If you do a brainstorm with a larger group, it's better to then do breakout rooms. Some people tend to shy away when there are many participants.\" This can be especially true in a virtual setting, where people might feel uncomfortable speaking up.</p> \n<p>If you're using Zoom for your meetings and interested in breakout rooms, here's a great tutorial for how to activate them on your next call.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 480px; max-height: 270px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbPpdyn16sY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h3>5. Use digital noises and other signals to transition between activities.</h3> \n<p>Some brainstorms might involve a combination of individual and group activities. However, when the ideas are flowing in one task, it can be naturally hard to stop and jump into a new portion of the session. According to Margot Lieblich, a Sr. UX Researcher who coordinates monthly brainstorms and ideation sessions, it's even harder to manage time in a virtual meeting.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúOftentimes in brainstorms, you are on a tight schedule and need to make quick transitions to the next activity. This can be especially hard in a remote setting, when you can‚Äôt always visually signal to get everyone‚Äôs attention at once,\" Lieblich says.</p> \n<p>\"Use an audible timer to clearly mark the end of an activity. You can even get creative with the sound,\" Lieblich advises. \"I‚Äôve used the Oscars' theme music, and one of my coworkers uses the sound of a duck quacking.\"</p> \n<p>\"After hearing the timer once, the group will quickly learn to wrap up and start transitioning to the next activity when they hear the sound again,‚Äù Lieblich explains.</p> \n<h3>6. Include both group and individual brainstorm activities.</h3> \n<p>Some people work better by themselves while others work much better in groups. In a virtual brainstorm, this can become more apparent when those who don't respond to group activities zone out, and those who don't like to give individual pitches will wait until the end hoping they run out of time. By doing two activities, you ensure that everyone can ideate in their own confort zone.</p> \n<p>\"I like to start out with an individual activity so people have a few minutes to explore their own approaches to the problem space without influencing each other,\" Lieblich says. \"After running an individual activity, I incorporate a group activity so people can inspire each other and come up with even richer, more interesting ideas.‚Äù</p> \n<h3>7. Remember, you don't always need to schedule a video call.</h3> \n<p>While you might think all remote brainstorms must happen on video calls, this isn't always true. Yes, many of them certainly will. But, if you're asking teammates to come to a brainstorm prepared with something quick -- like a blog post pitch or a one-off email idea, you might be able to cut a time-consuming video call out of your brainstorming process entirely.</p> \n<p>Recently, when the blog team was drawing out our quarterly content strategy, we wanted to ask our writers to come up with ideas for blog posts. But, because each writer has an incredibly busy schedule, asking them to come to a very long brainstorm meeting where each person would offer five to 10 post suggestions didn't make logistical sense.</p> \n<p>So instead, I coordinated a virtual brainstorm that took place completely over Google Sheets. To kick off the brainstorm, I sent my team an email and an Idea Generation Spreadsheet with instructions on what content needs we'd have for the next quarter, how many post ideas to insert on the spreadsheet, and a deadline for submitting post suggestions.</p> \n<p>From there, writers had two weeks to offer ideas for at least five blog posts. Here's a quick look at the spreadsheet with an example post I gave writers to guide them through the elements of giving a post suggestion:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/7%20Tips%20for%20Hosting%20a%20Virtual%20Brainstorm,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketing%20Managers.png?width=600&amp;name=7%20Tips%20for%20Hosting%20a%20Virtual%20Brainstorm,%20According%20to%20HubSpot%20Marketing%20Managers.png\" alt=\"HubSpot Blog hosts a virtual brainstorm in a Google Sheet\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>After the deadline, our editors went in and used the spreadsheet's comment features to give feedback that writers could keep in mind for the next virtual brainstorm. Since this brainstorm, most of the blog posts suggested were added to our content calendar.</p> \n<h2>Planning Your Virtual Brainstorm</h2> \n<p>Many of the tips above relate to boosting one critical aspect of brainstorms: participation.</p> \n<p>As you plan your next content or campaign brainstorm, ask yourself how you can make the brainstorm engaging for everyone.</p> \n<p>By making it easier for your team to engage with others, give their thoughts, or suggest ideas in a brainstorm, you'll get more participation and -- ultimately -- more winning ideas from teammates that might not offer them otherwise.</p> \n<p>To learn about more brainstorming tactics, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brainstorm-productive\">read this blog post</a>.

Brainstorming, developing, launching, and promoting an app is a lot of work for a small company. In that same amount of time, you can launch a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28776/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-mastering-mobile-marketing.aspx\">mobile-optimized website or mobile email strateg</a>y that could earn you solid awareness and ROI.</p> \n<p>But, if you're a marketer at a digital startup, agency, or tech firm that thinks an app might be helpful for business, a more affordable development option could be on the horizon.</p> \n<p>In 2020, some tech companies are starting to invest in \"mini-apps.\" And, as these programs expand, there might be room for companies to test the waters with a more compact app experience.</p> \n<p>Mini-apps became a commodity on large-scale Chinese social media platforms <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/wechat-mini-programs/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM0j8haMgC_vAZ9AlTVy2WZJYhFLCjzbHx2IRrsoXUPYQoqv7L7J5CtTcLNr1h9_qomxre8Vm-610N0opOtTXHnImNdEunFeXYbCjJ6YY5kaq-fxGO1zEHQeLGBXBwk8pP24N_SWqVElgbZ8KKlBOi5dAIqeGqRVAsy45jSsn1eO\">as recently as 2017</a>.

These companies have begun to build out and launch similar programs to WeChat.</p> \n<p>But what exactly do these apps look like, and how do they benefit the brands that launched them? Below, I'll highlight a few major mini-program platforms and give you a look at what these mobile experiences look like for brands.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Early Mini-App Platforms</h2> \n<h3>WeChat Mini Programs</h3> \n<p>A 2017 report from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/wechat-mini-programs/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM0j8haMgC_vAZ9AlTVy2WZJYhFLCjzbHx2IRrsoXUPYQoqv7L7J5CtTcLNr1h9_qomxre8Vm-610N0opOtTXHnImNdEunFeXYbCjJ6YY5kaq-fxGO1zEHQeLGBXBwk8pP24N_SWqVElgbZ8KKlBOi5dAIqeGqRVAsy45jSsn1eO\">TechCrunch</a> described Mini-Programs as basic app experiences that could be accessed via WeChat. Although tech journalists describe these as mini-apps, Tencent could not label them as \"apps\" because they worried about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/wechat-mini-programs/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM0j8haMgC_vAZ9AlTVy2WZJYhFLCjzbHx2IRrsoXUPYQoqv7L7J5CtTcLNr1h9_qomxre8Vm-610N0opOtTXHnImNdEunFeXYbCjJ6YY5kaq-fxGO1zEHQeLGBXBwk8pP24N_SWqVElgbZ8KKlBOi5dAIqeGqRVAsy45jSsn1eO\">infringing upon Apple and Google trademarks</a>.</p> \n<p>To give you a visual perspective of how Mini-Programs look on WeChat, here's a screenshot of what users see when accessing them. Although the text is in Chinese, the app's native language, you can tell the programs are all sponsored by other companies:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-4.png?width=300&amp;name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-4.png\" alt=\"WeChat mini-app homescreen\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 10px;\"><a href=\"https://walkthechat.com/wechat-mini-programs-simple-introduction/\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>When you tap on a Mini-Program, such as Tesla's, you'll stay on the WeChat app, but enter a new experience within it. With Tesla's basic program, you can find charging stations for your car, or schedule test drives:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-1.png?width=600&amp;name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-1.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Tesla Mini-app on WeChat\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://walkthechat.com/wechat-mini-programs-simple-introduction/\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>For users, a mini-program like Tesla's gives them the ability to connect with friends on WeChat, while learning about Tesla in the same session. Meanwhile, Tesla's content spreads awareness about its business to possible audiences or buyers who use WeChat.</p> \n<p>At this point, the WeChat Mini Program is only available for the app's original Chinese version, Weixin. However, if a marketer is trying to grow awareness on this platform, <a href=\"https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/#Apply-for-an-account\">they can apply for a Mini Program account</a>. Mini-program app creators will require a developer to create the experience. According to a <a href=\"https://walkthechat.com/wechat-mini-programs-simple-introduction/\">WALKTHECHAT</a> review of mini-programs, this aspect can be somewhat tricky:</p> \n<p>\"Mini-programs have to be developed in a specific 'language' (a JavaScript framework developed by Tencent). Developers have to write WXML, WXSS instead of traditional HTML and CSS, and leverage this framework for all their development,\" <a href=\"https://walkthechat.com/wechat-mini-programs-simple-introduction/\">the 2019 post noted</a>.</p> \n<h3>Snap Minis</h3> \n<p>Snap Minis, <a href=\"https://minis.snapchat.com/\">announced in 2020</a>, are miniature branded experiences within the Snapchat app. To access Snap Minis, a user opens a chat with a friend or group. Then they'll click on the spaceship icon, which reveals a number of searchable mini-programs. These include a number of different branded experiences from games, to scheduling tools, to meditation applets.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care.png?width=200&amp;name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care.png\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Mini app experiences in the Snapchat mini program\">\n</div> \n<p>When users click on a miniature program, such as Headspace, they can interact with it in basic ways, such as playing daily meditations. You can also share in-app experiences, such as the meditations you listened to or a score on a gaming app, with your Snapchat contacts.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-3.png?width=200&amp;name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-3.png\" alt=\"Headspace mini experience within Snapchat\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>While <a href=\"https://walkthechat.com/wechat-mini-programs-simple-introduction/\">Tesla's WeChat Mini-Program</a> spreads awareness of the car brand and its physical store locations, Snap's Minis take things a step further as they offer content that audiences can share with others, rather than just interacting with it. This is a great option for tech marketers or digital brands that want people in the Snapchat demographic to actively share branded content with others in their community.</p> \n<p>According to Snapchat, some development work is required before launching a Mini on its platform, but it is unclear if Snap or the partnering company will do most of the app development. Snap does note that Minis are <a href=\"https://minis.snapchat.com/\">easy-to-use </a><a href=\"https://minis.snapchat.com/\">build</a><a href=\"https://minis.snapchat.com/\"> with HTML5 code</a>.</p> \n<p>At this point, brands interested <a href=\"https://minis.snapchat.com/\">must apply for early access</a> to the Minis program. In the Snap application, businesses must include their contact information and explain what they'd like the Mini to be used for.</p> \n<h3>Apple App Clips</h3> \n<p>At this point, Apple Clips will still be inaccessible for brands that can't make their own Apple App Store app. However, they are still an interesting example of mini-apps that are worth noting, especially if your brand does have an app.</p> \n<p>Apple App Clips, which launched with <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/\">iPhone IOS 10.14 update in 2020</a>, are small features of a larger app that's currently available in the App Store. <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/\">Users can access App Clips</a> by scanning QR codes, walking near an App Clip business with an NFC tag, visiting the brand's website, or clicking on a specially designed link, but users can also find them when using other apps, such as Apple's Messenger or Maps apps.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-2.png?width=600&amp;name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-2.png\" alt=\"Apple App clips mini app program\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>When someone is discussing or searching for something related to a business that has an Apple App Clip, a call-to-action will pop up allowing a user to \"Open\" the Clip without downloading a full app. From there, a user can then take advantage of one of the app's basic features.</p> \n<p>For example, if two friends are talking about a restaurant chain that has an app via text message, an App Clip CTA might pop up encouraging them to open the restaurant's Clip to see a menu. When the user enters the Clip experience, they can do <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/\">a small task</a>, such as scanning the menu or making a reservation. Users can also click a CTA in the App Clip to download the full program from the App Store.</p> \n<p>While companies who can't easily create an app probably won't benefit from App Clips, digital startups and tech companies should keep on their radar. Along with literally allowing people to test out an app before they download it, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/\">the App Clip CTA options</a> allow people to get notified about a brand's app when they walk near its store, are messaging friends about products the brand offers, or while searching local businesses on Maps. This enables app promotions to literally meet audiences where they are.</p> \n<h2>Mini-App Takeaways for Marketers</h2> \n<p>Although some mini-app programs, such as Apple and Snapchat's are more exclusive and less accessible to smaller brands right now, they could be a helpful marketing tool for more companies in the future. Here's what marketers should keep in mind as mini-app programs grow and expand.</p> \n<h3>1. Brands that embrace digital transformation will get better \"mini\" opportunities.</h3> \n<p>First of all, your brand will likely need to offer a digital tool or store that will improve another major app's experience. For example, Tesla's website already allowed you to look up car charging stations and schedule test drives, so turning this into a mini-app experience would be much easier for developers.</p> \n<p>Additionally, some of WeChat's audiences had an interest in technologies, cars, and Tesla's, which offered a business case for creating this experience. While audiences are zoning in on Tesla's offerings, they are still spending time on the WeChat app.</p> \n<p>Because you'll need a strong digital presence and online business capabilities, mini-apps might not be possible for many small businesses yet -- especially in the U.S. where they are just now being embraced. However, as the world becomes more connected to apps, this strategy could become more accessible to you later on.</p> \n<h3>2. Big apps will only host mutually beneficial mini-apps.</h3> \n<p>Think of mini-apps like a website integration or a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-cobranding-partnerships\">brand partnership project</a>. A major brand likely wouldn't have an integration with a competitor's tool or partner with a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-cobranding-partnerships\">business that doesn't target similar audiences</a>. In the mini-app space, the thinking might be similar.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, big app brands will opt to host mini-programs that spread awareness to businesses with similar audiences and offer digital experiences that keep users on their main app longer. This is likely why companies such as Snapchat and WeChat require brands to apply for their mini-programs, rather than just allowing them to buy space for a mini-app.</p> \n<h3>3. Brands will still need to do groundwork in creating mini-apps.</h3> \n<p>In some cases, you might not need your own in-house developer to have a mini-app. In WeChat's case, the company offers a mini-program where brands can apply and pay to have a mini-app experience made and launched for them.</p> \n<p>Despite the ease of working with some platforms, others like Apple will require you to already have developed an app. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://minis.snapchat.com/\">Snapchat's site</a> is unclear (at time of publication) about what creating a Mini fully entails.</p> \n<h3>4. Not all brands will be able to access \"mini\" partnerships.</h3> \n<p>Despite the opportunities that might exist with mini-apps, marketers -- especially at small companies -- should still keep in mind that this might not be applicable to them or their strategy.</p> \n<p>As noted above, large platforms that offer mini-programs will selectively look for partners who can offer digital tools or experiences that improve each user's time on their main app. And, even though larger platforms might be more involved with producing a mini experience for smaller brands, these partners will still likely spend some time and money on ensuring that their program offers a glitchless experience.</p> \n<p>The good news? Although many companies can't launch a mini-app, just yet, they don't necessarily need to. If you never see this tactic fitting into your strategy, there are plenty of ways you can boost mobile or online awareness without any sort of app.</p> \n<p>If you'd like to harness on mobile marketing alternatives without an app, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/28776/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-mastering-mobile-marketing.aspx\">this Ultimate Guide</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmini-apps&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e6cfa03457515bfd07f697737ae233df","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"pbump@hubspot.com (Pamela Bump)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-4.png?width=300&name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn24@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-48-130_ef124f95ff29029f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-1.png?width=600&name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn89@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-51-574_7cf9a95d04f9a19d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care.png?width=200&name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn17@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-49-983_4b28317df44ce98d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-3.png?width=200&name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-47-958_fbbae99f53d1dff3.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-2.png?width=600&name=What%20are%20Mini%20Apps%20%26%20Why%20Marketers%20Should%20Care-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn68@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-49-904_ae1fafce3b22bea0.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmini-apps&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn100@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-49-948_319f4c78eedec578.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389709},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"5 Myths About Video Marketing, Debunked","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/myths-about-video-marketing-debunked","description":"<p>By now, you've probably heard video marketing is a powerful tool for generating leads and capturing new customers.</p> \n<p>So why aren't you using it yet?</p>  \n<p>For many small to medium businesses, the reluctance to adopt video comes from a fear of the unknown.

Today's buyers and consumers actually appreciate authenticity over production value.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3002249/story-behind-stuff-consumers-growing-interest-real-products\">According to Fast Company</a>, consumers prefer lower quality but \"authentic\" goods and services over those of a higher quality but which seem \"inauthentic.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This craving for authenticity is why we're seeing such an explosion in micro-influencer marketing and user-generated content. With both of these marketing strategies, brands rely on their own buyers to create content, usually with little more than an iPhone.</p> \n<p>With your own video content, don't stress over having a low production budget if you have something valuable to say. For example, Vidyard produces <a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/resources/?categories%5B%5D=chalk-talks&amp;types%5B%5D=videos&amp;search=\">Chalk Talks</a> where they ask experts within their company to chat about topics like outbound sales, analytics, and video strategy in front of a chalkboard. The videos have been shared thousands of times, and the cost? A few minutes of someone's time and a lot of colored chalk.</p> \n<h3>2. Video is cumbersome.</h3> \n<p>What many small business owners typically mean by this is \"I don't know where to begin.\" When they think of video, they imagine a time-consuming process of coming up with scripts and storyboards, procuring actors and equipment, and hiring someone in jockey pants to operate the clapperboard and shout, \"Action!\" Yet modern video marketing is worlds apart from Hollywood and requires a lot less effort.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>When it comes to camera equipment, the age-old aphorism still holds true: the best camera is the one that's with you.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Today, most iPhone cameras rival all but the top-of-the-line DSLRs and video equipment and are a great substitute. You can easily capture videos of yourself, your office, events, and customers giving off-the-cuff testimonials when your sales and account teams pay them a visit.</p> \n<p>And when it comes to actors, don't worry that you can't afford <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2933757/\">Gal Gadot</a>: you don't need her. Your employees will do a far better job because they actually know your products, your customers, and the details of your industry. After the initial awkwardness of seeing themselves on camera fades, you'll have all the actors you need.</p> \n<p>And finally, not everything needs to be scripted. Writers are great and preparation has its place, but a lot of great content can be created with little or no forethought. Take entrepreneur and internet personality Gary Vaynerchuk, for example. He built a media empire from selfie videos recorded on his mobile phone. The below video of him giving advice to young entrepreneurs might be what the internet would call \"potato quality\" but it still gets the powerful point across.</p> \n<p>If you feel like you don't know where to start, <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/video-marketing\">HubSpot's Video Marketing course</a> can serve as a great guide to helping on your way.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin: 0px auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.07%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe hs-fullwidth-embed\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/vxTXCpxn6DE\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>3. Our industry doesn't really use video.</h3> \n<p>What most brands hopefully mean by this one is \"our industry doesn't use video<i> yet</i>.\" Video is industry agnostic and the demand is being driven not by businesses, but the people who work within them. Remember, both B2B and B2C are really just B2H (business-to-human), and humans love video. One need only look at the numbers for a reminder:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/content-marketing\">54% of people want to see more video content from marketers.</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/content-marketing\">Overall, 83% of consumers worldwide prefer YouTube to watch video content.</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/content-marketing\">Overall, 73% of consumers worldwide prefer seeing videos on social media that are \"entertaining.\"</a></li> \n <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/content-marketing\">In 2019, video was the #1 form of media used in content strategy, overtaking blogs and infographics.</a></li> \n</ul> In fact, the industries with the greatest opportunities are those where video has classically been underused. Just look at the recent proliferation of online video in places like real estate, where agencies are suddenly embracing everything from drone flyovers to virtual reality walk-throughs. To see similarly outsized gains ask yourself, \n<em>\"What would the people who make up our customer base, business or otherwise, like to see?\"</em> \n<h3>4. Video is hard to track.</h3> \n<p>Videos can indeed be difficult to track, but only if you're using a bare bones video hosting platform like YouTube or your website's video feature. These platforms only show you total video views which is like measuring your website's success based solely from visits.</p> \n<p>What if 95 percent of your video's viewers dropped off in the first three seconds? You'd never know. A true <a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/blog/choosing-a-video-platform-evaluate-for-marketing-and-sales/\">video enablement platform</a>, on the other hand, can give you insights into how people watch your videos, who they are, what they liked and didn't like, and what they did afterward.</p> \n<p>You see, video has some unique characteristics that make it highly trackable. Because it's linear and people watch it from end-to-end, video enablement platforms, like <a href=\"https://www.twentythree.net/\">TwentyThree</a> and <a href=\"https://wistia.com/\">Wistia</a>, can tell you what parts viewers watched, where they skipped, and where they revisited. From this, you can automatically infer an individual's interest in particular products or value propositions that appeared in the video.</p> \n<p>And, with CRM and marketing system integrations, you don't have to spend all your time on these analytics. You can trigger actions based on how your viewers watched the video. Did they only complete 25 percent of it? Better send them a different video. Did another viewer rewatch the part where the product is shown over and over? Better ping your sales team because you might have a qualified lead on your hands.</p> \n<h3>5. Video doesn't have enough uses.</h3> \n<p>Of all the excuses, this one invariably makes our editor cough and spit out her coffee in surprise. Video is perhaps the most dynamic and repurpose-able type of content that you have: It <a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/blog/businesses-see-500-lift-in-email-conversion-personalized-video/\">increases open rates for email</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/blog/top-10-optimize-landing-page-with-video-to-convert-more-customers/\">boosts click through rates for landing pages</a>, encourages shares on social media, increases time on page for websites, and drives more leads than text alone. And, with a great video editing platform, you can optimize one video for all channels.</p> \n<p>A good video editing platform provides small to medium businesses with the tools they need to easily cut up, edit, and optimize one video into many formats for many channels. This scales easily because users can easily A/B test videos just as they would an email and can render dynamic content to personalize videos to viewers, such as inserting logos, names, or even swapping out different products. With the right tools, video has more uses than you'll know what to do with.</p> \n<p>Video is easier than you think.</p> \n<p>Once you have the epiphany that unscripted and low production value videos are both desirable and trackable, you'll also realize that it's useful for more than just marketing and sales.</p> \n<p>You can use video in your customer support to demonstrate how to use your product, in your internal communications to update your remote teams, and as a way for people within your company to communicate on a day-to-day basis.</p> \n<p>So, knowing that video isn't nearly as expensive, difficult, or untraceable as you previously thought, are you ready to stop putting it off?</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2017 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><em></em></p> \n<p><em></em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmyths-about-video-marketing-debunked&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 21:15:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"714e74b71c8c7e8286aa4abe2e247bb3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"greg.kelly@vidyard.com (Greg Kelly)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmyths-about-video-marketing-debunked&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn91@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-50-608_ccfd6663751aecb1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389705},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"How to Automate Your Account-Based Marketing Strategy","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-automation","description":"<p>In today's day and age, marketing is all about personalization.</p> \n<p>It's about reaching the right people in the right place at the right time. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-guide\">Account-based marketing (ABM)</a> is no different and has been growing in popularity in recent years.</p>  \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-stats\">87% of account-based marketers say</a> ABM initiatives outperform other marketing investments.</p> \n<p>Plus, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-stats\">one in five accounts targeted through ABM </a>becomes considered a qualified sales opportunity.</p> \n<p>That's why ABM is an important tactic to implement if you sell high value B2B products or services to a finite number of companies who have a multi-person buying committee and require personalized content and engagement.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, that might seem like a daunting task, because you've probably felt the pain of tools that were hard to use, didn't integrate with your systems, or made collaboration among teams hard.</p> \n<p>That's why using marketing automation and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-software\">ABM software</a> to make the process seamless is a good idea.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review how to automate your account-based marketing strategy.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Create your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).</h3> \n<p>Before you can get started with ABM, you'll need to define your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/ideal-customer-profiles-and-buyer-personas-are-they-different\">ideal customer profile</a>. This is similar to a buyer persona, except it's built around targeting entire organizations rather than individuals.</p> \n<p>You'll want to know what types of companies you want to target. For example, your ICP should include information on company size, revenue, industry, and location.</p> \n<p>With software, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/abm-software\">HubSpot's ABM software</a>, you can use ICP workflow templates to help you spot common traits that can be used to classify companies in your database by how well they match your ICP.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, automation should help you identify and organize your target accounts. Once you've created your ICP, you should be able to use this information in your ABM software to manage your audience.</p> \n<h3>2. Set up your target accounts.</h3> \n<p>Once you've created your ICP, you should be able to set up your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-choose-target-accounts-account-based-marketing\">target accounts</a> in your ABM software.</p> \n<p>Tagging \"Target accounts\" in your software will enable you to manage your audience from a Target Accounts dashboard. For example, with <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/abm-software\">HubSpot's ABM software</a>, you can tag accounts as target accounts and then rank them with the ICP Tier property. Your priority accounts will be marked Tier 1, while lower priority accounts will be marked Tier 3.</p> \n<p>Additionally, a great ABM software will use AI-powered target account recommendations to automate the process of researching companies that are a good fit.</p> \n<p>These types of tools will help you manage and then segment your lists so you can deliver personalized content to your target accounts.</p> \n<h3>3. Integrate your ABM, marketing automation software, and CRM.</h3> \n<p>Before you can build your ABM campaigns, you'll want to integrate your ABM software with your marketing automation software and your <a href=\"http://hubspot.com/crm\">CRM</a>.</p> \n<p>For example, with HubSpot, you can use many of the ABM software features if you have Marketing or Sales Pro.</p> \n<p>Integrating your marketing tools is important in the automation process. If your ABM software doesn't interact with your email marketing software or your ads tools, then you won't be able to automate the process.</p> \n<p>Additionally, if it doesn't interact with your CRM, it'll be impossible to know if leads become accounts and track the ROI of an account-based campaign.</p> \n<p>By integrating these tools, you'll have your ICP research, target accounts, content, and CRM all in one place.</p> \n<h3>4. Build your campaigns.</h3> \n<p>When you have your ABM software and marketing tools set up, it's time to create your campaigns.</p> \n<p>To start, you'll want to decide what channels you want to use and what actions will trigger an automated workflow.</p> \n<p>First, look at your target accounts and find out where they spend their time online. For example, you can build an ad campaign based on people's job title or company on LinkedIn and Facebook.</p> \n<p>Then, you'll want to think about your customer journey and set up automated workflows. For instance, you can have a task created for a sales rep when someone who works at one of your target accounts interacts with an email, your website, or blog content.</p> \n<h3>5. Personalize your content.</h3> \n<p>You probably got started with ABM so you could personalize your marketing campaigns. To do this, you'll want to create your content, and use your automation tools to segment your audience.</p> \n<p>For example, with <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/abm-software\">HubSpot's ABM software</a>, you can use company lists to create an ad audience or use company ad targeting for your LinkedIn ads.</p> \n<p>With your ICP set up, it should be easy to create your content based on your target audience. The content in your ABM campaigns will be similar to other marketing content, except that you're now targeting specific accounts and companies.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, your messaging should address specific pain points, and appeal to solving your target account's problems.</p> \n<h3>6. Tailor your engagement.</h3> \n<p>Another aspect of your ABM strategy will be collaborating with your sales team so they can tailor their engagement with target accounts.</p> \n<p>A great way to do this is through automation tools. That's why it's important for your CRM and ABM software to work together.</p> \n<p>For example, with <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/abm-software\">HubSpot's ABM software</a> and Sales Hub, you can automate your follow up emails and tasks based on prospect behavior.</p> \n<p>However, remember that even though you're focusing on automation right now, your sales outreach and content should still be personalized.</p> \n<h3>7. Set up a dashboard to assess ongoing efforts.</h3> \n<p>The last step to automating your ABM strategy is to track and measure your efforts. With your ABM software, you'll want to see information at-a-glance.</p> \n<p>For instance, on your dashboard, you might include information on your target accounts such as company score, open deals, total pipeline, and the number of decision makers identified.</p> \n<p>If your ABM software has company scoring available, you should use it. This is similar to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-scoring-instructions\">lead scoring</a>, where you assign a score based on the properties in your software.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you should consider running <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing\">A/B tests</a> when you get started with ABM automation so you can see what messaging appeals to your ICP.</p> \n<p>While ABM does require thoughtful planning and coordination, using ABM software tools ‚Äî ideally ones that integrate with your CRM and marketing automation tools ‚Äî can help you automate and scale your strategy.</p> \n<p>For more information on HubSpot's offerings, read about our <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/abm-software\">ABM software</a>.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<div>\n <a class=\"close\">&nbsp;</a>\n</div>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faccount-based-marketing-automation&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3f2c0c1d3b7020a34927b5204b2f2fc0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Faccount-based-marketing-automation&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-52-519_b2eeefbd7333ce8e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389713},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"The Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Usability Testing [+ Sample Questions]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/usability-testing","description":"<p>My favorite part of the writing process is when my editor reviews my work. By the time I‚Äôve submitted the first draft of most of my blog posts, I‚Äôve invested so much time and effort into my piece that I‚Äôm <em>too</em> emotionally attached to it. I need to distance myself from it.</p> \n<p>My editor also has fresh editing eyes, so she can discover any overlooked errors and new creative opportunities to sharpen my piece. After I address her edits, my piece always looks more polished.</p>  \n<p>Asking other people to evaluate your work applies to almost every discipline, especially user experience and design. It's not smart to rely on yourself when evaluating your own product or website design. You're partial towards it, and that can skew your perception of reality. Learning directly from the people that your work is actually for -- your users -- is what enables you to craft the best user experience possible.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>UX and design professionals leverage usability testing to get user feedback on their product or website‚Äôs user experience all the time. So we interviewed some of HubSpot‚Äôs Senior UX Researchers and Designers to teach you what exactly usability testing is, its benefits, and how to effectively conduct your own study.</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>What is Usability Testing?</h2> \n <p>Usability testing is a method of evaluating a product or website‚Äôs user experience. By testing the usability of their product or website with a representative group of their users or customers, UX researchers can determine if their actual users can easily and intuitively use their product or website.</p> \n</div> \n<p>UX researchers will usually conduct usability studies on each iteration of their product from its early development to its release. This allows UX researchers to uncover any problems with their product's user experience, decide how to fix these problems, and ultimately determine if the product is usable enough.</p> \n<p>Identifying and fixing these early issues saves the company both time and money: developers don‚Äôt have to overhaul the code of a poorly designed product that‚Äôs already built, and the product team is more likely to release it on schedule.</p> \n<p>During a usability study, the moderator asks participants in their individual user session to complete a series of tasks while the rest of the team observes and takes notes. By watching their actual users navigate their product or website and listening to their praises and concerns about it, they can see when the participants can quickly and successfully complete tasks and where they‚Äôre enjoying the user experience, encountering problems, and experiencing confusion.</p> \n<p>After conducting their study, they‚Äôll analyze the results and report any interesting insights to the project lead.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of Usability Testing</h2> \n<p>Usability testing has five major advantages over the other methods of examining a product's user experience, like a questionnaire:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Usability testing provides an unbiased, accurate, and direct examination of your product or website‚Äôs user experience. By testing its usability on a sample of actual users who are detached from the amount of emotional investment your team has put into creating and designing the product or website, their feedback can resolve most of your team‚Äôs internal debates.</li> \n <li>Usability testing is convenient. To conduct your study, all you have to do is find a quiet room and bring in portable recording equipment. If you don‚Äôt have recording equipment, someone on your team can just take notes.</li> \n <li>Usability testing can tell you what your users do on your site or product and why they take these actions.</li> \n <li>Usability testing lets you address your product‚Äôs or website‚Äôs issues before you spend a ton of money creating something that ends up having a poor design.</li> \n <li>For your business, intuitive design boosts customer usage and their results, driving demand for your product.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Examples of What Usability Testing Can Do</h2> \n<p>Usability testing sounds great in theory, but what value does it provide in practice? Here's what it can do to actually make a difference for your product (with examples):</p> \n<h3>1. Identify points of friction in the usability of your product.</h3> \n<p>As Brian Halligan said at INBOUND 2019, \"Dollars flow where friction is low.\" This just as true in UX as it is in sales or customer service. The more friction your product has, the more reason your users will have to find something that's easier to use.</p> \n<p>Usability testing can uncover points of friction from customer feedback.</p> \n<p>For example: <em>\"My process begins in Google Drive. I keep switching between windows and making multiple clicks just to copy and paste from Drive into this interface.\"</em></p> \n<p>Even though the product team may have had that task in mind when they created the tool, seeing it in action and hearing the user's frustration uncovered a use case that the tool didn't compensate for. It might lead the team to solve for this problem by creating an easy import feature or way to access Drive within the interface to reduce the number of clicks the user needs to make to accomplish their task.</p> \n<h3>2. Stress test across many environments and use cases.</h3> \n<p>Our products don't exist in a vacuum, and sometimes development environments are unable to compensate for all the variables. Getting the product out and tested by users can uncover bugs that you may not have noticed while testing internally.</p> \n<p>For example: <em>\"The check boxes disappear when I click on them.\"</em></p> \n<p>Let's say that the team investigates why this might be, and they discover that the user is on a browser that's not commonly used (or a browser version that's outdated).</p> \n<p>If the developers only tested across the browsers used in-house, they may have missed this bug, and it could have resulted in customer frustration.</p> \n<h3>3. Provide diverse perspectives from your user base.</h3> \n<p>While individuals in our customer bases have a lot in common (in particular, the things that led them to need and use our products), each individual is unique and brings a different perspective to the table. These perspectives are invaluable in uncovering issues that may not have occurred to your team.</p> \n<p>For example: <em>\"I can't find where I'm supposed to click.\" </em></p> \n<p>Upon further investigation, it's possible that this feedback came from a user who is color blind, leading your team to realize that the color choices did not create enough contrast for this user to navigate properly.</p> \n<p>Insights from diverse perspectives can lead to design, architectural, copy, and accessibility improvements.</p> \n<h3>4. Give you clear insights into your product's strengths and weaknesses.</h3> \n<p>You likely have competitors in your industry whose products are better than yours in some areas and worse than yours in others. These variations in the market lead to competitive differences and opportunities. User feedback can help you close the gap on critical issues and identify what positioning is working.</p> \n<p>For example: <em>\"This interface is so much easier to use and more attractive than [competitor product]. I just wish that I could also do [task] with it.\"</em></p> \n<p>Two scenarios are possible based on that feedback:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Your product can already accomplish the task the user wants. You just have to make it clear that the feature exists by improving copy or navigation.</li> \n <li>You have a really good opportunity to incorporate such a feature in future iterations of the product.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>5. Inspire you with potential future additions or enhancements.</h3> \n<p>Speaking of future iterations, that comes to the next example of how usability testing can make a difference for your product: The feedback that you gather can inspire future improvements to your tool.</p> \n<p>It's not just about rooting out issues but also envisioning where you can go next that will make the most difference for your customers. And who best to ask but your prospective and current customers themselves?</p> \n<h2>The 9 Phases of a Usability Study</h2> \n<h3>1. Decide which part of your product or website you want to test.</h3> \n<p>Do you have any pressing questions about how your users will interact with certain parts of your design, like a particular interaction or workflow? Or are you wondering what users will do first when they land on your product page? Gather your thoughts about your product or website‚Äôs pros, cons, and areas of improvement, so you can create a solid hypothesis for your study.</p> \n<h3>2. Pick your study‚Äôs tasks.</h3> \n<p>Your participants' tasks should be your user‚Äôs most common goals when they interact with your product or website, like making a purchase.</p> \n<h3>3. Set a standard for success.</h3> \n<p>Once you know what to test and how to test it, make sure to set clear criteria to determine success for each task. For instance, when I was in a usability study for HubSpot‚Äôs Content Strategy tool, I had to add a blog post to a cluster and report exactly what I did. Setting a threshold of success and failure for each task lets you determine if your product's user experience is intuitive enough or not.</p> \n<h3>4. Write a study plan and script.</h3> \n<p>At the beginning of your script, you should include the purpose of the study, if you‚Äôll be recording, some background on the product or website, questions to learn about the participants‚Äô current knowledge of the product or website, and, finally, their tasks. To make your study consistent, unbiased, and scientific, moderators should follow the same script in each user session.</p> \n<h3>5. Delegate roles.</h3> \n<p>During your usability study, the moderator has to remain neutral, carefully guiding the participants through the tasks while strictly following the script. Whoever on your team is best at staying neutral, not giving into social pressure, and making participants feel comfortable while pushing them to complete the tasks should be your moderator</p> \n<p>Note-taking during the study&nbsp;is also just as important. If there‚Äôs no recorded data, you can‚Äôt extract any insights that‚Äôll prove or disprove your hypothesis. Your team‚Äôs most attentive listener should be your note-taker during the study.</p> \n<h3>6. Find your participants</h3> \n<p>Screening and recruiting the right&nbsp;participants is the hardest part of usability testing. Most usability experts suggest <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/ux-usability-research-testing/\">you should only test five participants during each study</a>, but your participants should also closely resemble your actual user base. With such a small sample size, it‚Äôs hard to replicate your actual user base in your study.</p> \n<p>To recruit the ideal participants for your study, create the most detailed and specific persona as you possibly can and incentivize them to participate with a gift card or another monetary reward.</p> \n<p>Recruiting colleagues from other departments who would potentially use your product is also another option. But you don‚Äôt want any of your team members to know the participants because their personal relationship can create bias -- since they want to be nice to each other, the researcher might help a user complete a task or the user might not want to constructively criticize the researcher‚Äôs product design.</p> \n<h3>7. Conduct the study.</h3> \n<p>During the actual study, you should ask your participants to complete one task at a time, without your help or guidance. If the participant asks you how to do something, don‚Äôt say anything. You want to see how long it takes users to figure out your interface.</p> \n<p>Asking participants to ‚Äúthink out loud‚Äù is also an effective tactic -- you‚Äôll know what‚Äôs going through a user‚Äôs head when they interact with your product or website.</p> \n<p>After they complete each task, ask for their feedback, like if they expected to see what they just saw, if they would‚Äôve completed the task if it wasn‚Äôt a test, if they would recommend your product to a friend, and what they would change about it. This qualitative data can pinpoint more pros and cons of your design.</p> \n<h3>8. Analyze your data.</h3> \n<p>You‚Äôll collect a ton of qualitative data after your study. Analyzing it will help you discover patterns of problems, gauge the severity of each usability issue, and provide design recommendations to the engineering team.</p> \n<p>When you analyze your data, make sure to pay attention to both the users‚Äô performance and their feelings about the product. It‚Äôs not unusual for a participant to quickly and successfully achieve your goal but still feel negatively about the product experience.</p> \n<h3>9. Report your findings.</h3> \n<p>After extracting insights from your data, report the main takeaways and lay out the next steps for improving your product or website‚Äôs design and the enhancements you expect to see during the next round of testing.</p> \n<h2>The 3 Most Common Types of Usability Tests</h2> \n<h3>1. Hallway/Guerilla Usability Testing</h3> \n<p>This is where you set up your study somewhere with a lot of foot traffic. It allows you to ask randomly-selected people who have most likely never even heard of your product or website -- like passers-by -- to evaluate its user-experience.</p> \n<h3>2. Remote/Unmoderated Usability Testing</h3> \n<p>Remote/unmoderated usability testing has two main advantages: it uses third-party software to recruit target participants for your study, so you can spend less time recruiting and more time researching. It also allows your participants to interact with your interface by themselves and in their natural environment -- the software can record video and audio of your user completing tasks.</p> \n<p>Letting participants interact with your design in their natural environment with no one breathing down their neck can give you more realistic, objective feedback. When you‚Äôre in the same room as your participants, it can prompt them to put more effort into completing your tasks since they don‚Äôt want to seem incompetent around an expert. Your perceived expertise can also lead to them to please you instead of being honest when you ask for their opinion, skewing your user experience's reactions and feedback.</p> \n<h3>3. Moderated Usability Testing</h3> \n<p>Moderated usability testing also has two main advantages: interacting with participants in person or through a video a call lets you ask them to elaborate on their comments if you don‚Äôt understand them, which is impossible to do in an unmoderated usability study. You‚Äôll also be able to help your users understand the task and keep them on track if your instructions don‚Äôt initially register with them.</p> \n<h2>Usability Testing Script &amp; Questions</h2> \n<p>Following one script or even a template of questions for every one of your usability studies wouldn't make any sense -- each study's subject matter is different. You'll need to tailor your questions to the things you want to learn, but most importantly, you'll need to know&nbsp;<em>how </em>to ask good questions.</p> \n<h3>1. When you [action], what's the first thing you do to [goal]?</h3> \n<p>Questions such as this one give insight into how users are inclined to interact with the tool and what their natural behavior is.</p> \n<p>Julie Fischer, one of HubSpot's Senior UX researchers, gives this advice:<em> \"Don't ask leading questions that insert your own bias or opinion into the participants' mind. They'll end up doing what you want them to do instead of what they would do by themselves.\"</em></p> \n<p>For example, <em>\"Find [x]\"</em> is a better than <em>\"Are you able to easily find [x]?\"</em> The latter inserts connotation that may affect how they use the product or answer the question.</p> \n<h3>2. How satisfied are you with the [attribute] of [feature]?</h3> \n<p>Avoid leading the participants by asking questions like <em>\"Is this feature too complicated?\"</em> Instead, gauge their satisfaction on a Likert scale that provides a number range from highly unsatisfied to highly satisfied. This will provide a less biased result than leading them to a negative answer they may not otherwise have had.</p> \n<h3>3. How do you use [feature]?</h3> \n<p>There may be multiple ways to achieve the same goal or utilize the same feature. This question will help uncover how users interact with a specific aspect of the product and what they find valuable.</p> \n<h3>4. What parts of [the product] do you use the most? Why?</h3> \n<p>This question is meant to help you understand the strengths of the product and what about it creates raving fans. This will indicate what you should absolutely keep and perhaps even lead to insights into what you can improve for other features.</p> \n<h3>5. What parts of [the product] do you use the least? Why?</h3> \n<p>This question is meant to uncover the weaknesses of the product or the friction in its use. That way, you can rectify any issues or plan future improvements to close the gap between user expectations and reality.</p> \n<h3>6. If you could change one thing about [feature] what would it be?</h3> \n<p>Because it's so similar to #5, you may get some of the same answers. However, you'd be surprised about the aspirational things that your users might say here.</p> \n<h3>7. What do you expect [action/feature] to do?</h3> \n<p>Here's another tip from Julie Fischer:</p> \n<p><em>\"When participants ask 'What will this do?' it's best to reply with the question 'What do you expect it do?' rather than telling them the answer.\" </em></p> \n<p>Doing this can uncover user expectation as well as clarity issues with the copy.</p> \n<h2>Your Work Could Always Use a Fresh Perspective</h2> \n<p>Letting another person review and possibly criticize your work takes courage -- no one wants a bruised ego. But most of the time, when you allow people to constructively criticize or even rip apart your article or product design, especially when your work is intended to help these people, your final result will be better than you could've ever imagined.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fusability-testing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Oct 2020 11:30:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0368000f507a8533c852cd2053f1bb60","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fusability-testing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-45-743_0fa459bd2fa98605.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389705},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"How to Craft Brand Messaging Your Target Audience Will Love","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-communication-strategy","description":"<p>As a consumer ‚Äî and a marketer ‚Äî one of my favorite <a href=\"https://info.restaurantspacesevent.com/blog/taco-bell-reinvents-itself-into-a-full-fledged-lifestyle-brand\">brands to watch is Taco Bell</a>. In the last five years or so, Taco Bell has begun making strides in its brand messaging.</p>  \n<p>The brand has reinvented itself on social media, introducing a new, bold personality. With its food, packaging, marketing campaigns, events, philanthropic efforts, and interior design, Taco Bell reinvented itself into a full on lifestyle brand.</p> \n<p>Doing this ‚Äî telling a compelling brand story through messaging ‚Äî isn't easy.</p> \n<p>Marketers need to have an entire brand identity to communicate what their business does, what it's about, and why it's different. Oh, and it needs to resonate with people and strengthen your company's values and reputation.</p> \n<p>This is because, according to research from Bergische University, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mar.20805\">brands produce similar feelings as the ones we feel when we like someone</a>. So, we actually feel similarly about brands as we do about people.</p> \n<p>That's why marketers need to craft brand messaging that their audience can relate to.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review brand messaging ‚Äî what it is and a framework to get started.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>It's how your consumers can have a relationship with your brand. Ultimately, it's the culmination of language, design, events, and philanthropic efforts that tell the story of who your brand is.</p> \n<p>So, how do you get started crafting brand messaging that your target audience will love?</p> \n<p>You need to know two things like the back of your hand: your target audience and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/unique-selling-proposition\">unique value proposition</a>.</p> \n<p>Then, you can begin to write out a brand identity that'll help your company make all its marketing decisions. Would a brand that cares about \"X\" do this? Would a brand that's motivated by \"Y\" sell this?</p> \n<p>Your brand identity will inform your company's behavior because it'll tell you why your brand matters, what it stands for, and why it's different from other brands.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity\">brand identity</a> that your audience relates to and has a personality ‚Äî or talks to your audience like a friend ‚Äî is how you'll continue to remain relevant to your consumers and create <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-loyalty\">loyal customers</a>.</p> \n<h2>Brand Message Framework</h2> \n<p>With a full understanding of brand messaging and creating a brand identity, you might be wondering, <i>\"Now what? How do I get started?\"</i></p> \n<p>And it's a fair question. That's why we've created a brand message framework that you can use to begin crafting a brand message or identity.</p> \n<h3>1. Figure out who you are.</h3> \n<p>To get started, your brand message needs to answer these questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How do you differentiate from your competitors?</li> \n <li>What is your unique value proposition?</li> \n <li>What kind of messaging will resonate with your target audience?</li> \n <li>Who is your target audience? What do they care about?</li> \n <li>Does your brand message tell a story?</li> \n <li>What are your company's goals? (No one is perfect and your target audience can't relate to a seemingly perfect brand).</li> \n <li>What are your company's values?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While you're answering these questions and beginning to map out who your brand identity is and what your brand messaging will look like, remember that your brand message answers the question, <i>why?</i> Why does your audience care?</p> \n<h3>2. Know your audience.</h3> \n<p>Now that you have a better idea of what you offer and who you are, you need to understand who your audience is. If you haven't already, create <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/ideal-customer-profiles-and-buyer-personas-are-they-different\">buyer personas</a> that represent who your customers are and their goals. This will help you find alignment between your brand and your consumers.</p> \n<h3>3. Start a document that explains your brand message.</h3> \n<p>After you've answered the questions above and written out your personas, begin compiling this information in a document that explains what your brand message is, your unique value proposition, and key themes that are core to your brand identity.</p> \n<p>Then, start to figure out how your brand identity relates to your buyer persona. What are the patterns and what do they have in common? This is how you'll make decisions on brand messaging. You'll see what your audience cares about that align with your values and can derive messaging opportunities.</p> \n<h3>4. Brainstorm messaging opportunities.</h3> \n<p>With a clear document that represents who you are and who your audience is, you can then begin to look for messaging opportunities. How can you relate your current campaigns to your brand message? How can you use content to convey your values?</p> \n<p>Once you have an idea, you can create a tagline that communicates who you are and your unique value proposition.</p> \n<p>At this point, you should have created a brand message and identity that'll inform your messaging. Now, we wanted to review a few tips for creating messaging that stays true to your brand:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong> Stay focused on the brand positioning: </strong>With all the content you write, ask yourself, <i>\"Is this true to our values?\"</i></li> \n <li><strong> Relate to your audience: </strong>When you create content, use your buyer personas and brand messaging document to ensure that you're talking about something that's relevant to your audience.</li> \n <li><strong> Don't be perfect: </strong>Similarly to the point above, people aren't perfect and brands shouldn't be either. Don't over promise and communicate that you're perfect, because you aren't and it'll come off disingenuous.</li> \n <li><strong> Communicate your message everywhere: </strong>In everything you write and all your marketing decisions, think about your brand message. Whether you're writing copy for your website, creating slogans for packaging, or marketing an event, your copy needs to communicate your brand message.</li> \n <li><strong> Be simple: </strong>Keep it simple. If your brand's personality or overall values are confusing or hard to discern, people won't relate to you. The last thing you want to do is create a brand message that your audience is confused by.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.tacobell.com/\">Taco Bell</a></h3> \n<p>As mentioned above, Taco Bell has started to create a reputation for its strong, funny brand. If you tweet them, they will likely respond with a humorous comment.</p> \n<p>The goal is to be so relatable that customers love to interact and talk about Taco Bell. When people are talking about you and with you, they're more likely to be loyal customers.</p> \n<p>Below is an example of a tweet that represents Taco Bell's brand identity and messaging. They respond to tweets like a sarcastic, funny best friend would.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/taco-bell-example.jpg?width=600&amp;name=taco-bell-example.jpg\" alt=\"Taco Bell tweets a customer in a funny, sarcastic tone.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tacobell/status/1201677471768203264\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.theskimm.com/\">TheSkimm</a></h3> \n<p>TheSkimm is a daily newsletter that aims to quickly inform young women of current events. The brand is known for having a bold, witty personality similar to that of its target audience ‚Äî millennial women.</p> \n<p>The goal? To mirror its target audience. Act like the fun, irreverent best friend to help readers get started with their day.</p> \n<p>In the tweet below, theSkimm stays true to its <a href=\"https://www.brandchannel.com/2016/09/30/theskimm-093016/\">brand messaging and identity</a> by starting off with a sharp, witty comment on Congress.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/the-skimm-example.jpg?width=600&amp;name=the-skimm-example.jpg\" alt=\"The Skimm showcases its personality through brand messaging.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/theskimm/status/1205246833427177472\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.wearproclaim.com/\">Proclaim</a></h3> \n<p>Proclaim is a lingerie line that is \"expanding the definition of nude, one ethically made bra at a time.\" They tackle the lack of inclusivity in women's undergarments by creating products for all skin tones, and they do it with sustainable, Earth-friendly products. This value proposition is combined with their messaging, which celebrates diversity and nature.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/proclaim-brand-messaging.jpg?width=600&amp;name=proclaim-brand-messaging.jpg\" alt=\"proclaim's brand that celebrates diverse models and products in nature settings\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wearproclaim/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://fabfitfun.com/\">FabFitFun</a></h3> \n<p>When I think of FabFitFun, I think of trendy products that are popular with self-care influencers. The brand has cultivated a following by partnering with influencers on Instagram who are trendy, fashionable, and take care of themselves.</p> \n<p>And this image of self-care and trendy products is carried out through its content as well. Below, the company tweeted its blog about trendy tech accessories. This type of content is right in line with the brand messaging consumers hear about on Instagram.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/fab-fit-fun-example.jpg?width=600&amp;name=fab-fit-fun-example.jpg\" alt=\"FabFitFun tweets blog aligning with personality and customer personas.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 11px;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FabFitFun/status/1204844753344331776\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.traderjoes.com/\">Trader Joe's</a></h3> \n<p>Trader Joe's is a grocery store that has created an almost cult-like following through its brand messaging. They are a fun, cheap, organic food store with a small-town, neighborhood feel. For example, they even put out an old-fashioned newsletter called the \"Fearless Flyer.\" This includes product roundups and recipes.</p> \n<p>The content Trader Joe's puts out reinforces its brand image as a small, neighborhood grocery store. With brand messaging that is consistent with its unique value proposition and personality, customers relate to the brand as if it were a person.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/trader-joes-example.jpg?width=444&amp;name=trader-joes-example.jpg\" alt=\"Trader Joes newsletter reveals brand identity.\" width=\"444\" style=\"width: 444px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.taylorswift.com/\">Taylor Swift</a></h3> \n<p>Besides the fact that Taylor Swift is one of my favorite singer/songwriters, I had to include her because her brand messaging is on point.</p> \n<p>From the time she was 16, Taylor Swift has used social media and brand messaging to connect with her fans. This is another example of someone who has created a cult-like following through brand messaging.</p> \n<p>Taylor Swift's brand is that she's like the girl next door, something her audience relates with. In the example below, someone on Tumblr posted a tweet on Swift's birthday, and Swift responded like ‚Ä¶ well, like the girl next door. A fun, outgoing best friend you can easily talk to on social media.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/taylor-swift-example.jpg?width=344&amp;name=taylor-swift-example.jpg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift uses Tumblr to reveal personality and brand identity.\" width=\"344\" style=\"width: 344px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://taylorswift.tumblr.com/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://hillaryweiss.com/\">Hillary Weiss</a></h3> \n<p>Large brands have more resources to invest into branding and awareness, so this list would not be complete without at least one personal brand (since I'm not sure that Taylor counts). Hillary Weiss is a great example to look to if you want an example of brand messaging that speaks directly to prospects. Her personality literally jumps off the page...</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hillary-weiss-brand-messaging.jpg?width=600&amp;name=hillary-weiss-brand-messaging.jpg\" alt=\"hillary weiss brand messaging: big ideas that stomp off the screen (along with photo of her coming out of a laptop screen)\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>... And it's her goal to make others' do the same with their brand positioning and copywriting. She comes right out and says it on her website:</p> \n<p>\"I'm Hillary Weiss, and I turn small businesses like yours into HUGE obsessions. Since 2011, I‚Äôve helped thousands of personality-fueled brands define their Statement Piece ‚Äî a.k.a. the big idea that makes them unmissable in their market, and radically relevant to their perfect people. Now it‚Äôs your turn. Let‚Äôs get loud (and rich) together.\"</p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/\">Loom</a></h3> \n<p>Good messaging often comes down to conveying value to your target audience and why you're doing what you're doing. Loom is a great example of this, and it helps that they have an amazing product.</p> \n<p>Their homepage says, \"Say it with video\" along with their tagline: \"The expressiveness of video with the convenience of messaging. Communicate more effectively wherever you work with Loom.\" The rest of their website backs up the assertion with facts to provide their point. For example, \"You talk up to 6 times faster than you type\" and \"Video conveys emotion and tone of voice that text simply can't.\"</p> \n<p>Even better, their brand messaging is further underscored in the testimonials of brand evangelists who truly believe in this value:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/loom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@loom</a> you‚Äôre changing lives over here. I know <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imcatnoone?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@imcatnoone</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConnorPM?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ConnorPM</a> feel similarly. <a href=\"https://t.co/a9qzt1shfm\">pic.twitter.com/a9qzt1shfm</a></p> ‚Äî Alberto Orsini üáµüá∑ (@albertojorsini) \n <a href=\"https://twitter.com/albertojorsini/status/1299392126632046596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 28, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>  \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://www.dove.com/us/en/dove-self-esteem-project/our-mission.html#\">Dove</a></h3> \n<p>Branding goes so further than what you sell and why it's valuable. Dove recognizes this by making their brand about more than just having the best soap and care products. To them, their products mean enhancing the natural beauty of their customers and (more importantly) that beauty should be \"a source of confidence, not anxiety.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dove-brand-messaging.jpg?width=600&amp;name=dove-brand-messaging.jpg\" alt=\"dove's mission statement brand messaging\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>That's why Dove invests into realizing that mission with their Self-Esteem Project and taking a different approach with their advertising than simply discussing the features of their soap.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 623px; max-height: 350px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.18%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XpaOjMXyJGk?autoplay=0&amp;fs=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0\" width=\"623\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"https://metierbrewing.com/\">M√©tier Brewing Company</a></h3> \n<p>Speaking of missions, M√©tier Brewing Company, founded in 2018, isn't just a brewery; it's an organization that's embedded in the community (and that means making the community better). According to their website, \"Great beer should be for everyone, and we don‚Äôt just mean the people drinking it.

Get notifications when your favorite people post.</h3> \n<p>Never want to miss an Instagram post from your favorite influencers again? You can choose to get a notification every time a specific user posts a new photo. All you have to do is turn on notifications for each user individually.</p> \n<p>To turn on these notifications, visit a user's profile, click the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the post, click \"Notifications\" from the menu, and finally toggle on notifications for either posts or stories from the menu that appears.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8577%20copy-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8577%20copy-1.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram account to get notifications when influencers post\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8578.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8578.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram account to get notifications when influencers post\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8579.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8579.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram account to get notifications when influencers post\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Instagram Account: </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thesisterstudioig/?hl=en\" style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Jen Reed @thesisterstudioig</a></p> \n<p>Want to turn post notifications off? Just follow the same steps. It's important to note that you must enable notifications from the Instagram app in your phone's settings ‚Äî here's how.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>To allow notifications on iPhone/iPad:</strong> Go to \"Settings,\" then \"Notifications.\" Choose \"Instagram\" and then turn on the setting to \"Allow Notifications.\"</li> \n <li><strong>To allow notifications on Android:</strong> Go to \"Settings,\" then choose \"Apps,\" then \"Instagram.\" Select the option to show notifications.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Add special fonts to your bio.</h3> \n<p>Here's an Instagram bio hack that can truly make your profile stand out. You can already add emojis to the bio beneath your profile photo, but your keyboard limits your creativity right there.</p> \n<p>Using a couple of basic third-party websites, you can copy over some more special fonts not often found in the Instagram community. Here's how.</p> \n<h4>To Add a Special Font to Your Bio via Mobile:</h4> \n<p>Add a new font to your Instagram bio via your mobile device using a website like <a href=\"https://lingojam.com/FontsForInstagram\">LingoJam</a>. Open the site on your phone, type your desired bio text in the lefthand text box, and you'll see the same bio text in different typefaces appear on the right.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/instagram-bio-hack-new-fonts-1.png\" alt=\"how to add special font to bio with a tool like lingojam\"></p> \n<p>Carry your chosen font over to your Instagram bio by tapping it and selecting \"Copy.\" Then, open your Instagram app, navigate to your profile, select \"Edit Profile,\" tap the \"Bio\" section and paste your chosen font into the empty field.</p> \n<h4>To Add a Special Font to Your Bio on Desktop:</h4> \n<p>If you're editing your Instagram profile on your laptop or desktop, <a href=\"http://www.fontspace.com/category/instagram\">Font Space</a> has a library of fonts you can download and copy into your bio in seconds. To do so, Find a font you like and select \"Download\" beneath the font's sample image, as shown below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/download-font-for-instagram.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"cursive font of someone's name\"></p> \n<p>Downloading this font will open a folder on your desktop where you can pull a \".ttf\" file that carries the various versions of this font. The file will look something like the screenshot below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/cassandra-font-for-instagram-bio.png\" alt=\"copying special font to paste it into instagram\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Once you have this font copied to your computer's clipboard, open your internet browser and log onto Instagram.com. Select \"Edit Profile\" and paste your downloaded font into your bio field. You can then edit the sample text that came with your font to write your new bio as you see fit.</p> \n<h3>3. Add special characters to your bio.</h3> \n<p>Not only can you customize your bio with a special font, but you can also add atypical characters that distinguish you or your brand ‚Äî but that you wouldn't find on your smartphone's normal keyboard. These include <span>¬ß, </span><span>‚Ä†, or even <span>‚Ñ¢ if your Instagram name features a trademarked product name.</span></span></p> \n<h4>To Add Special Characters From Mobile</h4> \n<p>Using your mobile device, install a free mobile app like <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/character-pad/id418874651\">Character Pad</a>, which catalogs nearly every character and symbol you might need but won't find in the 26-letter English alphabet.</p> \n<p>Open the app and find the character you want to add to your Instagram bio. In Character Pad, you'll simply double-tap the picture of your chosen symbol to paste it into a text box, as shown below. Then, copy this character to your phone's clipboard. (For our purposes, I double-tapped the half moon icon.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8580-min.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8580-min.png\" alt=\"using character pad the app to find a special character like a moon\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Once you have your symbol copied to your clipboard, open Instagram, navigate to your bio, and tap \"Edit Profile.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8582.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8582.jpg\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"someone's instagram account to click edit profile to add character to bio\"></p> \n<p>Hold down your finger on the field of your bio you want to insert your special character until \"Paste\" appears as an option, as shown below. Tap \"Paste\" and then \"Done\" you'll be all set.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8581-min.png?width=1125&amp;name=IMG_8581-min.png\" alt=\"someone's instagram bio with moon\" width=\"1125\" style=\"width: 1125px;\"></p> \n<h4>To Add Special Characters From a PC</h4> \n<p>You can also insert special characters and symbols through Instagram's web client on a desktop or laptop computer. The easiest way is to use Microsoft Word's \"Symbol\" insertion icon, as shown below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ms-word-insert-symbol.jpg?width=400&amp;name=ms-word-insert-symbol.jpg\" alt=\"ms-word-insert-symbol\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Select your desired symbol or character and copy it to your computer's clipboard. Then, navigate to Instagram.com and follow the steps above to paste your character into a particular part of your bio.</p> \n<p>You might be tempted to simply Google search the special character you want, and at times it might work just as well as the steps above. But keep in mind not all special characters you copy from the internet are \"clean\" when you paste them into Instagram ‚Äî some of them might become corrupted or not show up correctly.</p> \n<h3>4. Search Instagram users without an account.</h3> \n<p>As much as Instagram would like to see you ultimately create an account for yourself or your business, you can peruse the beautiful brands, people, and dogs that are waiting for you without an account to see if it's worth signing up.</p> \n<p>There are two ways to search for people on Instagram without logging in:</p> \n<h4>Entering a Username at the End of the Instagram URL</h4> \n<p>The first way to search users without an account is by using an Instagram username you already know, and adding it to the end of \"www.instagram.com/.\"</p> \n<p>For example, if you were to start with our Instagram username ‚Äî which is simply \"HubSpot\" ‚Äî you can enter the following into your browser's address bar: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/hubspot\">www.instagram.com/hubspot</a>. This will bring you to our Instagram profile <em>as well as </em>the elusive search bar at the top of the page:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%2010.50.33%20AM-min%20(1).png?width=2310&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%2010.50.33%20AM-min%20(1).png\" alt=\"desktop version of hubspot instagram account \" width=\"2310\" style=\"width: 2310px;\"></p> \n<p>Once you've reached this page, you can use the search bar to the left of the \"Sign Up\" button to browse users who are already active on the platform.</p> \n<h4>Googling Them in an Instagram Site Search</h4> \n<p>A slightly \"hackier\" way of looking up users without an Instagram account of your own is to simply search their name in a Google site search. This means telling Google to only look up search terms on a website of your choice (in this case, Instagram).</p> \n<p>To site search a user, open a Google search and type the following: \"<strong>site:instagram.com [name of user]</strong>.\"</p> \n<p>By keeping all the text prior to the brackets in your search bar, you can shuffle through names of people and businesses and Google will produce results that live <em>only</em> on Instagram. Here's what a site search looks like for HubSpot, below. As you can see, Google produces our main profile, our culture-focused HubSpot Life profile, Instagram posts that include the #hubspot hashtag, and our HubSpot Academy Page.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/google-site-search-hubspot-instagram.png\" alt=\"Google site search for HubSpot, allowing you to search Instagram users without an account\"></p> \n<h3>5. See all the posts you've liked.</h3> \n<p>Ever wanted to see the posts you've Liked, all in one place? All you have to do is go to your own profile and click the \"Settings\" button in the top right ‚Äî a gear icon on iPhone/iPad, and three dots on Android ‚Äî then, click \"Account\", and finally \"Posts You've Liked.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8584.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8584.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to click account to find out posts you've liked\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8585.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8585.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to click account to find out posts you've liked\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>To un-Like any of the posts you've Liked, simply go to the post and deselect the \"heart\" icon below it. Don't worry ‚Äî the user won't be notified that you've un-Liked the post.</p> \n<h3>6. Add and manage multiple accounts from the same device.</h3> \n<p>Have a separate account for your dog? Don't be embarrassed; stand by your puppy profile. In fact, whether it's a pet account or a business account, you can add and manage this one right alongside your personal account.</p> \n<p>Here's how:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>From your profile, tap the gear icon. To find this icon on an Android device, you'll first need to tap the three horizontal lines to the top right of your screen.</li> \n <li>Scroll to the very bottom and tap \"Add Account.\"</li> \n <li>Add your other account by username and password, and you're all set.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>To toggle between both profiles, hold down your profile picture in the navigation bar to view all connected accounts. You can also switch to a different account through the Settings page mentioned earlier. See what this screen looks like in the next Instagram feature, below.</p> \n<h3>7. Schedule posts in advance.</h3> \n<p>Instagram being a mobile app, you're probably in a routine of taking photos and posting them to your Instagram Story on the fly. But, you can also pre-post them from your computer for a set day and time in the future.</p> \n<p>This feature is available with a social media scheduling tool, <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/social/how-to-use-instagram-publishing-in-hubspot\">as well as HubSpot</a> if you have an Instagram business account. If you have this business profile, switch to it via the Instagram mobile app and follow the prompts to connect it to Facebook.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-account.jpg?width=450&amp;name=professional-account.jpg\" alt=\"how to switch to instagram professional account\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Depending on the social scheduling tool you use, you might not include this step. Once you've toggled to the right account, however, you'll launch your scheduling tool, navigate to your current connected profiles, and see Instagram as an available integration.</p> \n<h3>8. Optimize your Instagram bio to appear in the Explore tab.</h3> \n<p>Your friends, family, and coworkers might be your first group of Instagram followers, but growing your audience takes more than the people who already know you. One key way to do this is to get your profile to appear in Instagram's Explore page.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/explore-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=explore-1.jpg\" alt=\"instagram explore page\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>The Explore page, accessible using the magnifying glass icon shown above, is a browsing page that sorts the entire Instagram community by topic and keyword. These include \"Fitness,\" \"Style,\" \"Science,\" and more.</p> \n<p>Hashtagging your posts with these words can expose your content to the people browsing these topics, but you can also use them in your Instagram name and bio to promote your profile.</p> \n<p>If Jane Doe is a marketing consultant, for example, she might want to make her Instagram name \"Jane Doe Marketing,\" rather than simply \"Jane Doe.\" Then, in her bio, she can include all of her specialties, such as \"SEO,\" \"blogging,\" \"email marketing,\" etc.</p> \n<h3>9. Create a collection of saved posts.</h3> \n<p>In addition to being able to view all of the posts you've liked, Instagram also has an option to save or bookmark certain posts in collections that you create.</p> \n<p>Start by going to your profile, and tapping the \"Settings\" icon at the top-right of your screen, and then select \"Saved\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8585%20copy.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8585%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to find saved posts\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Next, press the \"+\" button and name your new Collection. <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8588-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8588-1.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to find saved posts\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Click \"Next\", and select images from your \"Saved\" section.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8589.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8589.png\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to find saved posts\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>To save photos for future collections, tap the bookmark icon below the post you want to add, as shown below:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8590.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8590.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to find saved posts\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Then, go back to your saved photos by following the previous steps.</p> \n<p>You'll see the photos you've saved ‚Äî to add them to your Collection, select the Collection you want to add to, and tap \"Add to Collection.\" From there, you can add any of your saved photos.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8591.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8591.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to find saved posts\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>10. Use 'Type Mode' to enhance your Instagram Stories.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories\">Instagram Stories</a> is a feature of Instagram that allows you to post ephemeral photos that show up separately from your profile and only last 24 hours. It's a great function for helping like-minded users discover your profile on Instagram's homepage.</p> \n<p>But since its beginning, Stories have become quite creative, and it takes more than a pretty filter to stand out to your audience. Enter \"Type Mode,\" an option similar to Snapchat that gives you the power to caption Stories that need extra context to resonate with someone. Here's how to use it:</p> \n<p>1. Open Instagram Stories by swiping right from your Instagram feed. This will launch your smartphone camera. Then, take a photo or video and press the \"Aa\" icon to the top-right of your screen, as shown below:</p> \n<h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8593.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8593.jpg\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"the text button on an instagram story to add text\"></h3> \n<p>This \"Aa\" icon will open Type Mode, where you have five fonts to choose from: <strong>Modern</strong>, <strong>Neon</strong>, <strong>Typewriter</strong>, <strong>Strong</strong>, and <strong>Classic</strong>. Here's what a sample Story looks like with Modern font:</p> \n<h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8594-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8594-1.jpg\" alt=\"adding text to instagram story\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></h3> \n<h3>11. Create Stories Highlights to show Stories for longer than a day.</h3> \n<p>Like in Snapchat, posts to your story only stick around for your followers to see for 24 hours. But sometimes, you have a story that deserves more daylight to be told.</p> \n<p>That's where Stories Highlights comes in, a feature by Instagram that allows you to save stories together in the same space on your profile page. If you ever wondered what that \"New\" button with the \"+\" icon was below your profile image, this explains it.</p> \n<p>To make a Stories Highlight, tap this New option and select any number of past stories in your album:</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram%20tricks%20stories%20highlights%20pictures.jpg?width=450&amp;name=instagram%20tricks%20stories%20highlights%20pictures.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram Stories Highlights are highlighted from this page of past pictures\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Instagram Stories Highlights are highlighted from this page of past pictures\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.01em; text-align: center;\">Image via </span>\n<a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/stories-highlights-and-archive/\" style=\"font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.01em; text-align: center;\">Instagram</a> \n<p>Then, give it a cover photo and a name to display as its own Instagram Story on your profile page. You can remove Stories Highlights at any time by tapping and holding down this story.</p> \n<h3>12. Post content from other users to your Instagram Story.</h3> \n<p>Although Instagram Stories are a great way to give your content exposure on your followers' homepages, you might not always have something Story-worthy. In those times, you can share an inspiring post from someone else through your Instagram Stories. Here's how:</p> \n<p>1. Find a post you want to share in your Instagram Stories and tap the paper airplane icon, as shown below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8596-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8596-1.jpg\" alt=\"freddy's usa instagram post of french fries to add to instagram story\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\">Instagram Account: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/freddysusa/?hl=en\">@Freddysusa</a></p> \n<p>This icon will open a screen allowing you to send this post to specific followers, or add to your Story. Tap the latter option, as shown below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8597-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8597-1.jpg\" alt=\"adding someone's post to my instagram story\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Tapping this option will automatically turn the post into an Instagram Story, which you can edit and design to your liking the same way you would any other Instagram Story.</p> \n<h3>13. Upload and browse video content on IGTV.</h3> \n<p>IGTV is one of the biggest new features by Instagram to date. This acronym, as you might assume, stands for \"Instagram TV,\" and it's basically an Explore page just for users' video content. The main benefits of IGTV? You can upload videos more than 60 seconds long, and you can create your own channel with, perhaps, a video series that can be broadcast across other video platforms like YouTube.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8587.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8587.jpg\" alt=\"explore page on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Navigate to IGTV by going to your Explore page and selecting \"IGTV\" at the top, as shown above. A page will appear featuring topics and videos by some of the most prolific IGTV video creators on the platform today.</p> \n<p>As you view more videos, the topics you see on the IGTV homepage will begin to adapt to your interests and serve you more content around those interests. And, naturally, the same goes for your target audience.</p> \n<p>Create an IGTV channel by tapping the \"+\" icon to the top right of your screen, as shown below:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8598.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8598.jpg\" alt=\"IGTV homepage showing how to add your own video to IGTV\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>With an IGTV channel created, you can then upload videos directly from your smartphone's camera roll to your channel.</p> \n<h3>14. Look through pictures without accidentally liking them.</h3> \n<p>It's pretty easy to learn how to like something on Instagram ‚Äî so easy, in fact, that people do it accidentally: It's just a quick double tap of the photo once you've entered its full view.</p> \n<p>The thing is, it's so easy to do quickly by mistake.</p> \n<p>So, here's a quick Instagram cheat for you: To look through someone's photos without \"double-tap paranoia,\" scroll through Instagram feeds with your phone set to airplane mode. Without internet access, you won't be able to Like a photo, even if you accidentally double-tap it.</p> \n<p>The pictures won't load in the first place if you start on airplane mode, though. You'll have to go to the feed first to load the posts, then turn on airplane mode, then start scrolling.</p> \n<p>When you reach the end of the first rows of posts and want to load more, simply turn airplane mode off, let more load, and then turn it on again. Cumbersome? Maybe a little, but it could be worth the paranoia mitigation.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>To turn on airplane mode on an iPhone/iPad:</strong> Swipe up from the bottom of the screen and click the airplane icon. Or, go to \"Settings\" and then \"Wi-Fi,\" and switch \"Airplane Mode\" on.</li> \n <li><strong>To turn on airplane mode on an Android device:</strong> Swipe down from the top of the screen. Then, swipe from right to left until you see \"Settings,\" and then touch it. Touch \"Airplane Mode\" to turn it on.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>15. Hide, delete, or disable comments on your posts.</h3> \n<p>Twitter may carry a more \"anything goes\" culture of commentary, but your Instagram is your domain ‚Äî and it's much easier to control who says what on your content. This is especially important if you manage a business account.</p> \n<h4>To Filter Comments by Keyword:</h4> \n<p>In the Instagram mobile app, navigate to \"Options\" and select \"Comments.\" From here, you can toggle on \"Hide Inappropriate Comments\" and even enter specific keywords you'd like the app to police within each comment.</p> \n<h4>To Delete Comments:</h4> \n<p>Tap the speech bubble icon below the comment you'd like to delete, and swipe lightly to the left over this text. Select the garbage can icon that appears to delete this post. You can also do this to your own comments.</p> \n<h4>To Disable Comments Entirely:</h4> \n<p>To clarify, you can't turn off comments across your entire profile; you can only disable them for individual posts.</p> \n<p>To do so, start posting an image on which you'd like nobody to comment. When you reach the page to add a caption, tags, and location, tap \"Advanced Settings\" at the very bottom. This will open a screen where you can easily switch on an option labeled \"Turn Off Commenting.\"</p> \n<h3>16. Clear your Instagram search history.</h3> \n<p>We swear ‚Äî this blog post isn't all about how to convince people you're not an Instagram creeper. But many of us can relate to the desire to clear our online search history everywhere, including on this particular social channel. Luckily, you can.</p> \n<p>To clear your Instagram search history, go to your own profile and click the \"Settings\" button (a gear icon on iPhone/iPad and three dots on Android). Scroll down and click \"Security\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8584%20copy.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8584%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"showing in settings how to clear instagram search history\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Then, select \"Clear Search History\" at bottom of the screen, and then confirm by clicking the blue link, \"Clear Search History\".</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8600.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8600.jpg\" alt=\"showing in settings how to clear instagram search history\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>17. Reorder filters and hide the ones you don't use.</h3> \n<p>If you use Instagram a lot, chances are, you have a few favorite go-to filters, and others you never touch. To make editing photos easier, you can reorder the filters in your editing window, and hide the ones you never use.</p> \n<p>To reorder or hide filters, add a new post and begin editing it. When you get to the filters page, scroll to the very far right of your filters options and click \"Manage.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8602.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8602.jpg\" alt=\"instagram editing features and filters\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>To reorder filters, hold your finger down on the three grey lines on the far left of the filter you'd like to move, and drag it to reorder. To hide them, deselect the checkmark to the right.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8603.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8603.jpg\" alt=\"instagram filters with arrows showing you can move filters up or down\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>18. Use Instagram as a photo editor (without having to post anything).</h3> \n<p>Perhaps you love Instagram's filters and editing capabilities, but aren't quite ready to post the photo to your account ‚Äî right now, or ever. To use Instagram as a photo editor without posting anything, all you need to do is publish a picture while your phone is on airplane mode.</p> \n<p>First, be sure you have \"Save Original Photo\" turned on in your Instagram settings.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8604.png?width=1125&amp;name=IMG_8604.png\" alt=\"IMG_8604\" width=\"1125\" style=\"width: 1125px;\"></p> \n<p>Then, turn on airplane mode ‚Äî see instructions in #5.</p> \n<p>Next, follow the normal steps to post a photo to Instagram: Upload the photo, edit it, and press \"Share.\" An error message will appear saying the upload failed, but you'll be able to find the edited image in your phone's photo gallery.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8605%20copy.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8605%20copy.png\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"error message because instagram didn't upload a photo properly\"></p> \n<h3>19. Insert line breaks into your bio and captions.</h3> \n<p>When you write a caption in Instagram, you'll see the keyboard doesn't give you an option to press \"Enter\" or \"Return.\" The same is true for your bio. So how do all those people put line breaks in there?</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/No%20return%20key.png?width=300&amp;name=No%20return%20key.png\" alt=\"No return key.png\" title=\"No return key.png\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> \n<p>It turns out that all you have to do is press the \"123\" key in the bottom lefthand corner of the keyboard, and the \"Return\" key will appear on the bottom right.</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Return%20key.png?width=300&amp;name=Return%20key.png\" alt=\"Return key.png\" title=\"Return key.png\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> \n<p>I know this tip sounds simple, but <em>a lot</em> of people miss it ‚Äî myself included, until a colleague clued me in. We've seen some elaborate solutions out there for hacking through this problem, like <a href=\"http://www.lifeinlimbo.org/2014/08/27/instagram-tips-how-to-add-line-breaks-and-spaces-to-your-captions-and-bio/\">writing the caption copy in another app</a>, then copying and pasting it into Instagram. Thankfully, it's much simpler than that.</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\">\n   <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/498VDB076eY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>20. Hide Photos You've Been Tagged In</h3> \n<p>When someone tags you in a photo or video on Instagram, it's automatically added to your profile under \"Photos of You,\" unless you opt to add tagged photos manually (see the next tip).</p> \n<p>To see the posts you've been tagged in, go to your own profile and click the person icon below your bio.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8606.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8606.jpg\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"instagram profile with section where you are tagged\"></p> \n<p>Next, click on an individual post (any in the group of tagged photos) and click \"Edit\" in the top right. Then, click \"Manually Approve Tags\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8607.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8607.jpg\" alt=\"click manually approve tags to hide photos you're tagged in\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Then, to hide the posts you've been tagged in from other users, select the posts you'd like to remove from your profile, and when you're done, tap \"Hide Photos\" at the bottom of your screen. When prompted, tap \"Hide From Profile.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8608%20copy.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8608%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"someone's list of photos they've been tagged in\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>This won't remove the posts themselves from Instagram, but it will remove them from your profile, so you and others can't access them.</p> \n<h3>21. Adjust your settings to approve tagged photos before they show up in your profile.</h3> \n<p>As we mentioned in the previous step, when someone tags a photo or video of you on Instagram, it's usually added to your profile automatically. But, you can change your Instagram settings to enable manually selecting which photos you're tagged in that show up on your profile.</p> \n<p>To add tags manually, follow the same steps above to get to the photos in which you've been tagged, and click \"Edit\" at the top right of your screen. Tap \"Tagging Options,\" and select \"Add Manually.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8609.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8609.png\" alt=\"manually approve tag instagram CTA\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>You'll still be notified when someone tags you in a photo. Once that happens, to manually add a tagged photo to your profile, tap the photo you were tagged in, then tap your username and select \"Show on My Profile.\" And if you'd rather it not be visible, choose \"Hide from My Profile\" instead.</p> \n<h3>22. Browse posts from certain locations.</h3> \n<p>One fun thing you can do on Instagram is browse photos and videos from a specific location, or taken near your current location. I like to do that when I'm planning a trip somewhere, or want to check out a new restaurant and scroll through the pictures taken there.</p> \n<p>Here's how to do both of these things.</p> \n<h4>To Browse Posts From at a Specific Location:</h4> \n<p>You can either search for a specific place, or you can click into a geotag on an existing photo.</p> \n<p><strong>To search for a specific place:</strong> Tap the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of your home screen, which will bring you to the general search page. When you click into the search bar at the top, four tabs will appear. Choose \"Places,\" and type in the name of a place. When you press \"Search,\" it'll show you all the top and recent posts that were geotagged with that location.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8610.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8610.jpg\" alt=\"searching location on instagram search feature\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8611.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8611.png\" alt=\"searching location on instagram search feature\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></strong></p> \n<p><strong>To look at posts with a certain geotag:</strong> Go to the photo that's geotagged with that location, and click the geotag. It'll show you all the top and recent posts that were geotagged with that location.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8612.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8612.jpg\" alt=\"clicking on location on a post of fenway park\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8613.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8613.png\" alt=\"instagram feed of fenway park images\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h4>Browse Posts Near Your Current Location:</h4> \n<p>Follow the same instructions above to get to \"Places.\" Tap the search bar, and select \"Near Current Location.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8614.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8614.png\" alt=\"searching in places on instagram for near current location\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Choose which geotag you'd like to browse from the options that appear. Let's say I chose to browse posts with the Museum of Science geotag. When I click \"Museum of Science, Boston\" on the menu, I'll see the top and recent posts that were geotagged at that location.</p> \n<h3>23. Drive traffic to an external website.</h3> \n<p>One of the biggest frustrations people have with marketing on Instagram is that clickable URLs aren't allowed anywhere except the single \"website\" box in your bio. If you put a URL in a photo caption it'll appear as plain text, meaning users would have to painstakingly copy the URL, open a web browser, and paste or type it in there.</p> \n<p>One sneaky way to get people to visit your Instagram profile, which is where that one clickable URL is allowed, is to use your photo captions to encourage people to visit your profile for a link. Then, update that URL frequently to point to your latest blog content, YouTube video, product, or offer.</p> \n<p>Check out the example from food magazine <em>Bon App√©tit</em> below. This photo's caption provides a text call-to-action to visit the user's profile so you can click the link related to the post.</p>  \n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\"> \n <div style=\"padding: 8px;\"> \n  <div style=\"background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n   &nbsp;\n  </div> \n  <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BT99Vgvh_Km/\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\">Comfort food gone green üå±.

Update this link frequently to point to your latest content or offer.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8615%20copy.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8615%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"someone's link in instagram bio\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Plus, if you have a verified Instagram account, you can also add links to your Story. Read more about this feature <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/691455604353423\">here</a>.</p> \n<h3>24. Sell products from Instagram using Shoppable Posts.</h3> \n<p>You might already know you can tag people in your Instagram posts as (or after) you post new content. Now, you can tag <em>products</em> ‚Äî and direct your viewers to a product page to buy what they saw.</p> \n<h4>To Add an Instagram Business Account</h4> \n<p>You'll need an Instagram Business account to publish shoppable posts. You can get one by selecting \"Edit Profile\" on your Instagram profile and tapping \"Try Instagram Business Tools,\" as shown below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-account-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=professional-account-1.jpg\" alt=\"switch to professional account button on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h4>To Tag a Post With Products</h4> \n<p>Once you've launched an Instagram Business account, you'll need to enable product tags to use them on a post that depicts a product. Navigate to your settings using the gear icon from your profile page, and select \"Products.\" Tap \"Continue\" and follow the prompts to connect a \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/instagram/shopping/guide\">product catalog</a>\" to your business profile.</p> \n<p>With product tags enabled on your Instagram Business account, you can now upload new posts and tag your photo with products you find from your product catalog. Here's what a shoppable post can look like:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-shoppable-post.jpg?width=350&amp;name=instagram-shoppable-post.jpg\" alt=\"instagram-shoppable-post\" width=\"350\" style=\"width: 350px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/191462054687226\">Instagram</a></span></p> \n<h3>25. Pin your Instagram post to Pinterest.</h3> \n<p>Instagram doesn't have a natural integration with many social networks (except Facebook, its parent company) for publishing Instagram posts to other social accounts.</p> \n<p>But with respect to Pinterest, image-loving platforms stick together. Here's a backdoor way to Pin your latest Instagram Story to Pinterest:</p> \n<p>On the Instagram mobile app, tap a post to view it in full, then tap the three dots to the top-right of the image. Select \"Copy Share URL\" to attach the picture's link to your clipboard.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8618.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8618.jpg\" alt=\"copy an instagram post's link\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Open the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinterest&amp;hl=en_US\">Pinterest mobile app</a> ‚Äî or download it; you'll need it for this step ‚Äî and navigate to your profile page. If you have the latest version of Pinterest downloaded, it might ask you as soon as you open the app if you'd like to produce the image from your clipboard.</p> \n<p>If not, select the \"+\" icon to the top right to add a new pin, and you'll see a menu of options where you can add your \"Copied Link\" to a new Pin or board on your profile.</p> \n<h3>26. Hide ads you don't find relevant.</h3> \n<p>Instagram tries to show you ads that are interesting and relevant to you. You might see ads based on people you follow and things you Like on Instagram, or the third-party websites and apps you visit.</p> \n<p>If you see sponsored posts you don't find relevant, though, you can let Instagram know and slowly teach its algorithm what you like and don't like to see.</p> \n<p>To hide ads on Instagram, tap on the three dots to the right of a post labeled \"Sponsored,\" and choose \"Hide This.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8619.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8619.jpg\" alt=\"hiding a starbucks ad on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>From there, it'll ask you to share why you don't want to see the ad anymore.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8620.jpg?width=1125&amp;name=IMG_8620.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8620\" width=\"1125\" style=\"width: 1125px;\"></p> \n<p>You can also opt out of seeing ads based on sites and apps off of Instagram and Facebook from your device's settings. Note that even if you choose to opt out of seeing these types of ads, you'll still see ads based on your Instagram and Facebook activity.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>To limit ad tracking on an iPhone/iPad:</strong> Go to \"Settings\" and choose \"Privacy,\" then \"Advertising.\" From there, choose the option to \"Limit Ad Tracking\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%202.30.43%20PM.png?width=400&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%202.30.43%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-09-14 at 2.30.43 PM\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>To turn off interest-based ads on Android: </strong>Go to \"Google Settings,\" then \"Ads.\" From there, choose the option to \"Turn off interest-based ads.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/opt-out-interest-based-ads-android.png?width=300&amp;name=opt-out-interest-based-ads-android.png\" alt=\"opt-out-interest-based-ads-android.png\" title=\"opt-out-interest-based-ads-android.png\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><strong>27. Send photos privately to your friends.</strong></h3> \n<p>Posting photos with all of your followers or with the public isn't the only way to share content on Instagram. You can also share them with individual or multiple users, kind of like a Facebook message or group text message.</p> \n<p>You can either send a new photo to friends, or send a photo that you or someone else has already posted.</p> \n<p>To send a new photo privately, upload a photo and begin editing it, as you would when editing a new post. When you get to the \"Share\" page, tap the top where it automatically says \"New Post,\" but when prompted, select \"Direct Message.\" From there, you can pick and choose whom you'd like to send the photo to.</p> \n<p>You can access your direct messages at any time by clicking the mailbox icon at the top right of your homepage.</p> \n<p>To send an existing photo privately, start by opening the post you want to share ‚Äî it can be your own or someone else's, as long as the latter has a public account. Next, click the paper-airplane-like icon below the post, then select who you want to receive it when the \"Send to\" box appears.</p> \n<h3>28. Add another Instagram account to your bio.</h3> \n<p>Perhaps your company has more than one Instagram account for different aspects of your brand. For instance, HubSpot has a verified HubSpot account, a HubSpot Life account, a HubSpot Academy account, and a HubSpot Partners account.</p> \n<p>To draw awareness back to its main company page, then, HubSpot links to the @HubSpot account in its other account bios, like in @HubSpotLife's account:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/account-in-instagram-bio.jpg?width=450&amp;name=account-in-instagram-bio.jpg\" alt=\"account-in-instagram-bio\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Fortunately, you have the option to include another Instagram account in your Instagram bio. To do so, simply type the \"@\" sign into your Bio, and then select the account you'd like to tag. Then, click \"Done\".</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add-insta-account-to-bio.png?width=450&amp;name=add-insta-account-to-bio.png\" alt=\"add-insta-account-to-bio\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>29. Reorder Instagram Stories highlights.</h3> \n<p>The Highlights on your Instagram feed act as your brand's portfolio ‚Äî you can use Highlights to demonstrate your company's values, showcase new products or services, or categorize various topics you post about frequently.</p> \n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thenorthface/?hl=en\">The North Face</a> uses its Highlights section to highlight various initiatives that are important to the brand, including a section labelled \"VOTE\", \"Global Climbing Day 2020\" and \"Summer Basecamp\":</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/change-order-instagram-highlights.png?width=450&amp;name=change-order-instagram-highlights.png\" alt=\"change-order-instagram-highlights\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Since a user can only see the first four highlights when they first come across your feed, you'll want to ensure your first highlights are the ones you're most proud of. To do this, simply follow this trick:</p> \n<p>1. Hold down the highlight you'd like moved to the front of this list and click \"Edit Highlight\" when the slide-up appears.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8571%20copy.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8571%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"editing a highlight on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>2. Next, find an image or video you'd like to add to the highlight. (Don't worry ‚Äî you'll be able to delete this within 30 seconds, so you don't need to choose one that will stay on the highlight.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8572.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8572.png\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"selecting an image to add to instagram highlights\"></p> \n<p>3. Click \"Done\" in the top right corner.</p> \n<p>4. Now, your Highlight will be first in the list. To remove the image or video you just added, follow the above instructions and simply un-check the image you added. Your highlight will remain at the beginning of the Highlight reel.</p> \n<h3>30. Change your Instagram Highlights Icon without publishing it to your feed.</h3> \n<p>The image you choose for each Highlight should accurately depict what type of content users can expect to see if they tap the Highlight, so you'll want to choose a compelling, engaging image.</p> \n<p>However, if you have a design, logo, or image you'd like to use that isn't in your Instagram feed, it's still possible to make it the Highlight Icon.</p> \n<p>To do this, click \"Edit Highlight\" (same as the step above):</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8571%20copy-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8571%20copy-1.jpg\" alt=\"clicking on edit highlight button on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Next, click \"Edit Cover\". Scroll through your camera roll to find an image you like.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8572.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8572.jpg\" alt=\"editing cover highlight on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8575.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8575.png\" alt=\"choosing photo for instagram highlight\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Once you choose an image from your camera roll, click \"Done\". Your Highlight cover image is now an image you've never posted on your Instagram account:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8576.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8576.png\" alt=\"choosing instagram highlight cover photo\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>31. Create an auto-complete quick reply for standard responses.</h3> \n<p>Responding to user comments and questions is incredibly timely, but fortunately, there's a hack to streamline the process and make it more efficient. (Note: This only works on Instagram Business accounts.)</p> \n<p>You can simply create a one-to-two word phrase that can act as your shortcut to a longer standard response you might send often. To do this, click \"Business\" in your Settings, and then \"Quick Replies\" ‚Äî or, click the three-dot chat bubble icon on bottom of screen, and then click \"New Quick Reply\".</p> \n<p>Add a shortcut you can enter for the response. For instance, you might type \"returnpolicy\" as the shortcut for a longer response, i.e.: \"Hey there. We're sorry you don't love your purchase. Fortunately, we permit 30-day returns, no questions asked. Please send us your order confirmation number to get the process started.\"</p> \n<p>Once you've added a shortcut, you can either type the shortcut \"returnpolicy\" into the comment box when you want it to auto-generate, or you can tap the three-dot chat Quick Replies bubble icon at the bottom of your screen to choose from a response you've created. (<a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/how-to-communicate-effectively-with-customers\">Read more about Quick Replies here</a>.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/0bbb2a75b44c18506923b75ffceb2a1a.gif\" alt=\"0bbb2a75b44c18506923b75ffceb2a1a\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/how-to-communicate-effectively-with-customers\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>How to Get Verified on Instagram</h3> \n<p>A verified badge (the blue check beside a celebrity or brand account name) tells users that you're, in Instagram's words, \"the authentic presence of a notable public figure, celebrity, global brand or entity it represents\".</p> \n<p>For instance, there are plenty of \"Reese Witherspoon\" fan pages on Instagram, but there's only one <em>real </em>Reese Witherspoon account, as verified by the blue badge:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-verify-account-reese.jpg?width=450&amp;name=how-to-verify-account-reese.jpg\" alt=\"reese witherspoon blue verified logo\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>To request a verified badge, you must be a public figure, celebrity, or brand and <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/312685272613322?helpref=related\">meet certain requirements</a>. If you've determined you fit Instagram's criteria for verification, follow these steps to request a badge:</p> \n<ol type=\"1\"> \n <li>Go to your profile (the person icon in bottom left corner).</li> \n <li>Tap the three lines in the top right corner.</li> \n <li>Click \"Settings\" &gt; \"Account\" &gt; \"Request Verification\"</li> \n <li>Fill out the form, including username, Full Name, Known As, Category, and government-issued phoot ID.</li> \n <li>When you've filled out all form fields, click \"Send\".</li> \n</ol> \n<p>It's important to note, you won't necessarily receive a verified badge if you request one. Learn more about what happens <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/461238577687001\">after you request a verified badge</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>Instagram Hacks</strong></h2> \n<p>I might be biased, but Instagram is one of the most fun (and visually appealing) social apps around. And now, with these tricks, you can use it to an even fuller extent.</p> \n<p>Plus, many of these features can help to enhance your brand's presence on Instagram. Now, you know how to use the app more efficiently, to make sure you're only tagged in photos you want to appear on your profile, and have even more ways to engage with the people by whom you'd like to be discovered.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>{{slideInCta('5b6f8d3c-c701-4e42-a0a6-ee8d5bd8cb16')}</p>  \n<img

highest-value accounts. No wasted time working to market and sell to unqualified leads who aren‚Äôt the right fit for your business. Meaning, you could move straight into the phases of engaging and delighting your target accounts.</p> \n<p>Talk about efficiency, right?</p> \n<p>With <strong>account-based marketing</strong>, all of this is made possible. The process allows you to align your marketing and sales teams from the get-go to promote long-term business growth, delight customers, and boost revenue.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This guide is here to help you make it happen. Let‚Äôs dive in.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Account-based marketing allows you to weed out less-valuable companies early on and ensure Marketing and Sales are in complete alignment ‚Äî in return, your team can leap into the critical processes of engaging and delighting those accounts much faster.</p> \n<p>ABM helps your business work and communicate with high-value accounts as if they‚Äôre individual markets. By doing this ‚Äî along with personalizing the buyer‚Äôs journey and tailoring all communications, content, and campaigns to those specific accounts ‚Äî you'll see greater ROI and a boost in customer loyalty.</p> \n<p>Before we take a look at additional benefits of account-based marketing and specific tactics you can implement at your company, let‚Äôs review its relationship with another important strategy: <strong>inbound marketing</strong>.</p> \n<p>Often, these strategies are thought of as entirely different entities. However, they can be quite complementary.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Account-Based Marketing And Inbound Marketing</h2> \n<p>Batman and Robin. LeBron and D-Wade. Peanut butter and jelly.

These dynamic duos are forces to be reckoned with when they work <i>together</i>.</p> \n<p>Similarly, when paired, account-based marketing and inbound marketing have the power to make waves (the good ones) for your business.</p> \n<p>You might be wondering, ‚ÄúHow exactly does this partnership work?‚Äù</p> \n<p>Well, we just reviewed the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-guide#what-is-account-based-marketing\">definition of account-based marketing</a> ‚Äî as you learned, ABM is a highly-targeted strategy.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing?_ga=2.118531978.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">inbound marketing</a> is more foundational ‚Äî the methodology and growth strategy allows you to attract customers through the creation of valuable content, SEO, and a delightful customer experience.</p> \n<p>Rather than interrupting your target audience and customers (as you would with outbound marketing), inbound marketing allows you to more organically provide your audience with the information they want when they want it. Inbound lays the foundation for a strong ABM strategy by allowing for highly-targeted and efficient resource allocation of high-value accounts.</p> \n<p>Here are a few more reasons to implement both <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-vs-inbound-marketing?_ga=2.118531978.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">ABM and inbound marketing</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Inbound marketing helps you attract target accounts and ABM then accelerates the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel?_ga=2.118531978.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">flywheel</a> so you can win and delight those target accounts with a remarkable customer experience (and as a result, you‚Äôll <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/grow-better?_ga=2.194226990.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">grow better)</a>.</li> \n <li>Inbound marketing lays the foundation for a strong ABM strategy ‚Äî ABM builds off of inbound by allowing for targeted and efficient resource allocation of high-value accounts.</li> \n <li>With this combined approach, you attract a broader group of prospects than you would while using just one method and catch any opportunities the other strategy may have missed.</li> \n <li>Your content has a two-for-one value ‚Äî you can create and use content that serves both an ABM and inbound strategy (e.g. create a personalized case study for a target account that you also share on your website).</li> \n <li>Software options, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/abm-software?_ga=2.165839805.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">HubSpot‚Äôs account-based marketing software</a>, are available and make it easy to implement ABM and inbound strategies in a complementary way.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>üß°</strong>TLDR: Combine ABM and inbound marketing to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/grow-better?_ga=2.165839805.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">grow better</a>.</p> \n<p>Next, we‚Äôll take a look at some of the definable benefits of account-based marketing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>There are a number of benefits associated with account-based marketing. We've compiled the following list of commonly-noted results that positively impact (all types of) businesses.</p> \n<h3>1. Keep Marketing and Sales aligned.</h3> \n<p>Cross-team collaboration and improved communication across any organization are beneficial to growth. In terms of account-based marketing, this transparency and alignment will ensure your marketing and sales teams are focused on the same goals, stick to the mutually-agreed-upon budget, and understand the specific roles of each internal stakeholder.</p> \n<p>This alignment helps ensure all communications, interactions, and content (and more) are consistent for the accounts you work with. Meaning, no matter how long an account works with your company, your team members can pick up where others left off at any point in time without question ‚Äî this creates a seamless and delightful customer experience.</p> \n<p>üß°The easiest way to maintain internal account-based marketing alignment is with the help of software, like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/abm-software?_ga=2.263906191.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">HubSpot</a>, which makes connecting your marketing and sales teams exceptionally easy.<br><br /></br></p> \n<h3>2. Maximize your business‚Äôs relevance among high-value accounts.</h3> \n<p>Account-based marketing requires you to personalize everything (e.g. content, product information, communications, and campaigns) for each account you invest your resources in. Through this personalization and customization, your relevance among these accounts is maximized.</p> \n<p>That‚Äôs because your content and interactions are tailored in a way that shows them how your specific products, services, offerings, and team are what they <i>need</i> to solve their challenges and to grow better. Meaning, ABM allows you to angle your business in a way that makes it the most-relevant and ideal option for your target accounts.<br><br /></br></p> \n<h3>3. Deliver consistent customer experiences.</h3> \n<p>As mentioned, account-based marketing requires you to deliver consistent experiences for your accounts ‚Äî this plays a major role in your success. A large part of the reason for this is because ABM is a long process that often lasts several months or years.</p> \n<p>So, for your ABM efforts to be remarkable, you must maintain a long-term sense of delight among your accounts. This is how you‚Äôll make each account feel as though they‚Äôre your business‚Äôs market of <em>one</em> ‚Äî and why would they ever want to stop doing business with you if that‚Äôs their experience?</p> \n<p>Delivering these long-term, consistent experiences may seem a bit daunting. Although this is understandable, the good news is that ABM is a process that naturally encourages you to do so.</p> \n<p>Think about it this way: We already discussed the way ABM requires Marketing and Sales to be aligned on all things related to each account (e.g. their goals, budget, unique needs, members of their team and buying committee).</p> \n<p>When there‚Äôs a universal understanding of these factors within your organization, Marketing and Sales (and anyone else involved) will be able to effectively and naturally deliver that feeling of consistency through everything they communicate and share with each account (e.g. personalized content, targeted campaigns, pricing and product information, and more).<br><br /></br></p> \n<h3>4. Measure your return on investment.</h3> \n<p>With account-based marketing, you can easily measure return on investment (ROI) for each account you invest your resources and time into. This is beneficial because you can confirm whether certain accounts you invested in were ideal for your business.</p> \n<p>Then, you can nurture and delight those accounts long term as well as identify and target similar accounts in the future. If your ROI proves your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-guide#account-based-marketing-tactics\">ABM tactics</a> worked, use those results as a motivator to drive your strategy forward as well as one you can count on to continually improve your bottom line.<br><br /></br></p> \n<h3>5. Streamline the sales cycle.</h3> \n<p>Depending on your business, industry, and resources, the sales cycle typically looks something like this:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"background-color: #fce5cd;\"><strong>1) Prospect ‚Üí 2) Connect ‚Üí 3) Research ‚Üí 4) Present ‚Üí 5) Close ‚Üí 6) Delight</strong></span></p> \n<p>With account-based marketing, this cycle is streamlined ‚Äî by focusing your efforts on specific high-value target accounts, you save time and resources, and spend more time on the stages of the cycle that positively impact your bottom line:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #fce5cd;\">1) Identify Target Accounts ‚Üí 2) Present to Target Accounts ‚Üí 3) Close Target Accounts ‚Üí 4) Delight Accounts</span> </strong></p> \n<p>ABM streamlines your sales cycle by helping you stay efficient. Rather than experimenting with different tactics to prospect and qualify a large pool of leads, ABM ensures your target accounts are ideal for <i>your </i>business so you can quickly dive into building relationships.</p> \n<p>The sales cycle stage of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">closing</span> is also streamlined through ABM. That‚Äôs because your <a href=\"https://blog.marketo.com/2017/11/key-successful-abm-marketing-sales-alignment.html\">chances of converting accounts and retaining them long term</a> increase thanks to marketing and sales alignment, consistent customer experiences, and personalization.<br><br /></br></p> \n<h3>6. Expand business through account relationships.</h3> \n<p>The saying \"quality over quantity‚Äù applies to account-based marketing. The process requires you to invest significant time and resources in engaging and delighting a group of carefully-chosen, high-value accounts, versus trying to quickly close deals with less-qualified leads who may not be the best fit for your company in the long run.</p> \n<p>By taking the time to build these trusting relationships with accounts, you‚Äôll expand business by retaining those valuable customers longer. And considering it costs <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/happy-customers-marketing-opportunity?_ga=2.263906191.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">more to obtain customers than retain them</a>, this will positively impact your bottom line.</p> \n<p>Additionally, as a result of personalized, thoughtful, and consistent customer experiences, accounts will become loyal to your business over time ‚Äî and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/happy-customers-marketing-opportunity?_ga=2.157844409.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">loyal customers become your best marketers</a>, promoters, and brand advocates.</p> \n<p>In other words, your accounts will help you expand your business among <em>their</em> networks (e.g. partners, customers) through referrals, word-of-mouth marketing, testimonials, and more.</p> \n<p>Now let‚Äôs cover some account-based marketing tactics you can apply to your strategy to improve the likelihood of success.</p> \n<a></a> \n<br> <p>ABM tactics are the building blocks of your strategy ‚Äî so, work through the following list to ensure your ABM efforts and investment are successful.</p> <h3>1. Secure organizational ABM alignment.</h3> <p>One of the most important account-based marketing tactics is arguably one of the most straightforward: Secure organizational ABM alignment.</p> <p>This means getting all internal stakeholders on board with the various factors related to your account-based marketing strategy. In doing so, it‚Äôll be easier for your business to create consistent experiences for accounts and make sure your strategy is as efficient and streamlined as possible.</p> <p>For example, your VP of Marketing and VP of Sales should secure organizational alignment and spread awareness regarding:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Marketing and sales team members who are directly involved in the strategy</li> \n  <li>Account buying committee members and any other account stakeholders</li> \n  <li>Your business‚Äôs point-of-difference for each target account</li> \n  <li>ABM budget and resources</li> \n  <li>ABM goals and KPIs<br><br /></br></li> \n </ul> <h3>2. Build your ABM team.</h3> <p>Similar to the first tactic we reviewed above, VPs of Marketing and Sales will also likely be leaders in the discussion regarding how you‚Äôll build your ABM team.</p> <p>They, along with managers on their respective teams, will need to identify a minimum of one marketer and one sales rep who will be completely dedicated to the accounts you work with.</p> <p>These people will create and publish content for accounts as well as work to manage and close business deals with each account‚Äôs buying committee. (As a rule of thumb, try to limit your team size to no more than ten sales reps and one marketer.)</p> <p>In addition to the marketer(s) and sales rep(s), don‚Äôt forget to identify any other internal key players ‚Äî such as customer success reps ‚Äî who should be aware of and aligned on your ABM strategy.<br><br /></br></p> <h3>3. Identify and pick your ideal set of target accounts.</h3> <p>Identify and pick your ideal set of high-value target accounts to invest your time and resources in.</p> <p>Here are some recommendations on how you can do this:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Set search alerts for your ideal customer profile on LinkedIn.</li> \n  <li>Create a workflow that filters incoming qualified leads based on specific criteria (e.g. company size, industry, etc.) and tags them as an ideal customer type in your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.157844409.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">CRM</a>.</li> \n  <li>Ask, ‚ÄúIf we could replicate one deal from last year, what would it be?‚Äù Then, use the characteristics of that deal (e.g. industry, company size, value) to help you identify other good-fit customers.</li> \n  <li>Pick target accounts based on a particular industry or geographical location.</li> \n  <li>Review major companies and leads who are using and engaging with your inbound content but don‚Äôt have a deal attached (yet!).</li> \n  <li>Identify the lighthouse accounts you could use for reference.</li> \n  <li>Stick to no more than 10 accounts per sales rep.<br><br /></br></li> \n </ul> <h3>4. Encourage Marketing and Sales to create account plans together.</h3> <p>Throughout this guide, you‚Äôve probably picked up on the fact account-based marketing is a team effort. That‚Äôs why ensuring appropriate marketing and sales team members are involved in account planning is so important.</p> <p>Make sure Marketing and Sales ask the following questions while they work on account plans:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Who will we need to know at each account (e.g. buying committee members and account stakeholders)?</li> \n  <li>What content will we need to attract and engage account buying committee members (and any other stakeholders)?</li> \n  <li>Which channels will we use to share content with the right people at each account?</li> \n  <li>How will we (marketers and sales reps) provide the right type of support throughout each stage of the strategy and sales process ‚Äî in other words, how will sales help at the outset and how will marketing support in the later stages?</li> \n </ul> <p><strong>üß°</strong>Store your account plans as pinned notes in your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.157844409.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">HubSpot CRM</a>, Google Docs, <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/productivity/project-management/asana?_ga=2.157844409.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">Asana</a> Boards, pinned messages in <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/sales-enablement/slack?_ga=2.157844409.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">Slack</a>, and more to allow for easy access and collaboration.</p> <p>Here are a few other tips Marketing and Sales can use to make your account plans successful:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Ensure Marketing and Sales align on your product or service‚Äôs value proposition and point-of-difference for every account.</li> \n  <li>Create personalized content ‚Äî or update existing content ‚Äî so it‚Äôs tailored to each unique account.</li> \n  <li>Customize your allocated resources and budget for each account.<br><br /></br></li> \n </ul> <h3>5. Attract contacts from high-quality accounts.</h3> <p>Next, you‚Äôll want to attract the buying committee members and stakeholders of your target accounts. Depending on how long you‚Äôve been in business and any previous ABM work you‚Äôve done, you may or may not already have contacts for specific accounts.</p> <p>The key to successfully attracting high-quality accounts is to personalize content to those accounts ‚Äî this will help you elevate brand awareness and maximize relevance among audience members.</p> <p>Here are some GDPR-compliant recommendations for attracting high-quality accounts:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Engage accounts on social media (e.g. determine which platforms they‚Äôre on, join the groups they‚Äôre in, contribute to conversations they're a part of, and share helpful and relevant content you‚Äôve created).</li> \n  <li>Produce a podcast or video series and invite a leader from the account to be a special guest.</li> \n  <li>Sponsor a booth at a target account‚Äôs conference or event.</li> \n  <li>Send direct messages via social media and direct mail via email or post.</li> \n  <li>Communicate through LinkedIn InMail outreach (do this simply and <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/integrations/how-to-connect-hubspot-and-linkedin-sales-navigator?_ga=2.157844409.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">without ever leaving HubSpot</a> with the <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/social-media/linkedin?_ga=2.157844409.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">LinkedIn integration</a>).</li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/landing-pages?_ga=2.157844409.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">Build custom landing pages</a> tailored to the needs, questions, and concerns of accounts.</li> \n  <li>Offer gifts for engagement and interaction (e.g. prizes, swag, and discount codes).</li> \n  <li>Distribute content such as blog articles across channels that are relevant to each account (e.g. website, social media, and magazines).</li> \n  <li>Create <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns?_ga=2.157844409.2043081995.1586812054-1675356138.1572978608\">ad campaigns</a> and social ads to target different factors such as location, skill, and job title.</li> \n  <li>Ask current contacts, accounts, and customers for referrals.</li> \n  <li>Invite contacts to (physical or digital) events and ask attendees to invite their colleagues.<br><br /></br></li> \n </ul> <h3>6. Forge strong relationships with the account‚Äôs buying committee.</h3> <p>Once you‚Äôve attracted high-value accounts, it‚Äôs time to forge strong relationships with their buying committees. This is something your team will likely work on over an extended period of time ‚Äî in fact, it often takes months and even years to develop these bonds.

Marketing campaigns can only be effective once you've invested in properly defining your value proposition, messaging, and brand authority.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, there are three high-impact marketing strategies you can implement to see maximum results. Here, we'll dive into three highly effective campaigns you might use for both quick wins, <em>and </em>impressive long-term results.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3><strong>1. It's More Than Just LinkedIn: Account-Based Marketing</strong></h3> \n<p>LinkedIn Ads are the leading tool for generating new leads in B2B and a great start to any ABM campaign.</p> \n<p>On LinkedIn you can <a href=\"https://www.penguinstrategies.com/blog/linkedin-ads-part-one-roi-and-targeting\"><span>target</span></a> by company, location, job title, and more, which can help you reach the right people at the right time. You can even set it up right from your <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/ads/create-linkedin-lead-gen-ads-in-hubspot\"><span>Hubspot Account</span></a>!</p> \n<p>But you don't have to stop there. You need to build the journey <em>beyond</em> the ads. For instance, how will you nurture leads, who will nurture them, and when?</p> \n<p>To maximize engagement with your ABM campaign, <a href=\"https://www.penguinstrategies.com/blog/account-based-marketing-tactics-inbound-synergy\"><span>combine it with an inbound campaign</span></a>. Build an infrastructure of additional content and emails to nurture your new leads and keep them engaged. Be sure to constantly refresh your content to maintain relevance and new interest.</p> \n<p>Here's a five-step plan to build an effective ABM campaign with inbound tactics:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Designate an owner of the campaign and ensure buy-in from all team members company-wide.</li> \n <li>Create a LinkedIn Lead Generation campaign focused on your ideal companies' industry with captivating ads.</li> \n <li>Create or update existing landing pages and content that speak directly to the targeted audience. Customize the messaging and design to really grab their attention and create a connection.</li> \n <li>Set up a workflow that will take the new leads and nurture them with the above content, as well as specialized landing pages (for advanced campaigns, set a nurture for each company or industry with customized content and messaging for each).</li> \n <li>Monitor the leads and their engagement so you can reach out with the right content at the right time.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3><strong>2. Two is Better than One: Partnerships</strong></h3> \n<p>An often untapped source for high-impact marketing is partner collaboration. Finding a partner with whom to create a piece of content is highly effective both in terms of engagement and costs.</p> \n<p>Partners will have a different perspective and can provide insights that you might not have considered. Plus, the backlinks is valuable from an SEO perspective. The assets you create with your partner can be shared with both of your brand's networks, expanding your exposure and enabling you to reach new audiences.</p> \n<p>Simple ways to create these partnerships include offering a guest blog post, inviting a speaker to join you on a webinar, or creating an infographic that showcases both companies' expertise.</p> \n<p>Make sure to choose your partners wisely. Your partner should have shared values, a strong following, and provide value to your target audience.</p> \n<p>For instance, in early 2020 our company planned on hosting a Hubspot User Group (HUG) at the Google Campus in Tel Aviv. Following the pandemic and subsequent social distancing, all plans were canceled and companies were forced to adapt at lightning speed. All of a sudden, physical meet-ups were out of the question.</p> \n<p>To solve for this, we decided to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/run-successful-virtual-conference\"><span>host a virtual event</span></a> in less than three weeks. Thanks to a dedicated staff and strong partnerships, some of the industry's top marketing leaders reached out to us about how they could take part in the event.</p> \n<p>These leaders' involvement brought on a snowball effect of leads from their networks interested in joining the event. Plus, although our HUGs are normally restricted to 300 registrants due to space limitations, we were able to accept over <a href=\"https://www.penguinstrategies.com/blog/how-to-generate-a-record-number-of-leads-from-a-virtual-event\"><span>1,200 registrants</span></a> to the virtual event.</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Actions Speak Louder than Words: Customer Evangelism</strong></h3> \n<p>Customer evangelism may be one of the most impactful tools for generating high-potential leads. You can create amazing campaigns, but nothing compares to a freely given recommendation by a satisfied client.</p> \n<p>The inbound flywheel is made up of three sections; Attract, Engage, and Delight. If you don't delight your customers, then your flywheel can't reach maximum speed.</p> \n<p>A customer evangelism program is not a linear campaign. You must delight your customers at all touchpoints, so when an opportunity arises they will gladly recommend you to their network.</p> \n<p>Moving beyond impeccable service and outstanding results, think of other creative ways to connect with clients and build your relationships. This can be anything from shout-outs on social media for wins, to sending new year wishes to show you are thinking of them. Ultimately, a little generosity can go a long way.</p> \n<p>Recently, one of our customers was on LinkedIn when he came across a post from a connection who hadn't heard of us. Because he was delighted with our services, our customer commented that the connection should check us out ‚Äî one day later, he was speaking with a sales rep in the first step to becoming a new customer.</p> \n<p>You are already constantly in touch with your customers, and they have endless potential to bring in new business ‚Äî don't let that go to waste.</p> \n<p>These strategies are only the first step in building a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-strategy\"><span>high-impact marketing strategy</span></a>. They must be combined with a full strategic plan aligned across your entire company, from marketing to sales to customer success and beyond.</p> \n<p>Each campaign is only one block inside a larger marketing plan that needs to cover all stages of the flywheel. No campaign can live on its own.</p> \n<p>Additionally, it's important to remember the importance of monitoring old campaigns to gather insights and ensure you're optimizing each future campaign for better results.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhigh-impact-marketing-channels-list&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"89396010d2b34407ab7b7a5583911767","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yoni Grysman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhigh-impact-marketing-channels-list&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-48-913_f6d1ee10b7fcedbe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389713},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"How to Create an Editorial Calendar in Google Calendar [Free Templates]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-robust-editorial-calendar-ht","description":"<p>One of the most frequent questions we get from aspiring and current inbound marketers is, \"How do you manage all of that content?\"</p> \n<p>When we tell them we use an editorial calendar, the next question is often, \"Oh, how much does that cost?\"</p>  \n<p></p> \n<p>Nothing. Because, for the most part, we use Google Calendar.</p> \n<p>Surprised? There are a lot of great calendar tools out there you can choose from. (In fact, for those of you who are HubSpot customers, there's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/new-calendar\">a marketing calendar built right into HubSpot's software</a>.) But after trying a ton of other solutions, our team found that we really operated the best with just a simple Google Calendar. In fact, this has actually been the longest-running editorial calendar solution our team has ever seen.</p> \n<p>Here's how we set it up.</p> \n<h3>Follow Along With <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates?hubs_post-cta=body\">Free Editorial Calendar Templates</a></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-23%20at%205.10.04%20PM.png?width=2296&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-23%20at%205.10.04%20PM.png\" alt=\"HubSpot's Blog Editorial Calendar - Free Template in Excel\" width=\"2296\" style=\"width: 2296px;\"></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download the Template for Free</a></p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates?_ga=2.241189250.1881622160.1600360775-2015275129.1600360775\">Download HubSpot's free editorial calendar templates.</a></h3> \n<p>First thing's first: Download the calendar templates, above (they're free.) By doing this, you'll have three editorial calendar templates on your computer to use at your leisure: one for Google Calendar, one for Excel, and one for Google Sheets. In this blog post, we'll be going over <strong>how to import the Excel template into Google Calendar</strong>.</p> \n<h3>2. Customize your template and prepare for import into Google Calendar.</h3> \n<p>By default, the publish dates on the templates you download will be stamped for the year 2016. Feel free to change them to the present year in the spreadsheet itself -- you can also drag them to the dates of your choosing after you upload the file into Google Calendar.</p> \n<p>Google Calendar makes it easy to load a calendar you might have pre-created in another program into Google. This includes Microsoft Excel. Here's how to import the Excel calendar template you downloaded in the previous step into Google Calendar:</p> \n<h3>3. Open Google Calendar.</h3> \n<p>Once you've downloaded (or, for that matter, created) a calendar that opens in Microsoft Excel, it's time to open Google Calendar. Just make sure you're already logged into the Gmail account you want this calendar to give access to.</p> \n<h3>4. Use the lefthand dropdown menu to create a new calendar.</h3> \n<p>Now it's time to set up your Google Calendar to accommodate the information in your Excel spreadsheet. First, go into your Google Calendar and click the plus sign to the right of \"Other Calendars,\" as shown in the screenshot below. In the dropdown menu that appears, select \"Create new calendar.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/create-new-calendar.jpg?width=350&amp;name=create-new-calendar.jpg\" alt=\"Adding a New Calendar in Google Calendar\" width=\"350\" style=\"width: 350px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>5. Fill out the details of your new calendar.</h3> \n<p>Fill out the fields that appear on the next screen. This includes a brief description of your calendar, as shown below, to give people proper context when you invite them into this calendar. When you're done filling in the details, click \"Create calendar.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/create-calendar-google-calendar.png?width=378&amp;name=create-calendar-google-calendar.png\" width=\"378\" style=\"width: 378px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Adding Details in Google Calendar to Create New Calendar\"></p> \n<h3>6. Import your XLS or CSV file from the same dropdown menu.</h3> \n<p>Using the same dropdown menu you used to create your editorial calendar, you'll now import the Excel file itself into Google Calendar. Click that plus sign and select \"Import.\"</p> \n<p>Click the upload box that reads \"Select file from your computer,\" and locate the file entitled \"Blog Editorial Calendar - Excel\" that was included in the ZIP file you downloaded in Step 1, above.</p> \n<h3>7. Select which calendar to add this file to.</h3> \n<p>In the second box below your imported file, click the \"Add to calendar\" dropdown. Be sure to choose the name of the calendar you just created from the dropdown menu, as shown below. Then, click \"Import.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/import-file-google-calendar.png?width=420&amp;name=import-file-google-calendar.png\" alt=\"Import Excel Calendar in Google Calendar\" width=\"420\" style=\"width: 420px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>8. Click Import.</h3> \n<p>Once you've uploaded your Excel file and selected the calendar you want to add this file to, click \"Import.\" You should see an Import calendar dialog box telling you that seven events were successfully imported. Click \"Close.\"</p> \n<p>Now, if you didn't change the dates of the first seven assignments in the original Excel document, you can now. Navigate to January 3, 2016, which is the start of your calendar. Be sure all of your other calendars are temporarily hidden by clicking the colored box to the left of the calendar name. On the week of January 3, 2016, you should just see one \"Blog TBD\" calendar event on each day from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.</p> \n<p>Use the edit window of each assignment to change the publish date. For example, if you're satisfied with the 10 a.m. publish time, you can simply change the date from January X, 2016 to January X, 2019. Each assignment will then appear as event blocks in your 2019 monthly calendar view.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>9. Determine your publishing schedule.</h3> \n<p>Now that you have your calendar created, it's time to fill it in with assignments for the year. This is when you have to make some decisions about your blog's publishing schedule.</p> \n<p>While the Excel file you imported accounts for one blog post per day, this doesn't mean you need to publish seven days a week. Maybe you want to publish every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Or perhaps you plan on publishing on just Thursdays. Remember, the key to successful blogging is quality over quantity. Don't overcommit to a blogging schedule if the quality of your content will take a hit. (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-frequency-benchmarks\">Read this blog post</a> for some great benchmark data on how often companies should blog.)</p> \n<p>If you decide to decrease the number of days you want to publish, click on the calendar event of that day and select \"Delete.\"</p> \n<p>Even if you wanted to publish multiple times a day, updating this calendar is as easy as adding an event. Select a slot on your calendar to add another \"Blog TBD\" event and copy the default description from another one of the events you imported.</p> \n<p>Next, it's time for some minor adjustments. Currently, the \"Blog TBD\" events are set for 10 a.m. Feel free to move these events to whichever time your blog publishes during the day.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>10. Set up recurring events.</h3> \n<p>Now that you have your publish dates and times set, you can make these recurring events on your calendar. If you have a regular publishing schedule, like every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 10:00 a.m., then put that in as a recurring \"slot\" on your calendar. It's okay if you don't have a piece of completed content -- or even a working title -- to put there yet. It's just a reminder that you want to publish <em>something </em>that day.</p> \n<p>To add your recurring slot, click on your first \"Blog TBD\" event and click the pencil icon to edit your event. This will take you to the details of the post, where you can create a custom recurring schedule for each assignment, as shown in the screenshot below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/custom-repeat-schedule.jpg?width=430&amp;name=custom-repeat-schedule.jpg\" alt=\"Setting Custom Repeat Schedule in Google Calendar for Recurring Event\" width=\"430\" style=\"width: 430px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">You can set the post up as a recurring post so it automatically appears every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 10:00 a.m. (or whatever days and times you want).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/custom-repeat-google-editorial-calendar.jpg?width=402&amp;name=custom-repeat-google-editorial-calendar.jpg\" alt=\"Setting Custom Recurrence in Google Calendar for Recurring Event\" width=\"402\" style=\"width: 402px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Once you've selected the recurring days, hit \"Done\" and \"Save,\" and you'll have an editorial calendar framework to work with.</p> \n<p>For now, keep the title of the event as \"Blog TBD,\" but feel free to customize the description with any extra details you want to be sure you include for each post. Wait to invite any guest, as we'll use this to assign posts to an author once you begin filling in your topics. With everything complete, click \"Save.\"</p> \n<p>If you don't have a recurring schedule like this, you might not be in need of an editorial calendar just yet -- but it is a good way to set goals for yourself. If you know you want to publish a certain number of posts each week, even if you don't hit every single slot, it's a good reminder for yourself and your team that this is something you should all be striving for.</p> \n<h3>11. Fill your publishing slots.</h3> \n<p>Now that you know all of the slots you <em>want </em>to fill, you gotta actually ... you know ... fill 'em. (If you don't have topic ideas yet, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator\">check out this free topic idea generator</a>. It'll give you some good ideas for content to put in the calendar.)</p> \n<p>Let's say one of the posts you want to write is \"10 Surprising Facts About Tapirs,\" and one of the posts you've already written and want to publish later is \"Think You're Cut Out to Own a Tapir? Read This First.\" Cool! Just add 'em both to the calendar by clicking on \"Post - TBD\" on the correct date, choosing \"Edit Event,\" and then changing the \"Post - TBD\" text to the actual title of the post.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/change-name-of-post.png?width=390&amp;name=change-name-of-post.png\" alt=\"Changing Name of Post in Google Editorial Calendar\" title=\"change-name-of-post.png\" width=\"390\" style=\"width: 390px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>Now, let's say you don't actually want to write \"10 Surprising Facts About Tapirs,\" and you want your colleague to write it instead. To assign the post an author, you'll invite them to the event as a guest. To do this, click on the event, hit \"Edit Event,\" then invite that colleague to the post by typing his or her name or email address into the \"Add guests\" box, selecting \"Add\" when their name pops up, and hitting \"Save\" on the event once you're done.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add-guests-editorial-google-calendar.jpg?width=690&amp;name=add-guests-editorial-google-calendar.jpg\" alt=\"Adding Guests in Google Calendar\" width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<p>Now, anyone can see who is responsible for writing the post that's going up in that time slot.</p> \n<p>You can take it a step further by adding details to the \"Description\" box of the event, as shown in the large box in the screenshot above. You might include a quick synopsis, the keywords you plan to target the post for, the target audience you're trying to reach, and the offer or CTA you will direct the reader to at the end of the post. Don't forget a due date for the draft.</p> \n<p>Before Google Calendar will let you save the event, you'll see a dialog box asking if you would like to change just this event or all of the events in the series. Select \"Only this event.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/save-only-this-event.jpg?width=348&amp;name=save-only-this-event.jpg\" alt=\"Edit Recurring Event to Save Only This Event\" width=\"348\" style=\"width: 348px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Repeat these steps to assign each blog topic today and in the future.</p> \n<h3>12. Share your editorial calendar with others.</h3> \n<p>Now that you have your calendar set up, you can start to invite people to see it. I'd recommend you start with your immediate team and regular contributors -- as well as anyone who regularly asks you about publishing content on your company blog.</p> \n<p>To share this editorial calendar with people, simply find your editorial calendar under \"My Calendars,\" as shown below. Click the three dots next to the calendar name and then select \"Settings and sharing\" when it appears in the dropdown menu. You'll be taken to the same screen we saw when you first filled out the details of your editorial calendar in Step 2.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sharing-settings-google-calendar.jpg?width=415&amp;name=sharing-settings-google-calendar.jpg\" alt=\"Sharing Settings in Google Calendar\" width=\"415\" style=\"width: 415px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">Then, you can add in the names of people with whom you'd like to share the calendar and set the right permission levels for each invitee.</p> \n<p>It's wise to keep those with the permission settings to manage changes and sharing to a minimum so there aren't too many cooks in the kitchen -- but I recommend you let everyone see all event details so it's clear exactly what content is going up in each slot.</p> \n<p>Under the \"Share with specific people\" heading, enter the email addresses of those on your content team and decide if they have viewing, editing, or admin privileges. Save your updated settings.</p> \n<h2>Why Using Google Calendar as an Editorial Calendar Works</h2> \n<p>I mentioned earlier that we tried a lot of different editorial calendar solutions, and this is the only one that's stuck for more than a couple months. I think one reason for that is because we use Gmail for our corporate email, which means everyone on our team is already in Gmail (and their calendar, specifically) all day. As a result, it isn't hard for people to form a habit of checking the editorial calendar, because it's not difficult for them to find it.</p> \n<p>Google Calendar also makes things really easy to move around and schedule because ... well ... it's already a calendar. It has all the functionality you need to schedule stuff out and let the people who need to know about it know. When we were using other solutions for this, we were trying to hack a calendaring function instead of just relying on one that already existed.</p> \n<p>Along those lines, adding people to view your calendar is simple, which makes it easy for multiple teams to collaborate, see what's being published, and figure out when they might be able to launch content and campaigns.</p> \n<p>Finally, this sets a precedent for other teams to coordinate with you in a really simple way. You can have a calendar for upcoming campaigns, offers, social media pushes, product launches -- you name it. And you can all share those calendars with one another for a single-screen view of everything that's going on so you can coordinate more easily.</p> \n<p>Are there other solutions of there for maintaining an editorial calendar? Of course. But if you're looking for a minimum viable product, and a free one at that, this ain't too shabby. It's kept our content team sane, agile, and transparent for quite some time -- and I think it could do the same for you.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in January 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcreate-robust-editorial-calendar-ht&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Oct 2020 16:15:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"44c07c4cd070d62aee1d8fd338e5fd40","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"cwainwright@hubspot.com (Corey Wainwright)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-23%20at%205.10.04%20PM.png?width=2296&name=Screen%20Shot%202019-10-23%20at%205.10.04%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn56@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-48-811_6d461ab9847d9825.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/create-new-calendar.jpg?width=350&name=create-new-calendar.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn95@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-45-877_87f3a73adb018af1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/create-calendar-google-calendar.png?width=378&name=create-calendar-google-calendar.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn48@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-45-875_8d1344d70e5772fb.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/import-file-google-calendar.png?width=420&name=import-file-google-calendar.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn73@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-52-176_d8d9720d412acfd3.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/custom-repeat-schedule.jpg?width=430&name=custom-repeat-schedule.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-52-455_517b87a035095cac.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/custom-repeat-google-editorial-calendar.jpg?width=402&name=custom-repeat-google-editorial-calendar.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn63@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-33-45-914_d052a6b76e3a56dd.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/change-name-of-post.png?width=390&name=change-name-of-post.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn6@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-45-880_893e8d1d82bc1370.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add-guests-editorial-google-calendar.jpg?width=690&name=add-guests-editorial-google-calendar.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn20@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-47-898_1e78097b050a56e6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/save-only-this-event.jpg?width=348&name=save-only-this-event.jpg":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sharing-settings-google-calendar.jpg?width=415&name=sharing-settings-google-calendar.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-47-027_8f051bff4fc66d83.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcreate-robust-editorial-calendar-ht&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn36@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-48-734_627e46108856bdbd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214389704},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:33:09","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Content Marketing in 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing","description":"<p>Your customers, leads, and audience members want valuable content from your business.

What do you love about it? The ease of gathering relevant information? How you can buy something in one click (and have it delivered tomorrow)? Or how quickly it answers your questions?</p> \n<p>Now think about the people who <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-make-a-website\">created that website</a>. What was their goal?</p> \n<p>They were trying to create a site that had the features you love about it ‚Äî a site that is easy to use, effectively delivers the information you need, and allows you to make smart decisions tailored to your challenges or concerns.</p> \n<p>UX, or user experience, focuses on the end user‚Äôs overall experience, including their perceptions, emotions, and responses to a company‚Äôs product, system, or service. UX is defined by criteria including: <strong>ease of use</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, and <strong>convenience</strong>.</p> \n<p>The concept of UX is most often talked about in terms of tech, such as <a href=\"https://usabilitygeek.com/user-experience/\">smartphones, computers, software, and websites.</a> This is why UX is not only a fairly new field, but also a variable one ‚Äî it changes quickly due to technology advancements, new types of interactions, and user preferences.</p> \n<p>It‚Äôs no secret that customers today want quick and simple ways to meet their needs and solve their pain points. That‚Äôs why UX matters so much.</p> \n<p>Whether or not you‚Äôre in tech, the company you own or work for most likely has a website. Well, customers could write you off in a matter of seconds if they don‚Äôt find your website useful and easy to use. In fact, most website visitors determine <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/\">whether or not they want to leave within a minute</a> of opening a page.</p> \n<p>Follow along to learn more about the importance of the emerging field of UX, what today's designers are being hired to do, and why every type of business can benefit from thoughtful UX design.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>UX design is about creating products \"that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users,\" according to the <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design\">Interaction Design Foundation</a>. Within UX design, there are a few different categories.</p> \n<h3>1. Interaction Design</h3> \n<p>A subset of UX design is interaction design (IxD). It is defined as ... yup, you guessed it... the interaction between a user and a product ‚Äî the goal of that interaction is for it to be pleasant for the user.</p> \n<h3>2. Visual Design</h3> \n<p>In visual design, creators use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-design\">illustrations, photography, typography, space, layouts, and color to enhance user experience. </a>To have successful visual design, artistic design principles including balance, space, and contrast are crucial. Color, shape, size, and other elements also impact visual design.</p> \n<h3>3. User Research&nbsp;</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/user-testing\">User research</a> is the last major element of UX design. User research is how companies determine what their customers and users want and need. At its core, your website should solve a problem, and so this is an important step in determining what exactly your users require. Without it, your designs are simply guesses.</p> \n<h3>4. Information Architecture</h3> \n<p>Designers use information architecture to structure and label content so that users can find information easily. Information architecture is used on websites, smartphones, apps, and even in the physical places we go to. Ease of use and discoverability are two important factors of information architecture, which is why it is so closely related to UX design.</p> \n<p>Think about the New York City Subway map. This is a great example of information architecture that helps people understand how to get from one place to the next. According to the <a href=\"https://www.iainstitute.org/what-is-ia\">Information Architecture Institute</a>, \"If you‚Äôre making things for others, you‚Äôre practicing information architecture.\"</p> \n<p><strong><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20UX%20Design.png?width=600&amp;name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20UX%20Design.png\" alt=\"information-architecture\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" /></strong></strong><a href=\"http://www.nycsubwayguide.com/subway/subway_map.aspx\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Source:&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.nycsubwayguide.com/subway/subway_map.aspx\">NYC Subway Guide</a></em></strong></strong></strong></strong></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>UX Design Principles</h2> \n<p>UX is an ever-changing field, but the fundamental UX design principles remain the same. Designers also have to determine what they want in terms of visual balance. Being clear and concise is crucial ‚Ä¶ less is more! You want your design to be intuitive, and most importantly, your design should meet the user‚Äôs needs.</p> \n<p>While UX is subject to trends and new technology, there are a few core principles that stay the same. These help designers look at various problems through a&nbsp;methodology that's consistent and focused.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Be contextual:</strong> You want individuals to know exactly where they are in their user journey. They should never feel lost or overwhelmed. Your design is there to guide them along their journey.</li> \n <li><strong>Be human: </strong>No user enjoys feeling like they are interacting with a machine. You‚Äôll gain the trust of the end-user if you show them your brand‚Äôs personality and approachability.</li> \n <li><strong>Be findable: </strong>Users don‚Äôt want to waste time. With a successful UX design, your work will be easy to find and navigate.</li> \n <li><strong>Be easy: </strong>Being consistent and straightforward will go a long way with your users. You build relationships with your users by providing them with enjoyable and easy experiences.</li> \n <li><strong>Be simple: </strong>No fluff, tangents, or unnecessary descriptions. Get to the point. Let‚Äôs be honest here ‚Ä¶ these days, everyone has a short attention span.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>These principles will guide you at every stage of the UX design process. Let's walk through what each of those stages entails below.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>UX Design Process</h2> \n<p>There are typically several stages of the UX design process to consider. UX design takes a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/human-centered-design\">human-centered design approach</a> during all these stages. This is about considering the needs of the people you are designing for, coming up with a wide range of solutions to resolve the issue they are facing, designing prototypes for the users to test, and then finally putting the best solution in place for the user. If you look at the issue from the perspective of the user, and design with them in mind, you will create solutions they will want to adopt.</p> \n<p>Let's take a closer look at each stage of the design process below.</p> \n<h3>1. Understand your user‚Äôs pain points.</h3> \n<p>Since UX design is about improving the user experience, your first step is finding out what the challenges and expectations of users are. Once you understand what the problems are, you can solve for them.</p> \n<p>In an <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/the-ux-design-process-an-actionable-guide-to-your-first-job-in-ux/\">article for Career Foundry</a>, Rosie Allabarton stresses the role of empathy at this stage of the UX design process. She said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be working with groups of users who come from a variety of backgrounds and are bringing different experiences with them. Your job is to try to understand why they are behaving the way they are, not to try to change that behavior or influence it, but accommodate it within the product.‚Äù</p> \n<p>There are a few approaches you can take to gather this important user research.</p> \n<h4>Interviews</h4> \n<p>One of the best ways to understand your audience is to be in the same room as them. User interviews typically entail a group of users browsing through an existing site or product or even a competitor‚Äôs while members of your team observe. That way, your team can watch how people interact with a website or product and gather feedback in real time. This can help uncover areas of improvement that you and your team hadn‚Äôt noticed. Like maybe users are overlooking the CTA button on your homepage, or maybe they want a search box to navigate a website. You can then incorporate this feedback into your design process.</p> \n<p>If in-person interviews isn‚Äôt an option, then you can always hold remote user testing sessions</p> \n<h4>Online Surveys</h4> \n<p>While interviews are ideal for getting rich insights from a small group of users, online surveys are a great way to gather feedback from a larger audience. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/surveys\">Surveys</a> consist of a series of targeted questions sent to a sample of your audience. These questions can take on a variety of forms, including yes/no, multiple choice, checkbox, dropdown, ranking, ranking scale, and textbox. Online surveys are typically distributed via forms, and then compiled in a database so you and other stakeholders can review them.</p> \n<h3>2. Create user personas.</h3> \n<p>Now that you have all this user research, you‚Äôll want to summarize it. Creating user personas is a great way to do so. Also known as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-definition-under-100-sr?hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer personas</a>, these personas are semi-fictional representations of your ideal customers based on data and research. Buyer personas help you better understand your existing and prospective customers, so you can tailor your products as well as your services, content, and messaging to meet their specific needs, behaviors, and concerns.</p> \n<div> \n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update.png?width=1000&amp;name=UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update.png\" alt=\"Buyer persona template with sections for goals, challenges, and what can we do\" width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"> </img>\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>These personas help ensure that everyone on your team understands, remembers, and centers the end user throughout the design process.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>To learn how to research and create personas, check out the post </em><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">How to Create Detailed Buyer Personas for Your Business [Free Persona Template]</a><em>. </em></p> \n<h3>3. Map out user journeys.</h3> \n<p>While you can categories users into different types of personas, every user is unique. That means different users will interact with your site in different ways ‚Äî even if they have the same goal. Say they‚Äôre looking to apply to a job at your company. Some might navigate to your homepage, click <em>Careers</em> from your navigation bar, and then browse your job openings. Others might search your company name plus ‚Äúcareers‚Äù in Google.</p> \n<p>Your goal is to identify the primary goals of your users and ensure they can complete their goals. So an ecommerce site, for example, will need to identify all the different ways a customer might want to complete a purchase and make sure their site enables them at every step. Providing functionality to ensure a customer can complete a purchase on a desktop, tablet, and mobile device are just a few scenarios you‚Äôd have to plan for. You‚Äôll likely <a href=\"http://www.uxforthemasses.com/scenario-mapping/\">need a lot of colorful post-it notes</a> for this stage.</p> \n<h3>4. Create website wireframes.</h3> \n<p>Now that you‚Äôve mapped out user journeys on paper, it‚Äôs time to map them out in your actual product with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-wireframe\">website wireframes</a> and prototypes. You can think of a wireframe as a sketch of your product or website.</p> \n<p>When creating a wireframe for your website or product, you can plot out how you want to display your main features, allocate space, and present images and content and how this layout helps (or hinders) the user from achieving their goals before introducing design elements like color schemes.</p> \n<p>Evaluating your product‚Äôs functionality and intended user behavior at this stage can help you find potential problems or missing features that might get in the way of conversions or sales later on ‚Äî before you‚Äôre too far along in the design process. That way, you can easily make changes, get approval from other stakeholders, and confidently move to the next stage of the design process.</p> \n<p>Wireframes range in complexity. Some are hand drawn with a pencil, others are created with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wireframe-tools\">software tools like Sketch and Canva</a>. Here‚Äôs an illustrated example.</p> \n<div> \n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update.jpeg?width=1000&amp;name=UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update.jpeg\" alt=\"Illustrated example of website wireframe with logo, banner, navbar, sidebar, and content area\" width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"> </img>\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wireframes-prototype-testing/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>5. Start prototyping.</h3> \n<p>Think of a prototype as the final draft of your product or website before the coding begins. It‚Äôs not the final version, but it‚Äôs close enough that you can fully test the product before it launches and demonstrate it to management and other stakeholders.</p> \n<p>Unlike a wireframe, a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/prototype-vs-wireframe\">prototype</a> will include font, images, icons, and colors. This phase is focused less on aesthetics and more on user flow, however. Prototypes will be interactive, allowing you, users, and other stakeholders to experience how the product works in real life.</p> \n<p>You‚Äôll run more user testing at this phase to uncover issues like whether your checkout process requires too many clicks or your homepage is difficult to navigate.You‚Äôll likely experiment with navigation and other functionality at this stage, and produce lots of iterations.</p> \n<p>To create a prototype and subsequent iterations, you‚Äôll need to use a dedicated tool like Adobe XD, InVision, or the free Justinmind. Here‚Äôs an example of a prototype built with Justinmind.</p> \n<div> \n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-1.png?width=1000&amp;name=UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-1.png\" alt=\"Justinmind prototype of ecommerce website on desktop and mobile\" width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"> </img>\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.justinmind.com/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>At this point, the coding can begin so you‚Äôll pass your prototype to designers and developers who will build a user interface. More on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ux-user-experience#what-is-user-interface-design\">what a UI is and how it differs from UX later</a>.</p> \n<h2>UX Deliverables</h2> \n<p>UX deliverables are the various outputs of a UX design process. The designer and team will have to produce and present these deliverables to an internal team and external clients for review ‚Äî either during the design process or once the project is complete.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As tangible records of the work that has occurred, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/09/comprehensive-overview-ux-design-deliverables/\">UX deliverables</a> are a critical part of the design process. These deliverables help UX designers to effectively communicate their design ideas and findings, and make it clear to stakeholders why recommendations for changes and improvements are made. They also help designers get buy-in for their ideas.</p> \n<h3>1. User Research</h3> \n<p>User needs, tendencies, and motivations can be determined through <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/user-testing-tools-and-techniques\">different types of user research</a>. This might include quantitative and qualitative data from user testing sessions and focus groups. It could detail feedback on sign up flows, the onboarding process, and customer service inquiries.</p> \n<p>The goal is to have a detailed analysis of what's both working on the site and what could be improved ‚Äî and to have this all backed by information gathered from users. Researchers may create&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\" style=\"font-size: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.01em;\">buyer personas</a>&nbsp;based off of real user data to help them accurately determine who will be using their device, website, or app. Through user research, designers understand and empathize with the user.</p> \n<h3>2. Competitor Assessment</h3> \n<p>Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors is a way to enhance your own UX strategy. A great way to do this is by creating a competitive analysis report that details the interaction design of your competitors and provides an analysis of where you see pitfalls and missed opportunities ‚Äî things your business can take advantage of.</p> \n<h3>3. Interaction Design</h3> \n<p>An interaction design deliverable could come in the form of a prototype so that people can review how interactions with the site would occur ‚Äî showing how people would complete key tasks, get information, use a product, the flow of finding information, and how easy the product is to use. You want your prototype to be as similar to the final product as possible, so you can get sign off on the design before you begin building it.</p> \n<h3>4. Information Architecture</h3> \n<p>IA is the process of taking information and organizing it in a way that is easy to understand. For large websites, this is especially important, as you need to understand what content exists and how to organize it in a way that makes sense for your visitors. The result might be a content inventory, sitemap with suggested navigation, or sample user flows that reveal how visitors move through a site.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-06%20at%204.57.34%20PM-2.png?width=1460&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202018-06-06%20at%204.57.34%20PM-2.png\" width=\"1460\" style=\"width: 1460px;\" alt=\"site-map\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Source:&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/a-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture-for-ux-designers/\">Adobe Blog</a></em></strong></span></p> \n<p>Now that we understand the different deliverables a client or manager might ask from a UX designer, let's take a closer look at arguably the most important: UX research.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>User Experience Research</h2> \n<p>Without research, all of this focus on what the user needs and wants would be impossible. UX research is the <a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-research\">investigation of users and what they need</a>, which informs the UX design process. Companies and designers use this research to come to specific conclusions about what is working for users and what needs to be changed. There are several ways companies and designers perform UX research.</p> \n<h3>Usability Testing</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/usability-testing\">Usability testing</a> evaluates how successful a product is by testing it on actual users. It gives companies real input on how individuals are using a product or system and how that product or system works for that user. There are two primary testing methods.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Hallway usability testing</strong> is a quick and cheap way for companies and researchers to get information from users who may not know of your company or products. Random individuals use the products and give feedback on their experience.</p> \n<p><strong>Remote usability testing</strong> allows companies to research with users in their natural environment (such as in their home or office). These tests can be moderated in any way the company chooses.</p> \n<h3>Usability Testing Tools</h3> \n<p>Usability testing tools allow researchers and designers to compile accurate feedback from users and then analyze that feedback to make data-driven changes. If you‚Äôre looking for a tool that can help you test how easy-to-use your site or product is, check out these options:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.crazyegg.com/\">Crazy Egg</a>: This tool allows companies to see exactly what users are clicking on while on their website. Crazy Egg also records exactly where site visitors are coming from, including geographic location, and if they were referred from another site.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com/\">Hotjar</a>: This tool combines analytics and feedback to give an overview on ways to improve user experience. They do this through the use of heatmaps, visitor rates, conversion funnels, and more.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><em>For more usability testing tools to consider, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/website-user-testing-tools?_ga=2.54635811.966330271.1565107559-1493293515.1553017609\">this post</a>.</em></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Enhance User Experience</h2> \n<p>Through the research and testing mentioned above, user experiences can always be improved. Some of the most common ways to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/12-ways-to-improve-user-experience?_ga=2.54635811.966330271.1565107559-1493293515.1553017609\">improve user experience</a> include: Taking a consultative approach to improving the experience, determining calls to action, implementing responsive web design, considering Fitt's Law (more on this next), avoiding overwhelming data entry, and more.</p> \n<h3>Using Fitt‚Äôs Law to Enhance UX</h3> \n<p>Fitt‚Äôs law is a predictive model that determines the amount of time it takes for a specific user to move their mouse or cursor to a target area on a website. There are multiple versions of Fitt‚Äôs law that exist but they all revolve around the general idea that, <a href=\"https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law\">‚ÄúThe time required to move to a target depends on the distance to it, yet relates inversely to its size.‚Äù</a> Fitt‚Äôs law is widely used in UX design to improve ergonomics in addition to usability for users.</p> \n<p>Here‚Äôs an example of this at work: Have you seen the new Touch Bar on Apple‚Äôs MacBook Pro? This is a touchscreen above the keyboard that speeds up a user‚Äôs experience when using Google, bookmarking a page, changing screen brightness, volume, and more. Touch Bar options change depending on what page you are browsing while on your laptop, whether that be an app, a site you are visiting, or even just your personal settings.</p> \n<p>With the Touch Bar, the user‚Äôs experience is simplified because many commonly used settings are in one compact location. Fitt‚Äôs law states the further away and smaller an object or button is for a user, the harder it is for that user to click on it. That‚Äôs why the Touch Bar is such a great example of taking Fitt‚Äôs Law and successfully applying it to your device to enhance user experience.</p> \n<h3>UX Design Tools</h3> \n<p>Whether you are researching, prototyping, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wireframe-tools\">wireframing</a>, storyboarding, or creating graphics, there are multiple UX tools available to assist you during the design process. In fact, there are so many tools on the market, some free and some that require a subscription fee, that it may be overwhelming for designers who are unsure of exactly what they need. To get you started, here‚Äôs a list of some popular and valuable tools to use in your UX design work:</p> \n<h4>1. <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks.html\">Adobe Fireworks</a></h4> \n<p>Adobe Fireworks CS6 gives web designers a way to create graphics for their web pages without getting into the code or design details. There are a few reasons why UX designers use Adobe Fireworks: The tool has impressive pixel accuracy, has image compression abilities (JPEG, GIF, etc.), allows users to create functional websites, and build vectors. This is a great option especially if you are already familiar with other programs in the Creative Cloud.</p> \n<h4>2. <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html?sdid=12B9F15S&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!269223088203!e!!g!!adobe%20xd&amp;ef_id=WvEATwAABgAp-hGW:20180604193942:s\">Adobe XD</a></h4> \n<p>With&nbsp;Adobe XD, you can design websites and mobile apps, as well as create prototypes, wireframes, and vector designs. Users can share interactive prototypes on multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, so it‚Äôs perfect for team collaboration.</p> \n<h4>3. <a href=\"https://www.axure.com/\">Axure</a></h4> \n<p>Axure RP Pro is another great UX design tool ‚Äî that‚Äôs also free. Axure has several capabilities including wireframing, prototyping, and documenting. It can even help you create user flows and sitemaps.&nbsp;Axure&nbsp;is perfect for creating web and desktop applications, and it gives users the ability to easily export to PDF or HTML for review.</p> \n<h4>4. <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html?sdid=KKQLQ&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!247662215681!b!!g!!illustrator%20trial&amp;ef_id=WvEATwAABgAp-hGW:20180524142807:s\">Adobe Illustrator</a> and a Free Alternative</h4> \n<p>If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable alternative to Adobe software, such as&nbsp;Adobe&nbsp;Illustrator&nbsp;(which is primarily used to create vector graphics), we‚Äôve got you.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://inkscape.org/en/\">Inkscape</a>&nbsp;is known for doing most of what Illustrator does, but for free. This software is open source and can be used to create impressive vector graphics. The only issue you could run into is lag, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/reviews/inkscape-editor\">some users have reported</a>&nbsp;that the program is slow. If you‚Äôre partial to Illustrator, that‚Äôs OK too.</p> \n<h4>5. <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/\">Sketch</a></h4> \n<p>Sketch&nbsp;is an end-to-end software with specific features including non-destructive editing (meaning Sketch won‚Äôt change the pixels in the photo you are working with), code export, pixel precision, prototyping, vector editing, and more. With Sketch, you can reuse and update your designs easily.</p> \n<h4>6. Storyboard Software</h4> \n<p>You might be wondering why you would need to storyboard in UX design. It‚Äôs a great way to visually predict and review the way a user would interact with and experience a product in a broader context. There are several storyboard tools available, with varying levels of features and complexity.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/\">Storyboarder</a>&nbsp;is a free storyboard software option, which has basic features made for designers of all levels. This software allows users to quickly create drawings and stick figures to lay out a plot or idea.</p> \n<p>Another storyboard software option is <a href=\"https://www.toonboom.com/products/storyboardpro\">Toon Boom Storyboard Pro</a>. It combines drawing, animation, camera controls, and numerous other features, all for an annual or monthly fee. It has a wider range of features for more complex storytelling and detailed prep work. Both options are great for designers looking to visually tell the story of their persona or users.</p> \n<p>Storyboards are also a great way to bring in all stakeholders, including researchers, developers, and UI designers. Before we discuss how to become a UX designer, let‚Äôs make sure we understand the difference between two similar roles: UX and UI designers.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What is User Interface design?</h2> \n<p>Remember when Apple unveiled its <a href=\"https://www.punchkick.com/blog/2015/08/07/how-apple-has-shaped-the-user-interface\">click wheel</a> for the iPod? When it was introduced, the feature was intuitive and highly functional ‚Äî not to mention cool-looking.</p> \n<p>This is a great example of a successful user interface (UI). UI refers to how people interact with computers, machines, websites, apps, wearables, and other programs or devices. User interface design is the process of making these things as easy to use and efficient as possible.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>Common UI Elements</h3> \n<p>Although UX and UI have similar definitions, it‚Äôs important to note the key differences that separate the two topics. Again, UI focuses on a product‚Äôs appearances and surfaces, while UX is more concerned with how people interact with a site. Here are some common UI terms you should know to better understand how the two differentiate:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Informational Components:</strong> UI designers use informational components to enhance the reading experience or give more information. Examples of informational components are progress bars, notifications, and message boxes. Designers use these when they want to make it clear to the user that they have completed a task, or if they want to notify the user that action on their part is necessary.</li> \n <li><strong>Breadcrumb Navigation:</strong> This is a design tool often used by UI designers to visually increase the usability of a website. It allows users to see their location on a site in a <a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/breadcrumbs-for-web-sites-what-when-and-how-9273dacf1960\">hierarchical structure.</a> It doesn‚Äôt need to have special visual features or over-the-top design ‚Äî it should just clearly state where a person is located on a site. You may have noticed these links along the top of a webpage while online shopping or on another site.</li> \n <li><strong>Input Controls:</strong> Input Controls give individuals multiple options in response to a question you are asking. These are things like checkboxes, drop-down lists, and toggles. Keep the information you are asking in your input controls simple and to-the-point so it‚Äôs easy to find what the user needs.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/breadcrumb-navigation.png?width=600&amp;name=breadcrumb-navigation.png\" alt=\"breadcrumb-navigation\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source: <em><a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/breadcrumbs-for-web-sites-what-when-and-how-9273dacf1960\">UX Planet</a></em></span></p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>If you love designing, researching, working with other people in a fast-paced environment, and listening to others‚Äô experiences, a career in UX design may be right for you. As a UX designer, you‚Äôd focus on the conceptual aspects of design and create better experiences for users.</p> \n<p>Here are the steps to follow to become a UX designer.</p> \n<h3>1. Do your research.</h3> \n<p>This step may seem like a given, but pursuing a career path (or changing yours altogether) is a big move. Do plenty of research to ensure that you want to be a UX designer. Guides like this one will help give you an idea of what UX design entails. You can also lookup <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-ux-designer/\">\"day-in-the-life\" articles</a>, podcasts, and books to better understand how other UX designers spend their workdays.</p> \n<h3>2. Take a UX design course.</h3> \n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://uxmastery.com/resources/ux-degrees/\">higher education courses </a>available around the world, though they typically require a four-year undergraduate design curriculum as a prerequisite.</p> \n<p>However, some programs allow for more flexibility, such as the online <a href=\"https://quonline.quinnipiac.edu/online-programs/online-certificate-programs/UX-design-certificate/\">Quinnipiac University Graduate Program in User Experience Design.</a> There are also <a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2014/10/06/ux-certification-programs/\">UX certification programs</a> for professionals. These vary in commitment length and level of expertise upon receipt of the certificate.</p> \n<h3>3. Apply for a UX design internship.</h3> \n<p>A UX design internship is valuable for a few reasons. First, UX design internships bridge the gap between education and real-life experience. Internships allow you to put what you've learned in the classroom (or online) to work while receiving helpful feedback from your peers and coworkers.</p> \n<p>Secondly, UX design internships allow you to build a live portfolio of design work done on behalf of a real company. While demo work is valuable for demonstrating skill and process, you can report on the impact and results of the work you complete during your internship.</p> \n<p>Lastly, UX design internships introduce valuable mentor relationships. Design mentors are critical to developing your skills, receiving constructive criticism, and expanding your network ‚Äî three things that can help you land your dream UX design job.</p> \n<p>To find a UX design internship, start with sites like <a href=\"http://linkedin.com\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"http://themuse.com\">The Muse</a>, <a href=\"http://glassdoor.com\">Glassdoor</a>, and <a href=\"https://angel.co/\">AngelList</a>, as well as simply searching on Google. You can also target the companies themselves: <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/jobs/us/students.html\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://careers.google.com/students/engineering-and-technical-internships/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://careers.microsoft.com/students/us/en\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://boards.greenhouse.io/reddit\">Reddit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/careers/university.html\">Adobe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?ei=8c8OXO6lI4qh_wScmI74Dg&amp;q=amazon+ux+design+internship&amp;oq=amazon+ux+design+internship&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i30.15392.15890..16075...0.0..0.68.252.4......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71.LI-fBEEPkGk&amp;ibp=htl;jobs&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj3itXBkJbfAhUrwVQKHT0_CxUQp4wCMAB6BAgGEAs#htidocid=XJE4d6VuThoiw7ppAAAAAA%3D%3D\">Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/company/careers/university-recruiting/\">Salesforce</a> all offer UX design internship programs.</p> \n<h3>4. Build your UX design portfolio.</h3> \n<p>Once you‚Äôre ready to start applying for your dream UX job, you‚Äôll need a stand-out resume and a flashy portfolio. Use a site like <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\">Dribble</a> or <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/\">Behance</a> to showcase your work, or create your own website using a tool like <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\">SquareSpace</a>.</p> \n<p>When building your portfolio site, keep these tips in mind:</p> \n<h4>Make it visually stunning.</h4> \n<p>Presentation is everything. Your work should speak for itself ... show don‚Äôt tell! Your choice in color, typography, and layout all play a factor here.</p> \n<h4>Include an ‚Äúabout‚Äù page.</h4> \n<p>Hiring managers and recruiters want to get to know you, how you think about design, what inspires you, and what makes you unique. Why should they hire you? What value can you add to your new potential company and team?</p> \n<h4>Have clear navigation and links throughout your portfolio site.</h4> \n<p>Can you imagine the hiring manager at your dream company having a hard time navigating the portfolio site of a UX designer? Awkward. In your navigation bar, include options such as: ‚Äúportfolio,‚Äù ‚Äúabout,‚Äù ‚Äúcontact,‚Äù and ‚Äúresume‚Äù to avoid any confusion.</p> \n<h4>Explain your personal UX process.</h4> \n<p>Your future employer wants to know how you think. Include information that lets the hiring manager in on your <a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/how-to-structure-your-first-ux-design-portfolio-7b51576a04df\">UX researching, brainstorming, wireframing, designing, and prototyping</a> processes.</p> \n<h4>Create additional portfolios to expand your network.</h4> \n<p>Use other tools to make your work available on sites where designers and those looking to hire designers to spend their time. <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/search?field=51\">Behance</a> and <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\">Dribble</a> are great portfolio sites for people looking for inspiration, networking, and new career opportunities.</p> \n<p>If you're interested in this career path, we've gathered some ideas for UX projects that can help get you started and built out your portfolio. Let's take a look.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>UX Design Ideas</h2> \n<p>Are you interested in UX design but don‚Äôt know where to get started? We‚Äôve compiled a list of ideas for people who need inspiration just like you. Completing these projects will not only provide you with valuable experience, it will also provide valuable additions to your portfolio. Let‚Äôs take a look at some of these ideas and the real-life examples that go with them.</p> \n<h3>Redesign the digital menu of your favorite local restaurant.</h3> \n<p>Redesigning a restaurant‚Äôs menu is a great exercise in anticipating user needs. To find the right balance of information and images, you‚Äôll have to decide what readers need to know and see to make informed decisions, and what will simply overwhelm them. You might experiment with the categorization, descriptions, and ratings of the food items, and more.</p> \n<p>Below is a drink menu by Panji Arafat on Dribble.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"UX project showing redesigned drink menu for Miracle Coffee shop\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-4.png?width=1000&amp;name=UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-4.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 1000px;\" title=\"\" width=\"1000\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/2946912-43-Drink-Menu\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>Sketch a better interface for your toaster oven.</h3> \n<p>This will help you practice analyzing an existing product and identifying where you can add value in terms of functionality and design. The best part is you can complete this project without leaving your kitchen!</p> \n<p>Below is an example by designer Sarah Kerbleski.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 540px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\"> \n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 63.75%; margin: 0px;\"> \n   <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/30642565?app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"408\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h3>Redesign the homepage of your personal site.</h3> \n<p>You can redesign the homepage of any website, but using your own personal site or a site that you have access to analytics to is ideal. That way, you can practice accumulating and analyzing user research and using those insights to inform your design process.</p> \n<p>When HubSpot redesigned its homepage back in 2016, UX Designer Austin Knight&nbsp;analyzed massive amounts of data and discovered three important trends: a significant number of users were moving from the homepage to the pricing page, FAQ page, and the search bar. All of these trends supported the conclusion that the homepage was lacking critical information that was affecting its conversions. You can read more about this redesign in the <a href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/ux-case-study-hubspot-redesigned-homepage/\">UXPin case study</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"2016 Redesign of HubSpot homepage for UX\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-3.png?width=1000&amp;name=UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-3.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 1000px;\" title=\"\" width=\"1000\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/ux-case-study-hubspot-redesigned-homepage/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>Redesign a feature in an application that frustrates you.</h3> \n<p>This can help you practice redesigning some functionality in an existing app, rather than starting from scratch. Product designer Jo Zhouzheng did exactly this for Doordash. Frustrated by the restaurant and menu browsing experience in this popular food delivery app, Zhouzheng redesigned the interface. Here‚Äôs a before and after look of the interfaces.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Redesigned menu of India Palace Cuisine on Doordash app for UX project\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-2.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/doordash-redesign-a-ux-case-study-559370cac697\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>Design an app for checking in at your primary care doctor or specialist.</h3> \n<p>Designing any health app will be a great exercise in UX. Focusing on the check-in process specifically will help you practice identifying and solving for user pain points. You can focus on an in-person or virtual check-in, like Digital Product Designer Divan Raj did below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-2.png?width=1000&amp;name=UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-2.png\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 1000px; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"1000\" alt=\"Three interfaces of patient app designed for UX project\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/6817761-Patient-app/attachments/1455239\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>Create personas for an app you want to design (or redesign).</h3> \n<p>Creating personas is an important part of the UX design process. You can get some experience by creating personas for a hypothetical app, or an existing one. Maybe you like an app or website, but know the functionality or design could be better. In that case, you could define new personas for that product. Or you could create personas for a product that you‚Äôve thought of.</p> \n<p>Daorong Fang, for example, created a prototype of a mobile app for in-person social networking events. To illustrate her key audience and help potential stakeholders sympathize with her target issues (ie. how awkward and time-consuming networking can be), she built two personas. One of them ‚Äî&nbsp;Techy Sarah ‚Äî is shown below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-1.jpeg?width=1000&amp;name=UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 1000px;\" title=\"\" width=\"1000\" alt=\"Persona for UX project for social networking app\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.daorongfang.com/5-to-8\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>Map out a voter‚Äôs journey in a local, state, or federal election office . &nbsp;</h3> \n<p>This can help you understand how UX design can contribute to larger phenomena, like low voter turnout, and flex your analytic and critical thinking muscles. By plotting out the path from registration to the point where voters have a ballot in their hands, you‚Äôll uncover regulations, time constraints, a lack of transparency, poor design choices, and other pain points.</p> \n<p>Whitney Quesenbery and Dana Chisnell founded <a href=\"https://civicdesign.org/\">The Center for Civic Design</a>&nbsp;with this exact goal in mind: they wanted to understand where people fall off the voter journey, and how to get them back on. Below is one of their Field Guides to Ensuring Voter Intent, which helps local officials create well designed ballots.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Field guide to voter intent is part of UX project for increasing voter turnout\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-3.jpeg?width=1000&amp;name=UX%20Design%20Pillar%20Update-3.jpeg\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; width: 1000px; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"1000\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://99u.adobe.com/articles/59565/these-ux-designers-are-rethinking-the-voter-ballot\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>These are just a few ideas.

But, additionally, backlinks can also <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/backlink-strategies\">increase your search engine authority</a>.</p> \n<p>When high-authority sites link to your content, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/backlink-strategies\">search engine algorithms take this into account</a> when ranking your content on result pages. This means that the more backlinks you get from credible websites, the higher your search rankings could get.</p> \n<p>However, although referral traffic can be vital for your blog‚Äôs success, it's also the hardest to earn.</p> \n<p>Here's why:</p> \n<p>When a HubSpot Blog post gets a backlink, this typically means that a person has found our content, valued it, and shared the post's URL on their own website. Then, when others find and click this shared URL, it results in referral traffic.</p> \n<p>In short, a person working for a website or online publication has to find our content and determine that it's valuable, credible, or engaging enough to share with their site‚Äôs audiences.</p> \n<p>Because getting referrals can be challenging and complex, I've worked closely with <a href=\"https://www.nicairina.com/\">Irina Nica</a>, a Sr. Marketing Manager of Product Awareness -- and HubSpot's resident backlink expert -- to develop the blog's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/link-building-stats\">link-building</a> playbook.</p> \n<p>Although it takes time and solid research to create posts that earn quality backlinks, Nica and I find that the traffic returns are worth the effort.</p> \n<p>To help other bloggers in their quest for referrals, search authority, and non-organic traffic, here are three types of blog posts that get the most backlinks, according to Nica.</p> \n<h2>3 Types of Blog Posts That Earn the Most Backlinks</h2> \n<h3>Tell Stories Backed By Original Data</h3> \n<p>\"The blog posts that typically get the most backlinks are backed by original research and data,\" says Nica. \"If these blog post angles speak to wide audiences, they can even increase the chance of press mentions.\"</p> \n<p>Why? People use data to make decisions, inspire their own content, and learn more about their industry. So, when you publish original data, it's not shocking to think that other sites might be interested in sharing your research by citing, quoting, or directly linking to it.</p> \n<p>But, while it might be tempting to just throw a handful of original stats into a blog post's body and hit \"publish\", Nica says the backlinks for a post will be even stronger if you tell a story about how those stats impact your readers.</p> \n<p>\"The key is to help readers find meaning in the data you present by telling a compelling story,\" Nica says. \"Stories make data appealing and memorable. A good story is often one that‚Äôs related to recent events that made the headlines, or provides context on an issue that affects a wide range of readers in your industry.\"</p> \n<p>\"We recently launched a data-driven piece that‚Äôs relevant to recent news: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data\">How COVID-19 Is Impacting Sales and Marketing Performance</a>,\" Nica says. \"Because it‚Äôs timely and it provides useful information for marketers and business owners around the world, this article earned more than 500 backlinks from over 200 referring domains,\" Nica explains.</p> \n<p>The HubSpot Blog also publishes informative, data-driven posts that relate to industry trends, common strategies, or topics related to our subject matter expertise, rather than just news or events. These types of posts are also very linkable because they aim to help readers with day-to-day tasks, tactics, or decisions.</p> \n<p>For example, I recently wrote a post called, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/preferred-story-platforms\">Instagram, Facebook, or Snapchat: Which Stories Are People Actually Watching?</a> In the post, I shared results from s survey of more than 300 consumers about their social media Story preferences.</p> \n<p>\"Pam's article answers a relevant question for social media marketers -- which are a major part of the HubSpot Blog audience,\" Nica says. \"To create this piece, Pam used a survey tool called <a href=\"http://luc.id\">Lucid</a> to gather data. Then she used internal expertise to dig deeper into these results and explain how this impacts our work as marketers.\"</p> \n<p>Nica says that the post received more than 960 social shares in the past six months and over 500 backlinks from 100 Referring Domains. It <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/social-media-news-october-2019/\">was also mentioned in a post</a> from another marketing blog, Buffer.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/3%20Types%20of%20Blog%20Posts%20That%20Earn%20the%20Most%20Backlinks,%20According%20to%20HubSpots%20Link-Building%20Expert-1.png?width=600&amp;name=3%20Types%20of%20Blog%20Posts%20That%20Earn%20the%20Most%20Backlinks,%20According%20to%20HubSpots%20Link-Building%20Expert-1.png\" alt=\"blog post with data that received referrals and backlinks\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Molding Dull Data Sets into Intriguing Stories</h4> \n<p>Even if your data doesn't relate to an event or viral social media trend, it can still be compelling to readers if your post clearly explains why it's valuable.</p> \n<p>When HubSpot bloggers are tasked with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog\">telling an intriguing story around data sets</a>, we first try to explain how each major stat could impact marketers, sales reps, or service reps, depending on the audience we're trying to reach. In some posts, we also might give tips on how to adjust or embrace business tactics based on major facts or figures.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/black-friday-ads\">Here's an example</a> of how we draw out a full story from a few basic stats about Black Friday ads. Although <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/black-friday-ads\">this post relates to a newsier topic</a>, you can use the format as inspiration for data-driven posts related to almost anything in your industry.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/3%20Types%20of%20Blog%20Posts%20That%20Earn%20the%20Most%20Backlinks,%20According%20to%20HubSpots%20Link-Building%20Expert.png?width=600&amp;name=3%20Types%20of%20Blog%20Posts%20That%20Earn%20the%20Most%20Backlinks,%20According%20to%20HubSpots%20Link-Building%20Expert.png\" alt=\"a high-perforrming data blog post that received high backlinks\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>To make the data given in this post easy to consume and interesting to the reader, we created a list item and intriguing subhead around three major Black Friday survey data points. Then, we took the time to explain exactly what each point means for advertisers and marketers. To add visuals to the story, we also created quick infographics for each section:</p> \n<p>By expanding on what each stat means for your reader, you'll supply your audience with interesting data, establish your brand's expertise, and -- most importantly -- provide your valuable takeaways that readers can share with others or use in daily life.</p> \n<h4>Can't access original data? Try this alternative.</h4> \n<p>There are a number of free or affordable tools online that can help blog teams gain data quickly. But, if you don't have a survey or polling tool at easy access, or the time to conduct research, we've found that external research compilation posts also work well.</p> \n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/millennials-vs-gen-z\">just one example of a high-performing post</a> where I compiled and discussed a number of studies that compared millennials and Gen Z. In the post's first six months, HubSpot data shows that it drove over 5,000 views from social media alone, and more than 900 views from referral sources.</p> \n<h3>Thought Leadership or Expert Interview Posts</h3> \n<p>Odds are, people within your industry want to get tips from experts with high achievements in their field. If you have access to an industry expert or thought leader, publishing <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-thought-leadership\">their original thoughts</a> on your blog could benefit you.</p> \n<p>For example, if your thought leader says something bold, profound, or even slightly tactical, another publication or blog might quote them and link to the post on your site. Additionally, the thought leader and their followers might share the post via email, social media, or on their own website.</p> \n<h4>Planning Out Strategic Thought Leadership</h4> \n<p>While you could technically accept guest posts from whoever wants to write for you, Nica encourages bloggers to consider finding experts that can write about high-interest topics in their industry.</p> \n<p>\"If you‚Äôre not sure where to start, look for high search volume topics in your area of expertise,\" Nica says. \"Then, use this information to pick the topic for your thought leadership piece.\"</p> \n<p>Picking thought leadership angles that have high search volume might help you build content that's SEO friendly. But, according to Nica, this tactic most importantly helps you \"ensure that you're publishing about topics readers are actually interested in.\"</p> \n<p>By <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht\">conducting search volume research</a>, our blog team has identified a number of topics that could be covered by industry experts. For example, the idea for the blog post, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-academy-grew-youtube-subscribers\">\"How HubSpot Academy Grew YouTube Subscribers by 450% in 17 Months\"</a> came from researching keywords related to YouTube marketing.</p> \n<p>Once we defined a few potential YouTube angles, the blog team asked HubSpot acquisition marketing manager <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/author/bella-valentini\">Bella Valentini</a> to write about how her team implemented SEO tactics on HubSpot Academy's channel.</p> \n<p>\"The keyword 'Youtube SEO' has over 3,000 searches per month. This means a lot of people are eager to learn about tactics that work for this channel,\" Nica explains. \"Our thought leadership piece talks about Youtube SEO in a practical context by telling the story of how Valentini's strategy increased our subscribers by 450% in just 17 months,\" Nica says.</p> \n<p>Due to the YouTube SEO post's practical tips and original data, \"this article earned 96 backlinks from 51 referring domains without any targeted outreach to promote it,\" according to Nica.</p> \n<h4>Thought Leadership Alternatives</h4> \n<p>Sometimes, you can't get a busy thought leader or expert to sit down with you for an interview. But, you might be able to create a helpful, highly-linkable post by asking a number of thought leaders a quick question via email and compiling their quotes into a roundup.</p> \n<p>Since we have a huge team at HubSpot, we love creating roundups with our internal experts. They're easy to create and pull in solid non-organic traffic similarly to full thought leadership pieces. Additionally, we've also seen similar results from rounding up quotes from external experts.</p> \n<p>In a recent Marketing Blog post, we highlighted <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remote-work-tips\">tips for working remotely</a> directly sourced from seasoned members of our remote staff. This post has received over 17,000 total views with 204 referrals and more than 1,300 visits from social media platforms.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/3%20Types%20of%20Blog%20Posts%20That%20Earn%20the%20Most%20Backlinks,%20According%20to%20HubSpots%20Link-Building%20Expert-3.png?width=600&amp;name=3%20Types%20of%20Blog%20Posts%20That%20Earn%20the%20Most%20Backlinks,%20According%20to%20HubSpots%20Link-Building%20Expert-3.png\" alt=\"a blog post with expert quotes that earned many backlinks\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>Posts That Serve as Foundational \"Ultimate Guides\"</h3> \n<p>Once we've written heavily about a topic, such as Instagram Marketing, we'll compile all the data, information, tips, and advice our writers have collected into Ultimate Guides.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/3%20Types%20of%20Blog%20Posts%20That%20Earn%20the%20Most%20Backlinks,%20According%20to%20HubSpots%20Link-Building%20Expert-2.png?width=600&amp;name=3%20Types%20of%20Blog%20Posts%20That%20Earn%20the%20Most%20Backlinks,%20According%20to%20HubSpots%20Link-Building%20Expert-2.png\" alt=\"a video-centered pillar post that earned backlinks\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>These long-form posts, which each include internal links to a handful of other blog posts on our website, aren't just beneficial to SEO and direct traffic. They also can pull in solid backlinks, according to Nica.</p> \n<p>\"Usually, the most recommended blog types for getting backlinks have original research and data at their core. But this isn't always the case,\" Nica reveals. \"For some blog sites, the blog types that get the most backlinks are actually ultimate guides.\"</p> \n<p>\"If they are visible and easy to find on your website, these guides can easily serve as a supporting piece for other articles. This makes them a great link-magnet,\" Nica explains.</p> \n<h2>Tips for Creating Highly Linkable Content</h2> \n<p>Along with testing out the content types above on your blog, you should also keep these tips in mind as you create web content:</p> \n<h4>Original content is key.</h4> \n<p>Web writers and journalists are more likely to link to original quotes and data that they can't repeat or create on their own.</p> \n<p>Even though you're a blogger, your goal should be to publish content that no one can get anywhere else. This type of content could include original research, quotes, expert-written posts, images, and videos. Ask yourself, what will make journalists type, \"According to [your brand]\"?</p> \n<h4>Visibility is vital.</h4> \n<p>\"One of the most frequent mistakes marketers make when creating linkable content is that they invest 90% of their resources in production and only 10% on promotion,\" Nica warns. \"Links need to be <em>earned</em> naturally to support the business‚Äô SEO performance long-term, but no links can be earned if the target audience doesn‚Äôt know that content exists in the first place.\"</p> \n<p>\"Whatever you publish, make sure it‚Äôs visible. You can start by promoting content on your company‚Äôs social media channels or through <a href=\"https://blog.appsumo.com/defining-your-buyer-persona/\">targeted outreach</a>. Either way, your audience needs to find out about your content before they can link back to it,\" Nica advises.</p> \n<p>Nica says you'll also want to optimize your posts for search engines. Here's why:</p> \n<p>If a blogger from another company is covering a topic like \"email marketing trends,\" they'll need to find data to support the trends they list. They might begin their research by Googling, ‚Äú<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats\">email marketing statistics</a>.‚Äù If your original email data post is one of the first results, there's a strong chance that this writer will click it, find your data valuable, and share it in their own piece</p> \n<h4>Don't forget about web design.</h4> \n<p>\"Every time I stumble upon an old looking website, I don't think it's up to date. So, I don‚Äôt trust it enough to mention it in my article and link back to it,\" Nica admits.</p> \n<p>Although Nica can't confirm or deny if web design can impact backlinks, many of us can relate to the experience of bouncing off of a poorly designed website. And, when we do this, we're likely not sharing the content we saw or helping the blog's search rankings.</p> \n<p>\"Whether it‚Äôs thought leadership or a research report, make sure you invest in the aesthetic 'packaging' of your content with a solid design. This will pay off.\"</p> \n<p>For example, Nextiva's <a href=\"https://www.nextiva.com/blog/customer-service-statistics.html\">Customer Service Statistics and Trends in 2020</a> is not unique. However, it's design and packaging guides the audience through a nice reading experience.</p> \n<p>\"What sets Nextiva's guide apart from similar online content is its carefully crafted design and the experience they provide the reader. It‚Äôs no surprise they have over 700 backlinks to this page, from over 370 referring domains,\" Nica notes, using data pulled from Ahrefs.</p> \n<p>To learn more about why you should embrace a
