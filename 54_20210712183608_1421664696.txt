Research shows that roughly <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/315709/online-local-business-search-frequency-us-canada/\">a third of people use the web to find local businesses</a>. Honestly, I’m surprised that number isn’t higher.</p>  \n<p>As a small business, you might not have the budget to hire a designer, bring in a development team, or pay for a suite of design tools for your new site. A basic brochure site will probably have to do for now, right?</p> \n<p>But here’s the thing: You don’t need a design portfolio or a branding team to make an effective website. A lot of what makes websites work boils down to clear and intuitive navigation, well-written copy, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-color-schemes\">tasteful use of color</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-typography\">typography</a>, and images — no design degree necessary.</p> \n<p>Still, it’s one thing to talk about good design, and another to actually <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30557/6-guidelines-for-exceptional-website-design-and-usability.aspx\">build a website that delivers on all design fronts</a>. Lucky for us, there are many fascinating websites that have figured out what works. So, for help in your design journey, we’ve compiled our favorite examples of excellent small business websites to inspire your own.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=c791aced-6180-48a5-916d-b2d76cec1836&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Free Download: 77 Examples of Brilliant Web Design&nbsp;\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c791aced-6180-48a5-916d-b2d76cec1836.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Small Business Website Design Examples</h2> \n<p>There are, of course, thousands of small business websites you can draw from, but we think these 15 serve as a good starting point whether you’re planning a redesign or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-wireframe\">wireframing</a> your first iteration. By the way, these are all real businesses, so you can click each link to explore the website yourself. Let’s dive in.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.bennett-tea.com/\">Bennett Tea</a></h3> \n<p>Starting off our list is a gorgeous example of what you can accomplish with color palettes, animated page transitions, scrolling effects, and creative layouts. The Bennett Tea shop offers just a handful of premium tea options, but each is presented elegantly through this online store’s unconventional format.</p> \n<p>Typically, stores display their products as grids with links to product pages. On the Bennett Tea website, however, users scroll down to explore each offering, with a life-sized image of the tea box and descriptions of the taste, aroma, and mouthfeel. It’s the perfect visual palette to complement the company’s variety of tastes.</p> \n<p>Also notable is the site’s navigation experience. Upon landing on the website, visitors are shown a splash page stating the company’s mission. They then have the option to continue to the store or go to the About or Contact pages. It may require one additional click to get to the store page, but this choice puts the branding front and center for potential customers.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example bennett tea\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-2.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://arozjewelry.com/en/\">Aroz</a><a href=\"https://arozjewelry.com/en/\"> Jewelry</a></h3> \n<p>Belgium-based jeweler Aroz has constructed an immaculate website to showcase and sell their items. Offering a variety of accessories, Aroz first greets visitors with a full-width image, below which they present their pieces in a grid slider.</p> \n<p>As users continue scrolling, the website makes frequent use of zoom-in animation, slide-in animation, and fade-in effects for greater visual impact. Each text section establishes the store’s offerings, capped off with a contact form and a social media CTA.</p> \n<p>For those looking to learn more about Aroz, the website also includes a blog featuring new collections as well as customer and designer stories. All of these components work to conjure a professional, sophisticated, and unique brand image — a great example of what an ecommerce site can be.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example aroz jewelry\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-47-48-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-47-48-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://chicagofrenchpress.com/\">Chicago French Press</a></h3> \n<p>If a tea shop can have a fantastic website, why not a coffee roaster? Chicago French Press sells a variety of rotating flavors while donating a portion of its proceeds to nonprofits and charitable organizations.</p> \n<p>Like Bennett Tea, this website emphasizes the aesthetics of the product packaging. It also implements color backgrounds to distinguish between flavors, as seen in the full-width <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/web-slideshows-standard\">image slider</a> on the homepage.</p> \n<p>The Chicago French Press store is easy to navigate, as visitors can search by different criteria including flavor, brewing method, and bag size. And, if you want to incorporate their flavors with food, the website’s blog includes recipe posts too.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example chicago french press\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-47-78-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-47-78-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3><br>4. <a href=\"https://www.wildwoodbakery.com.au/\">Wildwood Bakery</a></h3> \n<p>Wildwood Bakery’s website incorporates illustrations in small but stunning ways. The Australian bakery has made a simple but captivating website with little more than some delicate illustrations, a nice orange-and-green color palette, and mouth-watering close-ups of their creations.</p> \n<p>On the homepage, visitors can learn about the bakery and click away to the website’s online store or sourdough subscription service. The bottom of the page sports a footer with social links and other useful resources. Note that the footer is more prominent than usual — the large text draws the eye to other important aspects of the business like sustainability and wholesale.</p> \n<p>Wildwood’s store page is also worth checking out. Customers can filter products by flavors and quickly add anything to the cart. It’s clear that the designers considered everything, as even the card icon itself is a custom illustration. It’s these details that make this site exceptional.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example wildwood bakery\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-48-06-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-48-06-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.aarkcollective.com/\">AÃRK Collective</a></h3> \n<p>The website for watchmaker AÃRK Collective leaves no question as to what it does — from the start, its timepieces are displayed in full-page, aesthetically pleasing images. The whole thing resembles more of a gallery than an ecommerce site and establishes the brand's commitment to simple and elegant designs.</p> \n<p>But, this is ultimately an online store, and scrolling down reveals AÃRK’s product lines in a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/broken-grid-layouts\">masonry grid style</a>. The presentation is quite minimal, but this lets visitors focus solely on the designs themselves. There’s no other information until you click on an item, which sends you to a product page with all the relevant information, plus many more images to be sure you’re making the right watch purchase.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example aark collective\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-46-99-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-46-99-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.cleenland.com/\">Cleenland</a></h3> \n<p>Not all websites have to be visually elaborate — this is proven with Cleenland’s online store. The Boston-based company sells low-waste home care and personal hygiene products, and the site wastes no time nudging visitors to visit the physical location.</p> \n<p>Visitors can also shop online in Cleenland’s online store, which lists its product categories with images of each product and information about the supplier. This way, you know products are sourced sustainably. There’s even a “popular products” category serving up the best this store has to offer.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example cleenland\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-46-71-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-46-71-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 650px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://ladiesgetpaid.com/\">Ladies Get Paid</a></h3> \n<p>Ladies Get Paid is a membership website that offers financial and professional education courses for women. There are online classes, speaker events, and networking events, as well as job postings and online communities, all to fuel career advancement and financial confidence.</p> \n<p>From a visual perspective, Ladies Get Paid does a fantastic job of presenting its variety of benefits in a straightforward manner. Its mission is clear from the start, and the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/header-design\">page header</a> lets guests view each offering in more detail.</p> \n<p>The website also effectively incorporates hints of color in its <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/interactive-websites\">interactive items</a>. Its cards and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/button-design\">buttons</a> match each other for a cohesive feel and incorporate subtle hover effects for a pleasing user experience. Overall, the website is bold but inviting, a difficult but certainly achievable balance.</p> \n<h3><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example ladies get paid\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-45-94-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-45-94-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></h3> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.goodvibesclean.com/\">Good Vibes All Purpose Cleaner</a></h3> \n<p>Maybe I’m just biased toward sustainable cleaning products, but Good Vibes All Purpose Cleaner presents a simple, effective ecommerce site that manages to convey its philosophy and offerings seamlessly.</p> \n<p>Good Vibes has no frill with its product displays — products are shown in a grid format as you might expect. However, the website also prominently features reviews and testimonials from customers below to instill confidence in new buyers.</p> \n<p>Each product page includes a description as well as cleaning instructions, ingredients, reviews, and recommended products. It’s enough to make a positive impression without relying on visual gimmicks.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example good vibes all purpose cleaner\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-3.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-3.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://www.wisr.com.au/\">Wisr</a></h3> \n<p>I never expected to have this much fun on a financial services website, but here we are — Wisr offers personal loans, financial planning, and, above all, an incredibly amusing homepage. As you scroll, you follow the path of a simulated marble course from start to end. With each obstacle, you learn more about what Wisr does.</p> \n<p>Whether you think this design choice serves as a metaphor for the often unpredictable financial road ahead, or just a cool thing to look at, this website definitely stands out among the rest.</p> \n<p>As another cool secondary feature, the website remembers what page you exit from. So, upon a return visit, you’ll see a prompt inviting you back to the page where you left off. It’s a clever use of cookies that can help get prospects back on the conversion path.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example wisr\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-1.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"https://www.cafeconlibrosbk.com/\">Cafe con Libros</a></h3> \n<p>Intersectional Feminist bookstore Cafe con Libros (Coffee with Books) not only offers espressos with your purchase — it also boasts a fantastic website with everything you need under one domain name.</p> \n<p>This site manages to pack its book inventory, merch store, event calendar, and mission onto the homepage alone without overcomplicating things. Visitors can also order any book from the store — physical, e-book, or audiobook — for pickup or delivery through the site.</p> \n<p>As if that weren’t enough, the website also maintains an active blog with reflections and book reviews, a newsletter, a monthly book subscription service, and a podcast with an on-site player. It’s an excellent balance of quantity of offerings with quality of design.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example cafe con libros\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-48-31-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-48-31-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>11. <a href=\"https://www.reformcollective.com/about/\">Reform Collective</a></h3> \n<p>Design agency Reform collective features one of the most cinematic scrolling experiences I’ve seen on a website. It combines fixed scrolling with horizontal scrolling to showcase each section in chunks while keeping visitors on the same page.</p> \n<p>Each individual section mentions some piece of the company, be it their design style and philosophy, a case study, testimonials, or a contact form. If you’re looking for a long-scrolling website that presents information to visitors in a specific linear sequence, try emulating this trick — it ensures users see what you want them to and in what order.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example reform collective\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-46-54-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-46-54-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>12. <a href=\"https://mysweetdreams.co/\">Sweet Dreams</a></h3> \n<p>Sweet Dreams may create CBD and melatonin products for better rest, but don’t sleep on this website. Combining 2D and 3D illustrations, scrolling animation effects, customer reviews, and even interactive graphics, the homepage for this small business does a great job getting visitors in the mindset of their product before promoting the products themselves.</p> \n<p>Informational sections are interspersed with product links so that new customers, whether sold or skeptical, know what they’re buying and how these products work. To learn more, the About page includes masterful visuals and copy to put visitors at ease. Given what they’re selling, that seems like the right approach.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example sweet dreams\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-47-18-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-47-18-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>13. <a href=\"https://panache.fr/\">Panache</a></h3> \n<p>The graphic design and branding experts and Panache have proven their abilities with their one-page informational website. This is another example of how scrolling can be much more than a way to traverse the page — here, it triggers colorful transitions and animations that leave a strong impression.</p> \n<p>Panache makes this list because, rather than including a separate gallery for showcasing the work, it blends its aesthetic approach into the construction of the site itself. This ultimately gets potential clients down to the contact form more quickly. There are also navigational links along the left side of the page in case visitors wish to return to a particular section.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example panache\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>14. <a href=\"https://scottscheapflights.com/\">Scott's Cheap Flights</a></h3> \n<p>The goal of Scott’s Cheap Flights is to help U.S. travelers easily and cheaply book vacations to domestic and international destinations. Its membership website is suitably simple: Just sign up and start getting daily emails with the latest discounted flight offerings.</p> \n<p>Once signed in, the website places its offers front-and-center — each one occupies a card with a colorful image of the destination. Clicking a card takes you to a page with information about the destination, instructions on how to book, and ticket prices by airport. Some cards are premium, and the “Upgrade” button lingers in the top right tempting users to subscribe.</p> \n<p>Additionally, this website also provides a ton of extra value to free and premium users in its blog section. In it, there are tips for booking flights, travel advice, and guides for exploring new cities.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example scott's cheap flights\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-46-38-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-Jun-26-2021-06-49-46-38-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h3>15. <a href=\"https://musicaudienceexchange.com/\">Music Audience Exchange</a></h3> \n<p>Finally, Music Audience Exchange (MAX) creates partnerships between brands and musical artists for promotional purposes, with a website that conveys class and professionalism.</p> \n<p>Since it caters to both artists and companies, it features two pages for both types of clients, with step-by-step guides explaining how the process works. It’s an efficient means to channel both brands and musicians alike toward an application form and a conversion.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"homepage for the small business website design example music audience exchange\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-4.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=15%20Stunning%20Examples%20of%20Small%20Business%20Website%20Design-4.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Big Design Ideas for Small Businesses</h2> \n<p>Designing a website is, without a doubt, a challenge for small businesses.

in the middle and several cameras positioned all around will simultaneously capture pictures of the star, creating a spectacular image that gives you a 360 view of the person.</p> \n<p>Now, imagine if you could do that with your target audience? Capture them from all angles as they interact with your brand. With a single customer view, you can.</p> \n<p>The issue is, many businesses struggle to know where to start.</p> \n<p>At the end of this article, you’ll understand what a single customer view is and how to create one for your brand.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=12501f7c-8e26-4e3c-9642-7afbe078156a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Customer Journey Map Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/12501f7c-8e26-4e3c-9642-7afbe078156a.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>A single customer view combines data from a consumer’s behavior on web and email, social media activity, demographics, interactions with customer service, and purchase history.</p> \n<p>Let’s go through an example of an interaction between a consumer and a brand.</p> \n<p>A consumer, let’s call her Jazmyn, discovers a brand on Instagram. Jazmyn visits the brand’s website through Instagram and downloads a free offer. Said brand adds Jazmyn to an email list and she starts receiving nurturing emails.</p> \n<p>After months of no interactions, Jazmyn rediscovers the brand and makes a purchase. A month after that, she calls customer service regarding an issue with her product.</p> \n<p>In just a few months, Jazmyn has interacted with at least three departments within the company: marketing, sales, and customer service. In many businesses, every department tracks data using its own system.</p> \n<p>For instance, sales teams often use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/why-your-company-needs-a-crm-system-to-grow?__hstc=45788219.5de9bd98105d63133a8f81787e11a704.1622843200471.1622843200471.1622843200471.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1622843200472&amp;__hsfp=3102107587\">customer relationship management </a>(CRM) software to track their interactions with clients and prospects while marketing teams use marketing platforms and automation tools to generate leads.</p> \n<p>This creates huge data gaps, making it difficult to understand how a user is behaving over an extended period of time beyond a single vertical. It can also lead to duplicate information, leading to dirty data.</p> \n<p>For instance, Jazmyn might receive ads for products she’s already purchased. Or she may get a call from customer service asking about a product she’s already reviewed via email.</p> \n<p>Having a single customer view allows organizations to build personalized interactions with consumers, based on their current stage in the customer lifecycle. This creates a better customer experience, stronger brand loyalty, and better retention rates.</p> \n<p>When you know where your target audience is, you can make enticing offers based on their current needs. It’s personalization at its best.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of a Single Customer View</h2> \n<p>When you invest in a platform with a single customer view, you:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Have cleaner data</strong> – With an integrated system, you remove information silos, which often cause data duplication.</li> \n <li><strong>Gather better insights </strong>– When you have an accurate map of the customer journey, you can better understand how your campaigns are performing and identify areas of improvement.</li> \n <li><strong>Assign proper credit to the right channels </strong>– Proper attribution is a major issue when it comes to audience tracking. With an SCV, you can identify the best and worst-performing channels for future campaigns.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>1. Align your data owners and your KPIs.</h3> \n<p>The first step in creating an SCV is aligning all your data owners across your organization.</p> \n<p>It’s important to align your teams early on key targets and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-kpis\">key progress indicators</a>. This keeps everyone on the same page and striving toward the same goal.</p> \n<p>So, although everyone will be working on different sections, they’ll all be contributing to the same objective. This is key in keeping everyone in the same mindset and easing the transition to a data-driven approach.</p> \n<p>Your data owners will serve as liaisons between IT and your team, enforcing governance standards and supplying IT with the access they need.</p> \n<p>During this process, your IT team will be instrumental, as they will need to consolidate data from multiple systems and sources.</p> \n<h3>2. Find the right tech.</h3> \n<p>The next step is finding a platform with the capabilities to support your company’s needs.</p> \n<p>Key features to consider when searching for a platform include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Usability and accessibility of software</li> \n <li>CRM Integration</li> \n <li>Data quality tools</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-automation\">Automation</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>You’ll also want to consider the size of your company and the scalability of the software. all-in-one CRM platform like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/get-started\">HubSpot</a>, which combines sales, marketing, customer service data to support a holistic customer experience.</p> \n<h3>3. Hire data managers.</h3> \n<p>Depending on your company size, you may want to onboard roles dedicated to data, such as data miners, data analysts, and data migration specialists.</p> \n<p>The process of migrating data is a costly and time-consuming one that you may not be equipped for. Instead, hire experts with the knowledge and experience to do it right.</p> \n<p>They will be essential not only during the initial building phase but also as you grow your customer base.</p> \n<h3>4. Sort and integrate all data from your legacy systems.</h3> \n<p>If you’re an established brand with a ton of scattered data, you’ll need to sort through your systems.</p> \n<p>Start by conducting an audit of your data quality. From there, clean your data so you can start integrating it with your other systems, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your data warehouse</li> \n <li>Your point-of-sale systems</li> \n <li>Your marketing automation systems</li> \n <li>Your call center systems</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Set your data governance strategy.</h3> \n<p>As you’re in the process of cleaning out old data, you’ll need a new system for new, incoming data.</p> \n<p>This is where your data governance standards come into play. They serve as operating guidelines for retrieving, storing, and processing data.</p> \n<p>You may wonder, what’s the difference between a data management strategy and a data governance strategy? The former refers to the actions you take to fulfill the guidelines outlined in your governance strategy.</p> \n<p>To learn about how to develop a governance strategy, click <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/data-governance-framework\">here</a>.</p> \n<h3>6. Test your processes.</h3> \n<p>The last step in this process is testing your new centralized system.</p> \n<p>To ensure that your new environment works (i.e., that the data linkage is complete), some test data will need to be used to ensure the data is gathered, stored, and reported correctly on your platform.</p> \n<p>This will likely be an ongoing process as your business scales and you implement new touchpoints.</p> \n<p>The earlier your team can implement a single customer view framework, the better equipped you will be to serve your target audience. While the process can be expensive and time-consuming, it’s a worthwhile investment that will be instrumental in making strategic business decisions.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=dfcc1cf6-fca7-455f-9c43-26ff2fba10ed&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Apply for a job, keep track of important information, and prepare for an  interview with the help of this free job seekers kit.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dfcc1cf6-fca7-455f-9c43-26ff2fba10ed.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsingle-customer-view&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/12501f7c-8e26-4e3c-9642-7afbe078156a.png","linkMd5":"6857ff4c03bf710b78b5bf7ea5254b88","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn95@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-38-574_29667f68bce7df45.webp","destWidth":494,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":3880,"destBytes":7698,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/12501f7c-8e26-4e3c-9642-7afbe078156a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn95@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-38-574_29667f68bce7df45.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dfcc1cf6-fca7-455f-9c43-26ff2fba10ed.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn3@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-52-290_a6a20c230b966a35.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsingle-customer-view&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-49-437_96c741cba561ff8a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938161},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"The Ultimate Guide to PPC Marketing","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc","description":"<p>Marketers, can we be honest with each other for a second?

Below, we review the main elements of a PPC campaign, ranging from broad to the more specific.</p> \n<h4>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</h4> \n<p>The objective of all forms of digital advertising is to rank for a target keyword, which you can do in several ways. Search Engine Marketing (SEM) refers to any digital marketing (paid or unpaid) done on a search engine, like Google, Yahoo, or Bing.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/seo-sem-faqs\">SEM</a> is an umbrella term that encompasses both paid advertising <em>and</em> search engine optimization, that is, ranking organically for keywords. It’s important to note that not all PPC occurs on search engines — social media has PPC ads, too (think: Facebook Ads).</p> \n<h4>CPC</h4> \n<p>Cost-per-click (CPC) is the amount that an advertiser pays for each click on your ad. CPC acts as your bid in an auction that determines where your ad will be placed. As you can imagine, a higher bid equates to better ad placement.</p> \n<p>You set your CPC at the maximum price you are willing to pay per click on your ad. What you <em>actually</em> pay is determined by the following formula:</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(Competitor’s Ad Rank / Your Quality Score) + 0.01 = Actual CPC.</p> \n<p>Let’s go over the terms in this equation, so you know what you’re paying for:</p> \n<h4>Ad Rank</h4> \n<p>This value determines the position of an ad on a search engine results page. It’s equal to <strong>Maximum Bid x Quality Score</strong>.</p> \n<h4>Quality Score</h4> \n<p>This is the score that search engines give to your ad based on your clickthrough rate (CTR) — measured against the average CTR of ads in that position — the relevance of your keywords, the quality of your landing page, and your past performance on the SERP.</p> \n<h4>Maximum Bid</h4> \n<p>This is the maximum you're willing to pay per click on your ad.</p> \n<p>Here’s an image by <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/cost-per-click\">WordStream</a> that illustrates what I mean:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/maximum%20ad%20bid%20example%20.jpg?width=500&amp;name=maximum%20ad%20bid%20example%20.jpg\" alt=\"maximum ad bid example \" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/cost-per-click\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Source</a></em></span></p> \n<p>You can set your CPC to <strong>manual</strong>, where you determine the maximum bid for your ads, or <strong>enhanced</strong>, which allows the search engines to adjust your bid based on your goals. One of these enhanced options involves bid strategies that automatically adjust your bids based on either clicks or conversions.</p> \n<h4>CPM (Cost per Mille)</h4> \n<p>CPM, also known as cost per thousand, is the cost per one thousand impressions. It’s most commonly used for paid social and display ads. There are other types of cost-per<em>s</em>… like cost-per-engagement, cost-per-acquisition (CPA), but for the sake of preserving your mental space, we’re going to stick with clicks, a.k.a. CPC.</p> \n<h4>Campaign</h4> \n<p>The first step in setting up your PPC ads is determining your ad campaign. You can think of your campaign as the key message or theme you want to get across with your advertisements.</p> \n<h4>Ad Group</h4> \n<p>One size doesn’t fit all. That’s why you’ll create a series of ads within your campaign based on a set of highly related keywords. You can set a CPC for each ad group that you create.</p> \n<h4>Keywords</h4> \n<p>Each ad within your ad group will target a set of relevant keywords or key terms. These keywords tell search engines which terms or search queries you want your ad to be displayed alongside in SERPs. Once you determine which keywords perform best, you can set a micro CPC specifically for keywords within your ads.</p> \n<h4>Ad Text</h4> \n<p>Your keywords should inform your ad text. Remember, your Quality Score is determined by how relevant your ad is; therefore, the text in your ad (and landing page, for that matter) should match the keyword terms you’re targeting.</p> \n<h4>Landing Page</h4> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-landing-page-builder\">landing page</a> is a critical piece of your paid advertising strategy. The landing page is where users will end up once they click your PPC ad. Whether it’s a dedicated webpage, your homepage, or somewhere else, make sure to follow landing page best practices to maximize conversions.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Best PPC Platforms</h3> \n<p>Now that you understand the PPC basics, I’m guessing your next question is: <em>Where should I advertise?</em></p> \n<p>There are dozens of online spaces where you can spend your coveted ad money, and the best way to vet them is by taking a close look at your potential ROI on each platform.</p> \n<p>The most popular advertising platforms are effective because they’re easy to use and, most importantly, highly trafficked. But for a smaller budget, you might consider a lesser-known alternative to these key players.</p> \n<p>When choosing a platform, some other things to consider are the availability of keyword terms, where your target audience spends their time, and your advertising budget.</p> \n<p>Here a non-exhaustive list of some of the top PPC platforms.</p> \n<h4>Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords)</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cleaning%20supplies%20google%20ads%20ppc%20example.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=cleaning%20supplies%20google%20ads%20ppc%20example.jpg\" alt=\"cleaning supplies google ads ppc example\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>How many times a day do you hear the phrase “Let me Google that?” Probably more than you can count … hence why Google Ads is the king of paid advertising.</p> \n<p>On average, Google processes over <a href=\"https://www.internetlivestats.com/one-second/#google-band\">90,000 search queries every second</a>, giving you plenty of opportunities to target keywords that will get your intended audience to click. The downside is that keywords are highly competitive on this platform, meaning a larger ad spend.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/template-managing-and-organizing-google-adwords-campaigns?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>If you’re planning to use this popular platform, start with our free Google Ads PPC Kit.</em></a></p> \n<h4>Bing Ads</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/great%20coffee%20at%20home%20bing%20ppc%20ad%20example.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=great%20coffee%20at%20home%20bing%20ppc%20ad%20example.jpg\" alt=\"great coffee at home bing ppc ad example\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>The perks of using Bing Ads over Google Ads is a slightly lower CPC at the expense of a larger audience, of course.</p> \n<h4>Facebook Ads</h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/example%20of%20ppc%20ads%20on%20facebook.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=example%20of%20ppc%20ads%20on%20facebook.jpg\" alt=\"example of ppc ads on facebook\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; margin: 0px auto;\">Facebook Ads blend in with other posts on the platform.</span></em></p> \n<p>Facebook Ads is a popular and effective platform for paid ads (more commonly used as CPM than CPC), mainly due to its specific targeting options. Facebook allows you to target users based on interests, demographics, location, and behaviors.</p> \n<p>Also, Facebook allows for native ads, which means ads are introduced and blend into the social feed. Not to mention, you can use Facebook Ads to advertise on Instagram as well.</p> \n<h4>AdRoll</h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/example%20of%20ad%20roll.jpg?width=1500&amp;name=example%20of%20ad%20roll.jpg\" alt=\"example of ad roll\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; margin: 0px auto;\">Chipotle retargeting me as I search for dessert recipes.</span></em></p> \n<p>AdRoll is a retargeting platform that advertises to people who have already visited your website. For instance, say someone read your article on cheese making. You can retarget them on other sites they visit with display ads that advertise your online cooking classes.</p> \n<p>While retargeting is possible with Google Ads, the benefit of using AdRoll is that it can display ads on Google <em>and</em> social media sites, which gives you more opportunities to capture clicks or impressions, depending on your goal.</p> \n<h4>RevContent</h4> \n<p>RevContent focuses specifically on promoting content through PPC. It has the same impact as a guest post, where your content is displayed on an external site, except it’s in the form of an ad. You still bid on keywords, and your advertisement is displayed next to content relevant to those keywords. With this platform, you’ll reap the benefits of a low CPC and highly engaged traffic.</p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<p>With that explanation out of the way, now let's look at some benefits of PPC ads.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1.&nbsp;PPC ads are cost-effective.</h3> \n<p>With PPC ad campaigns, you have complete control over how much you’re willing to spend.</p> \n<p>Since you only pay when visitors click the link leading to your website or landing page — with a high chance of conversion — you’ll be getting your money’s worth.</p> \n<h3>2. PPC ads produce fast results.</h3> \n<p>Although organic ranking is great, it sometimes takes months or even years to get on the first page on SERPs.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you’re a startup or small business, you likely don’t have the time to wait for the effect of organic, social, or direct traffic to kick in.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That’s where PPC ads come in.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With optimized PPC ads, you can shoot yourself to the top of the SERP within hours of launching your campaign.</p> \n<h3>3. You can easily control and test PPC ads.</h3> \n<p>It’s easy to control the keywords you’re targeting, ad placement, or budget with PPC ads. You can also run A/B split tests with different ads to identify the one that produces the highest return on investment. You can then scale the ads that do well until it no longer produces desirable results.</p> \n<h3>4. PPC ads allow you to target your ideal customers.</h3> \n<p>With PPC ads, you can skip right past cold audiences to target a warm audience that’s ready to buy your products and services.</p> \n<p>You can bid on keywords that solution-aware personas would search for online. Aside from keywords, PPC ads also offer targeting options like past online activity or demographics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Another excellent use of PPC ads is to create retargeting campaigns targeting visitors who didn’t purchase after landing on your site.</p> \n<h3>5. Algorithm changes have little effect on PPC ads.</h3> \n<p>Between the numerous <span>Google algorithm changes</span> and the <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors\"><span>200 ranking factors</span></a>, trying to get free traffic from search engines is a bit unstable compared to PPC advertising.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With PPC ads, you don’t have to worry about algorithm changes but instead focus on how well your campaigns perform.</p> \n<h3>6. PPC ads help you rank even with low domain ratings.</h3> \n<p>Keywords have become increasingly competitive. This makes it more difficult for a business with a low <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/domain-authority?_ga=2.263825157.882265536.1623113042-1188014066.1623113042\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>domain authority</span></a> to get into the top rankings on a search engine or in front of its target audience on a social platform.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With PPC advertising, you can quickly rank for keywords your audience is searching, irrespective of your domain ratings.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>7. Data from PPC ads can improve your SEO strategy.</h3> \n<p>You shouldn’t ditch all your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo?_ga=2.263825157.882265536.1623113042-1188014066.1623113042\"><span>search engine optimization (SEO</span></a>) efforts altogether — your paid advertising should <em>complement</em> your SEO strategy instead of replacing it.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“When people search for your keywords, you know their search intent and can display the most relevant ad to your audience. This means more clicks and a greater chance of conversion.” - Laura Mittelmann, Paid Acquisition at HubSpot</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How to Build a PPC Campaign</h2> \n<p>Now that you understand the benefits of PPC and have your key terms, let’s dive into crafting a quality PPC campaign using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33283/A-Simple-Guide-for-Setting-Up-Your-First-Google-AdWords-Campaign.aspx\"><span>Google AdWords</span></a> or some other platform.</p> \n<p>You don’t need to tackle these items step-by-step, but you will need to work through each of them to ensure that you create an effective marketing campaign.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/image-png-Jun-08-2021-01-02-26-45-PM.png\" alt=\"How to build a PPC campaign\"></p> \n<h3>Set Parameters</h3> \n<p>I know I said that you don’t need to do these things in order, but you should do this step first. Without parameters, you risk your ad being untargeted and ineffective.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You want to put your ad campaigns into the context of your ultimate business goals. Consider how your paid campaigns will contribute to those goals. Then, think about what you want to accomplish with your ads — whether that be visits, sales, brand awareness, or something else — and how much you’re willing to spend to achieve that goal.</p> \n<p>Your ads should encompass a few things:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Who you want to target</li> \n <li>Theme of your campaign</li> \n <li>How you will measure success</li> \n <li>Type of campaign you will run</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Create Goals and Goal Metrics</h3> \n<p>Your campaign goals will give you something to show for your ad spend as long as you determine <em>how</em> you will measure those goals. Your goal metrics should not be confused with your campaign metrics, which we’ll discuss below.</p> \n<p>Let’s touch on some common PPC goals and how to measure them.</p> \n<p><strong>Brand awareness</strong> is how familiar your target audience is with your company. It might be a good idea to look into display ads for this goal so you can supplement your copy with engaging imagery. You can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness\">measure brand awareness</a> through social engagement, surveys, and direct traffic.</p> \n<p><strong>Lead generation</strong> is the direct result of having a relevant and engaging landing page to follow your paid ad. Since you will create a separate landing page for each ad group, you should be able to easily track lead conversions either in the Google Ads interface via a tracking pixel, or through <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">UTM parameters</a>, if you’re using a tool like HubSpot.</p> \n<p><strong>Offer promotion</strong> is great if you’re running a limited-time offer, product or service discount, or contest. You should create a dedicated sign-up page or a unique discount code so you know which users came from your ad.</p> \n<p><strong>Sales</strong> can be measured by how much of your product or service is sold based on your paid ads. You should be able to track this through <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">CMS software</a> or with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/attribution-reports-definition\">attribution reporting</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Site traffic</strong> is a great goal if you have high-quality content throughout your website. If you’re going to spend money getting people to visit your site, you want to have some level of confidence that you can keep them there and eventually convert them into leads.</p> \n<h3>Choose Your Campaign Type</h3> \n<p>You don’t only need to know where you’ll advertise but also <em>how</em>. There are many different types of paid advertising campaigns, and the one you choose depends on where you can reach your audience. That isn’t to say that you can’t advertise through various means; you can also try a combination of campaign types as long as you’re consistently testing and revising.</p> \n<p><strong>Search Ads</strong> are the most common type of PPC and refer to the text ads that show up on search engine results pages.</p> \n<p><strong>Display Ads</strong> allow you to place ads (usually image-based) on external websites, including social. There are several ways to buy <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-online-advertising-effectively\">display ads</a>, including Google Display Network (GDN) and other ad networks.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-online-advertising-effectively?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>Learn how to integrate Display Ads into your inbound marketing plan.</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Social</strong> refers to any ads that you see on social media, including Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram. You can pay to show up in your target audience’s social feed or somewhere else within their profile, depending on the platform.</p> \n<p><strong>Remarketing</strong> can use either cookies or a list of contacts that you upload to target people who have previously engaged with your company through some action. That action could be filling out a form, reading a blog, or simply visiting a page on your website.</p> \n<p><strong>Google Shopping</strong> is most <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc-opportunities-ecommerce-marketers\">effective for ecommerce sites</a>. Your ad — including image, price, and a short product description — will show on a carousel on a search page based on your target keywords.</p> \n<h3>Perform Keyword Research</h3> \n<p>Each ad group you create needs to be assigned a set of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht\">keywords to target</a> — that’s how search engines know when and where to display your ad. The general rule of thumb is to select between one to five keywords per ad group, and those keywords should be extremely relevant — your Quality Score depends on it.</p> \n<p>Select keywords that are closely aligned with the specific theme of your ad group. If you find keywords you want to target that fall outside of one theme, you should create a separate ad group for them.</p> \n<p>It’s important to note that you’re not stuck with the keywords you start with. In fact, you should closely monitor your keyword list throughout your campaign — eliminating those that don’t bring in the types of visitors that you’re looking for and increasing your bids on those that do. Do your best to select the most relevant keywords, but don’t feel pressured to get it 100% right the first time around.</p> \n<h3>Set Up Google Analytics and Tracking</h3> \n<p>Google Analytics is free to use, so there’s no reason why you shouldn’t <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en\">install it on your website</a>. The tool provides insights into how your website is performing, how users interact with your pages, and what content is attractive to visitors. The information gathered from Google Analytics can be used for PPC and beyond.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Best Practices for a Quality PPC Strategy</h2> \n<p>You didn’t think we’d let you spend your hard-earned money on advertisements without providing some best practices to follow, did you? Of course not. We want to make sure you succeed with your next PPC campaign. So, let’s get into some PPC strategies that will help you maximize your efforts <em>and</em> your budget.</p> \n<p>As a note, we’re going to dive specifically into paid search ads (those little guys you see in search engines) here.</p> \n<h3>PPC Ad Copy</h3> \n<p>Bidding on targeted keywords will get your ad in front of the right people; <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-create-click-ppc-ads-ht\">good ad copy</a> will get those people to click on your ad. Like your keywords, your ad needs to solve for the intent of the searcher — you need to give the searcher exactly what they’re looking for <em>and</em> make sure that is clear through the words you use.</p> \n<p>Search ads are comprised of a headline, a URL, and a short description, and each of these has limited <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6021630?hl=en\">character requirements</a> to follow. To make the most of this space, make sure your ad copy does the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Speak directly to your target persona.</li> \n <li>Include the main keyword that you’re bidding on.</li> \n <li>Provide an actionable CTA so the searcher knows what to do next.</li> \n <li>Make the offer appealing.</li> \n <li>Use language that matches your landing page copy.</li> \n <li>Perform A/B Split tests with your copy.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Landing Page Best Practices</h3> \n<p>Arguably the most important element of PPC (after your ad copy) is the page that you send leads to <em>after</em> they click on your ad. This page needs to be highly targeted, relevant to your ad, deliver what was promised, and present a seamless experience.</p> \n<p><em>Why?</em> Because the point of your landing page is to <a href=\"https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/landing-page-examples\">convert your new visitor</a> into a lead or customer. Not only that, but a high-converting landing page will improve your Quality Score, leading to better ad placements. There’s nothing that will diminish PPC profits like a poorly crafted landing page.</p> \n<p>What should a PPC landing page include to increase conversions? Glad you asked.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Strong headline that mirrors your search ad</li> \n <li>Clean design and layout</li> \n <li>Responsive form that is easy to use with a stand-out CTA button</li> \n <li>Copy that is very specific and relevant to your target keywords</li> \n <li>Presents the offer that was promised in your ad</li> \n <li>A/B tested</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>A/B Testing Your PPC Ads</h3> \n<p>As a marketer, you’ll rarely throw something out to your audience that works without testing it. PPC campaigns are no different. A/B testing is as critical to your paid ad campaign as is every other element. The goal of testing your ad is to increase both your clickthrough rate and your conversion rate.</p> \n<p>The good news is that ads comprise just four parts that you’ll need to test: headline, description, landing page, and target keywords. Minor tweaks to just one of these elements can significantly alter your results, so you want to make changes one at a time so you can keep track of where improvements come from.</p> \n<p>Since there are many variations that you could test one at a time, it’s a good idea to list out all the potential tests you can run and prioritize them by most significant impact. Finally, you should allow your ads to run long enough to gather the data you need and test them early enough, so you don’t waste budget on a poor-performing ad.</p> \n<h3>Maximizing Your ROI</h3> \n<p>At a high level, maximizing ROI on your ad campaigns means considering customer lifetime value and customer acquisition costs, which will help you determine how much is worth spending on a new lead and how much of that spend can come from paid advertising.</p> \n<p>To get more granular, we need to talk inputs and outputs, that is 1) lowering your input (cost per lead [CPL]) and 2) increasing your return (revenue).</p> \n<p>There are a few factors to keep an eye on that will affect both, so let’s break it down.</p> \n<h4>Ways to Decrease Inputs</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Determine an <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/29/ppc-budget-guide\">ad budget</a> before you get started.</li> \n <li>Create more relevant ads. The more relevant, the lower your CPC.</li> \n <li>Improve your Quality Score. The <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-save-ppc-quality-score-ht\">higher your QS</a>, the less search engines will charge you for clicks.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Ways to Increase Revenue</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Follow landing page best practices to increase conversion rates.</li> \n <li>Go after quality leads by being specific with your ad. The more quality your leads, the more likely they will convert and eventually become customers.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Additional PPC Tips and Tricks</h3> \n<p>There are a few other things you can do to maximize the ROI of your paid ads, whether it’s time spent, budget, clicks, or conversions.</p> \n<h4>Audiences</h4> \n<p>Google allows you to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2611404?hl=en\">tailor your audience</a> so you save marketing dollars <em>and</em> get in front of the right people. You can upload a customer list so that you don’t waste money on people who have already bought from you.</p> \n<p>Google also has options for prospecting audiences. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/products/in-market-audiences/\">In-Market Audiences</a> employs user behavior tracking to put you in front of prospects who are in the market for a product or service like yours.</p> \n<p>You can also increase your bid for more relevant subgroups within your target audience — a practice called layering audiences. For example, HubSpot may layer on people who are in the market for CRM software and add a 30% bid adjustment because those people may be more likely to convert.</p> \n<h4>Bid Adjustments</h4> \n<p>Bid adjustments allow you to increase or decrease your bids based on performance. You can even make these adjustments based on different categories, like device, demographics, language, and more.</p> \n<p>For example, if a keyword isn’t performing as well on mobile as on desktop, you can add a negative bid adjustment so that when someone searches your keyword on mobile, you’ll bid X% lower than your normal bid.</p> \n<h4>Custom Ad Scheduling</h4> \n<p>You can set up <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6372656?hl=en&amp;co=ADWORDS.IsAWNCustomer%3Dfalse\">ad scheduling in Google Ads</a> to display your ad only during specific days and times. This can cut down on ad spend and improve relevance for your target audience.</p> \n<h4>Sitelink Extensions</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2375416?hl=en\">Sitelink extensions</a> allow you to supplement your ad with additional information. For instance, if you’re running an ad for a seasonal promotion at a local store, you can add a sitelink extension to display your store hours and location. These extensions take up more real estate on SERPs and, therefore, stand out. Not only that, but they play a role in improving your Ad Rank.</p> \n<h4>Conversion Tracking</h4> \n<p>Conversion tracking monitors how your landing page is performing via a tracking code that you place on the page where people land after completing your form (usually a “Thank You” page). By <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/02/13/tracking-conversions-in-adwords\">enabling this feature</a>, you’ll be better equipped to make adjustments that can improve your conversions.</p> \n<h4>Keyword Monitoring</h4> \n<p>Don’t let too much time pass before you check how your keywords are performing. You can place higher bids on the keywords that are creating the best results for your campaign, and “defund” or eliminate others.</p> \n<h4>Match Types</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6337842?hl=en\">Match Types in Google Ads</a> allows you to choose how closely related you want your ad group to be associated with a search team. There are four match types: broad, modified broad, phrase, and exact match. Google will display your ad in results according to your selection.</p> \n<p>For example, if your keyword phrase is “how to catch geese” and you select “broad match,” then Google will display your ad for queries that include any word in your key phrase in any order, including “geese catch” and “geese catch how.”</p> \n<h4>Negative Keywords</h4> \n<p>A negative keyword list tells search engines what you <em>don’t </em>want to rank for, which is equally as important as what you do. You might know some of these upfront, but likely you’ll determine these keywords by what isn’t performing so well within your campaign.</p> \n<h3>Social Media Ads</h3> \n<p>Although CPM is more common on social platforms, social media sites do offer PPC that works similarly to search engine ads in that you set a budget and bid on ad placements.</p> \n<p>The difference is social media ads can show up directly in your news feed on most platforms, decreasing the effectiveness of ad blockers. Social platforms, like Facebook, let you set targeted demographics and target people based on interests. While paid search is more keyword-focused, paid social broadens into a demographic focus, leading to more ways to target your persona.</p> \n<p>Social media has two paid ad functions that are critical to ad success — retargeting and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/a/lookalike-audiences\">Lookalike Audiences</a>. Retargeting is remarketing to people based on site visits or manually uploaded contact lists. Lookalike Audiences reviews the people on your marketing list and creates an audience that parallels your list, expanding your potential target. Paid social also allows for a wider variety of ad types, like images, videos, text, and more.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>PPC Management and Tracking</h2> \n<p>Paid advertising is not “set it and forget it.” You need to manage and constantly monitor your ads to ensure that you’re reaching optimal results. Management, analysis, and tracking are crucial to a PPC campaign because they provide you with valuable insights and help you create a more effective campaign.</p> \n<h3>What is PPC management?</h3> \n<p>PPC management covers a wide range of techniques, including creating and adjusting goals, split testing, introducing new keywords, optimizing conversion paths, and shifting plans to reach goals.</p> \n<p>Managing your PPC means looking at your strategy and ad spend.

Here are some key metrics to track within your PPC campaign.</p> \n<p><strong>Clicks</strong> refer to the total number of clicks you receive on an ad. This metric is affected by your keyword selection and the relevance of your ad copy.</p> \n<p><strong>Cost per click (CPC)</strong> measures the price you pay for each click on your ad.</p> \n<p><strong>Clickthrough rate (CTR)</strong> is the percentage of ad views that result in clicks. This metric determines how much you pay (CPC). <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2010/04/26/good-click-through-rate\">CTR benchmarks</a> vary by industry.</p> \n<p><strong>Impressions</strong> are the number of times an ad is viewed. Cost per mille (CPM) is determined for every thousand impressions. Impressions are most relevant for brand awareness campaigns.</p> \n<p><strong>Ad spend</strong> is the amount you are spending on your ads. You can optimize this by improving your Quality Score.</p> \n<p><strong>Return on ad spend (ROAS)</strong> is the ROI of your ad campaign. This metric calculates the revenue received for every dollar spent on ads.</p> \n<p><strong>Conversion rate </strong>refers to the percentage of people that complete the call-to-action on your landing page and become a lead or customer.</p> \n<p><strong>Cost per conversion</strong> refers to the cost to generate a lead. This is calculated as the total cost of an ad divided by the number of conversions.</p> \n<p><strong>Quality Score (QS)</strong> determines ad positioning, so it’s an important metric to keep an eye on.</p> \n<p>By paying close attention to each of these metrics, you can increase the ROI of your paid campaign and spend less for better results.</p> \n<h2>Go Paid!</h2> \n<p>Whether you just started your business yesterday or have been around for decades, PPC just might be the boost you need to get an edge on your competition — or at least ahead of them in the SERPs.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Applying the lessons found in this guide about building a PPC campaign and the best practices for a quality PPC strategy would set you well on your way to improving your website’s traffic and conversions.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August, 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=c5cea574-dc9b-436a-8cc5-0d208bf2cbd9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c5cea574-dc9b-436a-8cc5-0d208bf2cbd9.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fppc&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3242765b-a13a-461a-954d-510ce203b180.png","linkMd5":"a06363ccca0ae63185cadba8d36a0f75","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn25@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-589_37786f1e2b3f2dfc.webp","destWidth":630,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":5566,"destBytes":9538,"author":"cperricone@hubspot.com (Christina Perricone)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3242765b-a13a-461a-954d-510ce203b180.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn25@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-589_37786f1e2b3f2dfc.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/example%20of%20paid%20vs%20organic%20ads.jpg?width=1500&name=example%20of%20paid%20vs%20organic%20ads.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn87@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-50-517_39ca042254195473.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/maximum%20ad%20bid%20example%20.jpg?width=500&name=maximum%20ad%20bid%20example%20.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn55@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-50-395_9790c385d1e31885.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cleaning%20supplies%20google%20ads%20ppc%20example.jpg?width=1500&name=cleaning%20supplies%20google%20ads%20ppc%20example.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-51-290_fcb2f736d2d21cc0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/great%20coffee%20at%20home%20bing%20ppc%20ad%20example.jpg?width=1500&name=great%20coffee%20at%20home%20bing%20ppc%20ad%20example.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn21@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-53-579_47c81c269f7b69f4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/example%20of%20ppc%20ads%20on%20facebook.jpg?width=1500&name=example%20of%20ppc%20ads%20on%20facebook.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-52-435_0015d77ec5ebbed6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/example%20of%20ad%20roll.jpg?width=1500&name=example%20of%20ad%20roll.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn1@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-48-947_7d21afe15b08f06f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/image-png-Jun-08-2021-01-02-26-45-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn61@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-49-297_3df02a2013179405.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c5cea574-dc9b-436a-8cc5-0d208bf2cbd9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn34@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-50-873_c90fcbcd44a0eec6.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fppc&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn53@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-50-751_d6cfcaf02d00c911.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938142},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"5 Steps to Build an Enterprise Data Strategy, Straight From an Expert","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/enterprise-data-strategy","description":"<p>Data can be a scary word.</p> \n<p>It shouldn't be, but it is.

In fact, small businesses can benefit from investing in a data strategy early on and set the foundation that will help them scale.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of an Enterprise Data Strategy</h2> \n<p>The common pitfall many organizations face is that while they are collecting a lot of data, every team is interpreting it in their own way. There's no standard reporting method and each team might be reporting a different value for the same metric.</p> \n<p>This means that everyone ends up with different data with no clear understanding of what's accurate. When there's no single source of truth, it becomes incredibly difficult to trust your data and pull valuable insights.</p> \n<p>\"Data doesn't just exist in a silo,\" said Kossowski. \"The marketing team is not just going to use marketing-specific data that no other team has any influence over. They're going to want to pull information from different areas as well.\"</p> \n<p>She continues, \"And so, an element of governance and standardization and a common language is really important in making sure that those teams can communicate with one another.\"</p> \n<p>So, by implementing an EDS, you prevent information silos, allow for trust in the data, and enable decision making.</p> \n<h2>What To Consider When Building an Enterprise Data Strategy</h2> \n<h3>1. Your Current Data Maturity Level</h3> \n<p>The first thing Kossowski recommends doing before building out your strategy is a self-assessment.</p> \n<p>Ask yourself: Where does your company fall in the data maturity stage?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/index.htm\">Dell </a>has a widely used \"Data Maturity Model\" that helps companies determine how data-driven their company actually is. There are four stages:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Data aware </strong>– Your company has not standardized its reporting system and there's no integration between your systems, data sources, and databases. Plus, there's a lack of trust in the data itself.</li> \n <li><strong>Data proficient </strong>– There's still a lack of trust in the data, specifically its quality. You may have invested in a data warehouse but there are still some pieces missing.</li> \n <li><strong>Data savvy </strong>– Your company is empowered to make business decisions from your data. However, there are still some kinks to work out between business leaders and IT, as IT works to provide reliable data on demand.</li> \n <li><strong>Data driven </strong>– IT and business are working closely together and are on the same page. Now, the focus is on scaling the data strategy because the foundation work (particularly integrating data sources) has already been successfully implemented.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>What's most important here is being realistic about where your company falls.</p> \n<p>\"I think the biggest pitfall that I see is not being really honest with yourself about where your company is in the data maturity stage,\" said Kossowski.</p> \n<p>She adds that it's not enough to look at the feelings you have about how data driven you <em>think </em>your company is. Look at the facts.</p> \n<p>Start by identifying the data problems your company currently faces, as that is a great indicator of where you stand.</p> \n<h3>2. Your Industry and Company Size</h3> \n<p>The industry you're in and the size of your company will determine whether you take a centralized or distributed approach to your data strategy.</p> \n<p>But before we break down those approaches, let's talk about two data strategy frameworks: offense and defense.</p> \n<p>During my conversation with Kossowski, she brought up how this framework (explained in detail <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/05/whats-your-data-strategy\">here</a>) has helped HubSpot develop its own strategy.</p> \n<p>Data defense prioritizes things like data security, access, governance, and accuracy while data offense focuses on gaining insights that will enable decision making.</p> \n<p>Every company needs a balance of offense and defense. However, some lean more on one end of the spectrum based on their industry.</p> \n<p>A healthcare organization or financial institution, for instance, likely deals with highly sensitive data, where data privacy and security is paramount.</p> \n<p>Getting real-time data and quick insights is likely not a top priority whereas providing guardrails for who can access data probably is. As such, they will lean more toward a defense framework.</p> \n<p>On the flip side, you have tech companies, an industry that tends to move quickly and relies more heavily on a quick turnaround of data insights.</p> \n<p>So, they lean more on offense. With that said, there are certainly departments within tech companies (and other fast-moving industries) that will focus more on defense, such as finance.</p> \n<p>Now back to centralized and distributed strategies.</p> \n<p>The framework you use will inform which strategy serves your company best.</p> \n<p>In a centralized structure, you have a centralized reporting or business intelligence (BI) team that manages and prepares the data as well as the reports.</p> \n<p>\"That [structure] can work a lot better at a smaller organization, and especially in an organization that's prioritizing defense because you're going to move slower,\" said Kossowski. \"You're going to be the bottleneck but you also have tight control over every piece of it.\"</p> \n<p>A distributed model, on the other hand, works better for larger teams who take the offensive approach. This way, each team can move quickly and is empowered to do work in a way that works for them.</p> \n<p>In this model, BI simply is responsible for the platforms and setting the guardrails while the teams do the development work, Kossowski explains.</p> \n<p>\"If you think about an organization, as the company gets larger, with a more centralized team, it becomes more and more difficult to scale,\" she said. \"You end up having to just hire more and more people to be able to achieve that.\"</p> \n<p>\"So I think at a certain size of the company, you're going to end up moving more and more toward [a] decentralized [strategy] anyways.\"</p> \n<p>So, once you understand which framework works best for your industry and size, you can implement the appropriate strategy.</p> \n<h3>3. Your Data Management Team</h3> \n<p>Data science is the hot topic right now in data management, according to Kossowski. And she's not wrong.</p> \n<p>In 2012, Harvard Business Review named it <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century\">the sexiest job of the 21st century</a>. Nearly 10 years later, <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm\">Glassdoor </a>has named it the second best job in America.</p> \n<p>But if you're debating what role to add to your data management team, a data scientist shouldn't be your first option.</p> \n<p>Kossowski highlights that your data science is only going to be as good as the data that's powering it. And if that data isn't trustworthy, you're not going to get valuable insights.</p> \n<p>\"Data science is not a magic wand that magically turns bad data into insights. Regardless, you're still going to need that data foundation,\" she adds. \"So, jumping into doing something because it's the next big thing, I think that's a big concern.\"</p> \n<p>If you're in the earlier stages of the data maturity model, Kossowski has a suggestion on where to focus your efforts.</p> \n<p>\"A data warehouse architect or even a data analyst who is experienced in writing SQL and building out SQL tables,\" she says. \"If you're only going to hire one person and you don't have that much data, that can be a really powerful hire because there's a lot that one person can do when you're at a smaller scale. They can wear many different hats and learn different things.\"</p> \n<p>When it comes to the more technical tasks, like ingesting data into the warehouse, there are third-party tools you can use to do that for you.</p> \n<p>At this stage, what you really need is someone to help you with structuring your data.</p> \n<h3>1. Outline your data architecture.</h3> \n<p>The first thing you want to do is understand your data at a granular level.</p> \n<p>Ask yourself these questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Where will the data live?</li> \n <li>What type of data will you be collecting and from what sources?</li> \n <li>How will the data be organized?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The goal here is to understand the structure of your data.</p> \n<p>If there's no understanding of the structure, you can't build a comprehensive plan on how to manage your data.</p> \n<h3>2. Define the relationship between BI and your teams.</h3> \n<p>When it comes to data strategy, one of the most important steps is defining the teams involved in the process and setting expectations for BI.</p> \n<p>In a large organization that hasn't thought about data strategy before, you'll often find that every team follows a different model and has a different relationship with BI, making it hard for BI to operate in a streamlined and standard fashion.</p> \n<p>It also blurs the lines between the roles of the data analyst and BI.</p> \n<p>The data analyst should know the business logic that is specific to their team and the structure of the data being collected. BI, on the other hand, shouldn't need to have specific knowledge on the operational area it is supporting, and should instead be focusing on the data source and managing the platform to support the analyst.</p> \n<p>When BI is regularly adjusting its process to match the team's specific business logic, it slows everything down and creates a constant need for relearning.</p> \n<p>Kossowki's suggestion? Strip the business logic out of the BI layer and work on things that are relevant to as many teams as possible.</p> \n<p>In addition, come up with a standard analyst profile and a model for the relationship between BI and teams.</p> \n<p>\"There are still going to be some places where we're working on data sets and not the whole platform,\" said Kossowski, \"but as much as we can, it's cleaning up the base data, making it easy to join, but not actually doing those joins and the logic for them.\"</p> \n<h3>3. Assign ownership.</h3> \n<p>After establishing the relationship between your teams and BI, the next step is defining who will own what.</p> \n<p>It's typical to have a different owner for each part of the data. For example, one person or team may own the operational data while another owns the reporting data.</p> \n<p>You may also need to assign owners at different stages in the pipeline. The BI team may own the data at a particular stage then pass it on to the analysts.</p> \n<p>Kossowski believes ownership starts with the teams who are producing the data.</p> \n<p>\"They need to feel some level of ownership over the data and have some level of accountability if something's wrong,\" she said. \"Because if it's wrong at the source, there's very little that BI can do.\"</p> \n<p>She continues, \"And if you try to put in patch patches at that level, you're just going to run into more problems down the line, so that relationship is important as well.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Establish data governance.</h3> \n<p>Data governance is a set of policies and regulations that inform how data will be collected and stored to ensure accuracy and quality.</p> \n<p>In simple terms, data governance is saying \"<em>Hey, you want to use and be a part of this source of truth data we've created? Then you've got to meet this criteria.</em>\"</p> \n<p>This can include meeting coding standards, having a certain number of reviewers, and following a specific documentation process.</p> \n<p>\"When we think about governance and adoption, it's really about the mechanisms you can put into place toward adherence,\" said Kossowski.</p> \n<p>There are two pieces that you have to consider when it comes to governance: the cultural piece and the technological aspect.</p> \n<p>From a cultural perspective, how do you get your teams to adopt these standards? And from a technical perspective, which processes can you automate so that everything does not require behavior modification?</p> \n<p>As you think of these two pieces, you have to consider both the analyst side and the engineer (or source team) side.</p> \n<p>Kossowski explains that for engineering teams, it can be hard to think about what data looks like when it comes into the warehouse because it's not a core part of their product or responsibility.</p> \n<p>They may not see the tangible benefits of the data unless it's a data-driven organization that works tightly with its analysts. In this case, the analysts can relay that the data is powering X decision, so until the data means Y requirements, decisions can't be made.</p> \n<p>For analysts, it's easier to see the benefits because they're closer to the business and can see the direct impact. They can realize that following data governance standards means less reliance on BI, which makes things move more quickly.</p> \n<p>\"The insights from the data have to be powering decisions being made about the product because that's the only way you're going to get the product and engineering teams</p> \n<p>bought into the value of data and thinking about their data as it is exported,\" said Kossowski.</p> \n<h3>5. Reassess regularly.</h3> \n<p>Wherever you fall on the data maturity model, your data strategy will always need some tweaking.</p> \n<p>\"[At HubSpot], we have a three-year plan and all these ideas of what happens in each of those years,\" said Kossowski. But I fully expect that a year from now, when we look at it, there are things we're going to want to tweak based on how things have changed.\"</p> \n<p>For instance, say you introduce a new feature in your product or service and now are collecting more sensitive customer data. This may require taking a more defensive approach. If your company grows exponentially, you may need to shift toward a distributed strategy instead of a centralized one.</p> \n<p>Even if there are no changes in how your company operates, you may still need to reassess. Here are two major indicators it's time to review your data strategy:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>There is frustration with how long things are taking.</li> \n <li>There's a lack of trust in the data.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Kossowski says finding the balance between those two is key.</p> \n<p>\"You don't want BI doing everything because then it's just going to take a long time,\" she said, \"but you also don't want to have so much freedom in the analyst population that you can't really rely on any data.\"</p> \n<p>A good rule of thumb is to review your strategy every six months to a year. Speak with business leaders, IT, and your teams to understand how everyone feels about your progress and determine what changes need to be made.</p> \n<p>The process for building an EDS will vary from one company to the next, as your data maturity level, industry, and company size all play a role in the steps you take.</p> \n<p>By taking stock of where your company currently stands, you can develop a strategy that meets the specific needs of your business.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b7b5fa30-b069-48d5-8c08-517ef6d0f6b0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b7b5fa30-b069-48d5-8c08-517ef6d0f6b0.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fenterprise-data-strategy&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5f39f863-0316-486f-a5f3-849d76490a30.png","linkMd5":"f5d5ff6533ab7cc286e5c10dbf86b878","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn44@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-355_fa30b986c2b6e15d.webp","destWidth":422,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4889,"destBytes":6654,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5f39f863-0316-486f-a5f3-849d76490a30.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn44@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-355_fa30b986c2b6e15d.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b7b5fa30-b069-48d5-8c08-517ef6d0f6b0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-49-595_1b9fb426b1a877bc.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fenterprise-data-strategy&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn60@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-51-665_52855e66b57dfb01.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938151},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"How Consumer Spending Habits Could Change in 2021 [New Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/post-reopening-spending-habits","description":"<p>As businesses and economies closed down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, consumers also tightened up their budgets.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-consumers-changed-brands-this-year?_ga=2.243549255.354359694.1623873392-1940116527.1623873392\">data from McKinsey</a>, most consumers were more conscientious about purchases than before the pandemic. Because of this, most households primarily budgeted around essential products and services.</p> \n<p>But, now, as economies begin to swiftly reopen following mass vaccinations, business owners and marketers might also be wondering what this could mean for the next year of revenue.</p> \n<p>Specifically, many business leaders are asking, \"Will consumers continue to spend cautiously, or will they spend more freely in 2021?\"</p> \n<p>To help businesses prepare and navigate for the coming months, I asked nearly 300 random consumers, \"Which best describes your budgeting plan for the next year?\"</p> \n<p>Here's what they said and tips for how to navigate future spending behaviors.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Download Now: State of Marketing in 2021 Report\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png\"></a></p> \n<h2>How Consumers Will Spend Money in the Next Year</h2> \n<p>As economies reopen, people return to work, and household revenues start to rise again, you might think that people will be racing to online or physical stores to shop for all the things they didn't have the budget for in 2020.</p> \n<p>However, when looking at the results of our small survey, it seems that people are cautiously optimistic about their 2021 budget.</p> \n<p>Although one-third of respondents say they plan to \"loosen\" their budgets and spend more money than they did in 2020, a whopping 43% plan to keep the same budget they had in 2020. Meanwhile, nearly one-quarter of respondents will tighten their budget and spend less money in the next year.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Consumer%20Spending%20Habits%20Could%20Change%20in%202021%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png\"><img alt=\"poll results for the question which best describes your budget plan for the next year with most respondents saying their budget will remain the same.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Consumer%20Spending%20Habits%20Could%20Change%20in%202021%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png?width=600&amp;name=How%20Consumer%20Spending%20Habits%20Could%20Change%20in%202021%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 10px;\"><em><a href=\"http://luc.id\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Data Source</a></em></p> \n<p>If you sell non-essential products or services or rely on your customers to have a larger budget, you shouldn't panic just yet. Keep in mind that this is just one small survey of a random consumer group. Additionally, had we polled people in different industries, locations, or age ranges, the results might have been different.</p> \n<p>However, what this survey does remind us of is that people are still more conscientious than ever about the products and services they're purchasing -- and likely will remain that way for months to come.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, to turn audiences into customers, it's still more important than ever to market your offering's value -- even if you don't sell something that's considered \"essential.\"</p> \n<h2>Tips for Marketing Your Product or Service in Uncertain Financial Times</h2> \n<h3>1. Make your value proposition a priority.</h3> \n<p>When someone is on a tight budget, each dollar they spend has to be worth it. This means that the products or services they buy have to help them do something essential, solve a common pain point, save them time or money, or fulfill other major needs.</p> \n<p>As a marketer or business owner, it's important to learn the ins and outs of your buyer persona, their needs, and what motivates them to make a purchase. Then, you must use your messaging to explain why your offering will be worth their money.</p> \n<h3>2. Differentiate yourself from competitors.</h3> \n<p>As a budget-minded person myself, I -- like many others -- do detailed research before purchasing a product or service. When I decide I need to buy something, I look at all the brands that sell it, their reviews, and the product's cost. While I might buy the cheapest version of something, I also might consider a higher-end version of a product if something about it is better quality than the more affordable option.</p> \n<p>For example, I recently helped my parents pick out their first smart TV. While almost all of today's smart TVs have similar apps and features, we chose a Roku TV because Roku's marketing emphasized a simple, easy-to-understand user interface and setup. While it was also quite affordable, the UX alone was the reason for purchasing it over other competitors. &nbsp;</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Roku TV web page showing Roku UX and how the product easily works.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20Consumer%20Spending%20Habits%20Could%20Change%20in%202021%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20Consumer%20Spending%20Habits%20Could%20Change%20in%202021%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p>As a marketer, it's important to remember that people look into many different factors when making a purchase decision -- especially when it will be a larger investment. And, sometimes, the price of the product isn't the only deciding factor. That's why it's important to market elements of your product that are different or better than a competitor's.</p> \n<h3>3. Leverage customer-generated content.</h3> \n<p>If you're struggling to differentiate your product or service, but know you have loyal customers who love your brand, leverage them in your marketing.</p> \n<p>Research shows that prospects trust <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/user-generated-content-stats\">customer reviews, videos, how-tos, and other user-generated content</a> similarly to how they'd trust a word-of-mouth recommendation. Ultimately, when a prospect sees that someone like them has benefited from your brand's offerings, they trust that you sell something of good quality and value and might be more motivated to buy your product than a cheaper alternative from a competitor with poor or minimal reviews.</p> \n<p>Need some examples of how to collect and market excellent UGC, testimonials, or reviews? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-reviews-testimonials\">Check out this guide</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4. Consider discounts or sales.</h3> \n<p>If your brand can afford to offer small discounts or sales, this can be a great way to attract people with tighter budgets to your brand. Even if your discounts or sales are temporary, a prospect might purchase an on-sale product, love its quality, and return to the brand later because they've gained a sense of trust and loyalty to it.</p> \n<p>If it isn't possible to offer sales or discounted services, you could also consider a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/update-7-customer-loyalty-programs-that-actually-add-value\">customer loyalty or rewards program</a>&nbsp;that allows frequent shoppers to eventually receive a free or heavily discounted product. This way, they might feel like every penny they spend could go towards a reward in the future.</p> \n<h3>5. Highlight your brand's mission or purpose.</h3> \n<p>In 2020, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-consumers-changed-brands-this-year?_ga=2.187788394.354359694.1623873392-1940116527.1623873392\">the same McKinsey survey</a>&nbsp;mentioned at the beginning of this post, also found that people were beginning to also shop at brands that shared a similar set of values to their own. With this in mind, it's becoming more common for brands to invest in purpose-driven marketing, or campaigns that highlight a mission, purpose, or set of values the company is serious about.</p> \n<p>For example, Kréyol, a Black woman-run fashion brand, embraces Haitian culture and global female empowerment with its clothing and product lines. The company's \"For women, by women\" mission aims to improve the lives of women, artisans, and entrepreneurs around the globe by featuring their clothing and designs on the Kréyol site.</p> \n<p>\"The whole idea behind Kréyol was for me to be able to provide a platform for artisans, specifically women of color, to be able to highlight the wonderful work that they do,” CEO Joelle Wendy Fontaine said <a href=\"https://www.baystatebanner.com/2020/11/25/joelle-fontaines-kreyol-collection-celebrates-diverse-female-artisans/\">in an interview</a>.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 600px; max-height: 339px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVDmR6stjoE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>While Kréyol's marketing and business strategy spreads awareness of beautiful artisan fashion, prospects might also be more driven to support the brand because of its trustworthy and authentic mission to improve the lives of women around the world.</p> \n<h2>Navigating Changing Purchasing Behaviors</h2> \n<p>As the world continues to reopen and evolve following the pandemic, so will spending habits. While some people will start to begin spending more, others will remain cautious for the next year or beyond.</p> \n<p>As a marketer or business owner, you'll need to listen to your audiences and continue to follow data about your target persona's to learn how their approaches to money are changing and what efforts you'll need to take on to continue to win them over.</p> \n<p>To learn more about the latest marketing trends and consumer behaviors, check out our recently published State of Marketing Report.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

On top of tracking all your Facebook Business Page data in one place, users could also create and embed Facebook tracking pixels on their websites to see how audiences behaved and what their customer journey looked like.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://oneppcagency.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Facebook-Analytics-UI-1024x528.png\" alt=\"Facebook Analytics UI\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://oneppcagency.co.uk/facebook-ads/facebook-analytics/\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>Facebook Analytics could also give brands a look at your Facebook page’s details and audience demographics to help brands better inform their strategies.</p> \n<p>Because much of the information shown on Facebook Analytics can now be found through other competitive and affordable data platforms — as well as Facebook’s Insights, Business Suite, Ads Manager, and Events Manager — Facebook decided to discontinue Analytics in an effort to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/966883707418907\">consolidate its tools</a>.</p> \n<p>While Facebook hasn’t said if online privacy trends were a factor in its decision, the pivot comes at a time when Google and Apple have already begun to limit data tracking through the planned <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/third-party-cookie-phase-out?_ga=2.30497151.1379079422.1624456662-2110117211.1624456662\">phase-out of third-party cookies</a>&nbsp;and Apple’s recent <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/apple-ios-release-and-privacy-change?_ga=2.222958939.1379079422.1624456662-2110117211.1624456662\">IOS 14.5 opt-in requirements</a>&nbsp;for mobile app tracking.</p> \n<p>Because of the ongoing moves towards data privacy, it seems that Facebook could also prevent future data concerns with the streamlining of nearly extraneous Analytics tools.</p> \n<h2>How Marketers Can Prepare</h2> \n<p>Until June 30, brands can still access Facebook Analytics and download reports of all the data they might need.</p> \n<p>To export data into a CSV file from Facebook Analytics on your desktop, click the [share icon] <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">in the top-right corner of each chart or table,\" <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/966883707418907\">Facebook advises</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Aside from downloading data, brands that used the tool should also consider alternatives that can highlight similar data. Although Facebook Analytics was a helpful tool for some businesses looking for free or cheap platforms, there are affordable alternatives that can help you track your customer’s journey from social media to on-site conversion.</p> \n<p>Below is just a quick list of Facebook Analytics alternatives to consider.</p> \n<h2>Facebook Analytics Alternatives</h2> \n<h3>Free Tools</h3> \n<h4>Facebook Business Suite</h4> \n<p>Once Facebook Analytics is no more, Facebook will encourage Business Page admins to use its Business Suite, which allows users to connect and track <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com\">multiple Instagram and Facebook Business Pages</a>&nbsp;at once.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Facebook Business Suite dashboard\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Facebook%20Analytics%20is%20Going%20Away%20Should%20Marketers%20Really%20Worry%3F-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 10px;\"><em><a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>At the moment, Facebook Business Suite is still rolling out and might not be available for some admins just yet.

Serious?<br><br>For many of us, the stress of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-stronger-introductions\">creating a great introduction</a> drives the dreaded cursor feedback loop: Blink. Blink. Blink. The cursor-on-a-blank-screen sits, waiting for your brilliance but you just can’t find the words. It’s something that all writers — amateur or professional, aspiring or experienced — know and dread. And of all times for it to occur, it seems to plague us the most when trying to write an introduction.</p>  \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ccc95db5-9007-49cf-b69c-94bb5c46b366&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: 6 Free Blog Post Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ccc95db5-9007-49cf-b69c-94bb5c46b366.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>I mean, you already have a blog post you want to write. Can't you just dive in and write it? Why all the focus on getting the introduction right?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Here's the thing: Intros set the stage. They establish the tone and let visitors know what to expect.</p> \n<p>And it’s not all bad — introductions don’t have to be long or complex. In fact, most people prefer them to be quite quick. They also don't have to be so difficult.</p> \n<p>Let's break down exactly how to write an introduction that's short, effective, and relatively painless. And if you're ever having trouble churning out those intros, come back here and re-read this formula to lift yourself out of that writing rut.</p> \n<div> \n <p></p> \n <p></p> \n <h2>How to Write an Introduction</h2> \n</div> \n<p>Writing an introduction that captures your audience can help your website traffic (and ultimately, your business) grow better, but doing it right is just as important. Here's how to write an introduction in three simple steps.</p> \n<p>To write an introduction, be mindful of what it's supposed to achieve. The main goals here are to draw in your reader — a relative stranger, most of the time — and concisely let her know what the article is about. Generally, that consists of three key components:</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Step 1) Grab the reader's attention. That looks different for every piece of writing, but we've provided some suggestions below.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Step 2) Present the reason for the post's existence.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Step 3) Explain how the post will help address the problem that brought your reader to it.</p> \n<p>As a lover of all things meta, I will, of course, use this post's introduction as an example of how to write an intro. It contains different components that create the above introduction \"formula,\" which you can refer to that when you get stuck with your own.</p> \n<p>Below, we've gone into more detail on each component.</p> \n<h2>Writing an Introduction Paragraph</h2> \n<h3>1. Grab the reader's attention.</h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">There are a few ways to hook your reader from the start. You can be empathetic (\"Don't you hate it when...?\"), or tell a story, so the reader immediately feels some emotional resonance with the piece. You could tell a joke (\"Ha! This is fun. Let's read more of this.\"). You could shock the reader with a crazy fact or stat (\"Whoa. That's crazy. I must know more!\").</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">For this intro, I went the \"empathetic\" route.</span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9XvDso-vX2G0efZ8CCgDI_EuWw4S0O261zjbM7Maza4h13bfJRwM9c40UrwSxKcTQGMgweuV6xFPPesVTGRcSuJkOqluJJsNMGJ8BjgZ8ew6xH3Q30CusxDiyZHT1V6GsXZsY-a-\" width=\"600\" alt=\"example of how to Grab the reader's attention in an introduction paragraph\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Writer's block stinks. Blank screens and taunting cursors — the worst. Who's with me?</span></p> \n<h3>2. Present the reason for the post's existence.</h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Your post needs to have a purpose. The purpose of this post is to address a specific problem — the pain in the butt that is writing intros. But, we have to do it, and therein lies the approach to something important: making writing introductions easier.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Just because you know the purpose of your post, doesn't mean the reader does — not yet, anyway. It's your job to validate your post's importance and give your audience a reason to keep reading.</span></p> \n<h3>3. Explain how the post will help address the problem.</h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Now that the reader is presented with a problem that he or she can relate to — and obviously wants a solution — it's time to let the audience know what the post will provide, and quickly.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">In other words, the introduction should set expectations. Take this post, for example. I <em><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">don't</span></em><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> want the reader to dive in and expect to see a list of reasons <em><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">why</span></em><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> introductions are important. I want you to expect to read about <em><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">what</span></em><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> makes a good introduction. </span></span></span></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">But if I hadn't clarified that in the introduction, you might have expected the former. After all, be honest — did you skim over or forget the title of this post already? That's okay. That's why we tell the reader exactly what the post will provide, and why it's valuable.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Of course, there are other valid ways to write introductions for your marketi<span style=\"color: #444444;\">ng content — don't feel the need to follow this formula for every single piece of content, as some are more casual than others. But, this guide should help provide a solid framework to follow if you're just getting started, or if it's just one of those days when the words aren't flowing.</span></span></p> \n<h4><span style=\"color: #444444;\">What makes a good introduction?</span></h4> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">While format is fundamental to consistently capture visitor attention, it’s also worth considering stylistic frameworks that can help boost engagement from the first moment users land on your site. These include:</span></p> \n<h5><span style=\"color: #444444;\">1. Telling a compelling story.</span></h5> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Great stories sell books — and they’re also a fantastic way to open a website blog. Storytelling is part of the human experience and if your intro can tee up a solid story, visitors are more likely to keep reading past the first paragraph.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">The caveat? Don’t give it all away up-front. Not only should intros be kept short, but the idea is to have people read all the way through to the end. Instead, start with a great hook about something interesting that happened — “The one time I…”, “It all started when…”</span></p> \n<h5><span style=\"color: #444444;\">2. Cultivating empathy.</span></h5> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">We’re also naturally predisposed to empathy, especially when we can relate to what someone else is saying on a personal level.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Let’s say you’re running a money-saving advice blog. By starting your post with a few of your own experiences with debt and how it impacted your life, you can cultivate empathy from those in similar positions and simultaneously lend your blog greater authority.</span></p> \n<h5><span style=\"color: #444444;\">3. Establishing common pain points.</span></h5> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">There’s no trait more universally human than complaining. We do it about small things — like the weather — and big things, like challenges at work or home. This creates an opportunity for content creators: Establish common ground with familiar pain points.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Consider a home maintenance and repair blog. You could introduce homeowners communally dislike — such as clogged gutters or peeling paint — quickly discuss why it’s so frustrating, and then assure readers you can offer a viable solution.</span></p> \n<h5><span style=\"color: #444444;\">4. Crafting a human connection.</span></h5> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">If you’re running any type of product or service website, expect natural skepticism from visitors. They know you’re trying to sell something and their guard is naturally up, especially against hyperbolic or superfluous claims.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Here, it’s worth considering calling out a company shortfall — “we’re not the best, but”, “we don’t have all the answers” — and then highlighting what sets you apart from the competition. Done right, you can disarm cynical users with honesty, craft a human connection and encourage them to consider your pitch.</span></p> \n<h5><span style=\"color: #444444;\">5. Asking interesting questions.</span></h5> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">You can never go wrong with questions — so long as they’re interesting. Intros that start with “did you know that…” or “ever wondered why…” are great starters if you have relevant information to share.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">This can’t be overstated: If your blog doesn’t (or can’t) answer the question you pose in the introduction, choose a different approach. Nothing frustrates visitors faster than discovering that blog intro and body are a content mismatch.</span></p> \n<h2><span style=\"color: #444444;\">5 Introduction Examples</span></h2> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Curious about what a great introduction looks like in the wild? Let’s break down five great examples.</span></p> \n<h3><span style=\"color: #444444;\">1. <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2021/06/08/this-free-2-5-hour-tutorial-covers-all-aspects-of-wedding-photography/\">PetaPixel</a></span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Photography site PetaPixel offers news, insights, and advice about all things photo-related. In their post “This Free 2.5 Hour Tutorial Covers All Aspects of Wedding Photography,” PetaPixel uses their introduction to highlight the experience of tutorial creator Taylor Jackson, who shoots “60 to 70 weddings every year.”</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">This quick-hitter introduction helps establish Jackson’s credibility as an expert and cultivates confidence among readers, in turn encouraging them to read the post and click through to the tutorial.</span></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/statement-home-tray-36929493\">Apartment Therapy</a></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Apartment Therapy is all about helping visitors organize, clean, and streamline their apartment space, while also highlighting specific product categories. In their recent post “This Unique Tray is What Your Living Room is Missing,” the site uses one of the techniques mentioned above: Pain points.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">“Even maximalists can’t stand clutter,” reads the first intro line. “The reality is that nobody likes to open a cabinet only to be faced with a messy avalanche of knick-knacks and accessories.” By establishing common grounds for complaint, the blog helps set up the benefits of the product it’s trying to sell.</span></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://greatist.com/happiness/home-tool-kit-essentials\">Greatist</a></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Greatist is a health and wellness blog that offers advice and tips for readers. Their recent starter toolkit post — “Stop Using Your Shoe as a Hammer: 17 Items for Your Starter Tool Kit” helps cultivate a connection with a simple introductory line: “You don’t have to be a DIY pro to need a tool kit around.” </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">By highlighting the near-universal need for a simple, streamlined toolkit, the site sets up readers to continue on and discover which tools are critical for starter kits.</span></p> \n<h3><span style=\"color: #444444;\">4. <a href=\"http://www.thefriendlyteacher.com/blog\">The Friendly Teacher</a></span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Educational advice site The Friendly Teacher opens her “10 Tips for Organizing Your Classroom at the End of the Year” with a simple question: “What do teachers do in the summer?”</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">The answer is easy: Relax. But as the post points out, leaving classrooms in a state of disrepair only makes more work for the following year — and she’s here to help with 10 simple tips for pre-summer cleanup. The introduction works because it helps put readers in the right frame of mind — a relaxing summer — and then offers actionable tips to reach that goal.</span></p> \n<h3><span style=\"color: #444444;\">5. <a href=\"https://bloggingtips.com/choosing-your-blog-url/\">BloggingTips.com</a></span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">BloggingTips.com is exactly what you’d expect: A site dedicated to useful blogging tips that help improve your site. In their recent post, “How To Choose A Blog Name – A New Blogger’s Guide to Selecting a Domain Name And URL”, they don’t waste any time getting to the point of their introduction, noting that, “Once you’ve decided to launch a blog – whether for personal or business purposes – one of the first decisions you have to make involves your domain name selection.”</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">The biggest benefit of this introduction? Brevity. It gets right to the point. If you’ve got a blog, you need a domain name. This is a great approach when the subject matter you’re tackling is relevant and useful but not inherently compelling: Rather than trying to force a connection or create a convoluted narrative, straight and to the point works best.</span></p> \n<h2>Let's Get Started</h2> \n<p><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Feeling inspired?

TV commercials, print advertisements, and billboards all attempt to do just that.</p> \n<p>The internet offers unique benefits other marketing mediums can't offer — scope of reach, the option to personalize content, and the opportunity to build far-reaching relationships with customers, being just a few.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>But the internet can be an overwhelming and all-encompassing entity, filled with videos and recipes and news articles and e-commerce sites. In the crowded space of the internet, how are you supposed to differentiate your business to reach the right audience?</p> \n<p>The answer is internet marketing.</p> \n<p>Internet marketing leverages digital channels, including email, social media, websites, and search engines, to reach your ideal audience. Unlike more traditional advertising mediums, such as print, the internet encourages two-way conversations between your business and your customer, ideally creating better long-term customer retention.</p> \n<p>There's no avoiding it: internet marketing is critical for the success of your business in 2021 and beyond.</p> \n<p>But with all the gimmicks and tricks, it can be difficult to distinguish short-term wins from effective long-term strategies, which is why we've created an ultimate guide. Here, we'll cover everything from marketing strategies to real-world examples, to ensure your business reaches the right people out of that four billion.</p> \n<h2>What is Internet/Online Marketing?</h2> \n<p>Online marketing, also known as internet marketing or web advertising, is a form of marketing that uses the internet to deliver promotional messages to customers through digital channels such as search engines, email, websites, and social media.</p> \n<p>Online marketing strategies include web design, SEO, email, social media, PPC, and other internet-related methods.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What's the role of internet marketing?</h3> \n<p>Simply put, the role of internet marketing is to help your business reach, attract, and convert online audiences.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Let's dive into two separate goals you'll have with internet marketing, as well as the necessary methods you'll want to take to achieve those goals.</p> \n<h4>Internet Marketing to Attract New Customers</h4> \n<p>You can use online marketing strategies to attract new customers. To do this, you'll want to focus primarily on paid social media ads, search engines, and web design.</p> \n<p>For instance, you might use <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/a/lookalike-audiences\">Facebook's Lookalike Audiences</a> to get your message in front of an audience similar to your core demographic. Or, you could pay a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/influencers-social-media-experiment?_ga=2.249309317.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">social media influencer</a> to share images of your products to her already well-established community. Paid social media can attract new customers to your brand or product, but you'll want to conduct market research and A/B testing before investing too much in one social media channel.</p> \n<p>To attract new customers, you also need to maintain a powerful SEO presence. With <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/the-changing-face-b2b-marketing/\">89% of B2B buyers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.249309317.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">81% of shoppers</a> using the internet for research before making purchasing decisions, it's imperative your business is at the forefront of search for related keywords.</p> \n<p>Having a strong SEO presence also translates to more in-store purchases, as well — in fact, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.249309317.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">78% of local mobile searches</a> result in an offline purchase, and <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.249309317.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">local searches lead half of all mobile users</a> to visit stores within one day.</p> \n<p>Finally, it's critical you spend time and resources on your business's website design. When these aforementioned customers find your website, they'll likely feel deterred from trusting your brand and purchasing your product if they find your site confusing or unhelpful. For this reason, it's important you take the time to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-design-trends-2017?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">create a user-friendly</a> (and mobile-friendly) website.</p> \n<h4>Internet Marketing to Cultivate Brand Loyalists</h4> \n<p>Internet marketing is for more than just attracting new customers — it's also critical for maintaining a loyal, long-term customer base. And, since it costs <a href=\"https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/\">five times more to attract a new customer</a> than it does to keep an existing one, this is an equally important goal.</p> \n<p>You'll want to use email, blogging, and social media tactics to increase brand awareness, cultivate a strong online community, and retain customer loyalty. Consider sending personalized emails to past customers to impress or inspire them — for instance, you might send discounts based off what they've previously purchased, wish them a happy birthday, or remind them of upcoming events.</p> \n<p>To properly employ email campaigns, you'll need an email list. Here's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/list-building?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">how to build an email list from scratch</a>.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you might use social media to showcase your brand's personality and hear directly from your customers. Consider hosting a Twitter chat, posting surveys on Instagram, or creating fun contests on Facebook.</p> \n<p>If you don't feel like you have the bandwidth to create all social media content internally, consider using a third-party service like <a href=\"https://www.upcontent.com/\">UpContent</a>, which sends you compelling, curated content that you can share with your audiences for increased engagement.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Internet Marketing vs. Content Marketing</h3> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Content marketing and internet marketing are incredibly similar strategies used to attract leads and prospects to your site, and ultimately convert web traffic into customers. However, there are a few slight differences between the two.&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Content marketing lives under the roof of online/internet marketing — which means online/internet marketing is the more broad, overarching strategy, and content marketing is one process within that strategy.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Content marketing applies <em>only</em> to the process of creating and distributing content to reach audiences.&nbsp;Online marketing, on the other hand, encompasses sharing that content through email, search engines, and social media — it also includes paid advertising, retargeting, and a wide range of strategies you might use to reach audiences online.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">While most of the strategies that fall under online marketing have to do with content creation, online marketing also pertains to the non-content creation tasks of internet marketing: such as PPC bidding, or website design.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are 11 strategies you'll want to employ to ensure you're successful at internet marketing.</p> \n<h3>1. Design a User-friendly Website</h3> \n<p>First, you want to create a user-friendly, and mobile-friendly, website. The design of your site will showcase your brand's personality and differentiate your business from every other online business. But it's more than just looking good — a cleaner, more well-organized site structure can affect how you rank in the SERPS.</p> \n<p>For help designing your website or ensuring it's up-to-par, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30557/6-guidelines-for-exceptional-website-design-and-usability.aspx?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">8 Guidelines for Exceptional Web Design, Usability, and User Experience</a>.</p> \n<h3>2. Optimize Your Site for Search Engines</h3> \n<p>Next, you'll need to keyword optimize your site for search engines. Essentially, this means you'll choose keyword(s) that relate to your business, and incorporate those keywords into the URL, body text, image text, headers, and navigation bar.</p> \n<p>For tips on keyword optimizing your entire site, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-site-keyword-optimize-ht?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">On-Page SEO 101: Tips for Keyword Optimizing the Most Critical Parts of Your Website</a>.</p> \n<p>If you're interested in focusing on keyword optimizing your blog posts, consider reading <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">Blog SEO: How to Search Engine Optimize Your Blog Content</a>.</p> \n<p>For a real-life example on how to successfully implement SEO into your digital marketing strategy, check out our case study on Canva here:</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WuFc6UTS1T0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h3>3. Use Email Marketing or Opt-in Email Campaigns</h3> \n<p>Email marketing and opt-in marketing campaigns are one of the most effective long-term strategies to connect with potential customers and cultivate brand loyalty.</p> \n<p>For everything from getting started with email marketing, to email marketing best practices and lead magnets, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">The Ultimate Guide to Email Marketing</a>.</p> \n<h3>4. Write Online Press Releases</h3> \n<p>Writing online press releases is an additional way to increase online coverage of your business from other sources, which will also positively affect your ranking in the SERPs. Plus, if a local news outlet covers your business, you'll receive their audience, which you otherwise might not have reached.</p> \n<p>To get started writing a press release for your business, consider <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/press-release-template-ht?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">How to Write a Press Release [Free 2017 Press Release Template + Example]</a>.</p> \n<h3>5. Create a Blog</h3> \n<p>I might be biased, but blogging is one of the best ways to attract a large audience to your site, establish your business as a thought leader in your industry, and prove your brand to be both useful and current.</p> \n<p>Writing blog posts is especially effective for providing different opportunities to land on page one of search engines — for instance, maybe your eyeglass store's website is on page three of Google for “eyeglasses,” but your “Best Sunglasses of 2018” blog post is on page one, pulling in an impressive amount of traffic (over time, that blog post could also boost your overall website to page one).</p> \n<p>To learn everything from choosing a domain name to writing your first blog post, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">How to Start a Blog: A Step-by-Step Guide [+ Free Blog Post Templates]</a>.</p> \n<h3>6. Develop Social Media Contests and Campaigns</h3> \n<p>Social media contests and campaigns are exceptional opportunities to engage with your online audience, form relationships with customers, and learn about your buyer's persona.</p> \n<p>For an overarching compilation on everything you need to know about social media campaigns — from how to craft perfect posts on Facebook to the most shared phrases on LinkedIn — take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-campaigns?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">Everything You Need to Know about Social Media Campaigns.</a></p> \n<h3>7. Leverage Pay-per-click Advertising</h3> \n<p>With 45% of small businesses using paid advertising, this isn't a strategy you should ignore. Pay-per-click advertising, or PPC, is an advertising model in which advertisers only pay when someone interacts with their ad through impressions or clicks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\"><span>PPC</span></a> is most commonly used on search engines, and can help your business appear for searches related to your products or services. This is particularly important for more competitive keywords, when it's difficult to rank on page one against websites with higher domain authority.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It's important to note — PPC doesn't replace your SEO strategy, it simply complements it. For instance, if you're trying to rank for \"website builder\", you'll see the keyword difficulty is \"super hard (95)\", according to Ahrefs. However, there are some long-form keywords you might have success ranking for, including \"what is a website builder? (52)\" or \"best website builders for ecommerce (57)\".&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you do want to target \"website builder\", you'll want to bid for an ad and use PPC to stand out against competitors.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>8. Optimize Your Site for Conversions</h3> \n<p>Okay, you got readers to your blog or homepage … now what?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ultimately, you'll want to invest in resources for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide?_ga=2.155902393.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\"><span>conversion rate optimization (CRO)</span></a>. If you don't, you risk not being able to convert any of your traffic into qualified leads and, ultimately, customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are four areas of your website that can benefit from CRO. These include the homepage, pricing page, blog, and landing pages.</p> \n<p>Within a blog, a CRO strategy might include adding relevant calls-to-action throughout the text, or inviting readers to submit their emails in exchange for an ebook. On a pricing page, a CRO strategy might include a slide-out that invites viewers to book time with a sales rep or watch a demo.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Optimizing your site for conversions is a critical component of any strong internet marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>9. Post Videos on YouTube or Other Social Networks</h3> \n<p>Video marketing is an undeniably powerful opportunity to reach new audiences and convert leads into customers. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.214507541.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\"><span>83% of video marketers say video</span></a> has helped them generate leads, and <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?_ga=2.155902393.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\"><span>84% of people say that they've been convinced to buy a product</span></a> or service by watching a brand's video.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Convinced yet? If not, simply consider the fact that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data?_ga=2.155902393.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\"><span>89% of video marketers</span></a> plan to use YouTube in 2021 — which means, even if you're not posting videos on the channel, your competitors most likely are.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You'll want to diversify the type(s) of content you produce to attract audiences who prefer video over text, or YouTube over Twitter. Consider how you might implement your own video strategy to reach and convert new audiences.

Find Influencers to Work With Your Brand</h3> \n<p>I'm currently wearing a watch I found on Amazon. I'm sitting on a couch from Wayfair, with a candle from Anthropology on the table in front of me.</p> \n<p>Where did I hear about all these products? <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers\"><span>Influencers</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Social media influencers have cultivated strong, meaningful relationships with their followers. Their followers typically trust them to provide true, reliable guidance on a range of topics related to the influencers' expertise. Which is why influencer marketing can be an effective opportunity to spread brand awareness to new audiences.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you think influencer marketing could be a good choice for your business, consider micro-influencers as a more effective (and oftentimes more cost-efficient) option. In a recent study, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers?_ga=2.155902393.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\"><span>82% of respondents</span></a> said they were \"highly likely to follow a micro-influencers' recommendation\".</p> \n<p>Additionally, it can be expensive and time-consuming to find the right influencer(s) for your brand. If you're going to invest in the strategy, consider working with the same few influencers for the long-term — which enables your company to build stronger relationships with their social followers.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>11. Create a Facebook Group</h3> \n<p>A Facebook group — unlike a Facebook page — is an exclusive, private group that enables you to facilitate a sense of community surrounding your brand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-facebook-group?_ga=2.155902393.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\"><span>Facebook group</span></a> isn't a necessity for every business, but when done properly, it can go a long way towards creating a stronger relationship between you and your customers. Best of all, it can help foster connections <em>between</em> your customers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since having a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/surprising-stats-brand-loyalty?_ga=2.155902393.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\"><span>strong community can help you build brand loyalty</span></a>, it's important to seek out unique opportunities to engage directly with your customers. If a Facebook group doesn't seem like a good fit for your business, however, there are other ways to create a sense of community — including via social media, or through a branded newsletter.</p> \n<p>Finally, take a look at our <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/essential-guide-internet-marketing?_ga=2.155902393.360317351.1623877585-1873712312.1623877585\">Essential Step-by-Step Guide to Internet Marketing</a> to dive deeper into the six essential steps of internet marketing.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Online Marketing Examples</h2> \n<p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of online marketing examples to inspire your next internet marketing campaign.</p> \n<p>Here, I'll dive into five real world examples of social media, email, SEO, and website marketing methods. I'll also include links to additional blog resources at the bottom, for even more exceptional ideas.</p> \n<h3>1. Social Media: Under Armour's \"I Will What I Want\" Campaign</h3> \n<p>Under Armour came up with the hashtag \"I Will What I Want\" to encourage powerful athletic women to achieve their dreams despite any opposition they might face. The hashtag, first used by American Ballet Theatre ballerina soloist Misty Copeland, blew up on Facebook after supermodel Gisele Bündchen used it in one of her Facebook posts.

Email: JetBlue</h3> \n<p>Companies often use email marketing to re-engage past customers, but a \"Where'd You Go? Want To Buy This?\" message can come across as aggressive, and you want to be careful with your wording to cultivate a long-term email subscriber.</p> \n<p>This is why JetBlue's one year re-engagement email works so well — it uses humor to convey a sense of friendliness and fun, while simultaneously reminding an old email subscriber they might want to check out some of JetBlue's new flight deals.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jetblue%20email.png?width=458&amp;name=jetblue%20email.png\" alt=\"jetblue re-engagement email as an example of internet marketing\" width=\"458\" style=\"width: 458px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">\n</div> \n<h3>3.

However, according to <a href=\"https://blogs.constantcontact.com/what-is-the-roi-of-email-marketing/\">Constant Contact</a>, the average ROI for email marketing is $42 for every $1 spent.

That's why email is such an important channel.</p> \n<p>Through email, you're able to stay top-of-mind by providing communication to their personal inbox, and you can do it at scale with <a href=\"https://hubspot.com/products/marketing/marketing-automation\">marketing automation software</a>. It's important that an email campaign's recipients have opted in to receive this content and that each piece offers something valuable.</p> \n<p>Here are some examples of different purposes your email campaign may set out to accomplish:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Traffic generation</strong> - Email can be an effective promotion channel for the high-value content you create on your website.</li> \n <li><strong>Awareness</strong> - Not everyone who opts into your email list is ready for a purchasing decision. You can use email marketing to stay top of mind while providing the educational content that is most relevant to them.</li> \n <li><strong>Lead nurturing</strong> - As you stay top of mind, you may also consider ways to identify the leads you have with the highest purchase intent and provide conversion-focused content that <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/understanding-lead-nurturing\">\"nurtures\" them toward a sale</a> (or at least toward becoming sales-ready).</li> \n <li><strong>Revenue generation</strong> - You can create email marketing campaigns for your existing customers to promote <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/cross-selling\">upsell and cross-sell</a> opportunities. You can also create campaigns to capture a sales conversion from leads who are close to a purchasing decision. (One example might be creating \"abandon cart\" campaigns for recovering lost sales conversions.)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The options for effective email marketing are endless.

Let's get into how to create an effective email marketing campaign of your own.</p> \n<h3>1. Use an email planning template.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/email-marketing-planning-template?hubs_post-cta=image&amp;__hstc=45788219.78214bbb56125046cd2ba46e4539e61d.1623807888260.1623807888260.1623807888260.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1623807888260&amp;__hsfp=2686128884&amp;_ga=2.241991940.788778564.1623807886-247698671.1623807886\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/laptop%20email.png\" alt=\"Email Planning Template in Excel\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/email-marketing-planning-template?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download This Planning Template</a></p> \n<p>It's imperative to make a plan before you start emailing your entire customer database. That's why HubSpot created <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/email-marketing-planning-template?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">this free email planning template</a> to help you iron out who you're emailing, who you're suppressing from your contact list, and what the email's message is. Download the template now to get your email campaign planning organized.</p> \n<h3>2. Identify your goal for the campaign.</h3> \n<p>Figure out the outcome that you want:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Is it to clean up your list?</li> \n <li>Promote a new product?</li> \n <li>Follow-up from an abandoned cart event?</li> \n <li>Stay top of mind with your audience?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Different <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide\">email campaigns</a> will have different outcomes, requiring different tactics to get there. Once you determine the purpose of your campaign, you can then <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/metrics-email-marketers-should-be-tracking\">create the targets you want to hit</a>. Include specific metrics in your goal so that you can determine if your campaign was a success based on quantitative data.</p> \n<h3>3. Understand who you're emailing.</h3> \n<p>Have you ever heard the saying from Meredith Hill, \"When you speak to everyone, you speak to no one\"? What Hill is getting at here is that if you're watering down your message to apply to your entire audience, you're leaving opportunity on the table -- opportunity for creating high-value, specific, relevant content that speaks directly to the recipient.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, the key to a great email marketing campaign is identifying your audience and using <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-list-segmentation\">email segmentation</a> to ensure you're delivering to the right people at the right time. If you can accomplish this and build it into your strategy, you can get more creative and specific with your messaging.</p> \n<h3>4. Put yourself in the shoes of the buyer persona.</h3> \n<p>After you've identified the outcome and the goals you want to hit, you now need to strategize how to provide value to your buyer persona so that they convert, engage, or take the action you want them to take. Some things to ask yourself might include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How did they subscribe in the first place?</li> \n <li>What matters to them?</li> \n <li>What can I provide that will engage and delight them?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Build a targeted list and define enrollment criteria.</h3> \n<p>You know who you're targeting and what you want them to do. From there, you must build the segment. Thinking about your buyer persona, what properties do they all have in common? How does your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm\">CRM</a> describe those properties?</p> \n<p>Your software is smart, but it's not smart enough to automatically know which recipients you're sending to. Will the recipients receive the emails at the same time, or is there <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/workflows/understand-contact-based-workflow-types\">certain criteria they have to meet before they are enrolled in the sequence or campaign</a>?</p> \n<h3>6. Determine the timeline you want the campaign to run.</h3> \n<p>You may be running a seasonal campaign that only requires one or two emails, or you might be building a long-term top-of-mind nurturing campaign. Tailor the length of your email sequence to the length of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-cycle\">buying cycle</a> and stage the persona is at in the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">buyer's journey</a>. In other words, deliver the right message at the right time.</p> \n<h3>7. Plan your emails and follow-ups.</h3> \n<p>Once you know who you're emailing and why, it's time to strategize how to move them from A (where they are) to B (where you want them to be, the goal of the campaign).</p> \n<p>Over the course of the campaign's timeline, you may want multiple touchpoints. You may also even consider follow-ups based on the actions that each recipient takes. Plan these emails out, outlining the core message and take-away for each email.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that you can't expect a single email to do everything. Your email campaign can be made up of multiple emails, so consider taking your email recipients on a journey with each email serving a single purpose. This will increase the odds of each email being successful in its role toward reaching your goal.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're doing a lead nurturing campaign, you might have a few educational emails to take them from the awareness stage to the consideration stage before providing more conversion-focused content.</p> \n<p>The longer the buying process and sales cycle, the more emails you'll need.</p> \n<h3>8. Write click-worthy subject lines.</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-email-subject-line\">subject line</a> is the gate keeper of the rest of your email. Your buyer persona will not be exposed to your content unless they first click the subject line. With that in mind, use this precious real estate for copy that compels them to read further. You can do that by:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Piquing their interest</li> \n <li>Promising value</li> \n <li>Opening a loop (that will be closed in the body of the email)</li> \n <li>Using your unique voice to start the conversation</li> \n <li>Using personalization</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>9. Write copy that's suited for them.</h3> \n<p>Once you know the purpose of each email you're sending and you have the subject lines, you can write the copy that will engage your list. Consider where your audience is in their <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">buying journey</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage\">provide the type of content that they'll find useful</a>. For example, it doesn't make sense to promote products if you're emailing a segment of subscribers who are largely in the awareness stage of the buying journey.</p> \n<h3>10. Create your brand assets.</h3> \n<p>Few people want to read an email that simply gives them a wall of text. Visuals help your recipients quickly understand the point of the email. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/images-vs.-no-images-in-marketing-emails-newsletters\">intentional and well-placed imagery can increase click-through rates</a>, so put thought into not just what you want to say but how you want to say it, using visuals to support your message.</p> \n<h3>11. Put it all together with a comprehensive email builder.</h3> \n<p>Once you've written the copy for your emails, you'll want to build them out in the email software client you're intending to use.</p> \n<p>There are several options depending on your needs, including <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">HubSpot</a>, <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">MailChimp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pabbly.com/email-marketing/?utm_source=hubspot-email-marketing-examples&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=hubspot-email\">Pabbly Email Marketing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.constantcontact.com/index.jsp\">Constant Contact</a>.</p> \n<p>With a comprehensive email builder, you can create, optimize, and personalize your own email campaigns without needing any technical or graphic design experience.</p> \n<h3>12. Include clear calls to action.</h3> \n<p>Remember, if you're taking up your audience's time -- and inbox space -- with another email, your message must have a point to it. Consider what you want your email recipients to take away from the email.</p> \n<p>In most cases, you'll want to add a call-to-action (CTA) for them to take further action.</p> \n<p>Don't confuse your email contacts by providing too many options. For each email you send, there should be a single action that you want the reader to take. Then, instruct them to take that action and set expectations for what will happen when they do.</p> \n<p>Your goal behind the CTA may vary depending on the audience's buyer's journey stage and what you want to accomplish with your email campaign. For example, you may simply want to engage them further with another piece of content, or you might want to get them to make a purchase.</p> \n<p>Regardless of what it is, you should follow CTA best practices such as making the ask with clear language and emphasizing it with contrasting design elements.</p> \n<h3>13. Include personalization elements.</h3> \n<p>Consider the experience. Do your email recipients want to feel like one among hundreds of other people in your database? Or do they want a personalized experience as though you're talking directly with them?</p> \n<p>Automation helps save time, but it should never be at the cost of the experience. Marketing emails need to be personalized to the reader and contain information that is relevant to them.</p> \n<p>At the very least, swap out the \"Dear Sir/Madam\" in favor of their name using <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/website-pages/personalize-your-content\">personalization tokens</a>.</p> \n<h3>14. Always provide a way for them to opt out.</h3> \n<p>People who don't want to read your emails don't belong on your list. Keeping them only skews your open rates down and increases the number of people marketing your emails as spam. Besides, according to <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\">CAN-SPAM guidelines</a>, you should always provide a way for them to opt out of email if they no longer want to receive communications from you. Typically, this opt-out link lives in the footer of each email you send.</p> \n<h3>15. Test your emails and make sure they work on all devices.</h3> \n<p>Once your emails are built out, check them over before hitting the send button. Effective email marketing campaigns are designed for all devices on which users can read their emails -- desktop, tablet, and mobile. Consider sending them as a test to a colleague and checking them across multiple devices and email clients.</p> \n<h3>16. Monitor your metrics.</h3> \n<p>As the campaign runs, take notes.

In fact, you've probably been sending and receiving emails for years, and you've <em>definitely</em> received some questionable deliveries in your inbox.</p> \n<p>Whether they were unexpected, uninformative, or had a subject line tHaT wAs fOrmAtTeD liKe tHiS, we bet you didn't hesitate to direct them towards the trash, right?</p> \n<p>While email has managed to stand the test of time, many marketers have failed to update their strategies since its inception. So to ensure you're sending modern emails that warrant some of your recipients' precious time and attention, we've compiled a list of effective email examples to inspire your next campaign.</p> \n<h3>1. ModCloth</h3> \n<h4>Marketing Campaign: Email Preferences</h4> \n<p>Great companies are always evolving, and your customers expect to experience change. What they <em>don't</em> expect (because too many companies haven't lived up to this end of the bargain) is to be told about those changes.</p> \n<p>That said, this email from ModCloth serves as a refreshing change of pace. If you're going to change the way you communicate with a lead or customer, give them clear, fair warning so, if they aren't on board, they can make the necessary adjustments to keep their inbox clean.</p> \n<h4>Why It Works</h4> \n<p>It sets expectations for communication moving forward so that the buyer persona can choose what's best for them.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/modcloth_email_marketing.jpg?width=450&amp;name=modcloth_email_marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Modcloth - &quot;We're making changes to our email program!&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<h3>2. Tory Burch</h3> \n<h4>Marketing Campaign: Promotion</h4> \n<p>Did you see that? Did you see it move? Pretty cool, right? This small bit of animation helps to separate this email from Tory Burch from all of the immobile emails in their recipient's inboxes. They also leverage exclusivity by framing the promotion as a \"private\" sale. Oftentimes, this type of positioning makes the recipient feel like they're specially chosen, which encourages them to take advantage of the special opportunity they've been presented with.</p> \n<h4>Why It Works</h4> \n<p>Emails can get static, boring, and impersonal. This email subverts those expectations without going overboard.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tory_Burch_Private_Sale-2.gif?width=450&amp;name=Tory_Burch_Private_Sale-2.gif\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Tory Burch - Private Sale Invitation\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h3>3. RunKeeper</h3> \n<h4>Marketing Campaign: Re-Engagement Campaign</h4> \n<p>RunKeeper makes an effort to reengage lost users with this friendly, informational email. By highlighting their app's most recent changes and benefits, the copy works to entice recipients to give the app another chance. It also discusses benefits that the recipient may not know about since the last time they used the service.</p> \n<h4>Why It Works</h4> \n<p>Small inclusions like the \"Hi friend\" greeting and the \"You rock\" closing makes the content feel welcoming and less aggressive.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RunKeeper_Reengage.png?width=450&amp;name=RunKeeper_Reengage.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 450px;\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: RunKeeper - &quot;RunKeeper Elite is looking pretty fresh these days and we'd love for you to give it another try!&quot;\" width=\"450\"></p> \n<h3>4. Litmus</h3> \n<h4>Marketing Campaign: Promotion</h4> \n<p>Here's another great example of animation being used to create a more interesting email marketing design. Unlike static text, the swipe motion used to provide recipients with a look \"under the hood\" of their email tool is eye-catching and encourages you to take a deeper dive into the rest of the content. Not to mention the header does an excellent job of explicitly stating what this email is about.</p> \n<h4>Why It Works</h4> \n<p>The animation is subtle, and it's executed in a way that serves to enhance the email's body copy. Even better, it works well with the design of the email, creating a matching but contrasting focal point before the reader dives into the rest of the copy below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/litmus-1.gif?width=450&amp;name=litmus-1.gif\" alt=\"Email M arketing Campaign Example: Litmus - &quot;Tried in vain to see how that responsive design works under the hood?&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 450px;\"></p> \n<h3>5. Loft</h3> \n<h4>Marketing Campaign: Email Preferences</h4> \n<p>This email from Loft aims to demonstrate their understanding of your crazy, mixed-value inbox. In an effort to provide you with emails that you actually want to open, Loft asks that their recipients update their preferences to help them deliver a more personalized experience. This customer-focused email is super effective in making the recipient feel like their likes, dislikes, and opinions actually matter.</p> \n<h4>Why It Works</h4> \n<p>It centers the recipient's needs with the slogan \"Happy Inbox, Happy Life.\" Paired with a low-friction CTA, the copy is simple and effective.</p> \n<h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Loft_Tell_Us_About_You.jpg?width=450&amp;name=Loft_Tell_Us_About_You.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Loft - &quot;Happy Inbox, Happy Life&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></h3> \n<h3>6. UncommonGoods</h3> \n<h4>Marketing Campaign: Promotion</h4> \n<p>You've heard it a million times (and a few thousand of those times may have been from us): You should create a sense of urgency with your calls-to-action. That's what makes a lead take action, right? Well, this email from UncommonGoods succeeds in creating a sense of urgency by focusing on the <em>value</em> of acting now.</p> \n<h4>Why It Works</h4> \n<p>Instead of saying, \"Order your Mother's Day gift NOW before Preferred Shipping ends!\", this email asks, \"Don't you think Mom would've liked a faster delivery?\" Why yes, she would. Thank you for reminding me before it's too late -- I don't want to be in the dog house because my gift arrived after Mother's Day.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/uncommon_goods_email_marketing.jpg?width=450&amp;name=uncommon_goods_email_marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Uncommon Goods - &quot;Don't you think Mom would've liked a faster delivery?&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<div class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\"> \n <h3>7. JetBlue</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Customer Delight</h4> \n <p>Confession: We have a serious email marketing crush on JetBlue. And they continue to deliver their lovable marketing in this cheeky email campaign that aims to humorously reengage customers. Every element from the header, to the three witty points, to the actionable, contrasting CTA work together to create a lovable campaign that's promotional without being pushy.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>This copy is bursting with friendly personality and airline jokes. The email is relatable and reads as though it comes from a friend, which will help earn a positive reaction.</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/JetBlue_Anniversary.jpg?width=450&amp;name=JetBlue_Anniversary.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: JetBlue - &quot;It's our one year anniversary&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"hs-migrated-cms-post\"> \n <h3>8. Harpoon Brewery</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Customer Delight</h4> \n <p>My friends at Harpoon are so thoughtful, aren't they? This simple, timely email really does feel like it's coming from a friend, which is why it's so effective. In an age of email automation, it's easy for email campaigns to feel a little robotic. And while I'm certain that this email was, in fact, automated, it <em>feels</em> really human.</p> \n <p>If you're looking to strengthen the relationship you have with your existing customers, consider taking the time to set up a quick email like this to let them know you're thinking of them.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>Personalization: From the timing of the email (birthday) to the personalized salutation, this email was sent to the right person at the right time.</p> \n <h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/harpoon-brewery-email-example.jpg?width=449&amp;name=harpoon-brewery-email-example.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Harpoon Brewery - &quot;Happy Birthday Carly!&quot;\" width=\"449\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 449px;\"></h3> \n <h3>9. Rip Curl</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Promotion</h4> \n <p><em>\"JOIN THE REVOLUTION.\"</em></p> \n <p>That's quite powerful, wouldn't you agree? Rip Curl, an Australian surfing sportswear retailer, combines urgency and our psychological need to be part of something to create an email headline that jumps off the page. This positioning is designed to lead people to believe that there's a \"revolution\" taking place and it's their turn to get in on the action.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>At the end of the day, people want to be part of something that's bigger than themselves, and this email aims to motivate them to do so by purchasing this sleek watch.</p> \n <p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ripcurl.jpg?width=450&amp;name=ripcurl.jpg\" width=\"450\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 450px;\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Ripcurl - &quot;Join the revolution&quot;\"></p> \n <h3>10. J.Crew Factory</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Promotion</h4> \n <p>For many of us, when it comes to wrapping gifts, <em>the struggle is real</em>. J.Crew Factory recognized this problem and then created this email to serve as a solution for those incapable of pulling off a Pinterest-esque wrap job: gift cards. The email offers up two different ways to pick up a gift card -- in store or online -- in an effort to avoid excluding anyone.</p> \n <p>They've also included a map of the nearest store location at the end of the email to lower the purchasing barrier even further.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>It combines humor with a low-stress, low-friction solution.</p> \n <p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/JCrew_Gift_Card_Email.jpg?width=450&amp;name=JCrew_Gift_Card_Email.jpg\" width=\"450\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 450px;\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: J.Crew Factory - &quot;If your wrapping looks like this, you may want to get them a giftcard&quot;\"></p> \n <h3>11. charity: water</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Engagement</h4> \n <p>When people talk about email marketing, lots of them forget to mention transactional emails. These are the automated emails you get in your inbox after taking a certain action on a website. This could be anything from filling out a form to purchasing a product to updating you on the progress of your order. Often, these are plain text emails that marketers set and forget.</p> \n <p>Well, charity: water took an alternate route. Once someone donates to a charity: water project, her money takes a long journey. Most charities don't tell you about that journey at all -- charity: water uses automated emails to show donors how their money is making an impact over time. With the project timeline and accompanying table, you don't even really need to read the email -- you know immediately where you are in the whole process so you can move onto other things in your inbox.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>It keeps the audience engaged and shows the impact that their actions have made on the organization in the effort of staying top-of-mind and increasing future participation.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2560593787-png/charity-water-email-example-1.png?noresize&amp;width=450&amp;name=charity-water-email-example-1.png\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: charity.water - &quot;Progress Update&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>12. Brooks Sports</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Engagement</h4> \n <p>When Desiree Linden won the 2018 Boston Marathon, she became the first American woman to win the race in more than 30 years. To her shoe and apparel sponsor, Brooks Sports, it was an opportunity to celebrate their long partnership together. The resulting email campaign focuses almost entirely on the Olympic marathoner's amazing accomplishment.</p> \n <p>Email campaigns like this one allow companies to demonstrate their loyalties and add value to the products their best users have chosen. Not pictured is a blue CTA button at the bottom of the email that reads, \"See Desiree's go-to gear.\" What better products to call attention to than the stuff worn by America's latest legend?</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>After Desiree's victory, everyone knew her name. Brooks Sports struck while the iron was hot with a proud email that was sure to be opened and forwarded.</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brooks-running-des-linden-email-marketing-campaign.jpg?width=388&amp;name=brooks-running-des-linden-email-marketing-campaign.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Brooks Sports - &quot;Boston 2018 - One for the History Books&quot;\" width=\"388\" style=\"width: 388px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n <h3>13. Uber</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Engagement</h4> \n <p>The beauty of Uber's emails is in their simplicity. Email subscribers are alerted to deals and promotions with emails like the one you see below. We love how brief the initial description is, paired with a very clear CTA -- perfect for subscribers who are quickly skimming the email.</p> \n <p>For the people who want to learn more, these are followed by a more detailed (but still pleasingly simple), step-by-step explanation of how the deal works.</p> \n <p>We also love how consistent the design of Uber's emails is with its brand. Like its app, website, social media photos, and other parts of the visual branding, the emails are represented by bright colors and geometric patterns.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>All of its communications and marketing assets tell the brand's story -- and brand consistency is one tactic Uber's nailed in order to gain brand loyalty.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/uber-email-campaign.jpg?width=450&amp;name=uber-email-campaign.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Uber - &quot;Connect your calendar, streamline your schedule&quot;\" width=\"450\" title=\"uber-email-campaign.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>14. TheSkimm</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Customer Delight</h4> \n <p>We love TheSkimm's daily newsletter -- especially its clean design and its short, punchy paragraphs. But newsletters aren't TheSkimm's only strength when it comes to email. Check out its subscriber engagement email below, which rewarded one of their subscribers for being subscribed for two years.</p> \n <p>Emails triggered by milestones, like anniversaries and birthdays, are fun to get -- who doesn't like to celebrate a special occasion? The beauty of anniversary emails, in particular, is that they don't require subscribers to input any extra data, and they can work for a variety of senders. Plus, the timeframe can be modified based on the business model.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>The folks at TheSkimm took it a step further by asking Mineo if she'd like to earn the title of brand ambassador as a loyal subscriber -- which would require her to share the link with ten friends, of course.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/the-skimm-email-example.png?noresize&amp;width=450&amp;name=the-skimm-email-example.png\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: TheSkimm - &quot;Happy Skimmversary&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>15. Mom and Dad Money</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Questionnaire</h4> \n <p>Think you know all about the people who are reading your marketing emails? How much of what you \"know\" about them is based on assumptions? The strongest buyer personas are based on insights you gather from your actual readership, through surveys, interviews, and so on -- in addition to the market research.</p> \n <p>That's exactly what Matt Becker of Mom and Dad Money does -- and he does it very, very well.</p> \n <p>Here's an example of an email I once received from this brand. Design-wise, it's nothing special -- but that's the point. It reads just like an email from a friend or colleague asking for a quick favor.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>Not only was this initial email great, but his response to my answers was even better: Within a few days of responding to the questionnaire, I received a long and detailed personal email from Matt thanking me for filling out the questionnaire and offering a <em>ton </em>of helpful advice and links to resources specifically catered to my answers. I was very impressed by his business acumen, communication skills, and obvious dedication to his readers.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/matt-becker-email-example.png?noresize&amp;width=450&amp;name=matt-becker-email-example.png\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Mom and Dad Money - &quot;can you help me real quick?&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>16. Birchbox</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Promotion</h4> \n <p>The subject line of this email from beauty product subscription service Birchbox got my colleague <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamelavaughan\">Pam Vaughan</a> clicking. It read: \"We Forgot Something in Your February Box!\" Of course, if you read the email copy below, Birchbox didn't actually forget to put that discount code in her box -- but it was certainly a clever way to get her attention.</p> \n <p>As it turned out, the discount code was actually a bonus promo for Rent the Runway, a dress rental company that likely fits the interest profile of most Birchbox customers -- which certainly didn't disappoint. That's a great co-marketing partnership right there.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>It gained her attention and delivered some unexpected delight.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/birchbox-email-example.jpg?width=450&amp;name=birchbox-email-example.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Birchbox - &quot;Oops!&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>17. Postmates</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Promotion</h4> \n <p>I have to say, I'm a sucker for GIFs. They're easy to consume, they catch your eye, and they have an emotional impact -- like the fun GIF in one of Postmates' emails that's not only delightful to watch, but also makes you crave some delicious Chipotle.</p> \n <p>You, too, can use animated GIFs in your marketing to show a fun header, draw people's eyes to a certain part of the email, or display your products and services in action.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>It centers the product in a fun, attractive way.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chipotle-gif.gif?width=450&amp;name=chipotle-gif.gif\" alt=\"Email Campaign Example: Animated Nachos Gif\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/postmates-email-example.png?noresize&amp;width=450&amp;name=postmates-email-example.png\" alt=\"Email Campaign Example: Postmates - &quot;What do you call a tortilla chip that works out? A macho nacho.&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>18. Dropbox</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Re-Engagement</h4> \n <p>You might think it'd be hard to love an email from a company whose product you haven't been using. But Dropbox found a way to make its \"come back to us!\" email cute and funny, thanks to a pair of whimsical cartoons and an emoticon.</p> \n <p>Plus, the email was kept short and sweet, to emphasize the message that Dropox didn't want to intrude -- it just wants to remind the recipient that the brand exists, and why it could be helpful. When sending these types of email, you might include an incentive for recipients to come back to using your service, like a limited-time coupon.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>It uses the Dropbox logo in a way that's creative and unique to demonstrate their product as a solution.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2562063987-png/dropbox-email-example.png?width=450&amp;name=dropbox-email-example.png\" alt=\"Email Campaign Example: Dropbox - &quot;Recently your Dropbox has been feeling kind of lonely&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>19. InVision App</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Newsletter</h4> \n <p>Every week, the folks at InVision send a roundup of their best blog content, their favorite design links from the week, and a new opportunity to win a free t-shirt. (Seriously. They give away a new design every week.) They also sometimes have fun survey questions where they crowdsource for their blog. This week's, for example, asked subscribers what they would do if the internet didn't exist.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>Not only is InVision's newsletter a great mix of content, but I also love the nice balance between images and text, making it really easy to read and mobile-friendly -- which is especially important, because its newsletters are so long (below is just an excerpt). We like the clever copy on the call-to-action (CTA) buttons, too.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/invision-email-example.jpg?width=450&amp;name=invision-email-example.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Invision - &quot;Designing with your developer in mind&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>20. Cook Smarts</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Newsletter</h4> \n <p>I've been a huge fan of Cook Smarts' \"Weekly Eats\" newsletter for a while. The company sends yummy recipes in the form of a meal plan to my inbox every week. But I didn't just include it because of its delicious recipes -- I'm truly a fan of its emails.</p> \n <p>I especially love the layout of Cook Smarts' emails: Each message features three distinct sections: one for the menu, one for kitchen how-to's, and one for the tips. That means you don't have to go hunting to find the most interesting part of its blog posts -- you know exactly where to look after an email or two.</p> \n <p>I also love Cook Smarts' \"Forward to a Friend\" CTA in the top-right of the email.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>Emails are super shareable over -- you guessed it -- email, so you should also think about reminding your subscribers to forward your emails to friends, family, or coworkers.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cooksmart-email-example.jpg?width=450&amp;name=cooksmart-email-example.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Cook Smarts - &quot;Weekly Eats&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>21. HireVue</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Email Preferences</h4> \n <p>\"Saying goodbye is never easy to do… So, we thought we’d give you a chance to rethink things.\" That was the subject of this automated unsubscribe email from HireVue. We love the simple, guilt-free messaging here, from the funny header images to the great CTA button copy.</p> \n <p>Not only are the design and copy here top-notch, but we applaud the folks at HireVue for sending automated unsubscribe emails in the first place. It's smart to purge your subscriber lists of folks who aren't opening your email lists, because low open rates can seriously hurt email deliverability.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>The button copy is a pattern interrupt that will prompt the recipient to pause and think if they want to take the action.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hirevue-unsubscribe-email-example.jpg?width=450&amp;name=hirevue-unsubscribe-email-example.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Hirevue - &quot;Don't Let Me Go&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>22. Paperless Post</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Promotion</h4> \n <p>When you think of \"holiday email marketing,\" your mind might jump straight to Christmas, but there are other holidays sprinkled throughout the rest of the year that you can create campaigns around. (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/email-marketing-planning-template?utm_campaign=Marketing%20Blog%20-%20Internal%20Links%20%5BSeptember%5D&amp;utm_medium=15%20of%20the%20Best%20Email%20Marketing%20Campaign%20Examples%20You%27ve%20Ever%20Seen&amp;utm_source=Blog\">Download these email marketing planning templates to keep yourself organized throughout the year.</a>)</p> \n <p>Take the email below from Paperless Post, for example. I love the header of this email: It provides a clear CTA that includes a sense of urgency. Then, the subheader asks a question that forces recipients to think to themselves, \"Wait, when is Mother's Day again? <em>Did </em>I buy Mom a card?\"</p> \n <p>Below this copy, the simple grid design is both easy to scan and quite visually appealing. Each card picture is a CTA in and of itself -- click on any one of them, and you'll be taken to a purchase page.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>It earns a positive sentiment by prompting the recipient to do something they may have forgotten (send a card). This provides a solution and saves the recipient the pain of feeling guilty about forgetting Mother's Day.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/paperless-post-email-example.jpg?width=450&amp;name=paperless-post-email-example.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Paperless Post - &quot;You didn't forget Mother's Day, did you?&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>23. Stitcher</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Engagement</h4> \n <p>I love on-demand podcast/radio show app Stitcher's \"Recommended For You\" emails. I tend to listen to episodes from the same podcast instead of branching out to new ones. But Stitcher wants me to discover (and subscribe to) all the <em>other</em> awesome content it has -- and I probably wouldn't without this encouragement.</p> \n <p>I think this email also makes quite a brilliant use of responsive design. The colors are bright, and it's not too hard to scroll and click -- notice the CTAs are large enough for me to hit with my thumbs. Also, the mobile email actually has features that make sense for recipients who are on their mobile device. Check out the CTA at the bottom of the email, for example: The \"Open Stitcher Radio\" button prompts the app to open on your phone.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>As humans, we tend to crave personalized experiences. So when emails appear to be created especially for you, you feel special -- you’re not just getting what everyone else is getting. You might even feel like the company sending you the email knows you in some way, and that it cares about your preferences and making you happy.</p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/stitcher-email-example.jpg?width=256&amp;name=stitcher-email-example.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Stitcher - &quot;Recommended for you&quot;\" width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>24. RCN</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Update</h4> \n <p>Internet providers and bad weather are natural enemies. You'd think telecommunications companies wouldn't want to call attention to storm-induced power outages -- the one thing that sets off customers' impatience. Then, there's RCN.</p> \n <p>RCN, a cable and wireless internet service, turned this email marketing campaign into a weather forecast just for its customers. This \"storm update\" got the company out ahead of an event that threatened its service, while allowing its users to get the weather updates they need right from the company they count on for Wi-Fi.</p> \n <p>As you can see below, the email even advises personal safety -- a nice touch of care to go with the promise of responsive service. At the bottom of the email, RCN also took the opportunity to highlight its social media channels, which the company appropriately uses to keep users informed of network outages.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>It simply offers an update. No promoting, no selling. The recipient's best interests are in mind, and they're setting expectations for something that they may imminently care about.</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rcn-email-marketing-campaign.png?width=450&amp;name=rcn-email-marketing-campaign.png\" alt=\"Email Marketing Example: RCN - &quot;RCN is preparing for winter storm Quinn&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <h3>25. Trulia</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Newsletter</h4> \n <p>I'm a huge advocate of thought leadership. To me, some of the best companies gain customer loyalty by becoming the go-to source for expertise on a given topic. Trulia -- a property search engine for buyers, sellers, and renters -- is that expert in the real estate biz. How do I know? Just read their emails, much like the one below.</p> \n <p>\"Why aren't millennials moving?\" The subject line of this email campaign reads before citing interesting data about relocation trends in the U.S. Trulia doesn't benefit from people who choose not to move, but the company <em>does</em> benefit from having its fingers on the pulse of the industry -- and showing it cares which way the real estate winds are blowing.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>It opens a loop by posing a question that the recipient needs to take action to get the answer to.</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/trulia-email-marketing-campaign-1.png?width=450&amp;name=trulia-email-marketing-campaign-1.png\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: Trulia - &quot;Younger Americans Aren't Moving Like They Used To - What's Changed?&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n <h3>26. RedBubble</h3> \n <h4>Marketing Campaign: Promotion</h4> \n <p>This email marketing campaign crushes it, and for so many reasons.</p> \n <p>Not only is the design below super eye-catching -- without looking cluttered -- but the artwork is user-made. RedBubble sells merchandise featuring designs from artists all over the world. This presents a golden opportunity to feature popular submissions across the RedBubble community.</p> \n <p>The example below showcases artwork from \"Letter Shoppe,\" and when that artist sees RedBubble featuring her content, she's more likely to forward it to friends and colleagues.</p> \n <p>In addition to linking to Letter Shoppe's designs (available on merchandise that is ultimately sold by RedBubble), the email campaign includes an endearing quote by the Featured Artist: <em>\"Never compromise on your values, and only do work you want to get more of.\"</em> RedBubble's customers are likely to agree -- and open other emails in this campaign for more inspiring quotes.</p> \n <h4>Why It Works</h4> \n <p>The email lets the items speak for themselves, showcasing them as art rather than products.</p> \n <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/redbubble-email-marketing-campaign.jpg?width=450&amp;name=redbubble-email-marketing-campaign.jpg\" alt=\"Email Marketing Campaign Example: RedBubble - &quot;Featured Artist: Letter Shoppe&quot;\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n <p>These are just some of our favorite emails. Don't just follow best practices when it comes to your marketing emails. Every email you send from your work email address also can be optimized to convert with a little planning.</p> \n <p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in October 2013 and has been

Please note that, with these methods, it’s essential to allow people to opt-in to receiving additional emails from your company, as some may not be interested.</p> \n<h2>39 Creative List Building Techniques</h2> \n<h3>How To Grow Your Email List Using Email</h3> \n<h4>1. Create unique email content.</h4> \n<p>Want to retain your current subscribers and have them help you grow your list? Create unique<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email-hosting?_ga=2.185337515.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">&nbsp;email content</a>. If your emails are entertaining, informative, and valuable, recipients will always look forward to receiving them and will be more likely to forward them to their networks. This helps you gain exposure and obtain additional subscribers.</p> \n<h4>2. Encourage subscribers to share and forward your emails.</h4> \n<p>Include social sharing buttons and an “Email to a Friend” button on your marketing emails. By doing this, you’ll gain access to recipients' friends, colleagues, and networks to expand your contact list. At the bottom of your emails, include a “Subscribe” CTA as a simple text-based link so that the people receiving the forwarded emails can easily opt-in too.</p> \n<h4>3. Segment your email lists by buyer persona.</h4> \n<p>Email recipients are more likely to click through emails that cater to their specific interests, so using varying types of email subscriptions to send targeted content to different <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates?_ga=2.185337515.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">segments of your audience</a>&nbsp;is worth considering.</p> \n<p>If you create multiple targeted subscriber types, you’ll increase the chance that visitors will subscribe to one of them. In fact, marketers who used segmented campaigns noted as much as a <a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-new-rules/\">760% increase in revenue</a>.</p> \n<h4>4. Reinvigorate a stale email list with an opt-in campaign.</h4> \n<p>Do you have an older list that you suspect is mostly decayed? Create an engaging opt-in message and send it to your old list and encourage contacts to re-opt in if they’d like to, but also promising to remove all contacts who don’t respond.</p> \n<p>Though it may seem counterintuitive to remove folks from your email list to grow them, emailing contacts that you know are engaged can improve your deliverability and increase the odds of your email being shared with those outside your current database.</p> \n<h4>5. Add an opt-in link to your employees' signatures.</h4> \n<p>Hyperlinked email signatures can lead people to a landing page where they can sign up for your mailing list. Plus, if you’re already in a natural email conversation with them, subscribing to more emails can be a natural next step.</p> \n<h3>How To Grow Your Email List With New Content</h3> \n<h4>6. Create a new lead-generation offer.</h4> \n<p>Create a new <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ungated-content-free?_ga=2.185337515.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">gated</a>&nbsp;lead-generation offer, like a free <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ebook-templates?_ga=2.185337515.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">ebook</a>, and host it on a landing page that asks visitors to provide their email to download it.</p> \n<h4>7. Create a free online tool or resource that requires sign-up.</h4> \n<p>Free online tools make your users' lives easier, especially if all they have to do is sign up with their email address. For example, we've created quite a few free tools, like <a href=\"https://website.grader.com/\">Website Grader</a>, to gather email addresses.</p> \n<h4>8. Create additional bonus content.</h4> \n<p>Not all gated content is worth it to a website visitor. Sometimes, to gain their interest, you need to give them free content first. You can begin with a blog post that offers beginner advice on a subject, then offer additional bonus content with more advanced tips that they can access by submitting their email address via a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/landing-pages?_ga=2.185337515.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">landing page</a>.</p> \n<h3>How To Grow Your Email List Using Social Media</h3> \n<h4>9. Promote an online contest.</h4> \n<p>Use your social media accounts to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33352/everything-you-need-to-run-a-successful-social-media-contest.aspx\">host a free giveaway</a>&nbsp;that requires contact information to enter. You can encourage your followers to click through to your website and sign up using their email addresses.</p> \n<h4>10. Promote a lead gen offer on Twitter.</h4> \n<p>Create a Twitter campaign to promote an ebook or free resource to your followers that requires using an email address to redeem.</p> \n<h4>11. Use Pinterest to promote gated visual content.</h4> \n<p>Pinterest plays host to visual content that encourages visitors to sign up to see more content.

If you create a high-quality graphic that highlights and calls attention to its value, you can entice users to submit their email to gain further benefit from the content you offer.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource: </strong><strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/templates-shareable-graphics-social-media?_ga=2.116482820.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">Five Free Facebook Cover Photo Templates</a></strong></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/templates-shareable-graphics-social-media?_ga=2.69870610.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-templates-1.png?width=452&amp;name=social-templates-1.png\" alt=\"social-templates-1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 452px;\" width=\"452\">Get These Customizable Templates</a></p> \n<p>If you do this, you should also consider leveraging our next tip, making it easy for users to seamlessly submit their emails once you’ve attracted their attention.</p> \n<h4>13. Add a call-to-action button to the top of your Business’s Facebook page.</h4> \n<p>The value of this list-building technique is in the destination: add a CTA button to your Facebook page that links users to your sign-up landing page or a gated featured resource that requires email access. We added CTAs to our HubSpot Academy Facebook page, as displayed in the image below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot%20academy%20facebook.jpg?width=2108&amp;name=hubspot%20academy%20facebook.jpg\" alt=\"hubspot academy facebook profile page with sign up CTA button\" width=\"2108\" style=\"width: 2108px;\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/hubspotacademy\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><em>Image Source</em></span></a></p> \n<p>In addition, placing a sign-up CTA button within your profile makes it easier for users, as they won’t need to leave Facebook and go to your site — they simply click the link, and you take them there.</p> \n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/977869848936797\">a guide</a>&nbsp;from Facebook on how to add one to your profile.</p> \n<h4>14. Share newsletter previews on your profile.</h4> \n<p>Creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-post-ideas?_ga=2.116482820.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">Facebook post</a>&nbsp;that showcases a snippet of your email newsletter is a great way to attract your audiences and entice them to join your email list. They’ll get a preview of what you have to offer, become eager to learn more, and sign up to continue generating value from your business. Within this post, you can include a link to your sign-up page for easy and quick sign-up.</p> \n<h4>15. Promote content through Facebook that requires an email address to access.</h4> \n<p>Promote content in your Facebook posts that encourage email submission to access. This content can be something like a gated ebook, joining a giveaway or contest, or even saying that email subscribers get early access to new products.</p> \n<p>Be sure to add social sharing buttons to your landing and thank-you pages to encourage your leads to share within their networks.</p> \n<h3>How To Grow Your Email List Using YouTube</h3> \n<h4>16. Add engagement features to your YouTube videos.</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-end-screen?_ga=2.69870610.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">End screens</a>, also called video outros, are a tool that YouTube offers creators to direct viewers to take additional action after finishing a video, like clicking on a link to your website or watching another video on your channel. As they are used to generate further engagement from your viewers, it’s worth considering adding hyperlinks to your sign-up landing page in your end cards to grow your email list.</p> \n<p>This tip is beneficial if you have created an informative video with mostly surface-level content. A more advanced view is provided in a gated offer or your email newsletter.</p> \n<h4>17. Use your header and images to promote your email newsletter.</h4> \n<p>Capture leads by placing a link to your sign-up landing page in your channel header. This image is front and center on your profile, and if your <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-templates\">banner is eye-catching</a>, well designed, and calls attention to your content offer, users will be drawn to it, which places the CTA link in their direct line of sight.</p> \n<p>The red arrow in the image below points to a CTA on the HubSpot Academy YouTube page that leads users to a course enrollment offer that requires an email to sign up.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot%20academy%20youtube.jpg?width=2306&amp;name=hubspot%20academy%20youtube.jpg\" alt=\"hubspot academy youtube channel sign up link CTA\" width=\"2306\" style=\"width: 2306px;\"></p> \n<h4>18. Promote your emails in your video descriptions.</h4> \n<p>Your YouTube video descriptions talk about the content within your videos, so viewers know what they’re about to watch. Each of your descriptions will likely contain unique elements, but it’s worth plugging your email sign-up landing page link within each of them.</p> \n<p>This tip can be especially useful if you create how-to style videos, and you can entice users to sign up for more informative content and instruction by clicking the link in your description.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource: </strong><strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-templates\">7 YouTube Description Templates [Free Prompts]</a></strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-templates\"><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube%20description%20template.png?width=444&amp;name=youtube%20description%20template.png\" alt=\"free youtube description template\" width=\"444\" style=\"width: 444px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></strong></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-templates\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Download These Customizable Prompts</a></p> \n<h3>How To Grow Your Email List Using Instagram</h3> \n<h4>19. Add a call to action to your Instagram bio.</h4> \n<p>Your Instagram bio is a great place to share information with your audience, like a CTA that calls attention to your email list and a link to your sign-up form.</p> \n<p>Your CTA text should entice users by explaining the benefit they get from signing up, like obtaining bonus info, access to exclusive offers, or a general business newsletter. Placing the link directly in your bio also reduces customer effort, as they can simply click and sign up in a pop-up window within the app.</p> \n<h4>20. Share posts that lead users to click the call-to-action email link in your bio.</h4> \n<p>While you may not share posts that outright say “Give us your email,” you can certainly see success from sharing posts that entice users to share their contact info.</p> \n<p>For example, you can advertise a giveaway and let users know that they can enter by clicking the link in your bio and submitting their email addresses. In another case, if you post an informative video about how to use your products, you can entice users to sign up because your emails will offer more informational content about how to use your products.</p> \n<h4>21. Use the swipe-up feature to share your landing page.</h4> \n<p>If you have an Instagram Business profile and more than 10k followers, you can add a clickable link to your Stories that users can access by swiping up on the story.</p> \n<p>This feature is an excellent opportunity to share a link to your sign-up page or another offer on your site that collects email addresses in exchange for value, like a free trial. You can also use this feature to link to something like an informative blog post with a lead generation offer that your audience will be excited to sign up for.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource: </strong><strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-templates-for-business?_ga=2.117640203.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">8 Instagram Story Templates</a></strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram%20story.jpg?width=373&amp;name=instagram%20story.jpg\" alt=\"sample instagram story swipe up template\" width=\"373\" style=\"width: 373px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/instagram-templates-for-business\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Download These Free Templates</a></p> \n<h4>22. Add an email button to your business profile.</h4> \n<p>A more direct way to get user emails is to add an email button to your business page. This tool is primarily used for service needs so that customers can reach out to you for support inquiries. Still, it gives you the opportunity for further lead nurturing by asking if customers want to opt-in to receiving more emails.</p> \n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/1419650861499317\">a guide</a>&nbsp;on how to add one to your profile.</p> \n<h3>How To Grow Your Email List Using LinkedIn</h3> \n<h4>23. Send readers to a landing page for email sign-up.</h4> \n<p>After having conversations on LinkedIn, you can share links to your sign-up pages. You’re allowing users to continue the interaction you’ve just had, as your email will provide them with further high-quality information and content related to your business. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>You can send these links in InMail messages, comment threads, and personal 1:1 direct messages.</p> \n<h4>24. Post about your email newsletter.</h4> \n<p>If you have an email newsletter, you can post snippets of its content on LinkedIn and let users know that, if they sign up, they’ll get access to the entire piece and every newsletter from there on out.</p> \n<h4>25. Publish links to gated offers.</h4> \n<p>When you share a post on LinkedIn that contains high-quality information your audience can benefit from, round it out by encouraging users to sign up for your email list. If what you’ve said has resonated with them, they’ll recognize that receiving emails from you will give them additional access to the high-quality content you offer.</p> \n<p>You can also do this in appropriate and relevant LinkedIn group discussions — just be mindful of the topic being discussed to ensure your offer is a welcome addition to the conversation.</p> \n<h3>How To Grow Your Email List On Your Website</h3> \n<h4>26. Ask website visitors for feedback</h4> \n<p>People enjoy offering feedback on information that pertains to them. On your site pages, include a form that asks visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collect email addresses to follow up with them.</p> \n<h4>27. Shorten the length of your lead-capturing forms</h4> \n<p>It’s tempting to collect as much information on a user as possible right away, but adding too many fields to your landing pages and lead-capturing forms can drive people away. Reduce the length of your forms to just two to three fields — you can collect more information from them once you start a conversation.</p> \n<h4>28. Link to offers across your website that capture email signups</h4> \n<p>Create CTAs that link to your offers across your website that captures email sign-ups. Some key places to consider include your website’s homepage, your ‘About Us’ page, and your ‘Contact Us’ page.</p> \n<h4>29. A/B test different campaign copy</h4> \n<p>You might be doing all the right things to generate leads — landing pages, gated content, contests, and more, but not seeing the success you’re looking for. The problem may be that the design or copy itself isn’t driving the engagement you need.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-a-b-testing?_ga=2.117640203.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">A/B test </a>different aspects of your list-building campaigns with different versions of the same content. This includes the call-to-action text, the color of the gated offer, and even where these sign-up forms are placed on your website. Sometimes a small change can drive hundreds more conversions. &nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource: </strong><strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit\">The Complete A/B Testing Kit</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/a_b%20testing-1.jpg?width=414&amp;name=a_b%20testing-1.jpg\" alt=\"free A/B testing kit cover page\" width=\"414\" style=\"width: 414px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><br></strong></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Download the Free Kit</a></p> \n<h4>30. Create a blog that readers can subscribe to.</h4> \n<p>If you don’t already blog, you should. Blog posts help you increase your ranking on search engines and generate blog subscribers to upgrade to more actionable email campaigns over time.</p> \n<h4>31. Guest blog for other websites and share a call-to-action.</h4> \n<p>There are many websites and publishers out there that cater to your audience — and larger portions of it. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guest-blogging?_ga=2.70528018.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">Guest blogging</a>&nbsp;for these websites helps you expand your contact list through exposure to a new audience.</p> \n<p>When you create guest blogging content, include a CTA for readers to subscribe to your sites’ blog or email newsletter.</p> \n<h4>32. Include customer reviews on your sign-up landing pages.</h4> \n<p>It’s one thing for you to tell people to sign up for a campaign, but it’s another thing for your happiest customers to say it too. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-reviews-testimonials?_ga=2.70528018.302710988.1623444582-1034280639.1623444582\">Customer reviews</a>&nbsp;are the social proof that encourages people to join in on something, and you should publish these reviews on your website, especially landing pages with sign-up forms. Including reviews will add genuine value to your content when people are on the fence about submitting contact information.</p> \n<h3>How To Grow Your Email List With a Partner</h3> \n<h4>33. Run a promotion on a partner website or email newsletter.</h4> \n<p>Similar to guest blogging, partner websites can help you target a new audience. Use this partner source to direct visitors to your website, where you’re already sharing sign-up forms.</p> \n<h4>34. Host a co-marketing offer with a partner.</h4> \n<p>Creating an ebook or webinar with a partner can split up the work of content creation and allow you to share the audience of a similar business. After you release your content, split the leads you generate with your partner.</p> \n<p>Creating an ebook or webinar with a partner can split up the work of content creation and allow you to share the audience of a similar business. If the content is gated, you’ll collect email addresses from a new audience for nurturing.</p> \n<h3>How To Grow Your Email List With Traditional Marketing</h3> \n<h4>35. Collect email addresses at a trade show.</h4> \n<p>Offline events like trade shows are highly anticipated growth opportunities for professionals in your industry. Demo your latest product at an appropriate conference and collect signups in person.</p> \n<p>Once you’re back at the office, import these signups into your contact database, and be sure to send a welcome email that confirms their opt-in to your list.</p> \n<h4>36. Host your own offline, in-person events.</h4> \n<p>Meetups, seminars, hackathons, educational panels, and your conferences place you front and center of a networking event. Those who attend are often more qualified to be contacted because they came to your event. Take the opportunity to collect email addresses from attendees, and send a welcome email and encourage opt-in.</p> \n<h4>37. Host an online webinar.</h4> \n<p>Webinars are the perfect opportunity to talk about your industry and access the audience of thought leaders that you may want to present with. The best part? Webinars are normally registered for via email, so you have audience emails to add to your list for further nurturing upon registration.</p> \n<h4>38. Add QR codes to your display ad.</h4> \n<p>Incorporate a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29449/how-to-create-a-qr-code-in-4-quick-steps.aspx\">QR code</a> into your print marketing collateral that people can scan for more information on the printer content. You can set it so that your codes require email addresses to access additional content so that you can grow your list.</p> \n<h4>39. Collect emails in-store.</h4> \n<p>If you have a brick-and-mortar store where you interact with customers face-to-face, launch a store membership that they can sign up for via email at the register. You can create an email campaign designated to walk-in customers, which can help you keep in touch and reward loyalty to your product.</p> \n<p>The examples above are all things you can do to increase your business’s email list. The best way to do so is to leverage multiple strategies on this list, helping you reach your audiences from a wide variety of angles and increase the chances of growing your list.</p> \n<p>As you grow your email list with fresh, opt-in contacts, you'll be able to nurture them with middle-of-the-funnel offers that allow you to convert early-stage leads into sales-ready leads.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b229b0b2-204e-4bdf-9079-572da882b84d&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b229b0b2-204e-4bdf-9079-572da882b84d.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F32028%2F25-clever-ways-to-grow-your-email-marketing-list.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/53e8428a-29a5-4225-a6ea-bca8ef991c19.png","linkMd5":"026f41a80f50d0b937b6c52e11106b65","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn38@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-555_717deba97acb3439.webp","destWidth":653,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6873,"destBytes":10226,"author":"apitre@hubspot.com (Andy Pitre)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/53e8428a-29a5-4225-a6ea-bca8ef991c19.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn38@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-555_717deba97acb3439.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Pinterest-Templates-Cover.jpg?width=474&name=Pinterest-Templates-Cover.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-49-773_51069d7851e212f3.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-templates-1.png?width=452&name=social-templates-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn73@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-52-452_6b21a37102467df1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot%20academy%20facebook.jpg?width=2108&name=hubspot%20academy%20facebook.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn1@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-50-541_e54d2c10b382fd1b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot%20academy%20youtube.jpg?width=2306&name=hubspot%20academy%20youtube.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-50-124_f6641bb0ce7128e9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/youtube%20description%20template.png?width=444&name=youtube%20description%20template.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn95@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-51-170_c6d568c72a0f843c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram%20story.jpg?width=373&name=instagram%20story.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn9@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-50-955_59157553abd37c37.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/a_b%20testing-1.jpg?width=414&name=a_b%20testing-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn2@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-53-268_ae8fc4a18002669f.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b229b0b2-204e-4bdf-9079-572da882b84d.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn65@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-51-747_314ba14066d2faeb.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F32028%2F25-clever-ways-to-grow-your-email-marketing-list.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn99@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-52-124_dc7e4e15d6fa6fc3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938154},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"20 of the Best Infographic Examples to Inspire Your Next Design","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-infographics-2016","description":"<p>There's a lot to like about well-designed infographics — whether it’s the beautiful typography, concise messaging, clever layouts, or bold graphics.</p> \n<p>Not to mention that people retain <a href=\"http://brainrules.net/vision/\">65% of information passed along with an image</a> compared to only 10% when they listen to the same piece of information.</p> \n<p>As the fourth most-used type of content marketing, infographics pop up all over the place — from social media posts to whitepapers.

You also don’t have to strain your eyes to read the text, as it's big enough to read from afar.</p> \n<h4>3. <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/106161273/Infographic-style/modules/609149733\">A Purposeful Life</a>, by Studio Patten</h4> \n<p>This free infographic from Studio Patten collects different survey results concerning living a purposeful life and presents the data with visually appealing charts.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/a-purposeful-life.jpg?width=597&amp;name=a-purposeful-life.jpg\" alt=\"infographic for living a purposeful life\" width=\"597\" style=\"width: 597px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Although the topic of a purposeful life might be a deep one, this infographic does a great job of presenting the information simply.</p> \n<p>There’s also a nice balance between the use of text and data visualization elements.</p> \n<h4>4. <a href=\"https://www.towerelectricbikes.com/most-bike-friendly-cities\">The Most and Least Bike-Friendly Cities In America</a>, by Tower Electric Bikes</h4> \n<p>Knowing whether a city is bike-friendly or not is a factor cyclists consider when moving.</p> \n<p>Naturally, questions about the city’s bike lanes, cyclist fatality rates, and the number of people using bikes would come up in a cyclist’s mind. Tower Electric Bikes answers these questions using this simple infographic.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/bike-friendly-cities.jpg?width=601&amp;name=bike-friendly-cities.jpg\" alt=\"infographic of bike friendly cities\" width=\"601\" style=\"width: 601px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>To make sense of the infographic, Tower Electric Bikes used color gradation (going from green to red) to help its audience of cyclists understand how friendly the different cities in the United States are.</p> \n<p>Cyclists can take a look and tell they’d need to avoid the Los Angeles areas if they want to enjoy sunny days out on their bikes.</p> \n<h4>5. <a href=\"https://ivypanda.com/blog/how-to-actually-enjoy-studying/\">How to Enjoy Studying</a>, by IvyPanda</h4> \n<p>Studying doesn’t always have to be a chore. IvyPanda created this excellent infographic design to help students enjoy studying instead of feeling burned out or turning to social media because of boredom.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/enjoy-studying.jpg?width=447&amp;name=enjoy-studying.jpg\" alt=\"infographic on how to enjoy studying\" width=\"447\" style=\"width: 447px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>The use of bright colors and minimalist animated design is brilliant from IvyPanda.</p> \n<h3>Business Infographic Examples</h3> \n<h4>6. <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/blog/smb-sales-teams-keeping-2020/\">How SMB Sales Teams Are Keeping Up in 2020</a>, by Zendesk</h4> \n<p>We all know 2020 led to massive changes in the way we work, buy, and enjoy leisure time. But this infographic by Zendesk hones in on a specific group (SMB sales teams) to show how they keep up with the times.</p> \n<p>Through research-backed data, clear visuals, and concise copy, the main point comes across crystal clear: Know customers' expectations to meet them where they are.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SMB-sales-teams.jpg?width=604&amp;name=SMB-sales-teams.jpg\" alt=\"an infographic on SMB sales teams\" width=\"604\" style=\"width: 604px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>This infographic does an excellent job following one theme, from start to finish. Readers can answer \"<em>What's the point?</em>\" within the first few sentences — a best practice, according to <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/infographic-best-practices/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">CoSchedule</a>.</p> \n<p>This helps focus your infographic and avoids cramming too much information into one piece, which is why Zendesk flowed from the research and stats to how SMB sales teams adopt new technology to keep up.</p> \n<p>It even includes the benefits of<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/crm/e010a?\"> CRM technology</a>, like a 52% increase in productivity from sales reps. Of course, the benefits align with the customer service software Zendesk offers, making the infographic a good sales tool for its team.</p> \n<h4>7. <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/en-uk/marketing-solutions/blog/posts/content-marketing-in-times-of-uncertainty/2020/Infographic-How-has-2020-affected-your-content-strategy\">Content Marketing in Times of Uncertainty</a>, by LinkedIn</h4> \n<p>More than eight out of 10 people want brands to act as a news source in uncertain times, foster a sense of community, and provide educational resources. Whew.</p> \n<p>As a content marketer, those are significant expectations to live up to. LinkedIn realized the changing global landscape would alter customer expectations and, as a result, content marketing strategies. So the team put together this handy infographic to help marketers focus on what matters most.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-marketing-in-times-of-uncertainty.jpg?width=525&amp;name=content-marketing-in-times-of-uncertainty.jpg\" alt=\"content marketing infographic example\" width=\"525\" style=\"width: 525px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>This infographic example features several design elements from LinkedIn's current brand. The graphics adhere to its primary and complementary color scheme, include diverse illustrations, and relate to the work-from-home times.</p> \n<p>It also uses color block banners to add visual interest and break up chunks of text. But my favorite part? The ruler graphic on how to measure ROI and show why your efforts are worthwhile.</p> \n<h4>8. <a href=\"https://blog.bannersnack.com/working-from-home/\">How to Be Productive While Working From Home</a>, by Bannersnack</h4> \n<p>Working from home isn't the pajama party many people (used to) imagine. As offices closed and millions turned dining tables into home office spaces, Bannersnack created this infographic to help its employees transition to a different way of working. As a freelancer working remotely for the past five years, I found it full of practical tips and valuable tools.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/WFH-productivity-tips.jpg?width=782&amp;name=WFH-productivity-tips.jpg\" alt=\"productivity infographic for working from home\" width=\"782\" style=\"width: 782px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Beyond essential elements like brand colors, Bannersnack includes information people can immediately put to use. While it's easy to stay planted on your couch all day, Bannersnack recommends finding multiple workspaces for different tasks — an inspirational spot for creative thinking and another for deep work and crunched deadlines.</p> \n<p>Tips like this may seem small once you've been working remotely for a while, but for newcomers, it's one less thing you have to learn while adjusting to a different routine.</p> \n<h4>9. <a href=\"https://www.netcredit.com/blog/45-slack-tricks-impress-boss/\">45 Slack Tricks That Will Impress Your Boss</a>, by Net Credit</h4> \n<p>A tool as powerful as Slack has many features most people will never use, yet this infographic makes it easy to look like the cool \"Slack-er\" at the company even if you've only mastered the /giphy shortcut until now.</p> \n<p>Net Credit starts with a handful of stats to inform readers and give an idea of Slack's scope. Who knew people spend 50 million hours on the platform in <em>one week</em>? I'm intrigued and want to keep reading.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/slack-tips.jpg?width=584&amp;name=slack-tips.jpg\" alt=\"slack tips infographic\" width=\"584\" style=\"width: 584px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>As you scroll down the graphic, you see a combination of direct headlines \"Read Channel Highlight\" followed by text instructions and visual cues. As a visual learner, I appreciate how these cues mirror the actual interface.</p> \n<p>Each section is organized to help you find what you're looking for, whether it's \"#channel\" or \"message\" tips. Finance may be Net Credit's bread and butter, but this infographic shows how its team is adaptable and helpful — exactly what you want in a financial partner.</p> \n<h4>10. <a href=\"https://www.tdinsights.com/infographics/how-bad-data-affects-business/\">How Bad Data Affects Businesses</a>, TD Insights</h4> \n<p>A bad egg spoils the whole bunch, but what effect does bad data have on businesses? TD Insights answers that question with this excellent infographic design.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-bad-data-affects-business.jpg?width=433&amp;name=how-bad-data-affects-business.jpg\" alt=\"infographic on how bad data affects business\" width=\"433\" style=\"width: 433px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>The use of contrast makes this infographic visually appealing. Any reader can quickly identify the main themes and points of the design because of the creative use of different fonts.</p> \n<h3>Timeline Infographic Examples</h3> \n<h4>11. <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/techs-bizarre-beginnings-lucrative-pivots/\">Tech's Bizarre Beginnings &amp; Lucrative Pivots</a>, by Visual Capitalist</h4> \n<p>The beauty of infographics? They can be used by dozens of industries for hundreds of different purposes. But the best ones are often unexpected.</p> \n<p>Take this graphic designed by Visual Capitalist. It reveals the wild origin stories of some of the biggest tech companies today. I had no idea YouTube began as a video dating site with the tagline \"Tune In. Hook Up.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tech-bizarre-beginnings.jpg?width=603&amp;name=tech-bizarre-beginnings.jpg\" alt=\"youtube origins infographic\" width=\"603\" style=\"width: 603px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>As a growing online publication that focuses on data and technology news, Visual Capitalist's audience is likely interested in stories around company pivots that led to success.</p> \n<p>That information, coupled with a simple timeline structure, fun graphics, and hard-hitting metrics, makes it tough to look away from this infographic. Plus, we all need reminders that it's not where you start but where you're going.</p> \n<h4>12. <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/106161273/Infographic-style?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cinfographic\">Power Shifts</a>, Studio Patten</h4> \n<p>The United States is a powerful nation, but that wasn’t the case centuries ago.</p> \n<p>In this infographic, Studio Patten takes us on a journey through the years that show the most powerful nations at different times in history.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/power-shifts.jpg?width=601&amp;name=power-shifts.jpg\" alt=\"infographic on power shifts\" width=\"601\" style=\"width: 601px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>This infographic is simple, but it also uses creative images and text to provide a history lesson.</p> \n<h4>13. <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/109330107/Infographic-The-Evolution-of-US-Vaccines?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cinfographic\">The Evolution of US Vaccines</a>, by Janet Haniak</h4> \n<p>Humans have been fighting diseases and pandemics long before COVID-19. Here is one of the many infographics that make it easy to learn about past vaccines created to combat these diseases.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/evolution-of-US-vaccines.jpg?width=604&amp;name=evolution-of-US-vaccines.jpg\" alt=\"infographic on the evolution of US vaccines\" width=\"604\" style=\"width: 604px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>The use of real-life images instead of cartoon characters makes this infographic more believable. Instead of complicating the infographic, the designer made the timeline appear on a single line, with the notable event branching out of that line.</p> \n<h4>14. <a href=\"https://www.bluemailmedia.com/the-journey-of-oprah-winfrey.php\">The Journey of Oprah Winfrey</a>, by Blue Mail Media</h4> \n<p>Oprah Winfrey is one of the most powerful women alive today. But did you know she grew up in a poverty-stricken family and had a tough childhood?</p> \n<p>This infographic from Blue Mail Media allows us to look into Oprah's early life and how she grew to become who she is today.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/journey-of-oprah-winfrey.jpg?width=280&amp;name=journey-of-oprah-winfrey.jpg\" alt=\"oprah winfrey infographic\" width=\"280\" style=\"width: 280px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Although this infographic has a prominent blue background, the other bright colors make engaging with it easy. The quote breaks also add personality to the infographic.</p> \n<h4>15. <a href=\"https://www.viziononline.co.uk/apple-timeline/\">Apple History Timeline</a>, by Viziononline</h4> \n<p>Apple is the subject of this creative infographic created by Viziononline, and why not? Apple is one of the largest corporations in the world. In fact, you’re likely reading this article on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</p> \n<p>But was Apple always this big?</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/apple-history-timeline.jpg?width=494&amp;name=apple-history-timeline.jpg\" alt=\"infographic of apple's history\" width=\"494\" style=\"width: 494px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>With one look, a reader can tell that this visualization is about Apple because of the different products that appear throughout the infographic.</p> \n<h3>Interactive Infographic Examples</h3> \n<h4>16. <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/center-devices-and-radiological-healths-response-coronavirus-covid-19-infographic\">Response to COVID-19</a>, by the U.S Food and Drug Administration</h4> \n<p>It wouldn't be a 2021 round-up without mentioning the global pandemic that kept many of us at home for months. The bright spot? There are infographics galore educating people on how to wash their hands and social distance properly.</p> \n<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also relied on this visual medium to share how their regulatory department addressed COVID-19.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/COVID-response.jpg?width=604&amp;name=COVID-response.jpg\" alt=\"COVID-19 infographic\" width=\"604\" style=\"width: 604px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>This infographic example made our list for several reasons. First, to show how infographics can highlight the impact, instead of sharing step-by-step instructions or research-oriented content.</p> \n<p>The impact of each action is organized into separate columns and given a distinct color to help your eyes track from top to bottom. While this flow breaks the typical left-to-right reading pattern, it's not distracting or difficult to follow.</p> \n<p>The healthcare worker design at the top of the page nods to those on the frontlines, the colors align with the brand, actual numbers are easy to read, and the page isn't crowded with text.</p> \n<p>So the next time you need to explain the fruits of your labors to your boss, help win them over with an impact-driven infographic.</p> \n<h4>17. <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/108639369/Green-Blue-Gruppo-Gedi-2020?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cinfographic%202020\">Pianeta Plastica</a>, by Manuel Bortoletti for GEDI Gruppo</h4> \n<p>“<em>Che bello”</em> is the first thought that comes to mind for this design. The stunning data visualizations, oceanic color scheme, and easy-to-understand layout let the visuals do the talking. Visme explains how an infographic follows this <a href=\"https://visme.co/blog/infographic-best-practices/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">essential best practice</a> if it makes sense with all of the text removed.</p> \n<p>That may seem impossible, but designer <a href=\"https://www.manuelbortoletti.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Manuel Bortoletti</a> pulls it off with informative maps accompanied by clear keys and a bar graph that uses oil tankers to inform readers about how oil circulates the globe.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pianeta-plastica.jpg?width=580&amp;name=pianeta-plastica.jpg\" alt=\"ocean pollution infographic\" width=\"580\" style=\"width: 580px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Even with my incredibly limited Italian, I understand that the main point of the piece is to inform readers about the impact of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. And since this infographic was designed for the Italian media outlet GEDI Gruppo, it stays on-brand with a more formal editorial tone.</p> \n<h4>18. <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/proper-mask-wearing-coronavirus-prevention-infographic\">How to Properly Wear a Mask</a>, by John Hopkins Medicine</h4> \n<p>Education is the crux of an infographic. And when you have mere seconds to capture <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190415081959.htm\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">people's increasingly narrow attention span</a>, the information better be easy to learn.</p> \n<p>That's why one of the best infographic examples comes from John Hopkins Medicine. They designed an infographic to share tips on a crucial COVID-19 procedure: wearing a mask.</p> \n<p>Is covering your nose important? You bet. What about wearing a bandana as a mask? No way. Hopkins uses a combination of straightforward graphics and copy to make the do's and don'ts very clear.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-wear-a-mask.jpg?width=592&amp;name=how-to-wear-a-mask.jpg\" alt=\"infographic on how to wear a mask\" width=\"592\" style=\"width: 592px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>As a renowned medical institution, Hopkins has the experience and authority to educate people on this topic, so it fits its brand and is helpful for everyone's health — a true win-win.</p> \n<h4>19. <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/overview/\">The Sustainable Development Goals Report</a>, by the United Nations</h4> \n<p>Infographics are a great way to add visual flavor to otherwise dry content, like annual reports and whitepapers.</p> \n<p>What stands out in this infographic example is how it can be used as one visual or divided into 17 sections — one for each Sustainable Development Goal. This allows the content team to choose which type of content best fits the target audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sustainable-development-goals-report.jpg?width=612&amp;name=sustainable-development-goals-report.jpg\" alt=\"sustainable development infographic\" width=\"612\" style=\"width: 612px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>If the UN is speaking to organizations that empower women and girls, they can share the \"Gender Equality'' graphic. But a non-profit that promotes all of the UN goals will likely be interested in the entire design.</p> \n<p>While a lot of information is packed into each graphic, it's never overwhelming. Each goal is separate from the other with bold headers and distinct colors, which are also used to differentiate the UN's marketing efforts.</p> \n<h4>20. <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/116182411/Ocean-Pollution?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7Cinfographic\">Ocean Pollution</a>, by Stephanie Phung</h4> \n<p>Designer Stephanie Phung created this engaging visualization to make more people aware of the ocean’s current state of pollution.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-05-28%20at%2012.59.58%20PM.jpg?width=603&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-05-28%20at%2012.59.58%20PM.jpg\" alt=\"pollution infographic\" width=\"603\" style=\"width: 603px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>This free infographic uses art to tell a story about the financial and environmental implications of ocean pollution. The designer also uses colors and design elements — the blue color for the sea — that people are already familiar with.</p> \n<h2>Ready to start designing stunning infographics?</h2> \n<p>Now that your creativity is sparked, it's the perfect time to start creating your infographics.</p> \n<p>While the infographics you create might be different from those on this list, ensure they’re colorful and engaging. And most importantly, that the infographics pass across information in a manner that’s easy to understand.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\"

Enjoy","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/creative-team-outing-ideas","description":"<p>Are you starting to notice some droopy shoulders around the office? It sounds like it's time to plan a team outing.</p>  \n<p>Team outings are a great way to facilitate bonding with your team members, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/avoidable-problems-stressing-out-marketing-employees?_ga=2.160203966.2020453271.1624402001-1385980291.1624402001\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">reduce employee stress</a>, and give them the chance to get to know one another outside of the office.</p>  \n<p>And, you know, they're entertaining.</p> \n<p>But how do you find ideas for a great team outing? Maybe you start with a Google search for \"team outing ideas\" and stumble upon an article that suggests \"field trips\" and \"professional development activities.\" It sounds like a starting point, but where's the real excitement?</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Company Culture Code Template&nbsp;\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>Next time you plan an outing for your team, cut the trust-falls and get one of these ideas on the calendar instead. We have something for everyone — from perfect activities for remote teams to large or small in-house groups to events that enhance teamwork and events that all team members can enjoy outdoors.</p> \n<h2>Why should you do team-building activities for work?</h2> \n<p>Team building activities can be embarrassing for coworkers, and some don’t even add anything that relates to the workplace. For example, while ‘trust falls’ seems like an excellent idea, forcing it doesn’t improve trust among coworkers, and what is worse, it can result in injuries when pairings are not even.</p> \n<p>However, not all team-building activities are detrimental to your workers, as you would see from the ideas we highlight in this post.</p> \n<p>One of the most significant advantages of the right team-building activities is that it boosts morale among your workforce. Team members get to work together on exciting and challenging activities and can display their skills and talents.</p> \n<p>Team-building activities and games that boost morale can break down barriers among employees and create an environment that is nice to work in, which is vital to a successful and well-functioning business.</p> \n<p>The ultimate goal of team-building activities is to get your team members to bond and build trust with each other. People with different backgrounds, needs, ambitions, and personalities make up teams.</p> \n<p>By engaging in the right team-building activities, you can bring these different people together to build a bonded, trusting team.</p> \n<p>When your team bonds, it results in several benefits for the company. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Some of these benefits include:</span></p> \n<h3>1. Improved Communication Skills</h3> \n<p>Communication between staff and departments is essential to a company’s success. Team-building exercises put people in a relaxed environment and encourage them to communicate while completing tasks.</p> \n<h3>2. Improved Productivity</h3> \n<p>Better communication skills will have a domino effect on productivity levels. When your employees work together and communicate, there is less work duplication and less friction between workers.</p> \n<h3>3. Identifies Leaders</h3> \n<p>Another benefit from team-building exercises is that managers can discover leaders within the workforce while engaging in team-building activities.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Regardless of the type of event that you want to enjoy, here are eight essential things to consider:</p> \n<h3>1. Define your goals.</h3> \n<p>You must determine clear areas of focus that you want to enhance during team-building events. Only after selecting the activity’s goals can you successfully choose the activities and challenges that would best fit the occasion.</p> \n<h3>2. Set a budget.</h3> \n<p>A budget needs to be determined after you have decided on your priorities. With a realistic budget, you can ensure that the price of the event doesn’t run out of control.</p> \n<h3>3. Set up a planning team.</h3> \n<p>As you begin planning, you will discover how difficult it can be for one person to organize a team-building event. There are so many things you need to prepare for, and the best way to deal with these things is to delegate responsibilities.</p> \n<h3>4. Invite and involve the right people.</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, it is easy to determine who to invite. Some other times, it can be challenging choosing who to invite. To help you, ask yourself (or the planning team these questions):</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Is it a compulsory event?</li> \n <li>What is the maximum number of people that the budget and venue can accommodate?</li> \n <li>Will remote employees be invited?</li> \n <li>Can anyone attend the event?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Answering these questions can make it easier for you to invite the right people.</p> \n<h3>5. Select the right activities.</h3> \n<p>After determining the goals of the team-building event, you should have a clear idea of activities that will align with these goals.</p> \n<p>It is best to choose activities that are interactive, engaging and that build collaboration among employees.</p> \n<h3>6. Choose a great time.</h3> \n<p>The best time for a team-building event depends on the schedule and personal lives of those you plan to invite. Ensure that invitees are free before you commit to a day and time. You also need to take the weather and season into account when choosing a date - especially if organizing an outdoor activity.</p> \n<h3>7. Choose a good location.</h3> \n<p>The location is one of the factors that can make or mar your event. You need to avoid places that’ll not accommodate enough people or that aren’t suitable for the activities you’ve planned.</p> \n<h3>8. Market the event internally.</h3> \n<p>Marketing the event internally will likely build excitement among employees. Developing and distributing an “Event Day Agenda” that highlights all the activities employees will enjoy will increase expectations for the day and get folks excited.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>Remote Team Building Activities</h3> \n<h4>1. Virtual Break Room</h4> \n<p>The simple chats that happen on the office floor are sorely missed. Since most members of your team still work remotely, a virtual break room is an excellent team-building activity.</p> \n<p>You can create this via Zoom or some other platform where staff can log in and join over their lunch or break - allowing them to catch up with coworkers as they would in a physical office.</p> \n<p>You can also keep water cooler moments alive by encouraging workers to share interesting photos or videos.</p> \n<h4>2. Virtual Escape Room</h4> \n<p>Since the pandemic made physical escape rooms impossible to visit, a <a href=\"https://theescapegame.com/remote-adventures/?utm_source=snacknation&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=virtual-team-building\">Virtual Escape Room</a> brings the mystery to your workers right in their homes!</p> \n<p>Depending on the Escape Room you choose, team members have to pass through different rooms, solve the puzzles they encounter, solve a murder, and so much more!. It is just as fun as it sounds, and what is more, it builds collaboration and communication among staff.</p> \n<h4>3. Beer Making</h4> \n<p>In this team-building exercise, team members become brewers for a day right from their homes. The process does not require prior knowledge as <a href=\"https://www.citybrewtours.com/at-home-corporate-craft-beer-events/beer-making-experience/\">Beer Making Experience</a> walks participants through each step of the journey. Kits are also delivered to interested staff.</p> \n<h4>4. Virtual Scavenger Hunt</h4> \n<p>You can quickly organize this team-building activity over a Zoom call. On the call, challenge team members to collect different items from around their homes.</p> \n<p>The first person to show all the required items wins the hunt!</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Rd_ojgOM2MrLUGRVDlxpt-c4xrkIIdlGnQbrXo1pgWZ6YEC02KNI563gKDV4aYU0rOXBX_dZJl4FVUEZBqD0iM9bEQGBKoXy1WuLiIHF9p4iM_9x6P6TBDAADsft2gWa8t-dLzMF\" width=\"600\" alt=\"host a virtual scavenger hunt for a corporate team-building activity\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.scavify.com/\" style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\">Scavify</a></span></p> \n<h4>5. Set Competitive Challenges</h4> \n<p>A little friendly competition never hurts any team - on the contrary, it can strengthen the bonds of unity.</p> \n<p>Setting up challenges for your teams can give them a goal to work towards. One popular challenge is the fitness challenge. It provides healthy competition between teams and improves their health.</p> \n<h4>6. Icebreaker Quizzes</h4> \n<p>These quizzes are an exciting and safe way to do team-building weekly. You can choose an online ice-breaker quiz like Quizbreaker, which sends out a new round of quizzes weekly to the team. It can work wonders to bringing remote teams closer as they learn more about each other while having loads of fun.</p> \n<h4>7. Visit Paris Virtually</h4> \n<p>One challenge many HR departments face is onboarding new hires. Virtually visiting new places with tools like <a href=\"https://woyago.com/home/virtual-team-building-hangouts/?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=blog.weekdone.com&amp;utm_campaign=wayago&amp;utm_content=team-building\">Woyago </a>is a unique and exciting ice-breaker. The virtual tour offered by Woyago has real-life Parisian guiding participants while throwing challenges along the way.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/D0cKfQXT82JJCn2azANLlIbxAecvHyq31ymycCOL52kkdL04qqrCxcdOSoBmV7lV_svyLrE8K8VaAzoOymubvaRiohoTNdRv9Kp4DNDV91poq6SagNf95ck6cTiDoSVW4kOQgHNT\" width=\"600\" alt=\"visit paris virtually for a corporate team-building activity\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\">Source: <a href=\"https://woyago.com/home/\" style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\">Woyago</a></span></p> \n<h3>Large Group Team Building Activities</h3> \n<h4><strong>8. Scavenger Hunt</strong></h4> \n<p>Find a beautiful day, break everyone out into groups, and have a scavenger hunt around the city. You can organize one yourself or use a creative service like <a href=\"https://www.thegogame.com/team-building-games\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">The Go Game</a> (which lists companies like Netflix, Facebook, and HBO among clients) or <a href=\"https://www.strayboots.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Stray Boots</a>.</p> \n<p>Your team members will feel nice and rejuvenated after some fresh air and fun challenges. Be sure to take plenty of silly pictures — you can even have a slideshow when everyone regroups at the end.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, you might try a \"Random Acts of Kindness\" hunt. For instance, Outback Team Building &amp; Training <a href=\"https://www.outbackteambuilding.com/event/random-acts-of-kindness/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">offers this team building activity</a>, which requires teams to split up into groups, download Outback's app, and complete a series of challenges to benefit strangers in the community.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qOPuetA9bL5l18nqCjXZJvaL82R9Mv-R9KkaM_9sVibwViTNdBioeLldu8twy0XD1g06T0RC_btPN5s8gJ8lUM4NXtxdIZwceeK1jDAoGvY0ydppPztuDTTTOsweuY9nPP8em84O\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"host a scavenger hunt for a corporate team-building activity\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 9px;\">Image credit: </span></em><a href=\"https://www.thegogame.com/\" style=\"font-size: 9px; color: #0091ae;\"><em>The Go Game</em></a></p> \n<h4>9. What’s My Name?</h4> \n<p>You might have seen this game played before. It goes by different names, and the more people who play, the better it is.</p> \n<p>What's My Name is an activity where each player is assigned the name of a person — dead or alive — and displays that name on their back, head, or part of their body such that only the other players can read the name. You can write these names on index cards or Post-it notes.</p> \n<p>Once team members have been assigned a name, the players mingle with one another, treating their coworkers the way they'd treat the person listed on that coworker's card. They can also ask questions about their own hidden identity until they correctly guess who they are.</p> \n<p>What's My Name has no complicated rules or potential for competitiveness. It's simply an empathy-builder — a critical ingredient of good company culture — allowing team members to find out what it would be like to be treated the way someone very different from them might be treated every day.</p> \n<h4><strong>10. Cook-Off</strong></h4> \n<p>Here's a culinary team-building activity that could end in dessert or disaster — in a fun way. Creating new dishes together requires creativity and will require everyone to put their team and leadership skills into action.</p> \n<p>Divide your team into smaller teams, pick a food category, and challenge each team to whip up something delicious. The category could be anything from ice cream, to salsa, to pizza.</p> \n<p>One fun twist you could add? Pick a single ingredient that all teams <em>must </em>use, like maple syrup or Oreos. Or, have each team get creative thinking caps on with the shape of its food — you can make pizzas into almost any shape.</p> \n<h4><strong>11. Sneak a Peek</strong></h4> \n<p>What do you get when you add a test of memory to a game of Pictionary? Sneak a Peek. In this game, team members break off into groups of at least four and take turns recreating objects from memory.</p> \n<p>Using LEGOs, clay, building blocks, or a similar set of construction items, one game leader will craft an object or structure for every group to recreate. A member of each group then has 10 seconds to \"sneak a peek\" at the structure (which is hidden), return to their groups, and describe what they saw to the rest of the group so they can recreate it.</p> \n<p>Each group has its LEGOs, clay, or building blocks. If it isn’t complete after a minute of recreating the structure, another member of each group sneaks a 10-second peek at the game leader's object and comes back to instruct the group further.</p> \n<p>This rotation continues until a group is confident they have recreated the item. The object of the game? Be the first group to recreate it.</p> \n<p>Not only does this game help team members practice project management, but it shows you how to accomplish tasks using input from a variety of sources. It's also just a fun way to see how good your coworkers are at retaining information.</p> \n<h4><strong>12. Board Game Tournament</strong></h4> \n<p>Here's one way to spark your team members' competitive sides without having to leave the office. Organize a team-wide board game tournament.</p> \n<p>Especially if your team is pretty big, it might be easiest to pick a single game, then have one team member sign up for specific time slots when they're free to leave their desks and spend some time playing the game.</p> \n<p>Some great games with reasonable play times include Boggle, Jenga, or even games using good ol' playing cards. Don't forget to incentivize with prizes for first, second, and third place.</p> \n<h4><strong>13. Office Trivia</strong></h4> \n<p>Who says trivia night only takes place at the bar? Office trivia is the perfect way to bring a large group of colleagues together and challenge the brain in areas that don't necessarily apply to their daily jobs. Break the company into teams of four or more and offer small prizes for the teams who score the most points.</p> \n<p>Want to write your own trivia questions? For reference, trivia questions are generally sorted into categories — four or five trivia questions per category — with optional bonus questions at the end of the game.</p> \n<p>While you can give each question a point value, you can also assign each team a certain amount of points per category that they can <em>bet</em>, instead. Each team can then bet as many or as few points as they want per question until they've used all their points for that category.</p> \n<p>Not prepared to create your own trivia questions? Hire a trivia organization to host a trivia night at your office. There are tons of national trivia companies who'd be happy to host an event right on site — <a href=\"http://www.district-trivia.com/where/is-trivia\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">District Trivia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thetriviafactory.com/where-to-play/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">The Trivia Factory</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.bigquizthing.com/private-corporate-trivia-events/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Big Quiz Thing</a> are just a few of them.</p> \n<h4>14. 4-Question Mingle</h4> \n<p>This activity has each team member moving around and meeting each person individually. It is excellent for teams that have spent some time apart or groups that have just been formed. Armed with four questions, each person gets to know coworkers better.</p> \n<h3>Small-Group Team Building Events</h3> \n<h4><strong>15. Improv Workshop</strong></h4> \n<p>Comedy and improv events are fun, interactive experiences that'll have your employees roaring with laughter while teaching them useful communication and soft skills, like focus and trust.</p> \n<p>Depending on your budget, you could do anything from simply <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/magazine/201404/adam-bluesteint/improv-exercises-for-the-office.html\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">playing improv games</a> with your employees to bringing in professionals to run competitive, fast-paced activities.</p> \n<h4><strong>16. Two Truths and One Lie</strong></h4> \n<p>This is a classic house party fun activity, but it's also an excellent ice-breaker when integrating coworkers who don't yet know one another.</p> \n<p>Two Truths and a Lie is simple: Start by organizing the entire group into a circle and give each person the floor to introduce themselves. In addition to providing their name, however, every team member also says three things about themselves —only two of which are true. It's up to the rest of the group to guess which statement is the lie.</p> \n<h4><strong>17. Karaoke Night</strong></h4> \n<p>What better way to get your employees to break out of their shells than to have them get up and sing some karaoke? You can even have a contest for the best group karaoke performance.</p> \n<p>Bonus points if there are feather boas and cowboy hats involved. This activity works best for a more extroverted group, so if your team isn't into strutting their stuff on stage, consider an idea on this list that caters more to those personalities.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5qS3ihOYJQutiA6gW6k9oyY5H1XKCYWCKNdMw1xHO8J_2UsnxiBuvGA694PQLl0wyh5XHG7K60joztyFk7_pHoWtQCbooWgCcBGkzYdkO0AgS30GDZaWZ7vEb9Poa1SYSMfl94pE\" width=\"600\" alt=\"go to karaoke for a corporate team-building activity\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10px; font-style: italic;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/derekgavey/4917447111\" style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #0091ae; font-style: italic;\">derekgavey</a></span></p> \n<h4><strong>18. The \"Suddenly\" Story</strong></h4> \n<p>If you've ever told stories around a campfire, you might have narrated a variation of The \"Suddenly\" Story. This activity is the choose-your-own-adventure book of team-building.</p> \n<p>However, putting activities. You're not just telling a story — you're piecing a story together using the (often hilarious) imaginations of your coworkers.</p> \n<p>To tell The \"Suddenly\" Story, gather your team in a circle, and offer the opening three sentences to a story about anything. At the end of the three sentences, say \"Suddenly ...\" and pass the story onto the person next to you.</p> \n<p>It's their job to take your three sentences and build on the story with another three sentences, followed by \"Suddenly ...\" Each mention of \"Suddenly\" allows the story to take a turn. What that turn looks like is up to the next person in the circle.</p> \n<p>The \"Suddenly\" Story helps people find ways of building on existing content while also being creative when all ears are on them. Try it the next time you want to get your department together for a break, and you're sure to get everyone laughing.</p> \n<h4><strong>19. Go-Kart Racing</strong></h4> \n<p>There’s nothing like a bit of competition to bond a group together. An adrenaline-pumping activity like kart racing is a great way to get employees to interact with one another in a totally new and fun way. Just make sure everyone pays attention during the safety lecture.</p> \n<h4><strong>20. Concentration (Marketing Edition)</strong></h4> \n<p>Here's a professional spin on the 1960s game show. The original game show, called <a href=\"https://fiftiesweb.com/tv/concentration/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Concentration</a>, put 30 numbered tiles up on a board, each tile with an identical tile somewhere else on the board. What made them similar? They had matching prizes on the back.</p> \n<p>Over time, as contestants opened up more tiles, they had the opportunity to select tiles they knew would match up and win the prize written on the back.</p> \n<p>Businesses — especially marketing departments — can have a field day putting logos, slogans, and company names on the back of their own tiles and having players match up every piece of the brand.</p> \n<p>As your business grows, you can even put the names of your products, employees, and job titles on the backs of your tiles to see how well your coworkers know the company they work for.</p> \n<h4>21. Sales Exercise</h4> \n<p>This activity is perfect for your marketing team but can still be enjoyed by all types of teams and encourages creative thinking. In this building exercise, each group is given an item, from the mundane to the strange. The teams each have five minutes to come up with a creative advert. The team with the most creative advert wins each round.</p> \n<h3>Teamwork Team Building Activities</h3> \n<h4>22. Professional Development Workshop</h4> \n<p>Want to encourage team bonding while providing each team member with an opportunity to learn and further their career?</p> \n<p>Offer a shared learning experience either at your office or at an off-site workshop or conference. The activity could be specifically related to your employees' jobs, or it could be something broader, like a negotiation or leadership skills workshop.</p> \n<h4><strong>23. Jigsaw Puzzle Race</strong></h4> \n<p>Jigsaw puzzles can be a tedious thing to put together alone. Maybe you have one set up at home and make progress on it for a couple of hours every weekend.</p> \n<p>However, putting your numerous brilliant colleagues on the case makes a jigsaw puzzle an enjoyable problem-solving activity. Break the company into teams for a multi-puzzle race, and suddenly you have a test of teamwork that electrifies the entire office.</p> \n<p>Grab several copies of the same puzzle and turn your weekend activity into a contest to see which team can complete the puzzle first. Offer prizes just like you would in a game of office trivia.</p> \n<p>Just be sure each team has the same number of people and choose your puzzle size wisely. A 1000-piece puzzle, for example, might be a bit time-consuming for a team of just five or six people.</p> \n<h4><strong>24. Room Escape Games</strong></h4> \n<p>Here's a great bonding activity that requires leadership skills, teamwork, logic, and patience. Room escape games — Escape the Room, Puzzle Break, AdventureRooms, etc. — have become a wildly popular team-building exercise for groups around the globe.</p> \n<p>Here's how it works: A group of people gets \"locked\" in a room for one hour. During that time limit, they have to find hidden objects, solve puzzles, and figure out clues to locate the key that will set them free. And it's not easy: <a href=\"http://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/blog/2015/02/09/escape-the-room-boston/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Only 20% of players</a> actually make it out before the hour is up.</p> \n<p>If you're not sure how to convert your office space into an escape room, you can always hire a service to do it for you. Companies like <a href=\"https://www.outbackteambuilding.com/event/corporate-escape-rooms/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Outback Team Building &amp; Training</a> host events that turn your office into a team-building escape challenge. And, this can invoke some great, positive memories into a space where your team works every day.</p> \n<h4><strong>25. The Egg Drop Challenge</strong></h4> \n<p>Chances are, you played this in school or summer camp. The <a href=\"https://buggyandbuddy.com/egg-drop-challenge-and-free-planning-printable-science-invitation-saturday/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Egg Drop Challenge</a> is a beloved tradition that challenges teams of kids to create small structures around an uncooked egg to protect the egg from a high fall onto hard ground.</p> \n<p>Each group is given specific items to build the structure that protects the egg, but nothing more. So, why not offer the same challenge to your coworkers?</p> \n<p>Straws, newspaper, tape, and cardboard are just some everyday items provided during the Egg Drop Challenge — as you can see in the sample egg fortress below. However, consider making it even more challenging for your coworkers and allow them to use simply anything available in the office.</p> \n<p>The height of the fall is up to you. But ensure to set an altitude that's consistent with the materials each team has to work with.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1h-A4f_qR6OyCCYS9ZNeufpQ3AYjItE18uWXrMeQbIuDz4MVYLH1e_BQBkNYpkTC4v7jBkNS1MpUcB4B-rWuFRgHQu-RHVpRAUncULU6fL8zQKXYj-TYYVN2Fxfa511rkWdA_bUp\" width=\"600\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" alt=\"egg drop challenge for a corporate team-building activity\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://buggyandbuddy.com/egg-drop-challenge-free-planning-printable-2014/\" style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #0091ae;\"><em>Buggy and Buddy</em></a></span></p> \n<h4><strong>26. Laser Tag</strong></h4> \n<p>Another great way to get your adrenaline pumping? A good old game of laser tag. Not only is it great fun, it's also an opportunity for employees to exercise their strategy and logic skills, as well as teamwork skills. Bonus: Determine teams ahead of time and have people dress up.</p> \n<h4><strong>27. Catch Phrase</strong></h4> \n<p>In this classic party game, players team up and take turns describing words and phrases to their teammates without saying the word or phrase itself. Phrases can include celebrities, expressions, or just simple things found around the house.</p> \n<p>If my phrase is \"needle in a haystack,\" for example, a clue I might give to my teammates could be \"a pointy object buried inside farm equipment.\"</p> \n<p>Catch Phrase is the perfect way to get your employees together and teach them how to communicate with one another. (Don't worry, everyone will be having so much fun, they won't realize that's what you're doing.)</p> \n<p>This game is often played with a basket of phrases on slips of paper, but it became so popular, Hasbro made an <a href=\"https://shop.hasbro.com/en-us/product/catch-phrase-game:2C79D3B5-5056-9047-F535-614A0B4DE1C0\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">electronic version</a>.</p> \n<h4>28. Game of Possibilities</h4> \n<p>To play this game, give an object to anyone in each group. Then ask each person to demonstrate in front of their group — without talking — what the object is used for. The rest of the team has to guess what object the person is demonstrating. Demonstrations must be creative and original. It can be played in small groups and only requires random objects.</p> \n<h3>Outings and Events Team Building Activities</h3> \n<h4><strong>29. Volunteer</strong></h4> \n<p>Giving time to support a good cause isn't just good for the soul; it's also an excellent way for your team members to bond. Place-based volunteering ideas include volunteering at a local soup kitchen, helping build a <a href=\"http://www.habitat.org/cd/giving/lander/default.aspx?link=271&amp;source_code=DHQOW1407W1GGP&amp;iq_id=62228274-VQ6-77521786995-VQ16-c-VQ14-88743918&amp;gclid=CMbk48HlkMoCFYUYHwodPXkPnA\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Habitat for Humanity</a> house, or delivering gifts to children's hospitals during the holidays.</p> \n<p>Skill-based volunteering is a terrific way to stretch your employees' expertise: It's when your team volunteers its time and uses its professional skills — anything from marketing to app development to writing — to help a nonprofit.</p> \n<p>Try <a href=\"http://volunteermatch.org/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">VolunteerMatch.org</a> for either type of volunteering opportunity and <a href=\"https://www.catchafire.org/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Catchafire.org</a> for skill-based volunteering opportunities.</p> \n<h4><strong>30. Mystery Dinner</strong></h4> \n<p>Mystery dinners are one of the most beloved traditions here at HubSpot. On a single night, you send a group of folks from different teams within your company to dinner somewhere in your city (or at someone's house).</p> \n<p>The dinner is hosted by one of your company's leaders and paid for by the company. These dinners allow random groups of people from the same company to spend an evening chock full of good food and conversation together.</p> \n<p>What makes them a mystery dinner? The only thing participants should know about the dinner ahead of time is the date and time. Send each group an email with the name of the restaurant they're going to and who they'll be going with, so they can arrange transportation together.</p> \n<p>Optional: Give every dinner host the name of a restaurant or bar to invite everyone to congregate once the dinners are over.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EmPeGD_jJuB3rkfiRV36P-2GaFGarpNiS_BlKjnukDyGWSVU53wxQPxQ4WCbajz0CnZ2DjZA3uV6zwFYUgL8kajo-tnM8VSRkXSClRHcDVJM_CPUa7ie54opBnvzGF16-tTAUv-M\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"host a mystery dinner for a corporate team-building activity\"></p> \n<h4><strong>31. Kayaking/Canoeing</strong></h4> \n<p>Nothing says \"let's work together,\" quite like trying not to end up in the water. Want to take advantage of the outdoors? Grab a paddle and head down to the closest river for a great spring or summer outing.</p> \n<p>Many public rivers and ponds have boat houses where you can rent kayaks and canoes — and you can encourage folks to rent multi-person ones and pair up with people they don't usually work with.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/K1-Fd-v1erM5_qwVarB_obz6WBGoeWWgUeWn6JIAV6rg_Z2PmYpVsLwl47wGeQo8oN0dzQMPblYC7O956ab7rBn6yFsXSBgUk9yuWUqCLt3PUCpERVtQRkvyqmdBzHUPGInhajWo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"go kayaking or canoeing for a corporate team-building activity\"></p> \n<h4><strong>32. Trampoline Park</strong></h4> \n<p>Hey, who says trampolines are just for kids? Take your team to a trampoline park for some jumping fun and a chance to work off the day's stress. Many cities have local places with trampoline activities — if you're in the Boston area, check out <a href=\"http://www.skyzone.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Skyzone</a> for trampoline dodgeball and basketball games.</p> \n<h4><strong>33. Something Touristy</strong></h4> \n<p>Embrace your city! Pick a hot tourist destination and go as a team. You can even do a Segway tour. (Fanny packs: optional.) It'll be nice to laugh at how silly it feels to be a tourist in your own city, and you might even learn something new.</p> \n<h4><strong>34. Painting Class</strong></h4> \n<p>If you're looking for a slightly more relaxing activity, take a group painting class. <a href=\"http://www.paintnite.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Paint Nite</a> hosts painting classes by local artists at various bars throughout major cities for painting on canvases, wine glasses (like in the picture below), and so on. It's a great way to let your team members unwind, catch up over some drinks, and express their creativity.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EVlA_tpPV7WUPBZZ9Q22Hk8ZPliRE_2Z1MO21hVk9C3gWT-d4qSU8919iLCBugsv3MPeqn2yxcOy4D7dpok4c0BZ88RNF2LcCPZLEiKDk21Gf_HSwfi2XwgiCqcq7NcWSn7PzxF4\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"go to a painting class for a corporate team-building activity\"></p> \n<h4><strong>35. Cooking Class</strong></h4> \n<p>In the mood for something a little more culinary? Change up the usual outing to a bar or your local restaurant, and try a cooking class. Through a service such as <a href=\"https://www.kitchensurfing.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Kitchensurfing</a>, you can hire a professional chef to cook a fancy meal for you in your home or office kitchen.</p> \n<p>Between the multiple courses prepared before your eyes, your team will have plenty of time to strike up a conversation and enjoy the delicious aromas.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/riYuonwEDe4_XdoA26jB31lupln_Rh9a1D2vi0UvDP20XmVUDfrZAsVXCBFt9JcF3DJF-gcE5HjJAK1WWNSbBj8LG4On7ni5IXodLQazr6kWdUt43frxznLGx-4FDcv2xAUh8FM6\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"go to a cooking class for a corporate team-building activity\"></p> \n<h4><strong>36. Explore a New Place</strong></h4> \n<p>Few things are more fun than getting out of the city and exploring for a day. So, why not do it with your team?</p> \n<p>For bigger events — maybe every quarter, when you have more budget to use for outings — charter a bus and take your team to a new place. You can all take a historical tour of the new place, grab lunch at a restaurant serving the town's finest, or take in a local attraction together.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Nv7Y5-sDD36sXTrEQQY1SsXJDR-QkTQFgcHnhsAgc-lGHUpRuaJJ_PDpRRzb2xkjFwWu3S0q6o2TlTy2tvrUp0PbXhtxYU1awmyfTNKeKXmXITWQgG7XgStL3EkLqYWlJRgL6Dq8\" width=\"600\" height=\"449\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"explore a new place for a corporate team-building activity\"></p> \n<h4><strong>37. Sports Game</strong></h4> \n<p>Round up the team and head out to a sports game. What a fantastic way to rev up team spirit while combining both competition and camaraderie.</p> \n<h4>38. Go Camping</h4> \n<p>Get away from the hustle and bustle of work and city life by heading out to a camping site in your area.</p> \n<p>Bond with your coworkers over camp stories, marshmallows, and campfires. Walk into the woods as coworkers and come out as friends!</p> \n<h2>Bring Fun To The Workplace!</h2> \n<p>These are just some fun team-building activities that you can use to get the best out of your team. Be sure to use any of the activities listed above to build a firm foundation of trust and purpose between your employees.</p> \n<p>Now you're ready to show your team a great time while increasing their happiness <em>and</em> creating a great company culture. And hey, you might just be the \"cool boss\" now. How cool would <em>that</em> be?</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4bbcf7f8-3c11-4d5b-b284-c5f6a9d419c9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

A great-looking website takes it that much further. But a custom email domain? Well, that's peak official. It signals structure and organization.</p> \n<p>Let's talk about the benefits of getting a custom email domain and how to get one.</p> \n<p>Personalized email domains can be used for both your employees and the departments in your company.</p> \n<p>There are two types of personalized email domains:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>A regular custom email domain</strong> – This includes an inbox and has all the features of a regular email service.</li> \n <li><strong>A forwarding email domain</strong> – This is only a customer-facing alias used to forward emails and doesn't have an inbox. Ex: You set up <a href=\"mailto:support@yourcompany.com\">support@yourcompany.com</a> and have all emails sent to that address forwarded to <a href=\"mailto:martina@yourcompany.com\">martina@yourcompany.com</a> or <a href=\"mailto:martina@gmail.com\">martina@gmail.com</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you're a small business and don't anticipate a high volume of emails, you can start out with a forwarding custom email domain. It looks professional and you don't have to sift through a separate inbox, as all emails will go to another inbox.</p> \n<p>However, as your company grows, you'll likely need to invest in a separate inbox for your business emails.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of a Custom Email Domain</h2> \n<p>We've already covered how a personalized email domain looks \"official,\" but let's talk about what that means in concrete terms.</p> \n<p>Back in 2016, <a href=\"https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2016/Consumer-Trust-In-Online-Small-Businesses-Strengthened-By-Professional-Email/default.aspx\">GoDaddy</a> ran a survey and found that 75% of Americans think a domain-based email is a key factor in trusting a small ecommerce business. They even ranked it as three times more important than having an active social media channel.</p> \n<p>The report also revealed that some consumers (about 24%) would hesitate to share their personal information with a seller using a personal email address.</p> \n<p>It's likely that these figures have gone up recently, given the prevalence of email phishing attacks. Today, consumers may be a little bit warier of a business without a custom email domain and with one that doesn't match its website.</p> \n<p>When you have a custom email domain, it adds to your credibility and serves as another way to show consumers that you are a reputable company.</p> \n<p>In addition, a personalized email domain helps you organize your incoming emails based on the various departments within your company.</p> \n<p>For instance, you can have <a href=\"mailto:info@yourcompany.com\">info@yourcompany.com</a> for consumers to send their general inquiries. You could have <a href=\"mailto:shipping@yourcompany.com\">shipping@yourcompany.com</a> for order-specific inquiries, and countless others based on your business needs.</p> \n<p>This can be incredibly helpful in managing incoming and outgoing emails, especially as your company grows. You may also want to designate a team member to be the directly responsible individual (DRI) for that email account.</p> \n<p>Lastly, it's important to have a separate email domain for your business to streamline your email marketing efforts. As you develop a plan for your email communications with your consumers, You'll likely invest in <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email-b\">email marketing software</a> to manage, track and analyze your activities.</p> \n<p>Having a custom email domain will ensure your personal data doesn't get mixed in with your business analytics and dirty your data.</p> \n<p>Before you select your email provider, here are a few things to know and features to consider:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>The cost per user </strong>– Some email providers charge by user while others offer unlimited users for one monthly price.</li> \n <li><strong>The storage size </strong>– Email providers typically offer various packages, each with a different storage amount, ranging from 5GB to unlimited. Consider the volume of emails you expect to receive and use that to guide which one you select.</li> \n <li><strong>Aliases </strong>– If you want to use a forwarding email, look for an email provider that allows you to create domain aliases that can be sent to other inboxes.</li> \n <li><strong>Spam filter </strong>– Look for a provider with advanced filtering capabilities to avoid filling up your inbox with spammy emails.</li> \n <li><strong>Your website domain </strong>– Most providers require you to have a website domain associated with your custom email domain.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>1. Select an email provider.</h3> \n<p>There are many email providers to choose from, including <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/\">Google Workspace</a> (formerly G Suite), <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products?&amp;activetab=tab:primaryr2\">Microsoft 365</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hostinger.com/email-hosting\">Hostinger</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ionos.com/office-solutions/create-an-email-address\">Ionos</a>.</p> \n<p>Many web hosting and designing companies like <a href=\"https://www.wix.com/business/email-address\">Wix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/email/professional-business-email\">GoDaddy</a> allow you to create your own custom domain right on the platform (usually from Google Workspace and Microsoft 365) and connect it with your website.</p> \n<p>This feature can be included in your current package or available at an additional monthly cost, depending on the platform.</p> \n<h3>2. Purchase or connect your domain.</h3> \n<p>Once you select a provider, you'll likely have to connect it to your website domains.</p> \n<p>Google Workspace, for instance, requires users to have a linked website to create a custom email domain.</p> \n<p>In most cases, you can connect the provider to an existing domain or purchase one on the spot.</p> \n<h3>3. Select your users and/or aliases.</h3> \n<p>Now that you have your personalized email domain, it's time to select your users.</p> \n<p>Let's say you have employees, you may need to create accounts for them. This is something only an administrator can manage through your admin dashboard. Some providers only allow a certain number of users per plan.</p> \n<p>Now, onto the departments. Decide if you want to create aliases for specific departments that get forwarded to other email addresses <strong>or</strong> want designated email addresses.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you're a small team, you may create a <a href=\"mailto:support@yourcompany.com\">support@yourcompany.com</a> email that goes right in your <a href=\"mailto:personalemail@gmail.com\">personalemail@gmail.com</a> inbox. If the volume gets high, you may want to make <a href=\"mailto:support@yourcompany.com\">support@yourcompany.com</a> its own user to have a designated inbox for all support-related inquiries.</p> \n<p>Knowing what you'll need ahead of time will help decide which provider and plan best suits your business needs.</p> \n<h3>4. Choose an email address format.</h3> \n<p>When you have custom email addresses, consistency and simplicity are key. This makes it easy for people to reach you.</p> \n<p>For your employees, you can have the following formats:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"mailto:firstname.lastname@yourcompany.com\">firstname.lastname@yourcompany.com</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"mailto:firstletter.lastname@yourcompany.com\">firstletter.lastname@yourcompany.com</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"mailto:role@yourcompany.com\">role@yourcompany.com</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Select the one that makes the most sense for your business.</p> \n<p>For your departments, try to keep it to one or two words. Here are a few examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>General inquiries</strong> – info@, contact@, hello@, questions@</li> \n <li><strong>Customer service </strong>– support@, billing@, shipping@, returns@, orders@</li> \n <li><strong>Sales</strong> – sales@, demo@</li> \n <li><strong>Marketing</strong> – press@, media@, pr@</li> \n <li><strong>Human Resources</strong> – hr@, jobs@, careers@</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Getting a personalized email domain for your business is a key step in achieving an \"official\" stamp from your audience online. It's a worthy investment that can strengthen consumer trust in your brand and make them more likely to purchase from you.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b229b0b2-204e-4bdf-9079-572da882b84d&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b229b0b2-204e-4bdf-9079-572da882b84d.png\" /></a></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcustom-email-domain&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 19:27:12 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/53e8428a-29a5-4225-a6ea-bca8ef991c19.png","linkMd5":"320755f24ebb4ea8675c23c4c398838f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn38@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-555_717deba97acb3439.webp","destWidth":653,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6873,"destBytes":10226,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/53e8428a-29a5-4225-a6ea-bca8ef991c19.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn38@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-555_717deba97acb3439.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b229b0b2-204e-4bdf-9079-572da882b84d.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn65@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-51-747_314ba14066d2faeb.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcustom-email-domain&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn45@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-53-453_a5c6c9953f9e00a8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938152},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"How to Use Excel Like a Pro: 18 Easy Excel Tips, Tricks, & Shortcuts","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-use-excel-tips","description":"<p>Sometimes, Excel seems too good to be true.

Let’s cover the basics first.</p> \n<h2>Excel Basics</h2> \n<p>If you're just starting out with Excel, there are a few basic commands that we suggest you become familiar with. These are things like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Creating a new spreadsheet from scratch.</li> \n <li>Executing basic computations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.</li> \n <li>Writing and formatting column text and titles.</li> \n <li>Using Excel's auto-fill features.</li> \n <li>Adding or deleting single columns, rows, and spreadsheets. Below, we'll get into how to add things like multiple columns and rows.</li> \n <li>Keeping column and row titles visible as you scroll past them in a spreadsheet, so that you know what data you're filling as you move further down the document.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>For a deep dive on these basics, check out our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/microsoft-excel\">comprehensive Microsoft Excel guide</a>.</p> \n<p>In the spirit of working more efficiently and avoiding tedious, manual work, here are a few Excel formulas and functions you’ll need to know.</p> \n<h2>Excel Formulas</h2> \n<p>It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the wide range of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-formulas-keyboard-shortcuts\">Excel formulas</a> that you can use to make sense out of your data. If you’re just getting started using Excel, you can rely on the following formulas to carry out some complex functions — without adding to the complexity of your learning path.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Equal sign: </strong>Before creating any formula, you’ll need to write an equal sign <strong>(=)</strong> in the cell where you want the result to appear.</li> \n <li><strong>Addition</strong>: To add the values of two or more cells, use the <strong>+</strong> sign. Example: <em>=C5+D3</em>.</li> \n <li><strong>Subtraction</strong>: To subtract the values of two or more cells, use the <strong>-</strong> sign. Example: <em>=C5-D3</em>.</li> \n <li><strong>Multiplication</strong>: To multiply the values of two or more cells, use the <strong>*</strong> sign. Example: <em>=C5*D3</em>.</li> \n <li><strong>Division</strong>: To divide the values of two or more cells, use the <strong>/ </strong>sign. Example: <em>=C5/D3</em>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Putting all of these together, you can create a formula that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides all in one cell. Example: <em>=(C5-D3)/((A5+B6)*3)</em>.</p> \n<p>For more complex formulas, you’ll need to use parentheses around the expressions to avoid accidentally using the <a href=\"https://www.mashupmath.com/blog/pemdas-rule-math-order-of-operations\">PEMDAS order of operations</a>. Keep in mind that you can use plain numbers in your formulas.</p> \n<h2>Excel Functions</h2> \n<p>Excel functions automate some of the tasks you would use in a typical formula. For instance, instead of using the <strong>+</strong> sign to add up a range of cells, you’d use the SUM function. Let’s look at a few more functions that will help automate calculations and tasks.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sum-function-043e1c7d-7726-4e80-8f32-07b23e057f89\">SUM</a>: The SUM function automatically adds up a range of cells or numbers. To complete a sum, you would input the starting cell and the final cell with a colon in between. Here’s what that looks like: <strong>SUM(Cell1:Cell2)</strong>. Example: <em>=SUM(C5:C30)</em>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/average-function-047bac88-d466-426c-a32b-8f33eb960cf6\">AVERAGE</a>: The AVERAGE function averages out the values of a range of cells. The syntax is the same as the SUM function: <strong>AVERAGE(Cell1:Cell2). </strong>Example: <em>=AVERAGE(C5:C30)</em>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/if-function-69aed7c9-4e8a-4755-a9bc-aa8bbff73be2\">IF</a>: The IF function allows you to return values based on a logical test. The syntax is as follows: <strong>IF(logical_test, value_if_true, [value_if_false])</strong>. Example: <em>=IF(A2&gt;B2,\"Over Budget\",\"OK\")</em>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1\">VLOOKUP</a>: The VLOOKUP function helps you search for anything on your sheet’s rows. The syntax is: <strong>VLOOKUP(lookup value, table array, column number, Approximate match (TRUE) or Exact match (FALSE))</strong>. Example: <em>=VLOOKUP([@Attorney],tbl_Attorneys,4,FALSE).</em></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/index-function-a5dcf0dd-996d-40a4-a822-b56b061328bd\">INDEX</a>: The INDEX function returns a value from within a range. The syntax is as follows: <strong>INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])</strong>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/match-function-e8dffd45-c762-47d6-bf89-533f4a37673a\">MATCH</a>: The MATCH function looks for a certain item in a range of cells and returns the position of that item. It can be used in tandem with the INDEX function. The syntax is: <strong>MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])</strong>.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countif-function-e0de10c6-f885-4e71-abb4-1f464816df34\">COUNTIF</a>: The COUNTIF function returns the number of cells that meet a certain criteria or have a certain value. The syntax is: <strong>COUNTIF(range, criteria). </strong>Example: <em>=COUNTIF(A2:A5,\"London\"). </em></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Okay, ready to get into the nitty-gritty? Let's get to it. (And to all the Harry Potter fans out there ... you're welcome in advance.)</p> \n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The GIFs and visuals are from a previous version of Excel. When applicable, the copy has been updated to provide instruction for users of both newer and older Excel versions.</p> \n<h3>1. Use Pivot tables to recognize and make sense of data.</h3> \n<p>Pivot tables are used to reorganize data in a spreadsheet. They won't change the data that you have, but they can sum up values and compare different information in your spreadsheet, depending on what you'd like them to do.</p> \n<p>Let's take a look at an example. Let's say I want to take a look at how many people are in each house at Hogwarts. You may be thinking that I don't have too much data, but for longer data sets, this will come in handy.</p> \n<p>To create the Pivot Table, I go to <strong>Data</strong> &gt; <strong>Pivot Table</strong>. If you’re using the most recent version of Excel, you’d go to <strong>Insert</strong> &gt; <strong>Pivot Table</strong>. Excel will automatically populate your Pivot Table, but you can always change around the order of the data. Then, you have four options to choose from.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Report Filter</strong>: This allows you to only look at certain rows in your dataset. For example, if I wanted to create a filter by house, I could choose to only include students in Gryffindor instead of all students.</li> \n <li><strong>Column Labels</strong>: These would be your headers in the dataset.</li> \n <li><strong>Row Labels</strong>: These could be your rows in the dataset. Both Row and Column labels can contain data from your columns (e.g. First Name can be dragged to either the Row or Column label — it just depends on how you want to see the data.)</li> \n <li><strong>Value</strong>: This section allows you to look at your data differently. Instead of just pulling in any numeric value, you can sum, count, average, max, min, count numbers, or do a few other manipulations with your data. In fact, by default, when you drag a field to Value, it always does a count.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Since I want to count the number of students in each house, I'll go to the Pivot table builder and drag the House column to both the Row Labels and the Values. This will sum up the number of students associated with each house.<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-pivot-table.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-pivot-table.gif\" alt=\"Excel pivot table creation\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>2. Add more than one row or column.</h3> \n<p>As you play around with your data, you might find you're constantly needing to add more rows and columns. Sometimes, you may even need to add hundreds of rows. Doing this one-by-one would be super tedious. Luckily, there's always an easier way.</p> \n<p>To add multiple rows or columns in a spreadsheet, highlight the same number of preexisting rows or columns that you want to add. Then, right-click and select \"Insert.\"</p> \n<p>In the example below, I want to add an additional three rows. By highlighting three rows and then clicking insert, I'm able to add an additional three blank rows into my spreadsheet quickly and easily.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-2424242854-gif/Insert_Spaces_GIF.gif?width=650&amp;name=Insert_Spaces_GIF.gif\" alt=\"insert Spaces on Excel\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"insert Spaces\"></p> \n<h3>3. Use filters to simplify your data.</h3> \n<p>When you're looking at very large data sets, you don't usually need to be looking at every single row at the same time. Sometimes, you only want to look at data that fit into certain criteria.</p> \n<p>That's where filters come in.</p> \n<p>Filters allow you to pare down your data to only look at certain rows at one time. In Excel, a filter can be added to each column in your data — and from there, you can then choose which cells you want to view at once.</p> \n<p>Let's take a look at the example below. Add a filter by clicking the Data tab and selecting \"Filter.\" Clicking the arrow next to the column headers and you'll be able to choose whether you want your data to be organized in ascending or descending order, as well as which specific rows you want to show.</p> \n<p>In my Harry Potter example, let's say I only want to see the students in Gryffindor. By selecting the Gryffindor filter, the other rows disappear.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-filters.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-filters.gif\" alt=\"Excel filters in action\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Copy and paste the values in the spreadsheet when a Filter is on to do additional analysis in another spreadsheet.</p> \n<h3>4. Remove duplicate data points or sets.</h3> \n<p>Larger data sets tend to have duplicate content. You may have a list of multiple contacts in a company and only want to see the number of companies you have. In situations like this, removing the duplicates comes in quite handy.</p> \n<p>To remove your duplicates, highlight the row or column that you want to remove duplicates of. Then, go to the Data tab and select \"Remove Duplicates\" (which is under the Tools subheader in the older version of Excel). A pop-up will appear to confirm which data you want to work with. Select \"Remove Duplicates,\" and you're good to go.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-duplicates-removal.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-duplicates-removal.gif\" alt=\"Removing duplicates in Excel\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>You can also use this feature to remove an entire row based on a duplicate column value. So if you have three rows with Harry Potter's information and you only need to see one, then you can select the whole dataset and then remove duplicates based on email. Your resulting list will have only unique names without any duplicates.</p> \n<h3>5. Transpose rows into columns.</h3> \n<p>When you have rows of data in your spreadsheet, you might decide you actually want to transform the items in one of those rows into columns (or vice versa). It would take a lot of time to copy and paste each individual header — but what the transpose feature allows you to do is simply move your row data into columns, or the other way around.</p> \n<p>Start by highlighting the column that you want to transpose into rows. Right-click it, and then select \"Copy.\" Next, select the cells on your spreadsheet where you want your first row or column to begin. Right-click on the cell, and then select \"Paste Special.\" A module will appear — at the bottom, you'll see an option to transpose. Check that box and select OK. Your column will now be transferred to a row or vice-versa.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-transpose.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-transpose.gif\" alt=\"Transpose tool in Excel\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>On newer versions of Excel, a drop-down will appear instead of a pop-up.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-transpose-new.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-transpose-new.gif\" alt=\"Excel transpose tool in newer versions\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>6. Split up text information between columns.</h3> \n<p>What if you want to split out information that's in one cell into two different cells? For example, maybe you want to pull out someone's company name through their email address. Or perhaps you want to separate someone's full name into a first and last name for your email marketing templates.</p> \n<p>Thanks to Excel, both are possible. First, highlight the column that you want to split up. Next, go to the Data tab and select \"Text to Columns.\" A module will appear with additional information.</p> \n<p>First, you need to select either \"Delimited\" or \"Fixed Width.\"</p> \n<ul> \n <li>\"Delimited\" means you want to break up the column based on characters such as commas, spaces, or tabs.</li> \n <li>\"Fixed Width\" means you want to select the exact location on all the columns that you want the split to occur.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In the example case below, let's select \"Delimited\" so we can separate the full name into first name and last name.</p> \n<p>Then, it's time to choose the Delimiters. This could be a tab, semi-colon, comma, space, or something else. (\"Something else\" could be the \"@\" sign used in an email address, for example.) In our example, let's choose the space. Excel will then show you a preview of what your new columns will look like.</p> \n<p>When you're happy with the preview, press \"Next.\" This page will allow you to select Advanced Formats if you choose to. When you're done, click \"Finish.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-text-to-column.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-text-to-column.gif\" alt=\"Excel text to column tool\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>7. Use formulas for simple calculations.</h3> \n<p>In addition to doing pretty complex calculations, Excel can help you do simple arithmetic like adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing any of your data.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>To add, use the + sign.</li> \n <li>To subtract, use the - sign.</li> \n <li>To multiply, use the * sign.</li> \n <li>To divide, use the / sign.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You can also use parentheses to ensure certain calculations are done first. In the example below (10+10*10), the second and third 10 were multiplied together before adding the additional 10. However, if we made it (10+10)*10, the first and second 10 would be added together first.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-simple-math.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-simple-math.gif\" alt=\"Excel simple formulas in action\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>8. Get the average of numbers in your cells.</h3> \n<p>If you want the average of a set of numbers, you can use the formula <strong>=AVERAGE(Cell1:Cell2)</strong>. If you want to sum up a column of numbers, you can use the formula <strong>=SUM(Cell1:Cell2)</strong>.</p> \n<h3>9. Use conditional formatting to make cells automatically change color based on data.</h3> \n<p>Conditional formatting allows you to change a cell's color based on the information within the cell. For example, if you want to flag certain numbers that are above average or in the top 10% of the data in your spreadsheet, you can do that. If you want to color code commonalities between different rows in Excel, you can do that. This will help you quickly see information that is important to you.</p> \n<p>To get started, highlight the group of cells you want to use conditional formatting on. Then, choose \"Conditional Formatting\" from the Home menu and select your logic from the dropdown. (You can also create your own rule if you want something different.) A window will pop up that prompts you to provide more information about your formatting rule. Select \"OK\" when you're done, and you should see your results automatically appear.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-conditional-formatting.gif?width=1232&amp;name=excel-conditional-formatting.gif\" alt=\"Excel conditional formatting\" width=\"1232\" style=\"width: 1232px;\"></p> \n<h3>10. Use the IF Excel formula to automate certain Excel functions.</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, we don't want to count the number of times a value appears. Instead, we want to input different information into a cell if there is a corresponding cell with that information.</p> \n<p>For example, in the situation below, I want to award ten points to everyone who belongs in the Gryffindor house. Instead of manually typing in 10's next to each Gryffindor student's name, I can use the IF Excel formula to say that if the student is in Gryffindor, then they should get ten points.</p> \n<p>The formula is: <strong>IF(logical_test, value_if_true, [value_if_false])</strong></p> \n<p>Example Shown Below: <strong>=IF(D2=\"Gryffindor\",\"10\",\"0\")</strong></p> \n<p>In general terms, the formula would be IF(Logical Test, value of true, value of false). Let's dig into each of these variables.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Logical_Test</strong>: The logical test is the \"IF\" part of the statement. In this case, the logic is D2=\"Gryffindor\" because we want to make sure that the cell corresponding with the student says \"Gryffindor.\" Make sure to put Gryffindor in quotation marks here.</li> \n <li><strong>Value_if_True</strong>: This is what we want the cell to show if the value is true. In this case, we want the cell to show \"10\" to indicate that the student was awarded the 10 points. Only use quotation marks if you want the result to be text instead of a number.</li> \n <li><strong>Value_if_False</strong>: This is what we want the cell to show if the value is false. In this case, for any student not in Gryffindor, we want the cell to show \"0\". Only use quotation marks if you want the result to be text instead of a number.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-if-formula.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-if-formula.gif\" alt=\"Excel IF formula in action\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the example above, I awarded 10 points to everyone in Gryffindor. If I later wanted to sum the total number of points, I wouldn't be able to because the 10's are in quotes, thus making them text and not a number that Excel can sum.</p> \n<h3>11. Use dollar signs to keep one cell's formula the same regardless of where it moves.</h3> \n<p>Have you ever seen a dollar sign in an Excel formula? When used in a formula, it isn't representing an American dollar; instead, it makes sure that the exact column and row are held the same even if you copy the same formula in adjacent rows.</p> \n<p>You see, a cell reference — when you refer to cell A5 from cell C5, for example — is relative by default. In that case, you're actually referring to a cell that's five columns to the left (C minus A) and in the same row (5). This is called a relative formula. When you copy a relative formula from one cell to another, it'll adjust the values in the formula based on where it's moved. But sometimes, we want those values to stay the same no matter whether they're moved around or not — and we can do that by turning the formula into an absolute formula.</p> \n<p>To change the relative formula (=A5+C5) into an absolute formula, we'd precede the row and column values by dollar signs, like this: <strong>(=$A$5+$C$5)</strong>. (Learn more on Microsoft Office's support page <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Switch-between-relative-absolute-and-mixed-references-538396b3-990e-4b44-9d9c-28b4151d7d21\">here</a>.)</p> \n<h3>12. Use the VLOOKUP function to pull data from one area of a sheet to another.</h3> \n<p>Have you ever had two sets of data on two different spreadsheets that you want to combine into a single spreadsheet?</p> \n<p>For example, you might have a list of people's names next to their email addresses in one spreadsheet, and a list of those same people's email addresses next to their company names in the other — but you want the names, email addresses, and company names of those people to appear in one place.</p> \n<p>I have to combine data sets like this a lot — and when I do, the VLOOKUP is my go-to formula.</p> \n<p>Before you use the formula, though, be absolutely sure that you have at least one column that appears identically in both places. Scour your data sets to make sure the column of data you're using to combine your information is exactly the same, including no extra spaces.</p> \n<p>The formula: <strong>=VLOOKUP(lookup value, table array, column number, Approximate match (TRUE) or Exact match (FALSE))</strong></p> \n<p>The formula with variables from our example below: <strong>=VLOOKUP(C2,Sheet2!A:B,2,FALSE)</strong></p> \n<p>In this formula, there are several variables. The following is true when you want to combine information in Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 onto Sheet 1.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Lookup Value</strong>: This is the identical value you have in both spreadsheets. Choose the first value in your first spreadsheet. In the example that follows, this means the first email address on the list, or cell 2 (C2).</li> \n <li><strong>Table Array</strong>: The table array is the range of columns on Sheet 2 you're going to pull your data from, including the column of data identical to your lookup value (in our example, email addresses) in Sheet 1 as well as the column of data you're trying to copy to Sheet 1. In our example, this is \"Sheet2!A:B.\" \"A\" means Column A in Sheet 2, which is the column in Sheet 2 where the data identical to our lookup value (email) in Sheet 1 is listed. The \"B\" means Column B, which contains the information that's only available in Sheet 2 that you want to translate to Sheet 1.</li> \n <li><strong>Column Number</strong>: This tells Excel which column the new data you want to copy to Sheet 1 is located in. In our example, this would be the column that \"House\" is located in. \"House\" is the second column in our range of columns (table array), so our column number is 2. [<strong>Note</strong>: Your range can be more than two columns. For example, if there are three columns on Sheet 2 — Email, Age, and House — and you still want to bring House onto Sheet 1, you can still use a VLOOKUP. You just need to change the \"2\" to a \"3\" so it pulls back the value in the third column: =VLOOKUP(C2:Sheet2!A:C,3,false).]</li> \n <li><strong>Approximate Match (TRUE) or Exact Match (FALSE)</strong>: Use FALSE to ensure you pull in only exact value matches. If you use TRUE, the function will pull in approximate matches.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In the example below, Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 contain lists describing different information about the same people, and the common thread between the two is their email addresses. Let's say we want to combine both datasets so that all the house information from Sheet 2 translates over to Sheet 1.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-vlookup.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-vlookup.gif\" alt=\"Excel VLOOKUP function\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>So when we type in the formula <strong>=VLOOKUP(C2,Sheet2!A:B,2,FALSE)</strong>, we bring all the house data into Sheet 1.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that VLOOKUP will only pull back values from the second sheet that are to the right of the column containing your identical data. This can lead to some limitations, which is why some people prefer to use the INDEX and MATCH functions instead.</p> \n<h3>13. Use INDEX and MATCH formulas to pull data from horizontal columns.</h3> \n<p>Like VLOOKUP, the INDEX and MATCH functions pull in data from another dataset into one central location. Here are the main differences:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>VLOOKUP is a much simpler formula. If you're working with large data sets that would require thousands of lookups, using the INDEX and MATCH function will significantly decrease load time in Excel.</li> \n <li>The INDEX and MATCH formulas work right-to-left, whereas VLOOKUP formulas only work as a left-to-right lookup. In other words, if you need to do a lookup that has a lookup column to the right of the results column, then you'd have to rearrange those columns in order to do a VLOOKUP. This can be tedious with large datasets and/or lead to errors.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>So if I want to combine information in Sheet 1 and Sheet 2 onto Sheet 1, but the column values in Sheets 1 and 2 aren't the same, then to do a VLOOKUP, I would need to switch around my columns. In this case, I'd choose to do an INDEX and MATCH instead.</p> \n<p>Let's look at an example. Let's say Sheet 1 contains a list of people's names and their Hogwarts email addresses, and Sheet 2 contains a list of people's email addresses and the Patronus that each student has. (For the non-Harry Potter fans out there, every witch or wizard has an animal guardian called a \"Patronus\" associated with him or her.) The information that lives in both sheets is the column containing email addresses, but this email address column is in different column numbers on each sheet. I'd use the INDEX and MATCH formulas instead of VLOOKUP so I wouldn't have to switch any columns around.</p> \n<p>So what's the formula, then? The formula is actually the MATCH formula nested inside the INDEX formula. You'll see I differentiated the MATCH formula using a different color here.</p> \n<p>The formula: <strong>=INDEX(table array, MATCH formula)</strong></p> \n<p>This becomes:<strong> <strong>=INDEX(table array, MATCH (</strong><strong>lookup_value, lookup_array))</strong></strong></p> \n<p>The formula with variables from our example below: <strong>=INDEX(Sheet2!A:A,(MATCH(Sheet1!C:C,Sheet2!C:C,0)))</strong></p> \n<p>Here are the variables:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Table Array</strong>: The range of columns on Sheet 2 containing the new data you want to bring over to Sheet 1. In our example, \"A\" means Column A, which contains the \"Patronus\" information for each person.</li> \n <li><strong>Lookup Value</strong>: This is the column in Sheet 1 that contains identical values in both spreadsheets. In the example that follows, this means the \"email\" column on Sheet 1, which is Column C. So: Sheet1!C:C.</li> \n <li><strong>Lookup Array</strong>: This is the column in Sheet 2 that contains identical values in both spreadsheets. In the example that follows, this refers to the \"email\" column on Sheet 2, which happens to also be Column C. So: Sheet2!C:C.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you have your variables straight, type in the INDEX and MATCH formulas in the top-most cell of the blank Patronus column on Sheet 1, where you want the combined information to live.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-index-match.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-index-match.gif\" alt=\"Excel INDEX and MATCH functions in action\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>14. Use the COUNTIF function to make Excel count words or numbers in any range of cells.</h3> \n<p>Instead of manually counting how often a certain value or number appears, let Excel do the work for you. With the COUNTIF function, Excel can count the number of times a word or number appears in any range of cells.</p> \n<p>For example, let's say I want to count the number of times the word \"Gryffindor\" appears in my data set.</p> \n<p>The formula: <strong>=COUNTIF(range, criteria)</strong></p> \n<p>The formula with variables from our example below: <strong>=COUNTIF(D:D,\"Gryffindor\")</strong></p> \n<p>In this formula, there are several variables:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Range</strong>: The range that we want the formula to cover. In this case, since we're only focusing on one column, we use \"D:D\" to indicate that the first and last column are both D. If I were looking at columns C and D, I would use \"C:D.\"</li> \n <li><strong>Criteria</strong>: Whatever number or piece of text you want Excel to count. Only use quotation marks if you want the result to be text instead of a number. In our example, the criteria is \"Gryffindor.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Simply typing in the COUNTIF formula in any cell and pressing \"Enter\" will show me how many times the word \"Gryffindor\" appears in the dataset.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-countif.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-countif.gif\" alt=\"Excel COUNTIF function\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>15. Combine cells using &amp;.</h3> \n<p>Databases tend to split out data to make it as exact as possible. For example, instead of having a column that shows a person's full name, a database might have the data as a first name and then a last name in separate columns. Or, it may have a person's location separated by city, state, and zip code. In Excel, you can combine cells with different data into one cell by using the \"&amp;\" sign in your function.</p> \n<p>The formula with variables from our example below: <strong>=A2&amp;\" \"&amp;B2</strong></p> \n<p>Let's go through the formula together using an example. Pretend we want to combine first names and last names into full names in a single column. To do this, we'd first put our cursor in the blank cell where we want the full name to appear. Next, we'd highlight one cell that contains a first name, type in an \"&amp;\" sign, and then highlight a cell with the corresponding last name.</p> \n<p>But you're not finished — if all you type in is =A2&amp;B2, then there will not be a space between the person's first name and last name. To add that necessary space, use the function <strong>=A2&amp;\" \"&amp;B2</strong>. The quotation marks around the space tell Excel to put a space in between the first and last name.</p> \n<p>To make this true for multiple rows, simply drag the corner of that first cell downward as shown in the example.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-combine-function.gif?width=650&amp;name=excel-combine-function.gif\" alt=\"Excel combination of cells\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>16. Add checkboxes.</h3> \n<p>If you're using an Excel sheet to track customer data and want to oversee something that isn't quantifiable, you could insert checkboxes into a column.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're using an Excel sheet to manage your sales prospects and want to track whether you called them in the last quarter, you could have a \"Called this quarter?\" column and check off the cells in it when you've called the respective client.</p> \n<p>Here's how to do it.</p> \n<p>Highlight a cell you'd like to add checkboxes to in your spreadsheet. Then, click DEVELOPER. Then, under FORM CONTROLS, click the checkbox or the selection circle highlighted in the image below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-checkboxes.png?width=300&amp;name=excel-checkboxes.png\" alt=\"Excel checkboxes\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Once the box appears in the cell, copy it, highlight the cells you also want it to appear in, and then paste it.</p> \n<h3>17. Hyperlink a cell to a website.</h3> \n<p>If you're using your sheet to track social media or website metrics, it can be helpful to have a reference column with the links each row is tracking. If you add a URL directly into Excel, it should automatically be clickable. But, if you have to hyperlink words, such as a page title or the headline of a post you're tracking, here's how.</p> \n<p>Highlight the words you want to hyperlink, then press Shift K. From there a box will pop up allowing you to place the hyperlink URL. Copy and paste the URL into this box and hit or click Enter.</p> \n<p>If the key shortcut isn't working for any reason, you can also do this manually by highlighting the cell and clicking <strong>Insert</strong> &gt; <strong>Hyperlink</strong>.</p> \n<h3>18. Add drop-down menus.</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, you'll be using your spreadsheet to track processes or other qualitative things. Rather than writing words into your sheet repetitively, such as \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Customer Stage\", \"Sales Lead\", or \"Prospect\", you can use dropdown menus to quickly mark descriptive things about your contacts or whatever you're tracking.</p> \n<p>Here's how to add drop-downs to your cells.</p> \n<p>Highlight the cells you want the drop-downs to be in, then click the Data menu in the top navigation and press Validation.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/excel-drop-down-menu.png?width=300&amp;name=excel-drop-down-menu.png\" alt=\"Excel drop-down menu option\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>From there, you'll see a Data Validation Settings box open. Look at the Allow options, then click Lists and select Drop-down List. Check the In-Cell dropdown button, then press OK.</p> \n<h2>Other Excel Help Resources</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-build-excel-graph\">How to Make a Chart or Graph in Excel [With Video Tutorial]</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/excel-graph-tricks-list\">Design Tips to Create Beautiful Excel Charts and Graphs</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-with-excel-templates-list\">Totally Free Microsoft Excel Templates That Make Marketing Easier</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/learn-excel-resources\">How to Learn Excel Online: Free and Paid Resources for Excel Training</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Use Excel to Automate Processes in Your Team</h2> \n<p>Even if you’re not an accountant, you can still use Excel to automate tasks and processes in your team.

But I had one small problem — I only weighed 100 pounds and could barely hit the ball out of the infield. Even though I still had four years to bulk up and improve my skills, I knew I had a long way to go before I could play at the collegiate level.</p> \n <p>Fortunately, my high school coach always gave me opportunities to shoot for that kept my drive alive. After a grueling practice or workout, he would harp on how a long-term goal is just a series of short-term goals, and he made us write down our off-season training goals every year. But he didn't just accept the first draft of your goal sheet. He would make you edit it until you knew exactly what your goals were and how you were going to achieve them.</p> \n <p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=a482387e-c9f6-456b-b92f-4ba795780b19&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download your free marketing goal-setting template here.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a482387e-c9f6-456b-b92f-4ba795780b19.png\" align=\"middle\" /></a></p> \n <p>Setting a goal like \"improve upper body strength\" wasn't enough.

The reason why successful marketing teams always hit their numbers is that they also set SMART goals. Use the template above to follow along and create your own SMART goals.</p> \n <a></a> \n <h2>What are SMART goals?</h2> \n <p>SMART goals are concrete targets that you aim to hit over a certain period. These goals should be carefully drafted by a manager and their direct report to set them up for success. \"SMART\" is an acronym that describes the most important characteristics of each goal.</p> \n <p>The \"SMART\" acronym stands for \"specific,\" \"measurable,\" \"attainable,\" \"relevant,\" and \"time-bound.\" Each SMART goal should have these five characteristics to ensure the goal can be reached and benefits the employee. Find out what each characteristic means below, and how to write a SMART goal that exemplifies them.</p> \n <a></a> \n <h2>Why are SMART goals important?</h2> \n <p>When you make goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound, you're increasing your odds for success by verifying that the goal is achievable, identifying the metrics that define success, and creating a roadmap to reach those metrics.</p> \n <p>SMART goals are important to set as they:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Help you work with clear intentions, not broad or vague goals</li> \n  <li>Provide a method to gauge your success by setting benchmarks to meet</li> \n  <li>Give sensible objectives that are realistic and achievable</li> \n  <li>Cut out unnecessary or irrelevant work that could take away from what’s important</li> \n  <li>Set a clear beginning and end to adhere to in reaching your goals</li> \n </ul> \n <p>If your goals are abstract, if you don't know what it will take to achieve success, or if you don't give yourself a deadline to complete steps, you may lose focus and fall short of what you want to accomplish.</p> \n <h3>Do SMART goals actually work?</h3> \n <p>In short — yes, <em>if done correctly</em>. Setting unrealistic goals and trying to measure them without consideration of previous performance, overly short time frames, or including too many variables will lead you off course.</p> \n <p>These goals work if formulated properly and if they take into account the motive and cadence of those working on them. Additionally, your SMART goals can only succeed when the employees working towards them have the means to achieve them.</p> \n <p>Let’s take a look at some realistic examples of SMART goals to paint a clearer picture of what they are.</p> \n <a></a> \n <p></p> \n <h3>1.

Use specific wording.</h3> <p>When writing SMART goals, keep in mind that they are \"specific\" in that there's a hard and fast destination the employee is trying to reach. \"Get better at my job,\" isn't a SMART goal because it isn't specific. Instead, ask yourself: What are you getting better at? How much better do you want to get?</p> <p>If you're a marketing professional, your job probably revolves around <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/choosing-kpis\">key performance indicators</a> or KPIs. Therefore, you might choose a particular KPI or metric that you want to improve on — like visitors, leads, or customers. You should also identify the team members working toward this goal, the resources they have, and their plan of action.</p> <p>In practice, a specific SMART goal might say, \"Clifford and Braden will increase the blog's traffic from email ...\" You know exactly who's involved and what you're trying to improve on.</p> <h4>Common SMART Goal Mistake: Vagueness</h4> <p>While you may need to keep some goals more open-ended, you should avoid vagueness that could confuse your team later on. For example, instead of saying, \"Clifford will boost email marketing experiences,\" say \"Clifford will boost email marketing click rates by 10%.\"</p> <p></p> <h3>2. Include measurable goals.</h3> <p>SMART goals should be \"measurable\" in that you can track and quantify the goal's progress. \"Increase the blog's traffic from email,\" by itself, isn't a SMART goal because you can't measure the increase. Instead, ask yourself: How much email marketing traffic should you strive for?</p> <p>If you want to gauge your team's progress, you need to quantify your goals, like achieving an X-percentage increase in visitors, leads, or customers.</p> <p>Let's build on the SMART goal we started three paragraphs above. Now, our measurable SMART goal might say, \"Clifford and Braden will increase the blog's traffic from email by 25% more sessions per month ... \" You know what you're increasing, and by how much.</p> <h4>Common SMART Goal Mistake: No KPIs</h4> <p>This is in the same light of avoiding vagueness. While you might need qualitative or open-ended evidence to prove your success, you should still come up with a quantifiable KPI. For example, instead of saying, \"Customer service will improve customer happiness,\" say, \"We want the average call satisfaction score from customers to be a seven out of ten or higher.\"</p> <h3>3. Aim for realistically attainable goals.</h3> <p>An \"attainable\" SMART goal considers the employee's ability to achieve it. Make sure that X-percentage increase is rooted in reality. If your blog traffic increased by 5% last month, try to increase it by 8-10% this month, rather than a lofty 25%.</p> <p>It's crucial to base your goals on your own analytics, not industry benchmarks, or else you might bite off more than you can chew. So, let's add some \"attainability\" to the SMART goal we created earlier in this blog post: \"Clifford and Braden will increase the blog's traffic from email by 8-10% more sessions per month ... \" This way, you're not setting yourself up to fail.</p> <h4>Common SMART Goal Mistake: Unattainable Goals</h4> <p>Yes. You should always aim to improve. But reaching for completely unattainable goals may knock you off course and make it harder to track progress. Rather than saying, \"We want to make 10,000% of what we made in 2021,\" consider something more attainable, like, \"We want to increase sales by 150% this year,\" or \"We have a quarterly goal to reach a 20% year-over-year sales increase.\"</p> <h3>4. Pick relevant goals that relate to your business.</h3> <p>SMART goals that are \"relevant\" relate to your company's overall business goals and account for current trends in your industry. For instance, will growing your traffic from email lead to more revenue? And, is it actually possible for you to significantly <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/23965/9-email-marketing-best-practices-to-generate-more-leads.aspx\">boost your blog's email traffic</a> given your current email marketing campaigns?</p> <p>If you're aware of these factors, you’re more likely to set goals that benefit your company — not just you or your department.</p> <p>So, what does that do to our SMART goal? It might encourage you to adjust the metric you're using to track the goal's progress. For example, maybe your business has historically relied on organic traffic for generating leads and revenue, and research suggests you can generate more qualified leads this way.</p> <p>Our SMART goal might instead say, \"Clifford and Braden will increase the blog's organic traffic by 8-10% more sessions per month.\" This way, your traffic increase is aligned with the business's revenue stream.</p> <h4>Common SMART Goal Mistake: Losing Sight of the Company</h4> <p>When your company is doing well, it can be easy to say you want to pivot or grow in another direction. While companies can successfully do this, you don't want your team to lose sight of how the core of your business works.</p> <p>Rather than saying, \"We want to start a new B2B business on top of our B2C business,\" say something like, \"We want to continue increasing B2C sales while researching the impact our products could have on the B2B space in the next year.\"</p> <h3>5. Make goals time-bound by including a timeframe and deadline information.</h3> <p>A \"time-bound\" SMART goal keeps you on schedule. Improving on a goal is great, but not if it takes too long. Attaching deadlines to your goals puts a healthy dose of pressure on your team to accomplish them. This helps you make consistent and significant progress in the long term.</p> <p>For example, which would you prefer: increasing organic traffic by 5% every month, leading to a 30-35% increase in half a year? Or trying to increase traffic by 15% with no deadline and achieving that goal in the same timeframe? If you picked the former, you're right.</p> <p>So, what does our SMART goal look like once we bound it to a timeframe? \"Over the next three months, Clifford and Braden will work to increase the blog's organic traffic by 8-10%, reaching a total of 50,000 organic sessions by the end of August.”</p> <h4>Common SMART Goal Mistake: No Time Frame</h4> <p>Having no timeframe or a really broad span of time noted in your goal will cause the effort to get reprioritized or make it hard for you to see if your team is on track. Rather than saying. \"This year, we want to launch a major campaign,\" say, \"In quarter one, we will focus on campaign production in order to launch the campaign in quarter two.\"</p> <h2>Make Your SMART Goals SMART-er</h2> <p>Now that you know what a SMART goal is, why it's important, and the framework to create one, it's time to put that information into practice. Whether you're setting goals for a personal achievement or as part of hitting important marketing milestones, it's good to start with what you want to achieve and then reverse-engineer it into a concrete SMART goal.</p> <p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in December 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> <p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=25ef9b24-9a2a-479e-9994-c7e62e7037f7&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call to action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/25ef9b24-9a2a-479e-9994-c7e62e7037f7.png\" /></a></p> \n  <div> \n   <a class=\"close\"> </a> \n   <a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=e6052733-6314-48b7-b224-1d42c04561fe&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e6052733-6314-48b7-b224-1d42c04561fe.png\" /></a> \n  </div> </br>\n</div> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsmart-goal-examples&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a482387e-c9f6-456b-b92f-4ba795780b19.png","linkMd5":"648af3d95a169ccb9ba5e0019f255ff9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn41@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-38-384_f9874034bd791f68.webp","destWidth":523,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4586,"destBytes":7842,"author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a482387e-c9f6-456b-b92f-4ba795780b19.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn41@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-38-384_f9874034bd791f68.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/5%20Dos%20and%20Donts%20When%20Making%20a%20SMART%20Goal%20%5BExamples%5D.png?width=624&name=5%20Dos%20and%20Donts%20When%20Making%20a%20SMART%20Goal%20%5BExamples%5D.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn49@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-53-710_6c96a3e65f8b37ca.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/25ef9b24-9a2a-479e-9994-c7e62e7037f7.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn28@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-52-124_8c2de866bf966577.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e6052733-6314-48b7-b224-1d42c04561fe.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn25@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-52-480_e2d0212c82fab1f7.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fsmart-goal-examples&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-49-267_64a77ca592000c86.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938166},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"How to Calculate Standard Deviation in Excel, and Why It Matters for Marketers","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/standard-deviation-excel","description":"<p>If you’ve ever taken a statistics class, the words ‘standard deviation’ might intimidate you. This complex formula provides insightful information for datasets that averages alone cannot reveal, and thankfully, Excel makes calculating this statistic easier than putting pencil to paper.</p> \n<p>Standard deviation is frequently used by financial professionals as it can help determine risks in stock portfolios and is often applied to return on investment (ROI).</p> \n<p>For marketing professionals, standard deviation can reveal variabilities and risks in datasets that will ultimately help guide campaign decisions.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What is standard deviation?</h2> \n<p>Simply put, standard deviation is a mathematical term that measures the variation in a set of values. In marketing, standard deviation can help account for widely varying costs or sales. If the numbers in a data set are spread far apart, they have a higher standard deviation.</p> \n<p>This measurement can help assess risk when deciding how much budget can be allocated toward certain campaigns based on the standard deviation of the ROI, just to name one example.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How to Calculate Standard Deviation in Excel</h2> \n<p>There are six standard deviation formulas in Excel, which will be used based on whether you need to calculate sample standard deviation or population standard deviation. This is easy to identify in Excel, as the three formulas for population standard deviation include a P (.P, PA, or P at the end of STDEV).</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>STDEV.S</li> \n <li>STDEVA</li> \n <li>STDEV</li> \n <li>STDEV.P, STDEVPA, STDEVP</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>STDEV.S</h3> \n<p>If you are dealing with sample standard deviation and do not need to account for text or logical values, STDEV.S is the formula you will use to calculate standard deviation in Excel.</p> \n<h3>STDEVA</h3> \n<p>Alternatively, if you do need to account for text and logical values, use STDEVA, which will consider text and FALSE logical values to 0, while TRUE logical values will be read as 1.</p> \n<h3>STDEV</h3> \n<p>STDEV is simply the sample standard deviation formula that will work with older forms of Excel (2007 and before). It is the same as STDEV.S.</p> \n<h3>STDEVP, STDEVPA, STDEVP</h3> \n<p>You will almost exclusively use STDEV.S, STDEVA, or STDEV. When determining population standard deviation, you would have to include all datasets for the entirety of the population.</p> \n<p>This can actually be far more data and much less useful than examining a smaller portion of the data, or a sample, in which case you would use one of the sample standard deviation formulas.</p> \n<p>If you did, for some reason, need to determine the population standard deviation, you could still retrieve sample standard deviations and apply them to the larger dataset. The likelihood of needing these population standard deviation formulas is slim.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/stdevp-function-1f7c1c88-1bec-4422-8242-e9f7dc8bb195\">As stated by Microsoft</a>, “[STDEVP] has been replaced with one or more new functions that may provide improved accuracy and with names that better reflect their usage. Although this function is still available for backward compatibility, you should consider using the new functions from now on, because this function may not be available in future versions of Excel.”</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Sample of Standard Deviation in Excel</h2> \n<p>STDEV.S, STDEVA, or STDEV will be the most common formulas to use for marketers looking to calculate sample standard deviation in Excel.</p> \n<p>These formulas specifically calculate standard deviation for a sample of a dataset, so the result will determine the amount of variability from the average (mean) of the data.</p> \n<p>Next, we will determine how to find and use standard deviation formulas in an Excel spreadsheet.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Standard Deviation Excel Formula</h2> \n<p>As mentioned above, there are a total of six standard deviation Excel formulas, although you’ll only need one or two of them (depending on the version of Excel you use).</p> \n<p>The syntax of the standard deviation formula in Excel for STDEV.S is</p> \n<p><strong>STDEV.S(number1,[number2],...)</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Number1</strong>&nbsp;is required and refers to&nbsp;“The first number argument corresponding to a sample of a population. You can also use a single array or a reference to an array instead of arguments separated by commas,” <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/stdev-s-function-7d69cf97-0c1f-4acf-be27-f3e83904cc23\">as explained by Microsoft</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Number2, …</strong>&nbsp;is optional. You can include up to 254 number arguments that refer to sample sets or data of a population, or you can use an array or reference to an array instead of number arguments.</p> \n<p>This is the STDEV.S formula used by Excel:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Calculate%20Standard%20Deviation%20in%20Excel,%20and%20Why%20It%20Matters%20for%20Marketers-1.png?width=115&amp;height=78&amp;name=How%20to%20Calculate%20Standard%20Deviation%20in%20Excel,%20and%20Why%20It%20Matters%20for%20Marketers-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"115\" height=\"78\"></p> \n<p><em>x</em>&nbsp;is the sample mean AVERAGE(number1,number2,…) and <em>n</em>&nbsp;is the sample size.

In Excel, navigate to the “Formulas'' header in the topmost navigation bar. For Excel versions after 2007, the second navigation bar offers a list of popular formulas, and at the end, “More Functions.” Click “More Functions” then “Statistical” and finally scroll down to the STDEV.S or other standard deviation formula for which you need. You can then input Number1 and Number2, ….</p> \n<p>Those using an older version of Excel will not have the STDEV.S formula, but they will similarly be able to navigate to STDEV.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Why Standard Deviation is Important to Marketers</h2> \n<p>Perhaps this seems simple to some marketing professionals, or maybe this is a lot of statistical speak that sounds complex. Either way, mastering this formula and Excel function is crucial for marketers.</p> \n<p>In marketing, discussing averages for datasets is commonplace, and this can be insightful. But it can also leave out some crucial information that could impact a campaign.</p> \n<p>Standard deviation can show risks, volatility, or variability in a dataset. An average might show a promising campaign to allocate money toward, but standard deviation can show the potential risk and reward of a campaign. Together, averages and standard deviations can offer a comprehensive look at a dataset, so marketers can make the best decisions based on all of the information at hand.</p> \n<p>For example, let’s say we have two companies with different order averages.</p> \n<p>Company one has an order average of $1,000. Company two has an order average of $1,500.</p> \n<p>But Company two has a standard deviation of $500, while Company one has a standard deviation of $50. Company two has a higher order average on the surface, but a deeper dive shows that it is riskier.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Standard Deviation Can Help Marketers Assess Risk</h2> \n<p>Averages can be meaningful in showing marketers promising campaigns and to forecast their results. But what averages don’t show are the risk and variability within the data.</p> \n<p>A higher average sales number might not show a huge range of variability, and ultimately, risk. While standard deviation has long been used in finance to assess risk of stock portfolios and help professionals determine where to invest or what to expect for ROI, marketers can also benefit from using this statistical analysis in their own work.</p> \n<p>They just might find some profitable surprises and avoid risky, volatile campaigns or companies by looking at both averages and standard deviation when making decisions.</p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fstandard-deviation-excel&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 17:07:05 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b4e4803b87701cb5859186e62b1c03ef","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Paige Bennett","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Calculate%20Standard%20Deviation%20in%20Excel,%20and%20Why%20It%20Matters%20for%20Marketers-1.png?width=115&height=78&name=How%20to%20Calculate%20Standard%20Deviation%20in%20Excel,%20and%20Why%20It%20Matters%20for%20Marketers-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-49-717_db07adaf94dd872c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Calculate%20Standard%20Deviation%20in%20Excel,%20and%20Why%20It%20Matters%20for%20Marketers.png?width=624&height=351&name=How%20to%20Calculate%20Standard%20Deviation%20in%20Excel,%20and%20Why%20It%20Matters%20for%20Marketers.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-50-743_d0c6f0625d1e4e24.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fstandard-deviation-excel&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn69@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-52-672_91829b62be373c21.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938164},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"21 of the Best Brands on Instagram Right Now","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-brands-on-instagram","description":"<p>Contrary to what your friends' photos suggest, Instagram isn't just a<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\"> </a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar?_ga=2.167178366.1534219586.1623451039-1521708227.1623451039\">social network</a> for selfies and brunch pics.

Are users moving away from Facebook?</p> \n<p>Let’s see what the data says and what it means for brands.</p> \n<p>We surveyed 301 people in the United States and asked, \"<em>Which social media platform do you spend the most time on each week?</em>\" The response was kind of surprising.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/where-users-spend-most-time-on-social-media.png?width=500&amp;name=where-users-spend-most-time-on-social-media.png\" alt=\"Where users spend the most time on social media\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Despite YouTube’s steady growth over the past year and the rise of TikTok and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-clubhouse\">Clubhouse</a>, Facebook remains the top social media platform. YouTube follows, with the gap between the platform and Facebook much smaller in larger surveys.</p> \n<p>So, what does this information really mean?</p> \n<p>Well, in a broad sense, it means you should consider having a presence on these platforms. However, don’t delete your Instagram account just yet – better yet, don’t delete it at all.</p> \n<p>I’ll explain why in the next section.</p> \n<h2>Should brands limit their efforts to the most popular platforms?</h2> \n<p>There’s no single, clear-cut answer to this... but typically, no.</p> \n<p>While most consumers may spend most of their time on Facebook and <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/youtube-marketing\">YouTube</a>, that doesn’t mean you should dedicate all your efforts entirely to those platforms.</p> \n<p>Why? That may not be where <em>your</em> audience lives.</p> \n<p>Generality is the enemy of marketing. Imagine running a social media ad that targets everyone. Or having a target audience comprising all of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gen-z-stats\">Gen Z</a>.</p> \n<p>This sort of one-size-fits-all isn’t conducive to your brand’s growth. In fact, it is likely keeping you from making progress, as you waste time and resources on broad strategies that may not work for your specific market.</p> \n<p>It’s like going to a party and only getting an address for the neighborhood. Sure, you could drive around and knock on every door until you find the right one, but by that point, you might be tired, hungry, and out of gas.</p> \n<p>When you zero in on a specific audience and strategy, you can gain more valuable insights and get a higher return on investment.</p> \n<p>Data, just like the one above, should be used as a general guide to understand consumer behavior. However, it shouldn’t dictate your entire strategy. Your <em>own </em>consumer data and user persona(s) should.</p> \n<p>For instance, let’s say you’ve discovered through market research that your audience enjoys consuming information mostly through blogs and podcasts. That’s a good indicator of where you should focus your efforts. In a few years, that data may change, in which case, your team should be flexible and move to where your audience is going.</p> \n<p>Here’s what you should consider when determining where to direct your efforts:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Where your audience lives</li> \n <li>The type of content you’ll be creating</li> \n <li>The channel that converts the best</li> \n</ul> \n<p>There are a few ways to figure out where your audience \"hangs out\" online. First, you can check the demographics by platform – this will give you a general idea of the audience.</p> \n<p>For instance, TikTok mostly caters to a younger audience between <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095186/tiktok-us-users-age/\">10 to 29 years old</a> while most Instagram users are between <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/398166/us-instagram-user-age-distribution/\">18 to 34 years old</a>.</p> \n<p>You can also reach out to your target audience directly through polls and survey to find out where they spend their time. In addition, look to your competitors.</p> \n<p>See where they’re focusing their efforts and if they are successful, that may be a good indication of where you should be. Like when you’re not sure you went to the right place but see someone you know parking and you can let out a sigh of relief.</p> \n<p>Next is the type of content you’ll be creating.</p> \n<p>Say your audience enjoys video content the most (think webinars, lives, video tutorials). In this case, your audience would be well suited for YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok, all of which have video editing and publishing features. You can then repurpose your content for each platform.</p> \n<p>Another factor to consider is how each channel is contributing to your goals. This is where the importance of data comes in.</p> \n<p>You may be posting every day on TikTok and find that the rare times you post on Facebook, you get much higher engagement and conversion rates.

Willing to share it with the public?</p> \n<p>Search histories can tell a story about a person and what they're thinking.</p> \n<p>But I can't imagine anyone would willingly give up their personal search history — especially if it identifies them — without some sort of incentive.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, we can tap into Google Trends for these insights.</p> \n<p>Let's dive into what Google Trends is, where the data comes from, and how you can use Google Trends for market research, product innovation, and more.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: SEO Starter Pack [Free Kit]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What is Google Trends?</h2> \n<p>\"Explore what the world is searching\" greets you on the <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends homepage</a>&nbsp;and accurately reflects what the tool does.</p> \n<p>Google Trends visualizes trending topics, search terms, and news on Google. It provides real-time data regarding <em>current</em>&nbsp;trends from the past seven days, as well as <em>past</em>&nbsp;trends, which dates back to 2004.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Where Does Google Trends Data Come From</h2> \n<p>Google Trends includes anonymized samples — real-time and non-real-time — of search requests made to Google, which is then categorized into topics.</p> \n<p>Because we can see trends by location, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4365533?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6248052#:~:text=How%20is%20Google%20Trends%20data%20normalized\">the data is normalized</a>&nbsp;to ensure regions with the most search volume do not consistently rank the highest.</p> \n<p>To normalize the data, Google divides each data point by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents to compare relative popularity. Those numbers are then scaled on a range of 0 to 100, based on a topic's proportion to all searches on all topics.</p> \n<p>One major caveat to the data is that Google retains queries that may come from \"irregular activity.\" <a href=\"https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4365533?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6248052#:~:text=What%20searches%20are%20included%20in%20Google%20Trends\">Google says</a>&nbsp;this is done to preserve the quality of the search data provided from other Google tools.</p> \n<p>Simply put, if Google filtered out the spammy activity from Trends, spammers could then use the tool to understand which words are identified as spam, and adjust accordingly.</p> \n<p>In addition to the search query data, <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/trendingsearches/realtime?geo=US&amp;category=all\">the Realtime Search Trends report</a>&nbsp;also includes the number of Google News articles written per hour.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How to Use Google Trends</h2> \n<p>Google Trends has several ways to slice and dice the data. Google Trends has four main sections:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Explore</li> \n <li>Trending Searches</li> \n <li>Year in Search</li> \n <li>Subscriptions</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The data can be filtered by location, date, categories, search section (i.e., News vs. Shopping), and even by topics vs. search terms. Rather than walking through each section and visualization, let's see how they can apply to common marketing tasks.</p> \n<h3>1. Use Google Trends for Market Research</h3> \n<p>Need to understand the interest in your product or service to launch in a new market?</p> \n<p>Google Trends Explore can help you understand how seasonality and location might affect your product or service.</p> \n<p>In the Country drop-down selector below your query, for instance, you can filter down to a metropolitan area or click into the options on the map. You can also change the date to expand or decrease the history — but keep in mind the sample will change if you select a time within seven days.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/market-research-section-min.png?width=771&amp;name=market-research-section-min.png\" alt=\"market-research-section-min\" width=\"771\" style=\"width: 771px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>As you are typing in your query, notice the auto-populated options. Anything that does</p> \n<p>not have a \"search term\" underneath it is a Topic. Topics are aggregated categories, while search terms focus on keywords. The same applies to the \"Related topics\" and \"Related queries\" tables. Start broader with a topic, and then narrow down to specific search terms as you analyze the results.</p> \n<h3>2. Test Out Google Trends for Newsjacking</h3> \n<p>Do you use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/newsjacking-examples\">newsjacking</a>&nbsp;to help generate content? Then you should definitely use <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/subscriptions\">Google Trends subscriptions</a>. Sign up to get the top, most, or all search trends weekly, daily, or as they happen.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-alert-min.png?width=648&amp;name=email-alert-min.png\" alt=\"email-alert-min\" width=\"648\" style=\"width: 648px;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Leverage Google Trends for Keyword Research</h3> \n<p>Many keyword research tools show an expected monthly search volume. Unless you've been tracking that data month-by-month, it's hard to tell if searches for the topic are trending up or down. Google Trends can give you the directional data to pair with your monthly search volume.</p> \n<p>While you are checking trends for your keywords, you can find related queries that are on the rise to also consider in your keyword set.</p> \n<p>If you aren't sure what people might be searching for, use the topic presented by Google in auto-complete, where possible, and check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4355000\">the \"Related queries</a>\"&nbsp;filtered by Top queries. Once you've found different terms in the related queries, add, up to five, to compare them.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/compare-min.png?width=1053&amp;name=compare-min.png\" alt=\"compare-min\" width=\"1053\" style=\"width: 1053px;\"></p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Make sure you are using search terms. Wrapping your search in quotations ensures the whole phrase is used in that order. You can further <a href=\"https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4359582?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=4365530\">refine your search with punctuation</a>&nbsp;to include or exclude certain words.</p> \n<h3>4. Use Google Trends for Product Innovation</h3> \n<p>Are you looking for insights into the latest colors, materials, or styles for your product? Suppose you start broadly with a topic in Explore.</p> \n<p>In that case, the \"Related queries\" filtered by Rising can surface trending colors, materials, or other product innovations and indicate how much the interest has increased in the selected time frame. Those marked with Breakout show a significant increase from the previous period, growing more than 5000%.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rising-related-queries-min.png?width=1161&amp;name=rising-related-queries-min.png\" alt=\"rising-related-queries-min\" width=\"1161\" style=\"width: 1161px;\"></p> \n<h3>5. Employ Google Trends for Topic Clustering</h3> \n<p>Hopefully, you understand the difference between search terms and topics in Trends by now.</p> \n<p>With topics, Google Trends can help simplify your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/ignite-organic-growth-topic-cluster-strategy-hubspot?_ga=2.173600736.294127761.1622180794-1790977579.1622180794\">topic cluster strategy</a>. As you search for a term, Google will provide you with topics instead of just search terms, and once one is selected, lists \"Related topics\", too. You can get a sense for how Google News helps build relationships between topics by checking out the real-time search trends report.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/realtimetrends-min.png?width=952&amp;name=realtimetrends-min.png\" alt=\"realtimetrends-min\" width=\"952\" style=\"width: 952px;\"></p> \n<p>We can go even broader than topics, though. Once you've selected a term, you can then choose a Category. While these are meant to refine your search query, you can remove your search after a Category has been selected and be left with queries and topics tied to the high-level category.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/category-explore-min.png?width=943&amp;name=category-explore-min.png\" alt=\"category-explore-min\" width=\"943\" style=\"width: 943px;\"></p> \n<h3>6. Test Out Google Trends for Analyzing News Publications</h3> \n<p>Are you pitching to or working in the news? Then you want to dig into the <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/trendingsearches/\">Trending Searches data</a>.</p> \n<p>As mentioned before, the real-time trending searches lists how many Google News articles have been created about a trending topic each hour. Once you select a topic, the bar charts show the newly-added articles that hour and the cumulative total. You can see how the news may lead or follow the search trend.</p> \n<p>The articles listed are the top articles based on the Google News' ranking system, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/trends/answer/6248105?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6248052#zippy=%2Chow-are-the-related-news-articles-selected-under-daily-and-realtime-searches\">per Google</a>.

Good managers help employees navigate change.</h3> \n<p>Consider the last time you experienced change within your organization. Maybe a beloved leader retired, or perhaps your team experienced a reorg. Maybe you even acquired a new company.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whatever the reason, I'm willing to bet the change felt daunting at times. Fortunately, good managers can mitigate the negative or ambivalent emotions that arise from change.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For instance, Christine McLaughlin, a Senior Project Manager on HubSpot's Sales Leadership Enablement team, told me: \"The strongest managers are ones who can help their teams navigate change in a very personal way. I'm a firm believer that every challenge presents an opportunity. But, because we're human, we can't always see the opportunity from the start.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>McLaughlin adds, \"Our personal life, mental health, physical health, the last meeting we had, the next meeting we're preparing for, all play a role in influencing how we perceive change. Do we view it as a challenge? An opportunity? A setback? A relief?\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\"Strong managers can translate change for each individual on their team. They meet their teammate where they're at and help to answer their questions and concerns to bring them to where they need to go.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So … how can you do this? Start by fostering psychological safety, so your employees feel comfortable mentioning how they feel about a certain business change. Then, listen carefully to their concerns and work on providing solutions for those issues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say your team has experienced a reorg and one of your direct reports is concerned her role is going to change as a result.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To mitigate those concerns, consider creating a document that outlines which (if any) of her responsibilities might change as a result of the reorg — along with some new opportunities she can pursue to continue developing her professional skills.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>2. Good managers are open and transparent.</h3> \n<p>Trust and transparency are undeniably critical components of good leaders — and, post-pandemic, this is continuing to rise in importance. In fact, Edelman's most recent <a href=\"http://edelman.com/trust/2021-trust-barometer\"><span>2021 benchmark barometer on trust</span></a> in leaders found employees ranked \"good employee communication\" 44 points higher than in the previous year.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Keri Polmonari, HubSpot's Manager of Customer Success on the SMB team, believes transparency to be one of the most important attributes a good leader can possess.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>She says, \"Being transparent and forthcoming with your team creates an open and honest dialogue and ensures everyone is on the same page. Business changes — like changes in department goals, processes, or personnel — can be difficult and overwhelming. [But] when everyone understands the <em>why</em> behind these business changes, they are more open and understanding of implications this could have on their jobs, both positive and negative.\"</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Polmonari says,\"Transparency builds trust, fosters relationships, and creates organizational alignment, all key components of a company's, department's, and individual's success.\"</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/1-Jun-10-2021-02-38-06-55-PM.png?width=1104&amp;name=1-Jun-10-2021-02-38-06-55-PM.png\" alt=\"what does it mean to be a good manager? Keri's quote on the importance of transparency.\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<h3>3. Good managers encourage vulnerability.</h3> \n<p>Consider the last time your manager started your 1:1 with a slightly more personal question, like, \"How was your birthday this past weekend?\" or \"Read any good books lately?\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These questions ultimately help encourage vulnerability by creating space for you to share information about your life outside of work — and they can go a long way towards creating stronger bonds.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Jill Callan, VP of Marketing at <a href=\"https://www.trustedhealth.com/\"><span>Trusted Health</span></a>, told me, \"Whenever I start a new role or inherit a new team, I begin by enabling and encouraging vulnerability. This helps me forge strong bonds with my direct reports and allows them to be comfortable to share ideas and admit weaknesses.\"</p> \n<p>Callan adds, \"I'm also very intentional about getting to know my team as individuals, and learn about their lives outside of work. Taking the time upfront to build a strong, authentic relationship with my direct reports helps us tackle inevitable tough challenges down the line.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To encourage vulnerability, consider how you might increase your own openness with your team. For instance, perhaps you admit when you're feeling overwhelmed with childcare duties, mention a Netflix show you've been binging, or simply chat about the gardening hobby you've picked up.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And embrace vulnerability by admitting when you've made a mistake or you're feeling overwhelmed — it will help your employees feel comfortable admitting the same.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/2-Jun-10-2021-02-38-07-06-PM.png?width=1104&amp;name=2-Jun-10-2021-02-38-07-06-PM.png\" alt=\"what does it mean to be a good manager? Jill's quote on the importance of building authentic relationships.\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<h3>4. Good managers find ways to supplement their team member's weaknesses.</h3> \n<p>I once had a manager who repeatedly sought out learning and development opportunities for the areas we'd determined as weaknesses of mine. She would often email me public speaking courses, or data &amp; analytics workshops.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As a result, I continued to grow professionally, and I felt challenged. This is what a good manager does: Continues to keep a direct report's weaknesses in-mind, and provides guidance to help that employee improve.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>HubSpot Senior Manager Christina Perricone concurs, telling me, \"Good managers find ways to supplement their team member’s weaknesses. Each of us has skills that come naturally to us, as well as skills we’re not so great at.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"An attuned manager can identify an individual's weak areas and will surface resources or offer guidance to assist in those areas.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Consider how you might similarly foster growth by taking stock of your team's weaknesses, and actively pursuing resources that can help your team develop their weaker skills.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Additionally, use the hiring process to create a more well-rounded team by identifying strengths and weaknesses of existing employees.</p> \n<p>As Perricone says, \"Good managers are skilled at balancing out their teams by recruiting talent that can fill in the skill and experience gaps, thereby creating a more well-rounded unit.\"</p> \n<h3>5. Good managers work for their employees — not above them.</h3> \n<p>You might be thinking, \"Managers work for their employees? Isn't it the other way around?\"</p> \n<p>Actually, a manager, like an employee, is more effective when they're an active team player.</p> \n<p>But, while an employee's job is to fulfill tasks within a job description, a manager's job is to make his or her team successful. To do this, a manager shouldn't be afraid to chime in during meetings, assist on projects, or help their team grow or succeed in other ways.</p> \n<p>For instance, consider asking your direct reports during a 1:1, \"Is there anything you need me to do?\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This question can be translated in multiple positive ways, including, \"Are there any blockers I can remove for you?\", \"Are you waiting on a decision from me on anything?\", \"Are you working on an idea that you want to share with me?\" or even, \"Is there something going on in your world outside of work that's competing for your time and attention?\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a good manager considers it her primary job to make her employees successful in their projects and careers.</p> \n<h3>6. Good managers are always aiming to improve their emotional intelligence.</h3> \n<p>Emotional intelligence — or the skill that requires you to understand your own emotions, learn how to manage them, and know how to respond to the emotions of others on your team — is a vital component of good leadership.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Emotional intelligence can help you ensure you're giving clear directions, and allows you to be empathetic to the needs of others. In short, it can help you foster stronger professional relationships and communicate effectively.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Most importantly, emotional intelligence enables you to stay calm during high-stress or unexpected situations — which can prevent you from making rash decisions as a leader, or stressing your team out unnecessarily.</p> \n<h3>7. Good managers can establish and promote psychologically-safe environments.</h3> \n<p>The ability to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/psychological-safety-according-to-edmondson?_ga=2.239486723.1440891060.1623184284-154229254.1623184284\"><span>cultivate psychological safety</span></a> is a critical asset that Jennifer Stefancik, a HubSpot Academy Marketing Manager, values in her own people manager.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\"Feeling supported, heard, and understood is the foundation I need to be able to come to work every day with the right mindset to do good work,\" Stefancik says.&nbsp;</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Stefancik adds, \"Genuine empathy and psychological safety are hard to fake, and it's something that I think everyone should master before they consider the people management path.\"</p> \n<p>Psychological safety fosters innovative thinking and the ability to adapt well to change — and yet, according to a <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/psychological-safety-and-the-critical-role-of-leadership-development\"><span>2020 McKinsey Global Survey</span></a>, only a handful of business leaders often demonstrate the behaviors associated with psychological safety.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you're a manager or hoping to be a better leader, it's important you take time to identify aspects of your management style or overall office culture that could benefit from psychological safety.</p> \n<p>For example, rather than using language that makes your team members feel scared of missing deadlines or goals, keep an open and supportive dialogue with them so they can confidently come to you with successes, learnings from failure, or concerns while they're working on high-pressure projects.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how%20to%20be%20a%20good%20manager,%20quote%20from%20Jennifer%20on%20the%20importance%20of%20feeling%20supported%20by%20managers.png?width=1104&amp;name=how%20to%20be%20a%20good%20manager,%20quote%20from%20Jennifer%20on%20the%20importance%20of%20feeling%20supported%20by%20managers.png\" alt=\"how to be a good manager, quote from Jennifer on the importance of feeling supported by managers\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<p>Alternatively, if a team member is having trouble with a project, you should offer advice or assistance to help them remove blockers, rather than telling them to just get it done.</p> \n<p>Supportive communication with team members allows them to learn from mistakes and grow as employees, rather than work tirelessly on projects because they fear that they'll lose their jobs.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How to Be a Good Manager&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>As outlined in the data above, there are a few key traits required of any good manager. These include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Providing coaching and mentoring when necessary, but enabling your team to work autonomously and trusting them to get the job done.</li> \n <li>Showing empathy towards your direct reports as people with lives outside of work, and creating a sense of psychological safety for your employees to feel comfortable admitting when they're struggling or need help.</li> \n <li>Being clear and direct with feedback.</li> \n <li>Taking the time to go the extra mile to help foster your employees' professional growth through trainings, learning &amp; development opportunities, or 1:1 sessions in which you coach them on certain skills.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<p>However, a good manager looks different depending on the department or role — a good sales manager, for instance, requires different skills than that of a good marketing manager. Let's dive into those, now.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>How to Be a Good Sales Manager</h3> \n<p>Being a good sales manager requires a few unique skills outside of those listed above.</p> \n<p>Along with setting clear expectations, communicating effectively, and inspiring your sales reps to perform at their best, a good sales manager needs to demonstrate a positive mindset, build team unity, and learn how to best support each sales rep in the unique way that will serve him or her best.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A few other notes on being a good sales manager:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use a dashboard or <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/task-management\">task management tool</a> to easily track metrics for each sales rep. This enables you to avoid taking up too much time in your meetings discussing metrics — instead, you can now use that time to identify how you can best help, support, and coach your reps.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Plan team outings or events that allow your team to build relationships with one another. Sales can be high-pressure and stressful, so it's important you provide dedicated time to enable your sales reps to connect with one another and feel that they're part of a support system.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Look for trainings and development opportunities so your sales reps can continue to improve. In 1:1 meetings, focus on how you can help them achieve their goals; in team meetings, figure out what types of trainings can help the entire team perform better.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Motivate your team by focusing on the 'bigger purpose' to ensure they feel intrinsically motivated. Sales isn't just about hitting quota and making money — it's also (oftentimes) about selling a product or service that can help people in large or small ways. Remind your team of your company's bigger purpose to ensure they feel fulfilled and motivated.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Looking for more sales manager tips?

Learn about your direct report's strengths, interests, and areas for growth, and facilitate that growth by giving them projects when they align with their interests. This doesn't mean handing off any unwanted tasks from your to-do list — if you find a project that aligns with your direct report's interests and you feel it's mutually beneficial with team goals, then you'll want to shuffle some of their existing tasks to ensure you don't burn your team out.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To learn more about managing a marketing team, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-management\">What Is a Marketing Manager?</a></p> \n<h3>How to Be a Good Project Manager</h3> \n<p>To be a good project manager, you need a few additional technical skills compared to the other managers in this list. Project managers need a deep technical understanding of the project at-hand in order to understand which tasks need to be assigned to whom, and to keep the process running smoothly.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A few other project manager skills and responsibilities include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Being able to set realistic goals, and understanding what resources are required. A project manager needs to be able to set timelines on certain aspects of a project, and she also needs to understand what resources — including employees, external consultants, tools, or budgeting — are required to make it happen.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Having good organization and communication skills. A good project manager needs to remain organized and detail-oriented in order to effectively delegate tasks to the right teams, and stay on-top of identifying what needs to happen next for the project to go smoothly. A good project manager also needs to be able to clearly articulate the full scope of a project to various stakeholders to ensure each team is aligned on bigger-picture strategy.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Analyzing and determining potential risks. A good project manager needs to be able to foresee potential roadblocks in any given project, and analyze either internal metrics or industry data to determine the best way to mitigate those risks.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<p>A good project manager also uses the best tools at his or her disposal to create a streamlined process, keep track of responsibilities and timeline, and delegate effectively.

Regardless of our chosen professions, it's fair to say that we all want to build our businesses' customer bases. It's how we thrive. So it's only natural for us to want to market our products or services to everyone, in hopes of capturing a larger audience and thus making more money.</p> \n<p>But every business has a few \"unreachables.\" Now, some of these people are placed in that category for a reason. If you sell retirement plans, for instance, your unreachables might be children because they're simply too young to purchase your product. But that doesn't mean they have to remain that way forever. Even the most unexpected groups of people could be your biggest advocates later on. You just need to know how to speak to them.</p> \n<p>Here are some tips for successfully reaching your unreachables.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: State of Marketing Report [2021 Version]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>How to Reach Customers</h2> \n<h3>1. Make a list of your unreachables.</h3> \n<p>This is an important step you won't want to skip. Before you start trying to reach all different types of groups, you'll want to find out who your individual unreachables actually are. They may or may not be whom you think they are. That's why researching and surveying are important parts of this process.</p> \n<p>You might look at your current demographics for visitors to your website or social media platforms and determine which audiences aren't connecting with you. You might also try comparing your demographics to your competitors' to see if they're reaching an audience you might not be. Or, you could conduct interviews and send out questionnaires to gather additional information. Whatever methods of obtaining this data, be sure that in the end, you have answers to questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Why are these groups uninterested/uninformed about my business?</li> \n <li>Are they also uninterested/uninformed about the products/services I sell, too?</li> \n <li>Do they know they might want/need what I'm offering?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Develop a persona for your unreachables.</h3> \n<p>At this point, you've narrowed down exactly who your unreachables are, but the research stage isn't over just yet. You still want to find out what their likes and dislikes are, where they live, where they work, etc.</p> \n<p>Researching the specifics of their day-to-day lives can be helpful when brainstorming the message and channels to reach them. It can help you create a story that appeals to multiple audiences.</p> \n<p>You can create campaigns that are effective because they appeal to multiple audiences by finding common ground through storytelling.</p> \n<h3>3. Customize your approach to appeal to <em>them,</em> not your current customers.</h3> \n<p>This is a continuation of the previous action. When brainstorming ways to speak to your unreachables, it's important to remember that the same message that works really well for your current audience probably won't be received well by another—or at least not as effectively.</p> \n<p>A successful example of this is <a href=\"https://www.convinceandconvert.com/digital-marketing/killing-it-with-digital-marketing-campaigns/\">Dollar Shave Club's</a>&nbsp;marketing efforts. Marketers realized that they could reach a lot of the younger generations with humorous and quick-witted branding. The success of the brand stemmed from the viral nature of the ads that spoke to a much broader group of people than ever before.</p> \n<h3>4. Offer them something truly unique.</h3> \n<p>As wisely stated by <em>Entrepreneur</em> contributor Murray Newlands in his article, <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237040\">\"The 8 Fundamentals for a Successful Inbound-Marketing Strategy\"</a>, \"Think of your website as a hub, not a megaphone.\" This applies to all areas of your brand's presence—both online and offline. Treat your unreachables as if they are already your most loyal customers, rewarding them with valuable resources they can really use. Because if you can provide them with something they can't find elsewhere, it will build trust and credibility—two things that give you an instant leg up on your competition.</p> \n<p>Some valuable, yet still free/affordable resources you can offer include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Educational information, like e-books, guides, infographics, blog articles, webinars, tips, downloadable templates, etc.</li> \n <li>Coupons/exclusive discounts for first-time customers</li> \n <li>Product/service samples</li> \n <li>Branded merchandise</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As many in the industry may know already, this method of marketing (<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing\">inbound marketing</a>) has proven to be one of the most successful ways to promote your brand or business.</p> \n<h3>5. Generate awareness of the want/need for what you have to offer.</h3> \n<p>Your unreachables are most likely in the awareness stage of the buyer's journey—unsure whether or not they even want or need the product/service you're offering, let alone if they want it from your specific company. That's why you have to create reasons why someone might need you.</p> \n<p>Let's say you're a hotel that's running a special vacation package. An example of the awareness-stage buyers would be a mother and father who just found out they're able to take a vacation with their family soon but aren't yet sure if they want to stay local, travel abroad, or go on a cruise. By marketing your vacation package as the most all-inclusive, affordable, and family-friendly offer available, you're successfully generating awareness and a desire for your offer.</p> \n<h3>6. Demonstrate how your product/service could be the only solution they need.</h3> \n<p>Maybe your business offers a variety of products or services (i.e. multi-platform digital solutions). Or, maybe it offers something a little more niche (i.e. all-organic coffee). But no matter what you offer, there's always a way to position yourself as their all-purpose solution.</p> \n<p>Your unreachables might not even know your business can handle multiple problems they're experiencing. They might not know that just how well you've mastered your very specific product/service. Or, they might not know they need you. Either way, you'll want to demonstrate how you're the only solution.</p> \n<h3>7. Position your business in the most positive light possible.</h3> \n<p>Though it may hard to conceive, most people want to find out how you can help them, even if they're not actively seeking you out. If you've piqued their interest in some way, they'll want to find the good in your business, so they can have a product or service that provides a solution or added convenience to their lives.</p> \n<p>A few suggestions for keeping your efforts upbeat and positive:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use up-to-date content, design, and resources in your marketing efforts</li> \n <li>Use language that is confident and inviting, not cocky or abrasive</li> \n <li>Avoid negative messaging that puts down specific competitors (it's tacky)</li> \n <li>Highlight what specifically makes you better than the rest, but say it in a way that makes you look like the hero</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>8. Find ways to get your advocates to promote to them.</h3> \n<p>What's better than having happy customers who love your products/services? Having happy customers who willingly <em>promote</em> your products/services to others. If they're happy enough, they'll do it for free, too. It's like free advertising.</p> \n<p>This is your opportunity to reward your #1 fans with things like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Refer-a-friend offers/discounts/coupons</li> \n <li>Exclusive content</li> \n <li>Donations to fan-favorite charities</li> \n <li>Answered questions/concerns, personalized shout-outs, and Q&amp;A sessions on social media platforms</li> \n <li>Fan-appreciation events</li> \n <li>Featured fan videos/photos/etc.</li> \n <li>Project involvement</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Whether your business is able to spend a lot or a little toward rewarding your advocates, remember that there's a huge benefit in having people promote your business for you.</p> \n<h3>9. Show many forms of credibility.</h3> \n<p>In addition to having testimonials on top-rated review sites (or on your own website), there are a lot of ways to demonstrate that you are credible and trustworthy.</p> \n<p>Find unique (yet still truthful) ways to display this in your marketing efforts, such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Noteworthy awards or certifications (place a badge on your website, post a link to your social media platforms with information about the award/certification, etc.)</li> \n <li>Support a local charity (display information about it on a dedicated landing page on your site, post about it on social media, etc.)</li> \n <li>Mention any environmentally sustainable efforts you make at your business (recycling, volunteering for eco-friendly organizations, etc.</li> \n <li>Case studies and testimonials</li> \n</ul> Though this is certainly helpful for your current customers to confirm they've made the right choice with you, those who might not know they need you yet might find your business more desirable than another, simply for your credibility. Research the industry-specific materials you can provide your potential customers to let them know you are not just a viable option, but the best option. \n<h3>10. Do all of this in stages—not all at once.</h3> \n<p>Last, but certainly not least, make sure you do these things in different phases. Because it's not realistic to believe anyone's effort will magically attract everyone to your business, you should set goals, follow a strategic plan, and measure your results. Rinse and repeat as necessary for each audience.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of ways to speak to those who seem unreachable. You just have to find ways to make it about them and why they (specifically) would want or need you. If you're not sure how to get started, try these tips for expanding your reach.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April 2015 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"state of marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2F10-ways-to-speak-to-customers-who-dont-know-they-need-you&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png","linkMd5":"86679d143d5e41ed0864dfb7a4a7a752","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-363_0a6311d55189482b.webp","destWidth":505,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6246,"destBytes":8242,"author":"danielle@marketingzillas.com (Danielle Irigoyen)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn67@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-363_0a6311d55189482b.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-48-782_ba6ee21c8b9c368e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2F10-ways-to-speak-to-customers-who-dont-know-they-need-you&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn83@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-50-497_10e18042c8776074.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938117},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"SEO vs. PPC: When to Optimize and When to Pay for Traffic","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tabid/6307/bid/1514/paid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx","description":"<p>Imagine you’ve just created an excellent new product, and you're excited to share your business with the world.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, you have no idea how to share this revolutionary product with as many of your target users as possible.</p>  \n<p>You’re not alone.

And when these customers decide to click on your link, it comes at zero cost, unlike a PPC campaign where you pay per click.</p> \n<p>In the following image, you see that according to Ahrefs, Hubspot’s traffic value is a little over $22 million.

Search traffic is more stable.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>Once you rank on Google, you can be sure of free traffic to your website or web pages as long as you keep optimizing them.</p> \n<p>There’s also no off-and-on switch with SEO, unlike PPC marketing, where your website stops appearing on search results once your marketing budget dries up.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">4. Organic listings build brand authority.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>Appearing consistently on search results for keywords related to your products and services helps build trust and brand authority with your target audience.</p> \n<p>It also signifies to Google that you’re an expert on that topic or subject.</p> \n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Cons of SEO</span></strong></h3> \n<p>Here are some reasons why you might not love SEO:</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">1. Search engine algorithms change.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>Search engines, especially Google, have <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/\">changed their algorithm</a> many times over the years. These changes mean that you’ll have to keep a close eye on your marketing strategy and organic results.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">2. You’ll need to optimize your website regularly.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>Your job doesn’t end when you get your website to rank for target keywords. Over time, you’ll have to regularly optimize your content and web pages so that it continues to rank.</p> \n<p>Optimization might include refreshing old articles and removing old/expired links.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">3. SEO takes time to show results.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>If your website or domain is new, it’s unlikely that you’ll enjoy immediate results from SEO. The reason is that many factors affect how Google ranks websites.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">2. It requires high-level skills and expertise.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>If you’re not hiring a professional, you’ll need to be an excellent writer and SEO expert to optimize your site for search engines properly.</p> \n<p>It’s undoubtedly time-consuming and overwhelming to run a business while taking <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/results?q=seo&amp;library=true&amp;_ga=2.11489021.830295185.1621993439-1955934222.1621993439&amp;__hstc=45788219.ca6fa96b1444ad1af0b0b1debe5f22a0.1621995985031.1621995985031.1621995985031.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1621995985031&amp;__hsfp=2831226065\">technical SEO</a>, writing, and link-building classes.</p> \n<h3>What is PPC?</h3> \n<p>PPC, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.11489021.830295185.1621993439-1955934222.1621993439\">pay-per-click</a>, is a form of search engine marketing (SEM) where an advertiser pays a publisher (such as Google or Facebook) every time someone clicks on the ad. This model allows advertisers to pay only when consumers interact with their ads — meaning you attract people interested in your offer and ready to make a purchase.</p> \n<p>This method is mainly associated with search engines as advertisers bid on search keywords relevant to their target markets. You may have noticed that the top search results are tagged with an \"Ad\" marker.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4-hoOTBDh1tBOpOsMe9rzc0dxyIVkBIO1-wCEU5dsff1mDLduMwJQac--2-utPu_-TVwOg5iZVliwQD6VD7kSXKNkmSXCkU2bSwbtBAqWsli8u2z59TLOB_zHgwWFzMOicrfSXT1\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"what is ppc\"></p> \n<p>The cost of PPC ads usually depends on your industry and the search volume of the keyword you’re targeting.</p> \n<p>PPC advertising can help your business stay competitive in a crowded market and quickly get in front of their target consumers if you don’t have the domain authority to get your site ranking organically on search engines.</p> \n<h3>Pros of PPC</h3> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">1. PPC offers quick results.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>While it can take months to see results from your SEO strategy, it can take a few hours to see results from your PPC campaign.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">2. PPC ads appear above organic rankings.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>When you run a PPC campaign for your target keyword, your website would appear first on the search engine result page. This ranking makes your audience notice you first before scrolling to see other results.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">3. PPC allows you to pinpoint your target audience.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>While setting up a PPC campaign, you get to choose who you want to target with your ads.</p> \n<p>Do you want people from a specific geographic area? Or people of a particular age? Marital status? Or interest? If so, then you should use PPC.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">3. You can quickly run A/B tests on a PPC ad.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>With a PPC campaign, you can run two different ads simultaneously to measure the one that converts better.</p> \n<p>All you’ll have to do is change some ad elements like the ad copy and allow them to run for a period. Depending on the performance, you can decide to either “kill” the Google ads or continue optimization to improve your results.</p> \n<h3>Cons of PPC</h3> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">1. PPC ads are expensive.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>Without money, you cannot run a PPC campaign.</p> \n<p>You have to pay for every link that your audience clicks, meaning once your budget dries up, so does your traffic.</p> \n<p>Also, a PPC ad can get even more expensive (as high as $40) when you’re in a competitive industry like legal or insurance.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">2. Lower profit margins.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>While a PPC campaign might bring short-term wins, it’ll usually result in lower profit margins. Because PPC is a “pay to play” system, your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-does-cac-stand-for?_ga=2.243230795.830295185.1621993439-1955934222.1621993439\">customer acquisition costs</a> (CAC) would continue to get higher without a significant increase in the prices of your products and services.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">3. PPC ads become stale after a while.</span></strong></h4> \n<p>You have limited control over your paid ad because of the rule set by ad platforms like Google. As such, your copy might have similar wording to your competitors, which makes it easy for your audience to pass over quickly.</p> \n<h2>SEO vs. PPC</h2> \n<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) can help your content rank high on search engines, making it more likely that your audience would click and trust your content.</p> \n<p>SEO is also more effective for local searches and can grow your online presence for longer. Pay-per-click (PPC), on the other hand, is an acquisition strategy that requires you to spend ad money to get your content in front of an audience when they search for specific keywords online.</p> \n<h3>SEO vs. PPC: Which is better?</h3> \n<p>Asking which is better between SEO and PPC is like asking whether it’s better to eat with a fork or spoon — it depends.</p> \n<p>Serving pasta? Sure, I’d love a fork. Soup? I’d rather have a spoon.</p> \n<p>In the same way, different situations exist where SEO is better than PPC and vice versa.</p> \n<p>Let’s now look at some of these situations.</p> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Use SEO if...</span></strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Your marketing budget is low.</li> \n <li>You want to build your brand authority.</li> \n <li>You’re looking to maximize your long-term return-on-investment (ROI).</li> \n <li>You want to create content that reaches your audience at different stages of the sales funnel.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Use PPC if...</span></strong></h4> \n<p>You’d get better results with PPC in situations where:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>You want quick results.</li> \n <li>Your product is novel or first-of-its-kind.</li> \n <li>You’re promoting a time-sensitive offer, like a holiday sale.</li> \n <li>You want to direct your audience to a sales or landing page.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>How to Make SEO and PPC Work For You</h2> \n<p>Instead of choosing between SEO or PPC, why not combine the two strategies and make them work for you?</p> \n<p>Here’s how you can get the best of both worlds.</p> \n<h3>1. Create retargeting ads.</h3> \n<p>Did someone visit your site, probably the pricing or check-out page, without buying?</p> \n<p>You can easily use a retargeting ad to prompt these visitors, even after they’ve left your site, to come back and make a purchase.</p> \n<h3>2. Promote website content with social media ads.</h3> \n<p>While you want your content to rank organically, you can give it a quick boost by promoting it on social media.</p> \n<p>Not only do these kinds of ads help with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-distribution?__hstc=45788219.ca6fa96b1444ad1af0b0b1debe5f22a0.1621995985031.1621995985031.1621995985031.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1621995985031&amp;__hsfp=2831226065&amp;_ga=2.31360252.2124293733.1621995984-1118394532.1621995984\">content distribution</a>, but they could potentially help you acquire essential backlinks that’d boost your rankings.</p> \n<p>Also, it’s going to be a shame not to promote your latest blog post, guide, report, or case study after spending hours creating it.</p> \n<h3>3. Collect data From ads to improve your SEO strategy.</h3> \n<p>PPC campaigns grant you access to a lot of data — keyword search volumes, keywords your competitors are bidding for, highest converting calls-to-action, and so on.</p> \n<p>Aimed with all of this data, you’d be able to create better SEO strategies with less effort.</p> \n<h2>SEO vs. PPC Statistics</h2> \n<h3>SEO</h3> \n<ol> \n <li>Google is responsible for over <a href=\"https://sparktoro.com/blog/2018-search-market-share-myths-vs-realities-of-google-bing-amazon-facebook-duckduckgo-more/\">92%</a> of global web traffic.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/\">90.63%</a> of online content get zero traffic from Google, with only 0.21% getting over 1000 visits per month.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://sparktoro.com/blog/less-than-half-of-google-searches-now-result-in-a-click/\">46.40%</a> of browser-based Google searches resulted in an organic link click.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/\">99.2%</a> of website pages have less than 100 backlinks.</li> \n <li>Google processes over <a href=\"https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/\">7 billion</a> searches per day (or 2.5 trillion searches per year.)</li> \n <li>SEO drives almost <a href=\"https://videos.brightedge.com/research-report/BrightEdge_ChannelReport2019_FINAL.pdf\">100%</a> more traffic than paid traffic.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/smartphone-user-search-behavior-statistics/\">60%</a> of smartphone users have contacted a business directly using the search results (e.g., “click to call” option).</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/seo-trends?_ga=2.47785070.830295185.1621993439-1955934222.1621993439\">64%</a> of marketers actively invest in SEO.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://videos.brightedge.com/research-report/BrightEdge_ChannelReport2019_FINAL.pdf\">76%</a> of B2B search traffic is trackable.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/search/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search-download/\">18%</a> of local smartphone searches led to a purchase within a day, whereas only 7% of non-local searches led to a sale.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>PPC</h3> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"https://clutch.co/seo-firms/resources/search-engine-marketing-why-people-click-paid-search-ads\">390 out of 506</a> surveyed by Clutch say they recognize a paid search ad when they see it.</li> \n <li>The Google Display Network reaches <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/intl/en_ng/home/campaigns/display-ads/#:~:text=Display%20ads%20can%20help%20you,sites%20like%20Gmail%20and%20YouTube.\">90%</a> of Internet users worldwide.</li> \n <li>Search advertising spend is expected to exceed <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-advertising/search-advertising/worldwide\">$170 billion</a> in 2021.</li> \n <li>More than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/435252/adblock-users-worldwide/\">763 million devices use Adblock</a>. As a consumer, Adblock is amazing. It stops all those eerily targeted ads from popping up on your Facebook feed. However, as a marketer, it can be frustrating to invest in PPC if vast numbers of your target consumers will never see your ad. Additionally, ad blocking has increased <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tabid/6307/bid/1514/paid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=grown%2015-30%25&amp;_ga=2.46015213.830295185.1621993439-1955934222.1621993439\">15-30%</a> in the last four years.</li> \n <li>PPC Ads can <a href=\"https://cleverclicks.com.au/blog/best-ppc-stats-trends-2018/\">boost awareness by 80%</a>. Despite ad blockers, PPC is still effective in increasing your brand's reach and awareness.</li> \n <li>The highest average monthly cost-per-click (CPC) in Google Ads search advertising is in the insurance industry at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115432/us-search-advertising-cpc/\">$18.57 per click</a>.</li> \n <li>The cheapest CPC in Google Ads search advertising is in the electronics industry at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115432/us-search-advertising-cpc/\">83 cents per click</a>.</li> \n <li>The average Facebook Ads Click-Through Rate across all industries is <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2019/11/12/facebook-ad-benchmarks\">0.89%</a>.

Advertisers in the Finance industry have the highest average CPC ($3.89), while Food and Drinks have the lowest average CPC ($0.42)</li> \n <li>Google's algorithm updates don't affect PPC. While not a stat per se, a significant benefit of PPC is that it's immune to Google's changing SERP ranking algorithm. In 2018, Google reported that they had updated their algorithm <a href=\"https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change\">3,234 times</a>! If you're using the SEO method, you have to adjust your content optimization to rank better according to the updated algorithm requirements.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://clutch.co/seo-firms/resources/search-engine-marketing-why-people-click-paid-search-ads\">75% of marketers from Clutch’s survey</a> say it's easier to find what they're looking for from paid ads. The first page of search engine results — especially the few hits — gets the vast majority of clicks due to the combination of ease of use and finding what the searcher is looking for. Bidding on target keywords through PPC accomplishes both of these needs: the paid ads are easy to find at the top of the SERP, and they answer the searcher’s question.</li> \n</ol> \n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2> \n<p>Whether you choose to go with SEO or PPC ultimately depends on your business situation. So take your time to evaluate the pro and cons of both SEO and PPC to see which is the right fit for you. And if possible, integrate the two strategies to see even more outstanding results for your business.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"state of marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F1514%2Fpaid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3d0bc27a-898d-40d5-aa46-8696ed81c4ee.png","linkMd5":"51d6b12f6754640fc8551eeb1c315d3e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-38-400_67a56d849e63168b.webp","destWidth":539,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6641,"destBytes":8730,"author":"cmcginley@hubspot.com (Corinne McGinley)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3d0bc27a-898d-40d5-aa46-8696ed81c4ee.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-38-400_67a56d849e63168b.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1kbrv85xTSRPX7Ta5cDVs6NSmghWRWxDYxYtCEu4EhcpfXRjV177HJcHJgjdEgml0sGZA71aMFQcku9aP2R3CMTPnq0-2Td9bL8HYuEtrxNggKqvWC8y1AAc3I-XPmcO0UoG9R97":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn17@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-49-014_6d32d5e26698373c.webp","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rVH49Md83LafOL4B3XoK8DCbmGQ5GAEiSLJTD_6Fo1Kp2a8kLegKaDAi1ZaQC6es463G-HEnW_C1FTajSNusume0RTWP2iZpDU7jYwiSie3iQF0TUzpkUoXZOI6FzLzyBuFAcF18":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-51-755_11da1fd1a58132cf.webp","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4-hoOTBDh1tBOpOsMe9rzc0dxyIVkBIO1-wCEU5dsff1mDLduMwJQac--2-utPu_-TVwOg5iZVliwQD6VD7kSXKNkmSXCkU2bSwbtBAqWsli8u2z59TLOB_zHgwWFzMOicrfSXT1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-49-316_ee20ae3b16bea514.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-48-782_ba6ee21c8b9c368e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F1514%2Fpaid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn52@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-49-258_ef864c5b92a25966.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938168},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"How to Write the Perfect Email to Apply for an Unlisted Role [Infographic]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-for-unlisted-role-infographic","description":"<p>Maybe you've been refreshing the Careers page at your dream company for months.</p>  \n<p>Alternatively, perhaps you've heard glowing reviews about a company from friends — but whenever you check, they're still not hiring for any roles for which you'd qualify.</p> \n<p>Whatever the case, if you feel a company's culture could be a great fit for you, you might consider sending a cold email so hiring managers can keep you in-mind if a role becomes available.</p> \n<p>But that's easier said than done.

Why? Because existing customers understand the value of your products and services and they're invested loyally in your brand. If a customer feels satisfied with their interaction with you, it’s a no-brainer for them to turn to your business for their needs, again and again.</p> \n<p>No matter if you’re a team of one or leading a scaling enterprise, you can cultivate a deeper relationship with your existing audience without the typical costs associated with acquiring new customers. The key is strategic relationship marketing.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png\" align=\"middle\"></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>“But isn’t all marketing relationship marketing?” Not exactly. Some marketing tactics are solely about gaining traffic and conversions to get potential customers into the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel\">customer flywheel</a>. From there, you’ll have even more marketing tactics that get that potential customer to make their first purchase.</p> \n<p>The perfect time to start a relationship marketing strategy is when the customer has made a purchase (or several). Your goal with relationship marketing is to get these new customers to become brand-loyal patrons of your business. To do that, you’ll want to take a personalized approach and become integrated into their lives in a way that feels natural and genuine.</p> \n<p>Here, let's take a look at some relationship marketing examples and the tactics they use to make this strategy work. Then, we’ll explore how you can implement a strong relationship marketing strategy today.</p> \n<p></p> \n<br> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.capitalone.com/\">Capital One</a></h3> \n<p>Capital One understands its customers deeply — all the way down to the small inconveniences that plague them most. One of those annoyances is the long TSA line at the airport.</p> \n<p>Capital One <a href=\"https://www.capitalone.com/learn-grow/money-management/tsa-precheck-global-entry-credit/\">reimburses all venture cardholders up to $100</a> when they pay the TSA PreCheck fee. All they have to do is pay for it with their Capital One credit card.</p> \n<p>TSA PreCheck expires after five years, and this benefit can be used every time the cardholder wants to renew their PreCheck status. This benefit speaks to a relevant pain point for Capital One customers and makes keeping an account open with Capital One well worth it in the long run.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.fairwayindependentmc.com/\">Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation</a></h3> \n<p>Any homeowner knows that purchasing a home is one of the biggest and most important decisions one can make. Mortgage lenders know this, too. During the process of buying a home, buyers typically shop around for the lowest rate, but they’re also shopping for a reliable team that will make the process as smooth as possible.</p> \n<p>Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation is a great example of a business that takes the relationship marketing approach to customer relations. When the real estate market is moving quickly, Fairway stands out and offers its buyers more than just low interest rates. For example, I received a birthday email from Fairway which came right around the time I needed to make some decisions about my lender. In addition to that, the loan consultant was sure to send over some marketing documents with their value proposition and benefits for me as a buyer.</p> \n<p>All of this showed me that the company was committed to being responsive, respectful, helpful, and most importantly — closing on time. This is a recipe for success in the mortgage industry as referrals are the <a href=\"https://bombbomb.com/blog/8-tips-to-increase-mortgage-referral-business/\">“bread and butter of any successful loan officers business.”</a></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.ge.com/\">GE</a></h3> \n<p>Relationship marketing is ultimately about offering both new and existing customers valuable content regardless of where they are in the buyer’s journey. Good relationship marketing should appeal to the first-time viewer as powerfully as it appeals to your long-term customers to ensure your customers can grow with you over time.</p> \n<p>GE does a great job of diversifying its content, and the platforms on which it promotes, to ensure it satisfies as many people as possible. For instance, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lifeafter-the-message/id1045990056\">GE created two sponsored podcasts</a> in the sci-fi genre. It seems strange, but GE positions itself as an “inventor of the future of industry,” so it makes sense that the company might dabble in the world of what-ifs in the sci-fi genre. Additionally, the company has a popular <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GE/featured\">YouTube channel</a> that features <a href=\"https://youtu.be/D9fsQkjUNrQ\">historic, innovative stories</a> from the perspective of GE employees. Whether you’re an existing customer or a prospective employee, content like this places GE directly into the lives of customers in a natural, helpful, and even entertaining way.</p> \n<p>By consistently offering a diverse range of quality content, GE shows its desire to satisfy its long-term customers even at the expense of short-term wins.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.dominos.com/en/?lang=en\">Domino's</a></h3> \n<p>In the past couple of years, Domino's has taken its fair share of risks for the sake of innovation and improvement, including a series of ads called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH5R56jILag\">Pizza Turnaround</a>, in which they showcased a series of negative customer reviews, read by real Domino's employees, before promising a new and improved recipe.</p> \n<p>These self-deprecating ads appeal genuinely to viewers but clearly go against any traditional sales playbook... which is why they work. By admitting an area of opportunity, Domino's re-invented its brand as transparent and honest — and who wouldn't want to buy from a company like that?</p> \n<p>Additionally, Domino's has conducted other genius marketing campaigns like the <a href=\"https://dominosweddingregistry.com/\">Domino's wedding registry</a>, in which soon-to-be-married couples can create their own pizza registry, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sxP2cBA8OA\">Avoid the Noid</a>, where the company partnered with every state in the US to repair potholes to limit the number of damaged pizzas being delivered. Domino's has also done a fantastic job tapping into their digital audience — at one point, the company even allowed people to order pizza using a <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2015/5/13/8597819/how-to-order-dominos-pizza-emoji\">simple pizza emoji</a>. Now, <a href=\"https://biz.dominos.com/about/fun-facts/#:~:text=TECHNOLOGY%20%26%20ONLINE%3A&amp;text=Domino's%20generated%20more%20than%2070,international%20markets%20feature%20online%20ordering.\">70% of Domino's sales</a> are through digital channels.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, there are plenty of innovative steps Domino's has taken to cultivate a loyal, long-term customer base. They accepted short-term losses for long-term gains by slowly and strategically re-inventing their product and their brand while still engaging with their customers on their favorite digital platforms.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/home.html\">Panera</a></h3> \n<p>Panera’s commitment to health and convenience has resulted in <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciakelso/2020/08/04/paneras-coffee-subscription-is-such-a-success-the-chain-wants-to-do-more-such-programs/#:~:text=While%20the%20results%20of%20Panera's,loyalty%20programs%20in%20any%20industry.\">40 million Panera loyalty members</a>.</p> \n<p>In 2014, Panera <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/panera-bread-cleans-act/307387/\">issued a statement</a> promising its customers it would remove all artificial flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives from all Panera products by the end of 2016. The company remained transparent throughout the process, <a href=\"https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/our-beliefs/who-we-are.html\">publishing progress reports</a> to demonstrate a level of accountability and transparency to its customers.</p> \n<p>Undoubtedly, it was a risky decision to admit they'd previously used unhealthy ingredients in their food — but it paid off big-time in 2016 when the brand could officially say \"100% of our food is 100% clean\".</p> \n<p>Additionally, the brand continues to focus on cultivating strong relationships with its customers through personalization. For instance, Panera alerts loyalty members about new food offerings they feel will meet the member's \"flavor profile\" based on past purchases.</p> \n<p>The company also meets its customers where they are — <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2020/panera-dials-up-online-grocery-business/\">starting an online grocery business</a> as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Panera even offers home and business delivery, rapid pickup, and catering in an effort to better serve its customers.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.marriott.com/default.mi\">Marriott</a></h3> \n<p>Undoubtedly, a 35-minute film is not the most traditional avenue a hotel can take when it wants to increase sales — and yet, that's exactly what Marriott chose to do with their film, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUIeA1i6V5I\">Two Bellmen Three</a>\".</p> \n<p>This film enables Marriott to appeal to a younger demographic and build brand awareness on dominant platforms like Snapchat. Best of all, their content rarely resembles an advertisement and is typically focused on providing an audience with fun, or helpful, information on various travel destinations.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.armorsuit.com/\">ArmorSuit</a></h3> \n<p>ArmorSuit's <a href=\"https://www.armorsuit.com/pages/warranty\">warranty policy</a> begins like this — \"Most warranties are limited to 30 days or one year, but with our Lifetime Replacement Warranty, our customers can request for a replacement screen protector for a lifetime. This way, you never need to purchase a whole new kit when a replacement is needed.\"</p> \n<p>This way, you never need to purchase a whole new kit — a phrase you'll likely never hear in traditional sales transactions. ArmorSuit's lifetime warranty represents the company's steadfast commitment to keeping its customers satisfied. While it might seem ridiculous to offer a lifetime warranty, it makes sense for building strong relationships with ArmorSuit's customers — when the company's customers then need other products related to tech, they'll most likely check out ArmorSuit's website first.</p> \n<p>Next, let’s explore how you can create a strong relationship marketing strategy for your own business.</p> \n<br> \n<h3>1. Provide personalized, customer-focused service.</h3> \n<p>When you're creating a relationship marketing strategy and engaging with your customers, your primary concern should never be focused on your product or service. Instead, your concerns should always revolve around the customer — Would the customer want to see this ad? Would the customer be excited about this Instagram post? Does our new product delight the customer?</p> \n<p>Additionally, it's critical that you create channels for direct support when your customers need help. Perhaps you implement a Facebook Messaging Bot for service-related concerns. Alternatively, maybe you answer your customer's questions via Instagram DM. By meeting your customers on platforms they use most, you're proving your willingness to help them despite the hassles it might entail for your overall business process.</p> \n<h3>2. Engage with the customer where they are.</h3> \n<p>The reason Marriott's strategy works isn't only because of the content they create — it's also where they post that content. Creating videos specifically for Snapchat enables Marriott to appeal to a younger demographic on a platform already popular with that audience.</p> \n<p>Research which platforms are most popular for your ideal demographic. By reaching out to them through their preferred channels, you're demonstrating a level of helpfulness and understanding that will encourage those users to interact with your brand.</p> \n<h3>3. Incorporate technology to work more effectively.</h3> \n<p>Technology might seem counterintuitive to building organic relationships that are personalized, but it can be the key to solving customer pain points. As your company grows, it’ll become increasingly more difficult to connect one-on-one with each customer.</p> \n<p>Using an automated marketing system can ensure that every customer receives communication from your business and has the opportunity to engage. Tools like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">HubSpot’s Marketing Hub</a> can automate workflows and email cadences so that you never miss a customer milestone.</p> \n<h3>4. Offer incentives and rewards for customer loyalty.</h3> \n<p>To cultivate a long-term relationship with your customers and create lasting brand loyalty, continue engaging with customers even after they've purchased a product. Consider what you can offer them once they've become customers — perhaps they can get a discount on additional products, or receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences.</p> \n<p>By creating a loyalty rewards program, Panera continues to incentivize its customers to purchase additional products and slowly forms a more meaningful relationship by gathering information about each customer and then using that information to offer unique suggestions depending on their individual food preferences.</p> \n<h3>5. Create valuable content that tells a compelling story.</h3> \n<p>If a customer has already purchased your product, they don't need to see additional product advertisements to become brand loyalists — instead, they need to feel your business offers value regardless of their purchase intent.</p> \n<p>Marriott's film isn't meant to immediately convert a viewer into a paying customer. Instead, its purpose is to increase brand awareness, so that down the road, when that viewer is ready to book a hotel for an upcoming trip, they'll remember the compelling film they saw once and think of Marriott.</p> \n<h3>6. Collect feedback regularly.</h3> \n<p>A relationship works two ways — to truly develop a meaningful connection with your customers, then, it's vital you ask them for feedback. What do they want to see from your brand? What do they like about your product? What do they wish you wrote about on your blog? This information improves your relationship marketing strategy to best fit the needs of your specific audience.</p> \n<h2>Play the Long Game With Relationship Marketing</h2> \n<p>There’s a time and place for quick marketing wins and they’re paramount in hitting goals and KPIs each quarter. However, your marketing, sales, and service teams work much better together at playing the long game. Relationship marketing won’t score you consistent quick wins that you can measure with hard numbers in a dashboard. But you’ll find that staying the course and nurturing the customer will yield happier and more loyal brand advocates for quarters to come.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in February 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Marketing Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Frelationship-marketing&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png","linkMd5":"5b0368da4b7e15ee41fb105cf9b1c98f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn4@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-44-409_5a38291bbbb54ba3.webp","destWidth":433,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5125,"destBytes":6842,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/aacfe6c7-71e6-4f49-979f-76099062afa0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn4@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-44-409_5a38291bbbb54ba3.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/af934ebe-a3e6-4d2a-b12f-1c7ea40641fb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn44@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-49-901_b69ef96b2d492171.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Frelationship-marketing&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn7@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-51-355_d006360983e2da4f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938161},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"How HubSpot Helps Users Prepare for Google's Core Web Vitals","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-core-web-vitals","description":"<p>It's no secret that poor <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ux-user-experience\">user experience (UX)</a> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">isn’t</span> going to keep your customers and target audience coming back to your website.

The tool then flags pages that fail any of these metrics.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Three Core Web Vitals that HubSpot’s SEO audit tool flags:</h3> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-24%20at%2011.08.40%20PM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-24%20at%2011.08.40%20PM.png\" alt=\"hubspot helps you prep these three core website vitals of google\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/\"><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Source</span></em></span></a></img></p> \n<h4>1. <a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/\">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a></h4> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">LCP is perceived page load speed. It refers to how quickly a page can load and render all of its visual elements to the screen.</span></p> \n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2. <a href=\"https://web.dev/cls/\">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a></span></h4> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">CLS is visual stability. It refers to how often users experience unexpected layout shifts on a web page.</span></p> \n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">3. <a href=\"https://web.dev/fid/\">First Input Delay (FID)</a></span></h4> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">FID is load responsiveness. It's a quantifiable measurement of how users feel when a page is unresponsive.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">An alternative measurement for FID is <a href=\"https://web.dev/tbt/\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Total Blocking Time</a><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> (TBT)</span></span></span>. TBT&nbsp;is the quantifiable measurement of how much a non-interactive page is before becoming interactive.

It's important for various reasons, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Acting as a roadmap for Google and other search engines to find and better understand your content.</li> \n <li>Leading search engines through your website to crawl and index the essential pages.</li> \n <li>Helping search identify when new pages and updates to old pages are available.</li> \n <li>Helping search engines find alternate language versions of your page.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>But before I go further, you must know that there are two types of sitemap formats: HTML and XML. Here's the basic difference:</p> \n<p><strong>HTML sitemaps:</strong>&nbsp;This is more like your content sitemap that users can see and use to navigate your site. They're also commonly referred to as your \"website archive.\" Some marketers view HTML sitemaps as outdated or even entirely unnecessary.</p> \n<p><strong>XML sitemaps:</strong>&nbsp;This is the sitemap that's purely used for indexing and crawling your website and is manually submitted. It's the more modern form of handling how all your content is stored across your website.</p> \n<p>While HTML sitemaps might help users find pages on your site, as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bigseo/comments/dbqcmh/still_worth_making_html_sitemaps/\">John Mueller said</a>, your internal linking should take care of that anyways. So the focus from an SEO perspective should be on XML sitemaps.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Types of Sitemaps</h2> \n<p>From these two types of sitemaps described above, there are also subsections within them. I'll now go over these in more detail.</p> \n<h3>1. Page Sitemap</h3> \n<p>A page sitemap or <em>regular </em>sitemap improves the indexations of pages and posts. For sites that are not image-focused or video-focused, like photography and videography sites, a page sitemap can also include the images and videos on each page.</p> \n<p>A page sitemap without an image would look like this:</p> \n<p><em>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&lt;urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\" &gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &lt;url&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;loc&gt;https://example.com/&lt;/loc&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;lastmod&gt;2020-09-17&lt;/lastmod&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;changefreq&gt;daily&lt;/changefreq&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;priority&gt;0.9&lt;/priority&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/url&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&lt;/urlset&gt;</em></p> \n<p>Include&nbsp;your URLs in &lt;loc&gt; tags. &lt;lastmod&gt; indicates when the page was last edited. &lt;changefreq&gt; indicates how often the page is edited and &lt;priority&gt; indicates how important the page is to other pages on the website as a whole. You can take a look at<a href=\"https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html\">Sitemaps XML format</a>&nbsp;for more information on these parameters.</p> \n<h3>2. Video Sitemap</h3> \n<p>An XML video sitemap is similar to a page sitemap, but of course focuses largely on video content, which means they are only necessary if videos are critical to your business. If they aren't, save your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/technical-seo-guide/crawlability-checklist#:~:text=Your%20crawl%20budget%20refers%20to,most%20important%20pages%20for%20crawling.&amp;text=Watch%20out%20for%20dynamically%20generated,pages%20on%20your%20site%20skyrocket.\">crawl budget</a>&nbsp;(the finite amount of crawlable pages and resources across your site) and add the video link to your page sitemap.</p> \n<p>But if you do need a video sitemap, it would look like this:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-4.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p><em>Note: This is what a video sitemap looks like. Implement it only if videos are critical to your business.</em></p> \n<h3>3. News Sitemap</h3> \n<p>If you publish news and want to get those news articles featured&nbsp;on top stories and Google News, you need a news sitemap. There's a crucial rule here: do not include articles that were published longer than the last two days in the file.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/news-sitemap\">Google News sitemaps aren't favored in regular ranking results</a>, so make sure you only add news articles. Also, they do not support image links, so Google recommends you use structured data to specify your article thumbnail.</p> \n<h3>4. Image Sitemap</h3> \n<p>Like the video sitemaps, image sitemaps are only necessary if images are critical to your business, such as a photography or stock photo site. If they aren't, you can leave them in your page sitemap and mark them up with the image object schema, and they will be crawled along with the page content/URL.</p> \n<p>If you believe an image sitemap is needed, it will look like this:</p> \n<p><em>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&lt;urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\" xmlns:image=\"http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1\" &gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &lt;url&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;loc&gt;https://example.com/&lt;/loc&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;image:image&gt;</em></p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&lt;image:loc&gt;https://example.com/image-url.png&lt;/image:loc&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/image:image&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;image:image&gt;</em></p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&lt;image:loc&gt;https://example.com/second-image-url.png&lt;/image:loc&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/image:image&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&nbsp; &lt;/url&gt;</em></p> \n<p><em>&lt;/urlset&gt;</em></p> \n<h3>5. Sitemap Index</h3> \n<p>There are a few limitations you'll want to keep in mind for sitemaps:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Having too many URLs will only lead to no indexation of some of your pages.</li> \n <li>All sitemaps, except the news sitemap, should have a maximum of 50,000 URLs.</li> \n <li>News sitemaps should have a maximum of 1000 URLs.</li> \n <li>A sitemap should be a maximum of 50MB in uncompressed file size.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As a result of those limitations, you might need to have more than one sitemap. When you use more than one sitemap file, you need an index file that lists all of those sitemaps. It's the index file that you submit in Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. That file should look like this:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google.png?width=530&amp;height=168&amp;name=HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"530\" height=\"168\"></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">XML Sitemap Example</h2> \n<p>So far, you have seen each sitemap's structure. Most websites will only need the page sitemap that includes the images on each page. That looks like this:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-2.png?height=248&amp;name=HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" height=\"248\"></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Sitemap Priorities</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/xml-sitemap-best-practices/237649/#close\">Adding priorities to your sitemap</a>&nbsp;is one of the things many people do to differentiate between how important different pages are, but Google's Gary Illyes mentioned that Google ignores these priorities. In his exact words:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>Generally speaking, as long as you are honest about when your content was actually modified, include it in your sitemap so that Google and other search engines know to re-crawl the modified page and index the new content.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How to Create a Sitemap</h2> \n<p>In this section, I will show you how to create a sitemap without using any generator or plugin. If your website is on WordPress or you'd rather use a generator (which makes this easy), skip to the next section.</p> \n<p>These are the exact steps to follow to create a sitemap manually:</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">1. Decide which pages on your site should be crawled by Google, and determine the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/consolidate-duplicate-urls\">canonical version</a> of each page.</h3> \n<p>Canonical versions are necessary when you have duplicate pages. For example, suppose you serve an international community and have pages for each location with the same language and content, like <em>example.com/us/page</em>&nbsp;and <em>example.com/ca/page </em>for US and Canada visitors, respectively.</p> \n<p>In that case, it's important that you point to the original, which might be <em>example.com/page or </em>one of the two<em>&nbsp;</em>as the canonical. If you'd like to learn more about how this works, this <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/canonical-url\">post explains canonicalization</a>&nbsp;in depth.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, do not include URLs that are blocked by robots.txt files, require a login to access, or are password-protected, as search bots can't crawl them. You'll only get coverage errors in GSC if you add them.</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2. Determine if you need more than one sitemap.</span></h3> \n<p>Several websites use separate files for pages, posts, and categories. Remember that if you have more than 50,000 URLs, you need multiple sitemaps.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">3. Code all your URLs in XML tags to look like the type of sitemap you want to create.</h3> \n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html\">page explains how to use XML tags</a>&nbsp;in further detail.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">4. If you have multiple sitemap files, create a sitemap index file and include the links to the individual sitemaps you created.</h3> \n<p>This one is already described in the section titled \"Sitemap Index\".</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Sitemap Generators</h2> \n<p>Most of us marketers do not have a web development background, so we can't code to save our lives. If the thought of manually crafting a sitemap gives you a headache, use a sitemap generator and save yourself 12 days of looking through complex coding.</p> \n<p>There are several <a href=\"https://code.google.com/archive/p/sitemap-generators/wikis/SitemapGenerators.wiki\">sitemap generators</a>&nbsp;that you can use:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://technicalseo.com/tools/xml-sitemap/\">TechnicalSEO</a> by Merkle has one where you can upload a CSV file with your URLs. It's especially great if you have different language versions of your pages (hreflang tags).If your website is custom-coded and is not on any CMS or builder that generates a sitemap, you need to use a generator like TechnicalSEO.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/\">Screaming Frog SEO Spider</a>&nbsp;also has one that I like to use with simple custom-built sites. In Screaming Frog, ensure you are using the spider mode. You can do that by clicking on \"Mode\" and selecting \"spider\". Then type the URL of your home page and let it crawl. When it's done, click on \"Sitemaps.\"</li> \n</ul> \n<p>For clarification on how to use Screaming Frog, take a look at the image below:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-Jun-30-2021-03-31-31-54-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>In order to save the XML file to your computer, tick all the options that matter to your site and click on \"export\". Then, upload that file to your server in the root directory.</p> \n<p>Both tools do not automatically update the sitemap file. Some tools do but are premium, so you pay for the service.</p> \n<p>However, you won't need to deal with any of the above if your website is on WordPress or an ecommerce platform like Shopify.</p> \n<p>For WordPress sites, <a href=\"https://yoast.com/\">Yoast</a> and <a href=\"https://rankmath.com/\">Rank Math</a> are popular SEO plugins that generate sitemaps and update them when you edit your posts and pages and Shopify even generates sitemaps automatically.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How to Submit Your Sitemap to Google</h2> \n<p>The best way to submit your sitemap to Google is through <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-search-console\">Google Search Console</a>&nbsp;(GSC). There are other ways and additional steps as well, but I will start with GSC, because it's the most common method.</p> \n<p>Follow these steps:</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">1. Go to Google Search Console and click on \"sitemap.\"</h3> \n<h3><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-3.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\"></h3> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">2. Type your sitemap URL and click Submit. If you have multiple sitemaps with a sitemap index file, you only need to type the URL for the index file.</h3> \n<p>As an alternative, if you haven't submitted it to GSC, there is another way to let Google know you have one by adding this line in your robots.txt:</p> \n<p><em>Sitemap: http://example.com/sitemap.xml</em></p> \n<p>But of course the URL here with the one you actually have. And if you have an index file, include only your index file here.</p> \n<p>If (for some weird reason) you aren't using GSC, use the ping service to let Google know it should crawl your file. To do that, type the URL below in your browser:</p> \n<p><em>http://www.google.com/ping?sitemap=https://example.com/sitemap.xml</em></p> \n<p>Replace <em>https://example.com/sitemap.xml </em>with your sitemap URL.</p> \n<p>And it's done!</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Sitemap Best Practices</h2> \n<p>Now that you understand the importance of sitemaps, how they work, and your options for submitting them, let's make sure the final one you create is in tip-top shape by following these best practices.</p> \n<h3>1. Use tools to generate automatic sitemaps.</h3> \n<p>Manually creating and updating an XML sitemap will cost you a lot of time (and is unnecessarily complex). To save time so you can focus on other things like your next Netflix binge, it's best to use an automatic sitemap generator.</p> \n<p>The ones mentioned for WordPress above come with that feature for free. For custom-built sites, you will have to pay, but in my opinion it's absolutely something worth paying for.</p> \n<h3>2. Do regular sitemap maintenance checks and updates.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-strategy\">All parts of SEO are an ongoing effort</a>, so check your sitemaps regularly. Search console does an excellent job of letting you know if your submitted URLs have issues with crawling or indexing.</p> \n<p>Check the 'Coverage' section in GSC regularly and update your site or sitemap when there are errors. The great thing about this is that it tells you what the exact error is with suggestions on how to fix it.</p> \n<p>You can also use Screaming Frog for sitemap maintenance. After crawling your website or sitemap URL, check the response code tab for 404 or 5xx errors.</p> \n<p>If you are using an automatic sitemap generator tool or plugin, update it when updates are available. Furthermore, periodically view the sitemap by going to your sitemap URL and checking if any page is missing or the last updated time is incorrect.</p> \n<h3>3. Prioritize high-quality pages in your sitemap.</h3> \n<p>Although Google no longer pays attention to the priority tag (or so they say), you can still add it because there's more than Google out there (yes, as an SEO I will admit it). Bing might pay attention to that tag, so it's still good practice to prioritize high-quality pages in your sitemap.</p> \n<p>Sitemap priority shows which pages to crawl and index faster, so you can set priorities using values ranging from 0.00 to 1.00. But make sure not to use the same value for all pages or else Google won't be able to tell which is most important.</p> \n<p>For values, you can go with something like this:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Homepage - 1.00</li> \n <li>Main landing pages - 0.90</li> \n <li>Other landing pages - 0.85</li> \n <li>Main links on navigation bar - 0.80</li> \n <li>Other pages on site - 0.75</li> \n <li>Top articles/blog posts like hub pages - 0.80</li> \n <li>Blog category pages - 0.75</li> \n <li>Other posts - 0.64</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Include only canonical versions of URLs in your sitemap.</h3> \n<p>Your sitemap should only contain URLs that you want search engines to index. That means if a URL points to another as its <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/seo/set-canonical-urls-for-duplicate-content\">canonical version</a>, you shouldn't include it, as it's a statement to Google and other search engines that you don't wish for that URL to be indexed.</p> \n<p>Ignoring that and including that URL in your sitemap provides conflicting information to Google. The unintended URL might get indexed, or you will get coverage errors in GSC. So, only include the canonical versions, so you can consolidate your position in search engine results.</p> \n<h3>5. Split up your large sitemaps.</h3> \n<p>I mentioned this above already that you need to split your sitemap into multiple files if it exceeds 50MB or has more than 50,000 URLs. Never submit large <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-xml-file\">XML files</a>&nbsp;to Google, otherwise some of your URLs will not be indexed - and you know well that every URL matters!</p> \n<p>One quick tip here is to save each file with easy to understand names (for you) like page_sitemap1.xml and page_sitemap2.xml.</p> \n<p>And with that, I wish you happy sitemapping!</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=05aa9467-4eda-4dd6-8b7f-ad9855abfe33&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/05aa9467-4eda-4dd6-8b7f-ad9855abfe33.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbuild-sitemap-website&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e.png","linkMd5":"b8fefd8f037df5f51d7d7deb108b0ee3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn60@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-381_ac504860637ee534.webp","destWidth":368,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4411,"destBytes":6042,"author":"Adriana Stein","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn60@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-381_ac504860637ee534.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn99@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-51-014_e118febb3a81e1db.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google.png?width=530&height=168&name=HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-50-311_a6137acf2dff8877.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-2.png?height=248&name=HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn57@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-51-199_5833bdda5e4c2b74.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn62@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-51-304_b74a0b5a7af15f33.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-Jun-30-2021-03-31-31-54-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn25@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-48-854_c1210a012eb2667f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/HubSpot%20Sitemaps%20What%20They%20Are,%20How%20to%20Create%20One%20%26%20Submit%20it%20to%20Google-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn68@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-50-520_8fd38dfc7f7f626f.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/05aa9467-4eda-4dd6-8b7f-ad9855abfe33.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-53-180_339ca67d143927cd.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbuild-sitemap-website&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn54@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-48-856_d4c0d512fef8aaa5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938162},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"80 Things to Check Before, During, and After Launching a Website","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/website-launch-checklist","description":"<p>Admit it: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-make-a-website\">Launching a new website</a> is stressful — even for the most seasoned digital marketers.</p>  \n<p>Websites are complex.

Analyze your previous website (if applicable).</h3> \n<p>In order to make good decisions, you must first understand where you've been. That starts with your existing website if you have one. Ask yourself:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What is the purpose of a new design or overhaul?</li> \n <li>What haven't hasn't been accomplished with this existing site?</li> \n <li>How will a new design serve the new organization?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The answers to these questions can help you identify your gaps, which can then inform goal setting for the new site.</p> \n<h3>2. Crawl your old site (if applicable) and document its structure.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>You can get an idea of your site's existing structure, pages, and assets by using a crawling tool such as Screaming Frog. This is a necessary step in creating your <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/developing-a-website-strategy\">website development plan</a> because you'll have a more concrete view of what pages existed before, what redirects are in place, and what the meta data currently looks like.</p> \n<h3>3. Obtain benchmark data from your previous website (if applicable), and confirm testing procedures.</h3> \n<p>Not only will you want to compare how your new site performs compared to the old, but you'll also want to continue identifying gaps that will provide data-driven insights to aid your new strategy.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you'll want to confirm testing procedures. Soon, you'll begin testing your website to make sure all the different components are working, everything flows, and there's a system for tracking bugs and enhancements.</p> \n<p>Use a form (like Google Forms) instead of asking people to email their thoughts so the feedback-gathering process is more streamlined. Then, put one person in charge of choosing which bugs to prioritize, and filtering all the creative feedback you receive through the form.</p> \n<h3>4. Identify your goals for the new design, how you'll achieve them, and how you'll measure success.</h3> \n<p>Once the gaps are fully fleshed out, you can begin crafting your goals for the design. You may come to conclusions such as:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The current site is unwieldy, and we need ease of use.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>The current site no longer looks trendy, so we need a visual refresh.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>The current site doesn't perform, so we need a more SEO-friendly structure with a better UX.&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Whatever your goals, you'll want to understand exactly how a new site will help you achieve them so that you can craft its implementation accordingly.</p> \n<h3>5. List out action items, roles, and responsibilities.</h3> \n<p>Make a project management checklist for the website. What content needs to be written? What calls-to-action need to be created?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Make a master list of the things you need for your website and deadlines for when they should be completed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Then, assign each action item to an individual or team.&nbsp;It usually takes a lot of people to launch a website: You have marketers writing the content;&nbsp;designers choosing images and laying out the overall look and feel; a technical team doing all the back-end development.&nbsp;To ensure everyone's on the same page and there's no role confusion, you'll want to lay out a comprehensive plan for what each team or person is responsible for.</p> \n<p>One great way to do this is by using the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/migration-project-management-model\">DARCI model</a>, which stands for Decision Maker(s), Accountable, Responsible, Consulted, Informed. It's a powerful tool that'll help everyone understand which individual is responsible for completing which action items, which individual(s) or group(s) need to be consulted before any final decisions are made, and who needs to be consulted once a final decision has been made or an action has been taken.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Prepare for worst-case scenarios.</h3> \n<p>Poll everyone involved in your website launch on their concerns about what could go wrong, and then devise a few backup plans for what to do when — not if — some of these things go wrong.</p> \n<h3>7. Choose a Solid CMS.</h3> \n<p>If you've never launched a site before, the long list below might intimidate you. However, it actually shouldn't take too long to run through most of the aspects on this list — especially if you built your website with a solid CMS.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A CMS, or content management system, often allows you to design a website from a pre-created template, optimize your content for SEO, and edit content after it's published. If you've already built your website, you might have already gained experience with using a CMS.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But, if you're still building a website, one way to make going through this checklist less time consuming is by building your pages on a CMS that already does a lot of the work for you.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">HubSpot's CMS </a>that allows you to create and edit content including landing pages and blog posts. It's features also allow you to organize your content, schedule it, track analytics, and optimize it for SEO.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alternatively, you can also test out CMS platforms like WordPress, Wix, or even Drupal.</p> \n<h3>8. Develop a consistent brand.</h3> \n<p>Decide on a consistent brand message and tone, one that you're committed to presenting consistently across. This will make you look more legitimate, credible, and memorable.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Understand your value proposition.</li> \n <li>Choose a mission statement, vision statement, and tagline that represents that value as well as your brand identity.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Choose colors and fonts that convey that identity well.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Decide on the type of imagery that you'll use to further convey your messaging.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>9. Create your technical SEO strategy.</h3> \n<p>Take some time to ensure that your website has been given a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-strategy\">solid foundation for SEO success</a>. From site architecture and content hierarchy to metadata and XML sitemaps, do not leave any stone unturned.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Perform keyword research and decide what you want to rank for.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Create a content strategy that satisfies those keywords.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Understand how your existing pages (if applicable) can be adjusted and which pages will need to be created new.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Figure out which pages are no longer necessary.</li> \n <li>Map out where unnecessary pages can be redirected to (using a 301 redirect).</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>10. Strategize your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversion-rate-optimization-guide\">conversion paths</a>.</h3> \n<p>Once you have an understanding of the primary pages that will exist on your site, you'll need to figure out exactly what actions you want users to take and how you'll capture their information. This includes thinking through:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What premium top-of-the-funnel offers are needed</li> \n <li>What bottom-of-the-funnel action will be presented on main pages</li> \n <li>What forms need to be created</li> \n <li>What landing pages and thank you pages need to be created</li> \n <li>How conversions will be tracked</li> \n <li>What actions will happen after a website visitor converts (email responder, etc.)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>11. Set up analytics software.</h3> \n<ol> \n <li>Choose which analytics platforms you will be using on the new site.</li> \n <li>Decide if any previous Analytics tracking scripts will be used or if new accounts/scripts are needed.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Set up new accounts (if applicable).</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>12. Set a launch date.</h3> \n<p>Once you have an idea of what needs to get done before the launch, pick a launch date. Give yourself at least a month. Most agencies plan for two-to-three months of research, design, and development.</p> \n<h2>What to Check Once You've Built Your Site</h2> \n<p>Once you've chosen a CMS and built a site that you're ready to launch, here's a list of 80 things to check before, during, and after going live. Feel free to copy, edit, and make your own based on the software you're using to launch and host your website.</p> \n<p>Don't have time to check all 80? Here's a list of the most important highlights from each section:</p> \n<div class=\"hsg-featured-snippet\"> \n <h2>Website Launch Checklist</h2> \n <ol> \n  <li>Make sure text is accurate and error free.</li> \n  <li>Replace all placeholder images with final images and designs.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Ensure copy aligns with the new brand.</li> \n  <li>Check that all styling preferences have been implemented.</li> \n  <li>Ensure your design is aesthetically pleasing.</li> \n  <li>Ensure that rights to images, fonts, and other content have been properly licensed or cited.</li> \n  <li>Test the site for User Experience (UX).</li> \n  <li>Check that the conversion paths have been implemented properly.</li> \n  <li>Create your site backup strategy.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Store passwords and credentials in a secure place.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Audit the technical SEO implementation for errors.</li> \n  <li>Test the site for user experience again.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Test your conversion path's functionality.</li> \n  <li>Check that integrations with third-party tools are running smoothly.</li> \n  <li>Make a copy of the final website for backup purposes.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Ensure that backups are running properly.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Make sure your site is secure.</li> \n  <li>Comply with all applicable laws.</li> \n  <li>Crawl the site to ensure no errors happened on launch.</li> \n  <li>Check the technical SEO components for errors.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Optimize your metadata.</li> \n  <li>Set up analytics.</li> \n  <li>Build anticipation with teasers before the site is live.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Create a social media strategy for the announcement.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Identify exciting ways to promote engagement for the new site.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Send an email to your existing database.&nbsp;</li> \n  <li>Continue to promote the launch for a month.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<p>We've grouped items based on pre-launch and post-launch, making sure to touch on page content, design, functionality, SEO, branding, analytics, security, and compliance. Keep on reading to make sure you don't forget a thing before your next launch.</p> \n<h2>Website Pre-Launch Checklist</h2> \n<p>Before you launch, it's important to review all of the content on your website with a fine-tooth comb. Of course, that means page content, but don't forget about your premium content, too. From data-driven content and downloadable documents to rich media such as videos and images, you want to make sure everything is in place, working properly, and looking beautiful.</p> \n<p>It's important to note — you'll want to set up a staging site to prepare your new website before going live. Staging sites are exact copies of your website on a private server that are used to prepare and proof content and code changes before they go live. The staging site is a place to edit and play around with updates in an environment that's almost identical to the one that will be live. This is so you don't have to worry about crashing your site or screwing something up when you make a change.<br><br>Later, you'll sync content and templates between the staging environment and your live website via your content management system (CMS).&nbsp;If you're a HubSpot customer with the website platform, you'll find there's&nbsp;a <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/website-pages/redesign-and-relaunch-your-site-with-content-staging\">staging environment</a> built right into the software. It allows you to generate a preview URL of the entire site, so you can click around and test things in context.</p> \n<h3>1. Make sure text is accurate and error-free.</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Site content has been proofread for spelling and grammar.</li> \n <li>Company contact details are accurate throughout the website.</li> \n <li>Generic content, such as <em>lorem ipsum</em>, has been properly removed and replaced.</li> \n <li>All premium content, such as case studies, ebooks, and whitepapers, have been proofread. Spelling and grammar are correct.</li> \n <li>Copyright date (perhaps in the footer) includes the current year.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Replace all placeholder images with final images and designs.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>On occasion, a website designer may use a placeholder image if they didn't have the correct asset at the time of the page's creation. It's up to you to make sure each page is picture-perfect.</p> \n<h3>3. Ensure copy aligns with the new brand.</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>The text has been copy-edited to ensure consistent brand voice and style.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>All company tag lines and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inspiring-company-mission-statements\">mission statements</a> are up-to-date.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Check that all styling preferences have been implemented.</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Paragraphs, headers, lists, and other formatting are correct.</li> \n <li>Brand colors have been implemented correctly, including link and button colors.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Ensure your design is aesthetically pleasing.</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Scripts are optimized across web pages.</li> \n <li>Images are optimized across web pages.</li> \n <li>CSS is optimized across web pages.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>6. Ensure that rights to images, fonts, and other content have been properly licensed or cited.</h3> \n<p>Even if you outsourced the design to a web designer/developer, the responsibility falls on you to ensure there are no copyright licensing issues. Otherwise, you could end up with a hefty infringement settlement on your hands.</p> \n<h3>7. Test the site for User Experience (UX).</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Website pages are compatible across browsers.</li> \n <li>Website pages are compatible across devices.</li> \n <li>Images, videos, and audio files are in the correct places, formatted and working on all devices.</li> \n <li>All premium content, such as case studies, ebooks, and whitepapers, are stored in their proper libraries/databases and work properly.</li> \n <li>Internal links across web pages are working properly.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Social media share icons are associated with the correct accounts.</li> \n <li>Company logo is linked to the homepage.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>8. Check that the conversion paths have been implemented properly.</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>All necessary forms are present.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Landing pages and thank you pages have been implemented.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>The correct buttons and calls-to-action (CTAs) are present in the proper locations.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Everything is linked together appropriately.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>9. Create your site backup strategy.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>You can prevent loss of data and protect against malware and other damages by properly setting up site security and regular backups. Check that:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Backup schedule has been created.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Backup location has been identified.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>A plan for implementation is set to be put in motion after launch.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>10. Store passwords and credentials in a secure place.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Many individuals have likely been involved in the website launch up until this point, so ensure that passwords are reset when the time comes and proper password etiquette is followed.</p> \n<h3>11. Audit the technical SEO implementation for errors.&nbsp;</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Pages have unique page titles.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Pages have unique meta descriptions.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Each page has a specific purpose, and pages meant to rank organically are optimized around a single keyword or set of keywords.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>12. Conduct a stress test.</h3> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/website-optimization?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=website_optimization\">typical website redesign</a>, it may not be 100% necessary to do a stress test because the traffic spike may not overrun your server's capacity. But a stress test (also called a load test) is a must for any company that plans for a large influx of visitors during specific times — such as the holidays or after a major press event. It'll help you figure out how much simultaneous traffic your website can handle by simulating up to tens of thousands of simultaneous virtual users from different locations around the world.</p> \n<p>While stress tests simulate virtual users, the test won't be totally replicating a real-life scenario — so you'll want to find a test that brings you as close to reality as possible. Ask a developer which load tests they recommend. Here at HubSpot, many of our developers use <a href=\"http://jmeter.apache.org/\">JMeter by Apache</a>, but this is a pretty technical tool that's not ideal for&nbsp;someone who's new to the concept.</p> \n<p>Be sure to notify your host or provider that you want to perform a stress test before you actually do one.&nbsp;Otherwise, your test might look like a DDoS&nbsp;(Distributed Denial of Service)<em>&nbsp;</em>attack on your provider.&nbsp;Many providers (including HubSpot) consider an unauthorized load test a violation of terms of service.</p> \n<p>User experience is a key aspect of how they view your company, so testing your website before it goes live will bring more confidence that visitors will not be immediately displeased with your offerings.</p> \n<h2>Website Post-Launch Checklist</h2> \n<p>Let's say you've done it. The button has been pushed, the domain is pointing to the new site, and you're about ready to tell the world...</p> \n<p>But wait just one second because you still have things to check for now that your site is officially live.</p> \n<h3>13. Test the site for user experience again.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Just in case there was an issue with the implementation, you'll want to ensure the experience is consistent with what you reviewed before it went live.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Ensure your design is rendering as you expected it to across browsers.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Ensure your design is rendering as you expected it to across devices.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Ensure CSS/HTML is properly validated.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>CSS styling is rendering properly.</li> \n <li>Favicon is in place and rendering properly.&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Internal links across web pages are working properly.</li> \n <li>External links across web pages are working properly, and open in a new tab.</li> \n <li>Social media share icons are working properly.</li> \n <li>Feeds are working properly (RSS, news, social media).</li> \n <li>Company logo is linked to the homepage.</li> \n <li>404 Redirect pages are in place (page-not-found.aspx).</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>14. Test your conversion path's functionality.</h3> \n<p>Take some time to test and validate all of the different features on your website. Lead generation forms, CRM integration, and any other technology should work flawlessly across your website.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Forms are submitting data properly.</li> \n <li>Thank you message or page displays after form is submitted.</li> \n <li>Form data is being emailed to a recipient and/or stored in a company database.</li> \n <li>Auto-responders are working properly (if applicable).</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>15. Check that integrations with third-party tools are running smoothly.</h3> \n<p>Integrations such as your CRM, e-commerce software, and/or marketing platform link to your site and help you run your business. If there is a potential issue that can cause data loss, you don't want to find out way after the fact.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>16. Make a copy of the final website for backup purposes.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Now that everything is in place and finalized, you want to have a pristine copy of it should you experience data corruption or loss.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>17. Ensure that backups are running properly.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Now is the time to check the implementation of your backup strategy. Check that ongoing copies of the website are being created and stored on a regular basis.</p> \n<h3>18. Make sure your site is secure.</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>24/7 monitoring scripts are installed.</li> \n <li>There's a plan in place for updating plugins (if applicable).&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Ensure that all applicable parties are aware of your organization's password etiquette policies.</li> \n <li>Purchase an SSL certificate if need-be. An SSL certificate takes up to two weeks to purchase and set up, so ensure you have it prior to launch. (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-ssl\">An SSL certificate</a> will ensure&nbsp;your website is encrypted so hackers can't intercept any of your data. Not only will this put your website visitors at ease, but it'll also boost your website's SEO since&nbsp;<a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html\">SSL is now part of Google's search ranking algorithm</a>.)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>19. Comply with all applicable laws.</h3> \n<p>Make sure your website complies with any applicable laws and regulations. Internet law can be sticky, and each industry has its own set of rules to follow. <strong>So it's best to consult with your legal counsel to make sure you aren't missing anything — this post is not legal guidance. </strong>Here are a few you might need to know about:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Web pages offer accessibility for users with disabilities (WAI-ARIA).</li> \n <li>Web pages announce if the website uses cookies (required in some countries).</li> \n <li>Website is compliant with usage rights for purchased or borrowed code, images, and fonts.</li> \n <li>Terms and privacy policies are visible to website visitors.</li> \n <li>Website is <a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/\">PCI compliant</a> (if you're storing and processing credit cards).</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>20. Crawl the site to ensure no errors happened on launch.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Compare the crawl to the previous crawl and see if you find any inconsistencies that were not intentional. You'll also want to ensure that all pages have the proper search engine indexing settings.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you'll want to check for formatting consistency. Sometimes, font codes get dropped into a page accidentally, so you'll want to scour your site for any of these weird formatting errors. Make sure all your formatting is consistent and there are no weird blips in your copy.</p> \n<h3>21. Check the technical SEO components for errors.</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Page titles, meta descriptions, and URLs are all present and match the original technical SEO strategy.</li> \n <li>Load time for site pages is optimized.</li> \n <li>A <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en\">dynamic XML sitemap</a> has been created.</li> \n <li>The XML sitemap has been submitted to search engines.</li> \n <li>Page URLs consistently reflect site information architecture.</li> \n <li>301 redirects are in place for all old URLs (redirecting old to new pages).</li> \n <li>rel=\"nofollow\" tags are in place on applicable links and pages.</li> \n <li>Images on the website are properly compressed (which helps with load time).&nbsp;</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>22. Optimize your metadata.</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Metadata is properly in place for any content in an RSS feed.</li> \n <li>Metadata is properly in place for any social media sharing content.</li> \n <li>Spelling and grammar are correct in all metadata.</li> \n <li>Alt tags have been added to every image.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>23. Set up analytics.</h3> \n<p>Make sure your website is set up to capture web data and analytics. This valuable information will allow you to continually improve your website going forward, so you don't want to forget this stuff.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your website analytics codes and tracking scripts have been inserted on website.</li> \n <li>Relevant IP addresses have been excluded from analytics tracking.</li> \n <li>Funnels and goals have been properly created in your analytics software (if applicable).</li> \n <li>Google Webmaster and Google Analytics accounts have been properly synced.</li> \n <li>Google Ads accounts have been properly synced (if applicable).</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>24. Start a post-launch enhancement list.</h3> \n<p>The website you launch should be functional, well-designed, and well-positioned. But it probably won't be everything you hoped and dreamed on the first go — and you certainly don't want to spend months of effort designing a site that people may not react well to. What if your client doesn't like it? What if conversion rates plummet? That could add up to lost money and effort.</p> \n<p>Instead, it's best to publish a solid website, and then test and build on top of it <span>—</span> a website creation approach known as <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/growth-driven-design\">growth-driven design</a>. Create a document that lists out all&nbsp;the things you can't get done for the launch itself but want to add in the future, and add features and elements to it as you discover more about how users interact with the site. This you can do by using one of these <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/website-user-testing-tools\">user testing tools</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>How Do You Announce a New Website Launch?</h2> \n<p>This (hopefully) wasn't a vanity project; you did all of this work so far for the benefit of your website visitors, prospects, and existing customers. Your next step is to tell the world about your new site design. Here's how:</p> \n<h3>25. Build anticipation with teasers before the site is live.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A launch of a new product, a launch of a new movie, and — yes — a new site launch all require marketing before the actual release. Think of the last movie you watched in the theater. Did you see the trailer before you decided to buy those movie tickets and popcorn?</p> \n<p>Teasers for your website launch can only help to build anticipation and get users wondering what the new experience will be like. This can build buzz and interest once you finally break the news.</p> \n<h3>26. Create a social media strategy for the announcement.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Decide what channels you want to promote the news on, how you will make the announcement, and how long the promotion will last.</p> \n<p>As you craft your messaging, remember to focus on new features and how they benefit your audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>27. Identify exciting ways to promote engagement for the new site.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>For users who aren't as involved in your brand, a new site launch might not seem like a big deal. Your goal, then, is to make it one. Provide an exclusive offer for the first users who visit the site. Or, create a contest that promotes engaging with the site's new features. Whatever you choose, make sure you make it fun and interesting.</p> \n<h3>28. Send an email to your existing database.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>You may want to give existing leads and customers a head's up about the new design, especially if it will cause any confusion when they next visit. You can break the news as a matter of courtesy but also sneak in ways to underscore the value you're providing.</p> \n<p>You can also alert all stakeholders of the redesign and ask them to spread the word of the new website.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>29. Continue to promote the launch for a month.&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Just because you post about your new website once on social media does not mean that your audience will drop everything to visit the site in droves. Make your launch a big deal, and keep the new functionality top of mind so that your audience is prompted multiple times to check it out.</p> \n<p>(Once your website is launched, remember&nbsp;to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/build-sitemap-website\">resubmit your XML sitemap</a> to all major search engines once you're done, too.)</p> \n<h2>Resources for Launching Your First Website</h2> \n<p>Launching a new website can be a tedious task, but you can alleviate some of the stress by using this comprehensive website launch checklist.</p> \n<p>If you're just getting started on your first website, here are a few tools that can help you streamline your process</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>CMS:</strong> As mentioned above, a CMS can help you design your website, optimize and publish content, and track your analytics once it's launched.

Because changes in the supply and demand of products can result in the scarcity principle coming into play.</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll learn what the scarcity principle is and how you can use it to create high demand.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: State of Marketing in 2021 Report\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png\" align=\"middle\"></a> \n<h2>What is the scarcity principle?</h2> \n<p>The scarcity principle of persuasion coined by <a href=\"https://www.influenceatwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/E_Brand_principles.pdf\">Dr. Robert Cialdini</a> means the rarer or more difficult it is to obtain a product, offer, or piece of content is, the more valuable it becomes. Because we think the product will soon be unavailable to us, we're more likely to buy it than if there were no impression of scarcity.</p> \n<p>Brands can use the scarcity principle to persuade people to fill out a lead form, purchase a product, or take another desired action. Here's an example: On many air travel booking sites, such as <a href=\"https://www.kayak.com/\">KAYAK</a>, flight listings are displayed with a note that only a few seats are left at a certain price. Check it out below:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kayak-scarcity-principle.png?width=548&amp;name=kayak-scarcity-principle.png\" alt=\"Kayak scarcity principle\" width=\"548\" style=\"width: 548px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>We know that airfare pricing is incredibly volatile -- that's why some of us wait until <a href=\"http://clark.com/travel/best-day-book-cheap-flight/\">certain times or days of the week</a> to make purchases -- so the knowledge that only one seat is available at that price makes me think I should buy it now, instead of waiting and running the risk of paying more later.</p> \n<p>To learn about general consumers, we decided to survey 300 people to see if they were more interested in products that had a limited supply.</p> \n<p>45% of respondents said that scarcity makes them want to learn more about a product, while only 17% said that if it was too hard to purchase a product, they'd find it at another company.</p> \n<p>See results below:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/scarcity-principle-research.png?width=1206&amp;name=scarcity-principle-research.png\" alt=\"Scarcity principle survey results\" width=\"1206\" style=\"width: 1206px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://luc.id/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Data Source</a></p> \n<p>Now that we're all up to speed on scarcity, we wanted to highlight brands that have successfully used the scarcity principle to market and sell different products.</p> \n<h2>7 Brands That Used the Scarcity Principle to Promote and Sell Products</h2> \n<h3>1. Snap Inc.</h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/og-map.png?width=730&amp;height=383&amp;name=og-map.png\" alt=\"Snapchat high demand\" width=\"730\" height=\"383\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.spectacles.com/\">Image Source</a></em></span></p> \n<p>Ephemeral social media app Snapchat's parent company, Snap Inc., unveiled Snapchat Spectacles in <a href=\"https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/introducing-spectacles/\">September 2016</a>: sunglasses that could record 10-second videos from the perspective of the wearer. But instead of selling the new gadget online or at a storefront, Spectacles were initially only sold via Snapbots -- smiling, Snapchat-themed vending machines that were randomly dropped in cities around the United States.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Snapchat-Spectacles-Snapbot-640x447.jpg?width=640&amp;height=447&amp;name=Snapchat-Spectacles-Snapbot-640x447.jpg\" alt=\"Snapbot spectacle\" width=\"640\" height=\"447\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"http://phandroid.com/2016/11/21/snapchat-spectacles-new-york-city/\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>There were never announcements in advance of the arrival of Snapbots -- most awareness was generated on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/snapbotsighting\">social media</a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/snapbotlocations/\">channels</a>, and huge lines of people would queue hoping to purchase Spectacles before the Snapbot ran out of stock for the day.</p> \n<p>Now, Spectacles are <a href=\"https://www.spectacles.com/\">sold online</a> or at a few more permanent pop-up locations, so there's no need to line up outside a vending machine if you don't want to. But for the initial launch, the Snapbots was a unique approach to the scarcity complex. Spectacles were available for a limited time only -- just the day the Snapbot was in your city, and you had to beat everyone else trying to buy Spectacles before the machine sold out.</p> \n<p>Plus, the product's scarcity meant nobody -- ourselves included here at HubSpot -- could stop talking about the Spectacles. Blog posts and social media comments about the unique selling approach helped fuel even more interest in the products.</p> \n<p>MediaKix predicted Snap would achieve <a href=\"http://mediakix.com/2017/01/snapchat-spectacles-sales-projections-forecast-infographic/#gs.wxacByc\">$5 billion in Spectacles sales by 2020</a>, however, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/evan-spiegel-triples-down-on-snapchat-spectacles-3-at-twice-the-price\">Spectacles failed to make an impression</a> in the market and the company had to swallow about<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/11/20/tech-turkeys-2017-spectacles-beats-bixby-and-juicero-list-biggest-misses/872697001/\">$40 million</a><span> in unsold inventory after it released the first version</span>. Despite that failure, the company is still developing several iterations of the product.</p> \n<p>Regardless of how well the products sold, the marketing strategy to use scarcity helped pull people into a product that they might not have been interested in otherwise.</p> \n<h3>2. Nintendo</h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/wii-production-line.jpg?width=480&amp;height=223&amp;name=wii-production-line.jpg\" alt=\"Wii production line\" width=\"480\" height=\"223\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/02/nintendo-slowing-wii-production-lines/\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you weren't a big gamer back when Nintendo released the Wii gaming console in 2006, you might not remember that the Wii was one of the hottest commodities on the market. When it was officially released in <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/its-all-fun-and-games-at-nycs-wii-launch/\">November 2006</a>, people lined up to get their hands on the Wii as soon as possible, but the mania didn't end there. For nearly three years, the Wii was flying off the shelves, and <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22805\">gaming stores couldn't keep shelves stocked</a> -- despite Nintendo <a href=\"http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/GadgetGuide/story?id=4001054&amp;page=1\">increasing its supply</a> to 1.8 million and then 2.4 million units of production per month.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Supply eventually caught up with demand -- <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/nintendo-wii-supply-finally-catches-up-to-demand/\">48 million Wiis</a> sold later. By starting out with a low monthly production number, Nintendo ensured that customers would be clamoring to buy more right off the bat. The scarcity complex here made people desperate to buy a Wii whenever they could -- especially after a Nintendo executive <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2007/11/wii-shortage/\">advised shoppers</a> to \"stalk the UPS driver\" and to figure out when Wiis were being delivered to stores to get their hands on one.</p> \n<h3>3.

After stating on its website that the specialty drink would only be available for a few days, Starbucks was flooded with unicorn frappuccino orders -- which <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-runs-out-of-unicorn-frappuccino-2017-4\">quickly sold out</a> within the first day. There are no sales numbers available for the specialty drink, but there are nearly 160,000 <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/unicornfrappuccino/\">#unicornfrappuccino</a> posts on Instagram.</p> \n<p>Starbucks gets a lot of orders -- and social media engagement -- during another of its notorious limited-time offers -- the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BMoWwfNBOpP/?taken-by=starbucks\">Starbucks Red Cups</a>. During the holiday season in December, Starbucks starts serving coffee in red cups for a limited time only to drive people into cafes and to get them to share #RedCups photos on social media. In this case, scarcity + food and drink is the magic equation.</p> \n<h3>4. Girlfriend Collective</h3>  \n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\"> \n <div style=\"padding: 8px;\"> \n  <div style=\"background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 62.4537037037037% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n   &nbsp;\n  </div> \n  <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BDzbOu4s4pN/\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\">The Girlfriend legging is here. 🍾✨ The new generation of activewear is yours for just the cost of shipping. You read that right. Our super soft, sheer-proof leggings are designed by veterans of Acne Studios and lululemon, which means you're not only getting a deal, you're getting your new best friend.

All you had to do was share a link to its website on Facebook.</p> \n<p>Girlfriend Collective had just launched its website, and it was asking its female consumers to spread the word about the leggings so it could dedicate 100% of its advertising budget to leggings production. And if you think about it, that was a smart approach. After all, which are you more willing to trust: a Facebook ad offering free leggings or half of your friends in your News Feed advocating for the offer?</p> \n<p>Using this model, Girlfriend Collective \"sold\" <a href=\"http://www.instyle.com/fashion/girlfriend-collective-free-leggings\">10,000 pairs of leggings</a> just on the first day of the campaign -- in addition to the myriad of fans and buzz it scored as a by-product. The one-two punch of \"limited supply\" and \"free\" made this offer irresistible -- even to me.</p> \n<h3>5. Groupon</h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/groupon-limited-time.png\" alt=\"Groupon limited time offer\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/deals/intercontinental-spa-boston\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Groupon partners with different businesses to offer discounted services in exchange for new customers -- and a split of the revenue. The site often uses a limited-time remaining warning (pictured above) to encourage visitors to buy quickly at the risk of missing out on a good deal.</p> \n<p>For some deals, Groupon uses a few marketing psychology persuasion tactics to encourage you to buy. Check out the deal below:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/groupon-example-2.png?width=248&amp;name=groupon-example-2.png\" alt=\"Groupon scarcity principle\" width=\"248\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 248px;\"></p> \n<p>This deal uses the scarcity principle and social proof to encourage you to buy it -- it's only available for a limited time, <em>and</em> almost 600 other people have already purchased it and rated it highly. These strategies work well -- Groupon made <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/GRPN/financials\">more than $3 billion</a> last year.</p> \n<h3>6. Spotify</h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Spotify-US-Invites.png?width=730&amp;height=368&amp;name=Spotify-US-Invites.png\" alt=\"Spotify invite\" width=\"730\" height=\"368\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://geek.com/\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When the music streaming service Spotify was first launched, the United Kingdom was the only area that <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/spotify-goes-invite-only/?_escaped_fragment_=\">didn't require an invitation</a> from a friend or from Spotify to sign up. But due to high demand, Spotify U.K. actually had to start requiring invitations to manage all of the news users. The caveat to the invitation-only launches of Spotify around the world? Anyone could sign up for a premium, paid Spotify account. Using the scarcity principle, Spotify managed high levels of consumer demand by offering them a way in -- for a price. Now, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-02/spotify-hits-50-million-paid-subscribers-lifting-music-industry\">half of Spotify's 100 million users</a> are paid, subscribers.</p> \n<h3>7. TOMS</h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/toms-wild-aid.png?width=730&amp;height=417&amp;name=toms-wild-aid.png\" alt=\"TOMS wild aid initiative\" width=\"730\" height=\"417\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.toms.com/\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The beloved TOMS shoes offer a great value proposition beyond comfort and style: For every pair of shoes purchased, TOMS donates a pair to a child in need. TOMS takes that a step further by partnering with other advocacy organizations to share sales revenue to benefit other worthy causes.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Because the brand knows its customers are already philanthropic, it's a safe bet they'll want to purchase shoes benefiting other causes (such as pandas in the example above), but they still might need a push. So TOMS created a mini-site about why TOMS and WildAid are partnering, along with some fun facts about pandas and unique panda-themed shoe designs.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Then, once the visitor has read the entire compelling site and started browsing the vegan, panda-friendly footwear options, TOMS subtly lets them know that the shoes are only available for a short period of time. In other words, helping cute pandas is only an option for a limited time, too.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/toms-wildaid-pandas.png?width=730&amp;height=98&amp;name=toms-wildaid-pandas.png\" alt=\"TOMS wild aid panda collection\" width=\"730\" height=\"98\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">TOMS' approach of using the scarcity complex to encourage shopping and philanthropy works here.</p> \n<h2>Sometimes, Less Is More</h2> \n<p>Invoking the scarcity principle to promote and sell a product can be an effective persuasion strategy, but you have to do it correctly. If you phrase the product scarcity as if there used to be a large supply, but due to increased demand, only a few products were left, consumers will be more receptive. But if you phrase the product scarcity as if only a few units of product were ever available, the principle of scarcity won't be as effective at generating sales.</p> \n<p><i><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in May 2017 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></i></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"state of marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fthe-scarcity-principle&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png","linkMd5":"aad77e7209fdad88cd9527dadf757114","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn5@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-586_88b93bfb7be7b212.webp","destWidth":442,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5404,"destBytes":7216,"author":"sbernazzani@hubspot.com (Sophia Bernazzani)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn5@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-586_88b93bfb7be7b212.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kayak-scarcity-principle.png?width=548&name=kayak-scarcity-principle.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn34@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-49-964_9d0893612cd1bfd8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/scarcity-principle-research.png?width=1206&name=scarcity-principle-research.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn57@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-53-607_9a365d96317f8248.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/og-map.png?width=730&height=383&name=og-map.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn96@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-52-499_61a930114c6f0c4f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Snapchat-Spectacles-Snapbot-640x447.jpg?width=640&height=447&name=Snapchat-Spectacles-Snapbot-640x447.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn15@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-52-915_ccea3d21a539cfd0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/wii-production-line.jpg?width=480&height=223&name=wii-production-line.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn24@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-51-753_e0cc3a3fd2491ec0.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/groupon-limited-time.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn4@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-51-429_4cfa44e95dd3cbae.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/groupon-example-2.png?width=248&name=groupon-example-2.png":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Spotify-US-Invites.png?width=730&height=368&name=Spotify-US-Invites.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn17@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-51-011_f1d3d79c9dedce4a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/toms-wild-aid.png?width=730&height=417&name=toms-wild-aid.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn43@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-49-235_b666a39c257aa56f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/toms-wildaid-pandas.png?width=730&height=98&name=toms-wildaid-pandas.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn90@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-51-978_42008929bc51de64.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-48-782_ba6ee21c8b9c368e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fthe-scarcity-principle&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn81@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-52-307_09e8d06f65c87b19.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938147},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"How to Set & Achieve Marketing Objectives in 2021","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-objectives","description":"<p>In the marketing industry, setting objectives can be a double-edged sword.

Focusing on <a href=\"https://contently.com/2018/03/16/drive-grow-vs-drive-serve/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">serving your customers is what produces results</a>. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, is famous for sparking this customer-centric movement.</p>  \n<p>In 2015, he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-goldman-sachs-conerence-2015-2\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">spoke at Goldman Sach’s Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco</a>, and a reporter asked him what some of Apple’s biggest accomplishments from the past year were. He responded, “We're not focused on the numbers. We're focused on the things that produce the numbers.\"</p> \n<p>In this blog post, we’ll show you how to set realistic marketing objectives that will help you craft audience-centric content, prioritize your customers' needs, and hit your numbers, all at the same time.</p> \n<p>Read on to learn how to identify your marketing objectives’ purpose and process and why it's just as important as the numbers you aim to hit.</p> \n<p></p> \n<div> \n <p>In his <a href=\"http://jayacunzo.com/blog/problem-with-goals\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">insightful blog post about setting goals</a>, Jay Acunzo, the founder of Unthinkable Media, reveals a subtle yet potent problem that has pervaded the content marketing industry over the years — traditional goal-setting lets you measure what you do, but it doesn’t lend itself to gauging how you do it or why which is what ultimately gives your work meaning and resonates with prospects.</p> \n <p>In marketing, you obviously need to aim for concrete targets. But, as we said earlier, only focusing on the results can sometimes incentivize you to take a course of action that prioritizes your organization’s needs over your customers’ needs.</p> \n <p>To help you focus more on your purpose and process instead of just your results, Acunzo recommends considering two additional factors when setting a marketing objective — your hunger and your aspirational anchor.</p> \n <p>Your hunger is your current dissatisfaction with your work today or why you want to achieve your goal. Your aspirational anchor is your vision of your work in the future or how you’ll achieve your goal.</p> \n <p>These two factors drive your motivation and keep you on track to create work that better serves your customers. When you add your numerical goal to the equation, you’ll be able to simultaneously produce customer-centric work and create business impact.</p> \n <h2>How to Set Realistic Marketing Objectives</h2> \n <p>The first thing to understand is the subtle <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/goals-vs-objectives?_ga=2.175461482.933151706.1623427346-1058722707.1623427346\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">difference between a goal and an objective</a>. A general goal is going to be your broader vision while your marketing objective is that more concrete specification of how that vision is achieved. In order to craft your marketing objective, you must start with vision first by defining three main things:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Hunger - What is the driving force — or the “why” — behind what you want to achieve? What pain or problem has led you to this point, and why must it be solved?</li> \n  <li>Aspirational Anchor - What does success look like — or “how” does the end vision solve that problem?</li> \n  <li>Goal - What steps must be taken — or the “what” — for that aspiration to come to fruition?</li> \n </ul> \n <p>Now that we understand the “why” and the “how” behind setting marketing objectives, let’s go over how you can root the \"what\" in reality with the SMART goal framework.</p> \n <p>SMART goals are realistic, quantifiable, and focused targets that you can easily aim for. If you’re wondering what SMART means, it’s an acronym that helps you clearly define your goals.</p> \n <h4><strong>Specific</strong></h4> \n <p>In terms of marketing, you should choose the particular metric you want to improve upon, like visitors, leads, or customers. You should also determine what each team member will work on, the resources they’ll have, and their plan of action.</p> \n <h4><strong>Measurable</strong></h4> \n <p>If you want to gauge your team’s progress, you need to quantify your goals, like achieving an X% increase in visitors, leads, or customers.</p> \n <h4><strong>Attainable</strong></h4> \n <p>Make sure that X% increase is achievable in your specific situation. If your blog traffic increased by 5% last month, try to increase it by 8-10% this month, not 30%. It’s crucial to base your goals on your own analytics, not industry benchmarks, or else you might bite off more than you can chew.</p> \n <h4><strong>Relevant</strong></h4> \n <p>Your goal needs to relate to your company’s overall goal and account for current trends in your industry. For instance, will growing your Facebook following lead to more revenue? And is it actually possible for you to significantly boost your organic reach on Facebook after their most recent algorithm change? If you’re aware of these factors, you’ll be more likely to set goals that are realistic, achievable, and beneficial to your company.</p> \n <h4><strong>Time-bound</strong></h4> \n <p>Attaching deadlines to your goals puts pressure on your team to accomplish them. And this helps you make consistent and significant progress in the long term. If you don’t give yourself a deadline, you can very easily fall into the trap of procrastinating on action items, leading to a slower rate of success.</p> \n <p>For example, which would you prefer: Increasing leads by 5% every month, leading to a 30-35% increase in half a year, or trying to increase leads by 15% with no deadline and achieving that goal in a year?</p> \n <p>By analyzing two different goal-setting frameworks, we’ve learned how to identify the “why,” “how,” and “what” behind your marketing objectives. Now, we can blend the two frameworks to set a realistic goal that fulfills your customers’ needs and helps you hit your numbers at the same time. Check out the examples below for more detail.</p> \n</div> \n<div></div> \n<div> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Now that you know how to write a marketing objective, you can get ideas from some metaphorical samples. Below, we’ll start with one long example breaking out the above methodology step-by-step, and then we’ll provide other examples to fuel your inspiration.</span></p> \n <h3><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">1. Increase blog subscribers.</span></h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">In this example, we’ll set a target of increasing blog subscribers by 25% month-over-month this year — it’s a substantive increase, but possible with the SMART framework.</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Hunger (Why) - Our blog educates our audience well but it doesn’t resonate emotionally with them enough.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Aspirational Anchor (How) - Run a blog that consistently resonates with our audience and that people look forward to reading every time they receive our email digest.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Goal (What) - Increase blog subscribers as an indication of our success.</span></li> \n </ul> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">With this goal-setting framework, you can see how the “why” and “how” behind a goal incentivizes behavior that better serves customers and hits numbers at the same time.</span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">For instance, in the example above, this blog team refuses to just do whatever it takes to boost their blog subscription. They want to craft emotionally resonant stories that their audience actually values or content that’s worth subscribing to, and this is what will lead to their growth in subscribers and create long-term value for their business.</span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">If this blog team didn’t identify their hunger or set an aspirational anchor, however, the only thing that would guide them toward the finish line is the finish line itself. And that could incentivize short-sighted behavior that helps them achieve their goal at the expense of prioritizing their audience’s needs over their own.</span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Once the aspirational vision and the general goal has been defined, now it’s time to pivot to a concrete objective using the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template?_ga=2.175461482.933151706.1623427346-1058722707.1623427346\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">SMART goal framework</a><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">:</span></span></p> \n <h4><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Specific</span></h4> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Our blog educates our audience well, but it doesn’t resonate emotionally with them enough. Let’s start running a blog that can consistently provide value, that people look forward to reading every time they receive our email digest, and that can attract more subscribers.</span></p> \n <h4><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Measurable</span></h4> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Increase month-over-month blog subscribers by 25% this year.</span></p> \n <h4><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Attainable</span></h4> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Last year, we increased month-over-month blog subscribers by 15%, so we know this is doable.</span></p> \n <h4><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Relevant</span></h4> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">If we can craft emotionally resonant stories that our audience actually values, we can build deeper relationships with them, attract more subscribers with whom we can also build deep relationships, and hopefully do business in the future.</span></p> \n <h4><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Time-Bound</span></h4> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Monthly over the course of a year.</span></p> \n <h3><strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">2. Reach more visitors with organic search traffic.</span></strong></h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Let's say our organization's goal is to grow its online organic presence to attract more leads and reach 35,000 visitors via organic search monthly by the end of the year. These are Hunger and Aspirational anchors, so they must be translated into a SMART goal if we want to take steps to achieve it:</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Specific - Increase website visitors from organic search.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Measurable - Reach 35,000 visitors monthly.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Attainable - Must be sure that the number is reachable by increasing or improving variables within our control.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Relevant - Must be the right traffic since the ultimate goal is to increase leads.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Time-bound - By the end of the year.</span></li> \n </ul> \n <h3><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">3. Improve the mobile traffic conversion rate site-wide.</span></h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Traffic alone is not enough to generate leads and, ultimately, revenue. We need mechanisms in place to convert the traffic we're already getting. </span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Let's say we notice that our site converts a lot better on desktop than mobile. This means we could be losing a ton of lead opportunities who arrived at our site on a mobile device. That's why we decide to enhance the mobile experience and set a goal of improving mobile traffic conversion rates site-wide from 2.3% to 5% by Q3 Here's how we turn that goal into an objective:</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Specific - Improve mobile traffic conversion rate.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Measurable - From 2.3% to 5%.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Attainable - Must identify roadblocks to conversion and how we plan to remove them.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Relevant - Must actually have enough mobile traffic to justify the effort.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Time-bound - By Q3.</span></li> \n </ul> \n <h3><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">4. Increase MQL conversions.</span></h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">With inbound marketing, it's easy to get swept up in blogging, offer creation, and lead conversions. At the same time, if we don't have mechanisms in place to move those leads closer to a purchasing decision, these efforts don't pay off the way they could. <span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Part of our jobs as marketers is to foster relationships with our leads while qualifying them so that the sales team focuses on prospects who are ready to buy.</span></span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Let's say we have a top-of-the-funnel lead generation engine where website visitors convert on eBooks and guides. Our goal is now to bridge the gap between where they're at in their journey vs. where we want them to go and so we aim to convert 500 leads to MQLs by the end of the year. We decide to do that through an ongoing educational email drip sequence, and we start with our objective:</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Specific - Convert Leads to MQLs.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Measurable - From the existing number to 500.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Attainable - Must ensure we already have a large enough pool to extract those MQLs from (or a fast-enough lead generation engine to supply them).</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Relevant - Must have a clear definition of what constitutes an MQL and a plan to obtain those parameters.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Time-bound - By the year's end.</span></li> \n </ul> \n <h3><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">5. Boost the average monthly open rate.</span></h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">In order for us to effectively nurture leads, we want people to be reading our content... which they won't do if they don't get past the subject line of the email. Here's how we position this concept into the concrete objective of increasing the monthly open rate from 25% to 40% in one quarter:</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Specific - Increase average monthly open rate.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Measurable - From 25% to 40%.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Attainable - Must analyze existing email tactics to identify gaps.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Relevant - Must only include the most relevant marketing emails in the metrics to avoid skewing data.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Time-bound - In one quarter</span></li> \n </ul> \n <h3>6. Increase our MQL to SQL conversion rate.</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Never forget the primary goal of marketing, which is to promote an organization's goods or services in the effort of generating more sales. At the same time, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34212/how-to-create-a-service-level-agreement-sla-for-better-sales-marketing-alignment.aspx?_ga=2.175461482.933151706.1623427346-1058722707.1623427346\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">fewer than half of marketers consider their departments aligned with sales</a><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">.</span></span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">A relevant goal might be to improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts by solidifying the marketing to sales hand-off. Specifically, we’re aiming to increase MQL to SQL conversion rate from 25% to 35% by Q2. Our concrete objective might break down like this:</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Specific - Increase the MQL to SQL conversion rate.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Measurable - From 25% to 35%.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Attainable - Must ensure we already have a large enough pool to extract those SQLs from (or a fast-enough lead generation engine to supply them).</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Relevant - Must have a clear agreement between the marketing and sales departments for what constitutes an SQL.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Time-bound - By Q2.</span></li> \n </ul> \n <h3>7. Improve overall NPS score.</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Marketing doesn't end once the prospect becomes a customer, and that means also working on ways to fuel the flywheel i.e. turning customers into brand advocates who purchase from us and tell their friends to do the same. </span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">NPS is a solid measurement of customer happiness, so improving that score — from 31 to 35 within 6 month — is a solid place to start building our objective:</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Specific - Improve the NPS score.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Measurable - From 31 to 35.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Attainable - Must analyze existing NPS roadblocks to identify gaps.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Relevant - Must ensure there's a mechanism for collecting and analyzing NPS input.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Time-bound - In 6 months.</span></li> \n </ul> \n <h3>8. Enhance Facebook engagement.</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">One of the best ways to grow a brand’s marketing efforts exponentially is by investing in its community of customers and prospects. The goal might be to stay top of mind and energize the community by raising the bar on each social media platform. For example, we might look to improve Facebook engagement by 30% month-over-month:</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Specific - Improve engagement on Facebook.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Measurable - By 30%.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Attainable - Must identify the content that's engaging our existing user base and see if 30% is a reasonable number to strive for.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Relevant - Must ensure that there's a solid definition of what metrics are being counted as engagement.</span></li> \n  <li style=\"color: #33475b;\"><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Time-bound - On a monthly rolling basis.</span></li> \n </ul> \n <h3>9. Increase total market share.</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">As digital markets become more crowded, it’s critical for companies to claim as much market share as possible — pulling even a few percentage points away from the competition can have significant benefits for your bottom line.</span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Let’s set a reasonable goal: Increasing total market share a 5% by the end of the year:</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Specific - Improve total market share</span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Measurable - By 5%</span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Attainable - Must identify areas of potential loss, such as customer churn, and areas of gain such as targeted advertising</span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Relevant - Must ensure there’s a reliable way to regularly measure market share</span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Time-bound - By the end of the year</span></li> \n </ul> \n <h3>10. Evaluate ad impact.</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Advertisements help your brand get noticed — but are your ads doing their job? Here, our marketing objective is to compare the cost-per-click and conversion rate of two different ads using A/B testing on social media over the period of a month to determine which one drives better ROI:</span></p> \n <ul> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Specific - Determine the highest ad impact</span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Measurable - Evaluated using cost-per-click</span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Attainable - Must assess the impact of each ad and how many click-throughs it generates</span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Relevant - Must ensure the same metrics are used for each ad to ensure an accurate comparison</span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Time-bound - In one month</span></li> \n  <li>Marketing Objectives: Metrics and KPIs</li> \n </ul> \n <p>Once marketing objectives have been established, companies must identify and track specific metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide both immediate insights and set the stage for long-term strategic planning. Some of the most common metrics and KPIs include:</p> \n <h3><span style=\"color: #444444;\">Sales Growth</span></h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sales growth is measured using total revenue volume, number of units sold, or both. Increasing numbers mean growing sales — for best effect, monitor sales growth as a baseline and then during new marketing campaigns to evaluate your impact.</span></p> \n <h3>Profit Variance</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Profit — also called return on investment (ROI) — isn’t simply a factor of sales and revenue. Instead, it depends on the amount of money your brand makes after material costs, marketing expenses, and other spending is subtracted. If material costs increase but sales remain steady, for example, profit will decrease. Monitoring profit variance helps ensure product prices drive ROI.</span></p> \n <h3>Total Market Share</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The bigger your market share, the better. To calculate this metric, you need the market size of your local industry and its approximate total revenue. </span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Multiple your brand’s revenue by 100 and divide by the market’s total revenue to get a percentage market share. Recalculate this regularly to see if your share has improved.</span></p> \n <h3>New Customer Volumes</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">More customers mean more sales and more revenue. Along with measuring the total number of new customers over a specific time frame, it’s also worth evaluating customer increases in comparison to other time frames — such as when you’re running a sales or marketing event — along with considering the cost per customer, which is the total amount of money spent to acquire a new customer.</span></p> \n <h3>Lifetime Customer Value</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Higher lifetime customer values mean more reliable revenue streams. To calculate this metric, multiply the average number of purchases made by return customers over a specific period with the average total value of these purchases. This provides an approximation of lifetime customer value to help inform ongoing marketing strategy.</span></p> \n <h3>Conversion Rates</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Conversion rates measure the percentage of people who take action when presented with the choice to opt-in for sales notifications, email newsletters, free trials, or who ultimately decide to make a purchase. It’s worth tracking conversion rates across all aspects of your website to see which marketing tools are delivering reliable results.</span></p> \n <h3>SEO Impact</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Search engine optimization (SEO) helps your brand rank higher with popular engines such as Google, in turn making it easier for customers to find your site. </span></p> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Tools such as <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/intl/en_ca/home/tools/keyword-planner/\">Google’s Keyword Planner </a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">can help you identify ways to improve your SEO, and you can quickly test how you stack up by searching for your brand’s target keyword and seeing where you show up in current search rankings.</span></span></p> \n <h3>Social Media Performance</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Social media marketing is now critical to generate organic engagement and customer referrals. As a result, it’s worth tracking metrics such as the increase in follower numbers on a certain platform over a specific period, the number of comments left on your posts, and the number of times your posts are shared.</span></p> \n <h2>Tools to Track Marketing Objectives</h2> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You’ve got the model. You’ve identified the objectives, and you’ve defined the metrics. Now you need the right tools to track marketing objective success across your organization.</span></p> \n <h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">HubSpot Marketing Hub</a></h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The HubSpot Marketing Hub offers all the marketing tools and data you need, and all under one roof. From SEO strategy tools to ad tracking, social media management and live chat support, and a robust content creation platform, HubSpot can help your brand reach more people more quickly and boost total ROI.</span></p> \n <h3>2. Real-time Dashboards</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Real-time dashboard tools provide right-now, single-pane-of-glass analysis of current sales performance, KPI progress, and other key metrics. Often hosted in the cloud, real-time dashboards make it possible for everyone in the organization to view current marketing goals and ensure business operations are aligned with specific outcomes.</span></p> \n <h3>3. Spreadsheets</h3> \n <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">While spreadsheets are often considered relatively low-tech and legacy deployments when compared to more robust marketing tools, they nonetheless offer actionable value. Tools such as Google Sheets and Excel are easy to use, easy to view, and offer an understanding of specific metric performance at a glance that can help inform current marketing efforts.</span></p> \n <h3>4.

And helping them book a meeting to learn more.</p> \n<p>Your website is part of your customer service team, answering questions about your products and services through a knowledge base or chatbot.</p> \n<p>Your website is a member of your HR team, sharing information about your company culture and open positions.</p> \n<p>The list goes on...</p> \n<p>To put it bluntly: your website is really freaking important! Today, <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/04/need-a-website-small-business.html\">86%</a> of people will find your business online. Your website is your first impression, your primary spokesperson, your around-the-clock inbound sales team — you get my point. It’s one of the most important assets to your business.</p> \n<p>It’s no wonder we see businesses invest so much in their websites. In a recent<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/website-strategy?_ga=2.40047268.743952961.1592515403-112379962.1552485402\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/website-strategy?_ga=2.40047268.743952961.1592515403-112379962.1552485402\">HubSpot Research study</a>, 63% of marketers indicated that they were going to upgrade their website this year.</p> \n<p>Website upgrades can include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Performance: Page speed, load time, page requests, page size, and more</li> \n <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Page index, meta descriptions, content plugins, and descriptive link text</li> \n <li>Design: Responsive design, legible font size, and tap targets</li> \n <li>Security: HTTPS and secure javascript libraries</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Since 2008, we’ve graded over 1 million unique websites on the above four factors. With all this investment, are they actually getting better? Are businesses focusing on the right website upgrades? For example, are websites providing better security for their visitors. Are they offering faster load speeds for quick access? What about mobile accessibility and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-tips\">SEO best practices</a>?</p> \n<p>Let’s take a look at average performance in 2015 compared to this year to see what’s changed.</p> \n<h2>Website Performance Data (2015 vs 2021)</h2> \n<p><img alt=\"Website Performance data from 2015 to 2021 HubSpot Research\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Does%20your%20Website%20Make%20the%20Grade%20in%202021%3F-1.png?width=624&amp;name=Does%20your%20Website%20Make%20the%20Grade%20in%202021%3F-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>What surprises me the most about this data is that the improvements in technology over the past five years haven’t led to the same improvement in website performance. The overall grade average has only improved 17.1% in little over five years, and performance has actually decreased by 23.3%. The average website grade in 2020 is a D+ (69.1 out of 100). My mother wouldn’t be happy if I came home with that kind of grade.</p> \n<p>We also found that only 3.8% of websites have an overall score of 90 or more. If your website scores above a 90, pat yourself on the back. Here are the percentile ranges from our data:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>80 overall score: 82nd percentile</li> \n <li>85 overall score: 91st percentile</li> \n <li>90 overall score: 96th percentile</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Here are some observations of the individual benchmark scores:</p> \n<h3>Website performance has decreased in the past half-decade.</h3> \n<p>Websites should load faster in 2021 than they did in 2015 — but the exact opposite is true. Performance was the only benchmark metric that decreased in five years. This includes testing for page size, page requests, page speed, and five additional tests that offer a holistic performance grading.</p> \n<p>The result? Websites are slower today than they were in 2015.</p> \n<p>This is a risk for businesses: the longer visitors wait for your page to load, the more likely they’ll leave your page.</p> \n<p>For every second that your website takes to load, people are leaving your business. Good performance should be a priority when improving your website.<a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0rGVT00\"> </a><a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0rGVT00\">How does your website’s performance compare</a>?</p> \n<h3>Search engine optimization is the biggest winner.</h3> \n<p>In a 2020 survey, we found that 64% of marketers are <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/seo-trends?_ga=2.48521120.743952961.1592515403-112379962.1552485402\">actively investing in search engine optimization (SEO)</a> and growing their organic presence.</p> \n<p>Marketers care about SEO, and this has led to significant progress in the SEO benchmark since 2015 — a 51.9% improvement. Search engine optimization is essential to getting discovered online. It’s good that so many websites are following SEO best practices to improve the discovery of their business.<a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0rGVT00\"> </a><a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0rGVT00\">How does your SEO compare</a>?</p> \n<h3>Security had the second-biggest gain, but the total average falls short.</h3> \n<p>Our security benchmark shows that websites have improved their security by 142.3% over five years. This is a huge gain but there’s still a lot of room for improvement — the 2021 average score is only 6.3 out of 10.</p> \n<p>Security is essential to have on your site to protect customer data. If your website isn’t secure, your visitors might lose trust in your business, especially when shopping on your site. We found that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-ssl?_ga=2.48521120.743952961.1592515403-112379962.1552485402\">85%</a> of people won’t visit a site if it’s not secure.</p> \n<p>Additionally, security improves discoverability. Starting in 2019, <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/google/2015/12/17/unsecured-websites-are-about-to-get-hammered-in-googles-search-ranking/\">Google prioritized displaying websites with HTTPS</a> in search results. Website Grader checks that your website uses HTTPS and has secure JavaScript libraries.</p> \n<p>These two security factors are critical for delivering a secure experience for your visitors.<a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0rGVT00\"> </a><a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0rGVT00\">How does your website security compare</a>?</p> \n<h3>Mobile optimized websites improved marginally.</h3> \n<p>In the mid-2010s, it felt like every website was going responsive — that is, investing in mobile-first website design. It made sense.</p> \n<p>Everywhere I looked, people were heads down on their phones, reading the latest Facebook post or watching a viral YouTube video. And, things haven’t changed much. Well, they have, but now people are scrolling through Instagram or browsing the latest TikTok dance challenge.</p> \n<p>Responsiveness wasn’t just a trend — in the first quarter of 2021, mobile devices (excluding tablets) generated <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017.\">54.8%</a> of global website traffic. So how do websites stack up on small screens?</p> \n<p>We found that our mobile design benchmark average improved by 8% over five years. Today, average websites score 21.6 out of 30 on mobile design. A great improvement, though I’d love to see that number go up even more.</p> \n<p>Instagram, for example, is a website that does exceptionally well in how they design and optimize users’ mobile experience. It has a seamless mobile shopping feature for businesses to sell products directly through its mobile website or in-app.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"mobile optimized website for shopping on Instagram and Facebook\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Does%20your%20Website%20Make%20the%20Grade%20in%202021%3F.gif?width=360&amp;height=667&amp;name=Does%20your%20Website%20Make%20the%20Grade%20in%202021%3F.gif\" title=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"667\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/facebook/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>One study by Google found that 59% of shoppers surveyed said that <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data/global-shopper-product-research-statistics/\">shopping on mobile is important when deciding</a> which brand or retailer to buy from.</p> \n<p>That’s a huge portion of people looking at your website on mobile and making a decision of whether or not to buy from you.

We’ve received good feedback from our users, but we are always growing and evolving.</p> \n<p>So we asked ourselves, how could we make Website Grader better?</p> \n<p>Our users’ comments had a common thread. They graded their site. They saw where their websites fell short. But we stopped short of teaching them how to improve:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>\"More information about how to solve website problems\"</li> \n <li>\"Instructions on how to get better performance and SEO to get our score higher\"</li> \n <li>\"How about putting explanations and guidelines for beginners?\"</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Introducing the New Website Grader</h2> \n<p>You talked. We listened. Not only have we updated Website Grader’s grading system and foundational technology to get you a more accurate score, but we’ve also created a five-lesson video course that helps you improve your grade.

You can't just upload 24 hours of video content on the platform. Now you might be wondering, <em>\"How long can my Instagram videos be?\"</em> Let's dive in below.</p> \n<h2>How Long Can Instagram Videos Be?</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Instagram Feed -- 60 seconds</li> \n <li>Stories -- 15 seconds</li> \n <li>Livestream Videos -- 60 minutes</li> \n <li>IGTV -- 15 seconds - 10 minutes. Verified accounts can post up to 60 minutes of video on IGTV.</li> \n <li>Instagram Feed ads -- 2 minutes</li> \n <li>Instagram Carousel Video ads -- 60 seconds</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Instagram videos are a great way to reach Gen Z or millennial audiences. However, it's important to think about the type of video content that performs best on the platform. Additionally, knowing the right size and video specifications before filming your videos can help you reach success quicker.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"instagram statistics\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Finstagram-video-formats&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9.png","linkMd5":"ab3a34aa261f83cd846ea231dc9649f9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-38-585_7e54748a32aeb250.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5752,"destBytes":7844,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-38-585_7e54748a32aeb250.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Best%20Video%20Formats%20on%20Instagram%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png?width=624&name=The%20Best%20Video%20Formats%20on%20Instagram%20%5BNew%20Data%5D.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn11@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-49-457_9214d09ce6eca111.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Best%20Video%20Formats%20on%20Instagram%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png?width=236&name=The%20Best%20Video%20Formats%20on%20Instagram%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn41@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-53-038_00887798554dcbea.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Best%20Video%20Formats%20on%20Instagram%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-2.png?width=258&name=The%20Best%20Video%20Formats%20on%20Instagram%20%5BNew%20Data%5D-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn86@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-48-798_5a3c32bbb2b0eb26.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn6@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-49-299_a4245cc995397db3.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Finstagram-video-formats&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn74@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-51-557_a469a2b5cd2ffa62.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938126},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"12 Tips on How to Become a Manager: From 5 People Who Did","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/be-a-good-manager","description":"<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">So, you want to become a manager.</span> \n<p>The million-dollar question is, how do you get noticed?</p> \n<p>Some say it's by taking on big projects. Others believe face-to-face interactions with upper management are key. The truth is, it's a combination of those two steps and many others.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"→ Click here to download leadership lessons from HubSpot founder, Dharmesh  Shah [Free Guide].\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png\"></a> \n<p>We'll cover them all in this article, featuring five HubSpot managers who share their journeys to becoming managers and what they now look for in managerial candidates.</p> \n<h2>1. Add value to your team.</h2> \n<p>The number one way to get noticed as management material is by adding value to your team in your current role.</p> \n<p>What does that look like? Well, it depends on your position.</p> \n<p>For Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Team Manager at HubSpot <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-ladd/\">Ashley Ladd</a>, it started by volunteering for presentation slides on diversity and inclusion during quarterly meetings.</p> \n<p>\"It's very easy for our leadership team to be like, 'I can do that,' or 'our chief legal officer can do that,' or 'somebody could do it,'\" said Ladd, then program manager, \"but I was able to raise my hand and say 'Hey, I'm willing to take on this part of the presentation' or 'I'd love to have that opportunity.'\"</p> \n<p>Ladd said it pushed her outside of her comfort zone but also gave her visibility with upper management. Furthermore, it allowed her to share more about what she did, and show why she was passionate about her work.</p> \n<p>\"Those were some of the things earlier on that set me up for being seen as a leader in our space,\" said Ladd.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carinacarlos/\">Carina Carlos</a>, product expert manager at HubSpot, added value by identifying a problem in her previous company's ticket management system and solving for it.</p> \n<p>\"Solutions aren't just waiting,\" said Carlos. \"They're not just there, you have to think about them, be creative and cover them.\"</p> \n<p>And that's exactly what she did. After brainstorming and developing a solution, Carlos pitched it to management and reduced ticket volume by around 40%.</p> \n<p>\"Taking ownership [is what gets you noticed for management roles], leading projects and thinking of projects that can have a bigger impact in terms of scalability and solving for the root,\" she said.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-simmons-0ab80936\">Christopher Simmons</a>, small business sales manager at HubSpot, says adding value looks like a combination of the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Being successful in your role</li> \n <li>Aligning with the company strategy</li> \n <li>Filling in gaps leadership may have</li> \n <li>Giving your perspective proactively</li> \n <li>Speaking up on behalf of people</li> \n</ul> \n<p>He believes it requires shifting from an individual contributor mindset to a team one. But as you identify these opportunities, make sure you're not stepping on other people to do it.</p> \n<p>\"A key to adding value is dropping pretense,\" Simmons says. \"What often happens is that people can feel like you are using them as a piece to get to wherever you're trying to go.\"</p> \n<p>Whether you start small or go big, there's always an opportunity for you to add value without pushing others to the side.</p> \n<h2>2. Volunteer for projects that give you visibility.</h2> \n<p>One of the best ways to be noticed by upper management&nbsp;is by working on projects your leadership team cares about.</p> \n<p>\"I was always raising my hand for something because I knew it would give me experience as well as exposure to what I wanted to do and what I didn't want to do,\" said Customer Success Manager at HubSpot <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shadaviamjones/\">Davey Jones</a>.</p> \n<p>\"So, I had my shortlist of non-negotiables for whatever my next opportunity would be, even if I was leading people,\" she continued, \"and that came from raising my hand and volunteering.\"</p> \n<p>Your first step is identifying what those projects are, through company meetings and conversations with your managers and other leaders. Next, break the projects up into two categories: small, low-commitment versus long, high-impact.</p> \n<p>Jones emphasizes the importance of having measurable goals to prevent overextending yourself. Because then, you end up underperforming.</p> \n<p>The formula is this: Identify projects you'd like to work on and decide how many you will work on per quarter.</p> \n<p>\"It circles back to leveraging those additional opportunities because a lot of that has a leadership undertone in its own right,\" said Jones. \"And when you take advantage of those opportunities, you realize 'Do I want to manage people?'\"</p> \n<p>During this process, Ladd offers a key piece of advice: zoom out and up.</p> \n<p>\"As a manager, you have to be able to take yourself out and up and be like, 'Who is this impacting? Who else do I need to talk to and who else do I need to collaborate with?' she said.</p> \n<p>She continued, \"I think sometimes in those moments where I felt that sense of urgency to get something done, I definitely missed the opportunity to say 'How else can I think about this from a global perspective or a manager perspective?'\"</p> \n<p>Being solution-oriented is great, but make sure you don't rush. Have conversations with your colleagues about the best ways to move forward, get their input, and go from there.</p> \n<p>Jones adds one more thing to keep in mind when volunteering for projects: Don't be afraid to change your mind in the middle of it, if it goes beyond the original scope.</p> \n<p>\"Having a conversation or ongoing conversations with your manager helps because then, they can say, 'What's on your plate and what do you want to take off of your plate?'\" said Jones. \"And then, you look at your projects and say, 'I don't like this one, so I'm going to take it off.'\"</p> \n<p>This is where leveraging your manager's help is key.</p> \n<h2>3. Take calculated risks.</h2> \n<p>When I asked <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vrnda-levalley/\">Vrnda LeValley</a>, customer training manager at HubSpot, if there's a particular moment that stands out to her as a manager-making moment, this is what she answered.</p> \n<p>\"Yes, a lot of them do and usually they were linked to 'This might be the day I lose my job,'\" she says.</p> \n<p>Needless to say, risky moves get you noticed.</p> \n<p>\"I actually prefer people who do too much. I would rather reel you back instead of push you out there because leadership is a vulnerable position,\" said Simmons. \"When you're a leader, you're going to have to step out and be vulnerable and be exposed.\"</p> \n<p>He continues, \"And it's a lonely place so, I want people who kind of push the boundaries a little bit. Then, we can teach, tailor, and cultivate.\"</p> \n<p>However, taking risks doesn't mean being reckless or a bully.</p> \n<p>You need to have a pioneering spirit to be <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/people-manager-skills\">an effective leader</a>, Simmons says, so shrinking back isn't the answer.</p> \n<p>Pay attention to what the business needs and be ready to act on it. This can mean having difficult conversations or stepping up when it's the right thing to do.</p> \n<p>\"Ask yourself, 'How can I do this in a way that is authentically who I am and honors people at the same time?\" says Simmons.</p> \n<p>If it seems scary to take the risk, Carlos suggests looking at the bigger picture and framing it as a service to the company, your customers, and the team.</p> \n<p>And if you mess up, own up to it.</p> \n<p>\"There needs to be a self-awareness there and an opportunity for you to raise your hand and say 'I didn't do something well,'\" said Ladd. \"Being able to apologize as a manager – it's humbling work and you have to be able to say, 'I totally messed that up' and 'Here's my action plan going forward,' I think that builds trust.\"</p> \n<h2>4. Mentor and be mentored.</h2> \n<p>Every manager I interviewed spoke of a commitment to mentor and/or be mentored.</p> \n<p>Why is <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-mentorship-program\">mentorship</a> vital to becoming a manager? LeValley says it helps you broaden your thinking.</p> \n<p>\"You won't know when you're thinking small cause you don't know what big is, so you need a sounding board for that,\" she said.</p> \n<p>The question is, how do you identify the right people to seek out mentorship from? LeValley suggests asking yourself who impresses you.</p> \n<p>\"Who do you see that is making the moves that matter and that is coming up with the ideas that are implemented?\" says LeValley.</p> \n<p>From there, she has a pro-tip: Meet with the leaders' executive assistants within your first 90 days because they know what matters most to their supervisors.</p> \n<p>\"They're designed to have their finger on the pulse,\" LeValley says. \"They're designed to assist, so it's right up their alley.\"</p> \n<p>However, that's not the only route toward mentorship. Simmons got informal mentoring at first.</p> \n<p>\"I went to a group, had a leader – she was amazing, phenomenal [and] she mentored me but it wasn't labeled as a mentoring relationship,\" he said. \"Once I decided to move toward management, I went and got formal mentoring.\"</p> \n<p>He reached out to his then-VP for advice on how to take the next step in his career and asked for mentorship.</p> \n<p>Figuring out who to meet with is only one step of the process, the next step is having an action plan for these conversations.</p> \n<p>\"Whenever I would work with him (my mentor), I would bring what I wanted to talk about. I was proactive,\" said Simmons. \"I didn't want to be another deduction from his time, another liability. I wanted to be an asset.\"</p> \n<p>Simmons didn't necessarily want answers to specific tactical questions but instead, learn how a leader thinks.</p> \n<p>\"I wanted to first connect to the story. We learn best through stories,\" he said. \"So, I want to hear their career path, what their journey has been like. If I can figure out how you think, I can replicate the results.\"</p> \n<p>He also leveraged peer mentors.</p> \n<p>\"That really is the secret sauce for me,\" said Simmons. \"We would kind of mentor each other informally and teach each other things. And I adopted that throughout my career.\"</p> \n<p>When Simmons came to HubSpot, he adds that his first step wasn't meeting with the directors, it was networking across with his fellow managers. In particular, those who could offer diversity of thought.</p> \n<p>\"I am trying to think with people who can supplement my weaknesses or development areas. I know I'm strong in the art of leadership so, I like talking to people who like being in that space,\" he said.</p> \n<p>\"But I am also trying to think like a person who loves systems. So, I'm trying to find people who can think about the business systems, [and learn about] the processes they used.\"</p> \n<p>With mentoring, there's humbleness in knowing that you don't know everything and a willingness to learn from both your peers and your leaders.</p> \n<h2>5. Speak up and be bold.</h2> \n<p>Speaking up can be hard, especially at work. But, these five managers agree it's necessary to become a manager.</p> \n<p>\"You need to be the voice of reason and fairness on the team you're on,\" said LeValley. \"You need to be the person who says, 'Hey, that's not nice and that's not necessary,' and 'Let's hear the idea out.'\"</p> \n<p>Simmons echoes this sentiment and thinks back to his own experience.</p> \n<p>\"There were moments early in my career when I had a platform and I didn't say what I know I needed to say, my gut was saying 'Say something' but I was like, 'Oh they can't handle this,'\" he said. \"Those were missed opportunities because leaders have a pioneering spirit, that's part of the DNA of the best leaders that I've studied.\"</p> \n<p>Simmons' point is that leaders can handle a little pushback.</p> \n<p>If you feel scared, Ladd says it helps to think of the bigger picture.</p> \n<p>\"it's very easy to get very granular and be like 'This impacts me and this is the issue I'm having' but what I try to do is take a step back and realize that this can't be just a me thing,\" she says. \"I could be feeling this way, but I bet you, eight or 10 other people are feeling this way, too.\"</p> \n<p>It's about lending your voice to be that bridge between all these voices, she says, and articulating it in a way that feels it doesn't feel like an attack but empowering instead.</p> \n<p>Ladd recalls last year being a pivotal moment for her to speak up when the conversation around social justice was at the forefront.</p> \n<p>\"I could just continue to do my job, keep doing what I'm doing and giving feedback here and there,\" she said, \"but I was able to step up and say 'It's not just about me anymore, it's about our community here.\"</p> \n<p>Speaking up can (and should) also extend to your customers.</p> \n<p>In her role in customer success, Jones fiercely advocated for her customers.</p> \n<p>\"When I think back to my role as an individual contributor, it was mostly around doing what was right for the customer, no matter how many people disagreed with me,\" she said, \"and being able to advocate for them in a way that somebody else, who was a little bit shyer or didn't think they had enough buy-in or support, would.\"</p> \n<p>And because she did that, customers returned the favor by singing her praises to upper management.</p> \n<p>One thing you want to keep in mind though is your timing. LeValley had to learn that lesson.</p> \n<p>\"I would ask these questions in a group and the whole group would reel and I'd be like 'I just wanted to know' and not realizing the impact,\" said LeValley. \"So, be very aware of your influence as you're building your brand.\"</p> \n<p>It won't always be clear when the right time is, but consider what stage the company is in and what its priorities are.</p> \n<h2>6. Connect with your leadership team.</h2> \n<p>Part of becoming a manager is forging connections with the leaders at your company and understanding the bigger picture.</p> \n<p>\"Put yourself in the rooms that matter when you can,\" said LeValley, \"even if it's 'Hey I just want to touch base for 15 minutes,' or 'I had an idea about this,' 'Can you explain the strategy behind this?'\"</p> \n<p>This requires some visibility, which some would say it's harder to get these days as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/topic-learning-path/remote-work\">working remotely</a> is the new norm. You can't exactly start a conversation with upper management after a meeting, or have a quick word while getting coffee in the communal kitchen or get to know them at a happy hour.</p> \n<p>But LeValley thinks it's actually easier now: fewer interruptions and distractions.</p> \n<p>Set up an initial coffee chat with those key people you're interested in speaking with and go from there.</p> \n<p><strong>LeValley pro-tip:</strong> Call your first meeting a coffee chat and everything thereafter a strategic touch base or something similar.</p> \n<p>\"Don't marginalize yourself by calling it a coffee chat after the first one.\"</p> \n<p>It's all about framing your conversations in a strategic light because that's how you want to be viewed.</p> \n<h2>7. Be a resource to others.</h2> \n<p>One thing Simmons learned from his mentors is the importance of supporting your peers.</p> \n<p>\"My leader would say, 'Whenever we promote someone, we want everybody in the org to say, 'OK, that makes sense,\" he said. \"It makes sense for that person to be in that role because they've been adding value for so long.'\"</p> \n<p>Jones did it by always making herself available to assist her colleagues.</p> \n<p>\"I was called somewhere between like the 'mama bear' on the team and then also be a first responder,\" said Jones, \"because whenever there was an issue, somebody would call me in and say, 'Davey, I know you're not a part of this thing, but can you help us put this fire out?' And I'm like, 'OK, give me the problem.'\"</p> \n<p>She also got involved with new hire onboarding, unofficially mentoring others on her team.</p> \n<p>\"Typically, what happens before somebody goes into leadership, you're going to ask somebody else, 'Hey, tell me about X. Have you worked with them before? What were your experiences?' Simmons said. \"And if you're a person who burns bridges because you're not people-smart, then we should know that before.\"</p> \n<p>Wondering what are some actions you can take today to support your colleagues? Listen to their concerns, offer to help when you can, and provide resources.</p> \n<h2>8. Have career conversations with your manager.</h2> \n<p>As you start making plans to become a manager, leverage your manager's insight and support.</p> \n<p>\"Every single day, I would ask my manager, 'What can I do to make your job easier,?' which is different from 'How are you?'\" said LeValley. \"I asked my manager and my skip-level, whom you should definitely be meeting with at least once a quarter, 'What could I learn or be good at that would make this organization better?' and then you do it.\"</p> \n<p>This is an opportunity to make your aspirations clear with your manager and find opportunities to show what you're made of.</p> \n<p>\"Being able to make the space and time for conversations with your manager is the thing that helps move the needle,\" said Ladd.</p> \n<p>Start by asking your manager for quarterly career chats. Then, prepare talking points and areas of focus. Lastly, keep your manager informed on your progress, the projects you're working on, and leverage their help to identify career development opportunities.</p> \n<h2>9. Act with empathy and vulnerability.</h2> \n<p>Now more than ever, having empathy is central to being a good manager.</p> \n<p>\"I think companies tend to hire managers because they're functional, right? You can get the job done right. You had experience in this thing for three to six years,\" said Jones, \"but they never really have the behavioral questions in there like, how do you manage your people and how do you manage the culture of your team?\"</p> \n<p>During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and the fight for social justice, Jones was hiring managers and she looked for people who made concessions for their team, ones that weren't mandated by HR.</p> \n<p>\"How do you show up for somebody in a way that you may not have considered had you not gotten to know them a little bit more?\" she says.</p> \n<p>Managing people is a very delicate balancing act, adds Carlos, so it requires someone who can be vulnerable, create psychological safety, and show up for their team.</p> \n<p>\"Being able to bring out the best performance in them is a dance you have to learn to do each time,\" she says.</p> \n<p>So, how do you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/empathy-leadership\">practice empathy</a>? It starts in your role. Look at how you speak to customers. Do you understand their struggles? Do you prioritize their needs?</p> \n<p>What about your peers, do you listen actively to their ideas and concerns? Do you ask questions to get to the root of their problems?</p> \n<p>These are all ways to lead with empathy before you step into a managerial role.</p> \n<h2>10. Know the bigger picture.</h2> \n<p>When you become a manager, your priorities take a backseat and the company's needs take the wheel.</p> \n<p>This requires understanding the company's broader strategy and investing in projects that align with them.</p> \n<p>It begs the question: Does your purpose align with your company's?</p> \n<p>That's why before you seek out that management role, LeValley recommends getting clear on your 'why.'</p> \n<p>\"If you ask me why I want to get promoted and why I want to become a manager, [the answer is] because before I retire, I want to be responsible for supporting 15 people from marginalized communities to senior manager level,\" she says. \"You can't argue with that answer.\"</p> \n<p>Once you identify your 'why,' mean it, voice it, and take action.</p> \n<p>\"I look for why they come to work, why they say the things that they do, why they support the decisions they support, why they speak up on behalf of others,\" LeValley says. \"If they do, I look a lot of what really motivates them, because if it's money, you're not my type of manager.\"</p> \n<p>For LeValley, your 'why' should go beyond yourself. It should be a desire to elevate others and support their success.</p> \n<p>A big red flag is me-statements.</p> \n<p>Phrases like: \"<em>I can do it but I don't see how this is going to get me noticed</em>,\" or personal success stories that don't mention anyone else.</p> \n<p>\"People that see the train heading off the tracks, and maybe they get off, but they don't bring anybody else with them,\" says LeValley.</p> \n<p>Carlos says another concern is someone focused on just hitting their own goals.</p> \n<p>\"It would be a little concerning if someone was not looking at things holistically, [saying things like] 'I hit like this metric of X tickets, therefore, I should be a manager,' she said. \"It's not just about that, there's a lot more to consider.\"</p> \n<p>She adds that you have to focus on empowering those around you.</p> \n<p>\"What the mindset shift for a manager is, how do you multiply your impact through these people and empower them, work through them, lead them toward this conclusion and this performance?\" says Carlos.</p> \n<h2>11. Learn and practice.</h2> \n<p>Who better to learn from than people who have done it before?</p> \n<p>You already know this, of course, that's why you're reading this article. But let's explore how our HubSpot managers learned and practiced leadership before they stepped into their roles.</p> \n<p>\"One of my mentors would say the call to leadership is a call to preparation,\" Simmons said. \"So, one of the things I would do, and I'm kind of maniacal about this, is read everything I could on leadership, watch videos, listen to talks.</p> \n<p>Simmons' favorite books on leadership include <a href=\"https://simonsinek.com/product/start-with-why/\">\"Start With Why\" by Simon Sinek</a>, \"<a href=\"https://thewisemangroup.com/books/multipliers/\">Multipliers\" by Liz Wiseman</a>, \"<a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250183866\">Extreme Ownership\" by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin</a>, and \"<a href=\"https://www.tablegroup.com/product/ideal-team-player/\">The Ideal Team Player\" by Patrick Lencioni</a>. Oh, and anything by <a href=\"https://www.johnmaxwell.com/\">John Maxwell</a>.</p> \n<p>Simmons also volunteered for leadership roles outside of his company.</p> \n<p>\"Following the 10,000-hour rule, I was spending two hours every Saturday for eight years, not only facilitating conversation within the group but also taking leadership roles, organizing community service projects,\" he says.</p> \n<p>\"[Part of that preparation] is volunteering out the time to become a better leader because again, you are a leader before you actually have the role.\"</p> \n<p>On her end, Ladd leaned on her colleagues who exhibited behaviors she wanted to replicate.</p> \n<p>\"Doing the work before you get there is so important,\" she says. \"For me, it was 'What's that thing Maggie does to ensure that folks feel psychologically safe in meetings?' I want to make sure I do that, too.\"</p> \n<p>She continued, \"How do you facilitate an in-depth conversation like Alex does and make sure that it's something that folks want to engage with?\"</p> \n<p>Learning from your peers is as valuable&nbsp;as learning from the greats. Once you learn the strategies, practice, practice, practice.</p> \n<h2>12. Network across.</h2> \n<p>One of the biggest missed opportunities you can make on your journey to becoming a manager is not connecting with your peers.</p> \n<p>LeValley recalls her own experience with this.</p> \n<p>\"I was in an environment where I was considerably older than the colleagues in my office and I wasn't into what they were into. So, I did a lot of separating myself because look, I'm here to do a job [and] I'm going to go to work,\" she says, \"but that wasn't good because I didn't receive feedback like 'Are you a fit?' That shouldn't matter, but it does. Are you a fit for management?\"</p> \n<p>She was trustworthy, professional, and capable, but one thing she hadn't thought about was the social aspect of being a manager.</p> \n<p>\"When we go out for beers as a management team, do we want you there? And I contrast that with my friend who doesn't drink at all, but they still wanted her there,\" LeValley adds. \"So it's not that you have to drink.\"</p> \n<p>Not only is networking important for getting that approval from your peers, but also getting to know them.</p> \n<p>\"One indication of a good manager is what they know individually about all the other people that they used to work with,\" Jones says. \"If you don't know much about them, like their individual working styles, then that tells me that you are managing them in a one-size-fits-all approach.\"</p> \n<p>Being a manager means understanding that it takes different tactics to manage different people. You'll only know what those are by getting to know everyone on a personal level.</p> \n<p>At the core of all these tips is a commitment to elevating those around you and being aligned with the company's needs.</p> \n<p>By using a combination of the tactics outlined above, you'll become a manager in no time – just as these five managers did.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbe-a-good-manager&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png","linkMd5":"662dec0a3752c72c165c0eaa22330c8e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn16@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-375_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","destWidth":660,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7430,"destBytes":10618,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4e634041-e1ce-4a85-8e65-aea12fc10b84.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn16@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-375_a76d18c90cdcfa92.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5174aed9-1caa-4a36-b2d6-84c4d96c25fb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn98@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-49-785_5d7cf3090735f322.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbe-a-good-manager&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn67@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-50-001_8083001f56e17333.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938151},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"10 Best Email Previewing, Testing, & Rendering Tools","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-email-preview-tools","description":"<p>You know the expression, <em>\"What you see is what you get\"</em>?</p> \n<p>Well, when it comes to email marketing campaigns, that might not always be the case.</p> \n<p>Since everyone uses different email providers such as Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo, emails can appear differently for various subscribers.</p>  \n<p>Sometimes images are blocked, alt text is missing, or fonts won't render.

This is especially important if you go with an HTML email since it inherently includes multimedia elements, colors, fonts, branded elements, images, and more.</p> \n<h2>HTML Email Preview</h2> \n<p>As your HTML emails become more sophisticated and as your email list grows, it's important to preview and test your emails prior to them being sent to recipients. By previewing your messages, you'll ensure your emails are professional, error-free, easy-to-read, and ready for your leads and customers.</p> \n<p>An HTML preview allows you to adjust anything necessary prior to the final version being sent to your audience. That way, you can send your messages to the people who matter most — your customers — with complete confidence.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h4>Free Email Testing Tools</h4> \n<p>It's important to note that <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">the following free email <em>preview</em> tools are also free <em>email</em> testing tools</span>.

[+How Do You Measure It?]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-salience","description":"<p>While branding can feel like a vague concept, it's one of the most important elements of a marketing strategy.</p> \n<p>Did you know that presenting a brand consistently across all platforms can <a href=\"https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/branding-statistics/\">increase revenue by up to 23%</a>?</p> \n<p>Plus, consistently presented brands are <a href=\"https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/branding-statistics/\">3.5 times more likely</a> to have excellent brand visibility than those with inconsistent branding.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/branding-statistics/\">82% of investors</a> say name recognition is an important factor guiding them in their investment decisions.</p> \n<p>So, what does all this mean? Well, consistent branding leads to increased brand awareness which can then help gain investors and drive revenue to your business. Needless to say, branding is important for your business to succeed.</p> \n<p>In this post, let's review what brand salience is, how you can increase your brand visibility, and how to measure it.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Brand Building Guide\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>If you have high brand salience, then you have a strong brand presence that consumers recognize and think about when they need a product. If you have low brand salience, then consumers might not know your brand exists and therefore won't think of your brand when they need to make a purchase.</p> \n<p>Essentially, brand salience is a similar metric as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness\">brand awareness</a> except it's focused on measuring awareness during the actual purchasing decision instead of overall brand visibility.</p> \n<p>For example, when someone wants to get a cup of coffee and is driving around, what's the first brand they think of? Probably Starbucks. When they want to buy tissues, they think of Kleenex. When they want to search for something online, they Google it.</p> \n<p>All of these brands have transcended the perception of being a random company, and are now household names in their own right. Most people think of these brands and know of them whether they've been there or used those products before.</p> \n<p>These brands have high brand salience. To have high brand salience, your customers need to think about your brand as the first solution to their wants or needs when they have to make a purchasing decision.</p> \n<p>The concept of brand salience is actually psychological in nature. According to <a href=\"https://www.marketingscience.info/wp-content/uploads/staff/2015/08/9419.pdf\">research</a> done by Jenni Romaniuk and Byron Sharp, brand salience is \"a brand's propensity to be noticed or come to mind in buying situations.\"</p> \n<p>This means that you have to capture people's attention and be memorable enough for consumers to recall your brand when they're purchasing something.</p> \n<p>For example, when a consumer has a choice of brands to purchase from, they'll rely both on their memory and attention salience. This means they'll recall brands they know and then see what captures their attention.</p> \n<p>This process is actually scientific. People who have studied brand salience have studied the human brain -- how do people recall information and how does a brand associate positive memory structure with their product?</p> \n<p>To increase your brand salience, some of your marketing campaigns probably won't even focus on persuading consumers to buy your product. The goal of many <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding\">branding</a> campaigns is to constantly reinforce positive associations with your brand. Familiarity is important. Constant marketing messages from a brand ensure that the brand is top-of-mind when a consumer is making a purchasing decision.</p> \n<p>Brands create high brand salience by using distinctive brand assets that capture attention and create positive memories for their audience. This means your marketing assets promote positive storytelling and create a meaning associated with your brand. When you promote your values, you're differentiating your brand from the competition and increasing brand salience.</p> \n<p>To create campaigns that will improve brand salience, think about the emotional impact of your assets. Your campaigns should be meaningful, authentic, and portray your values as a company.</p> \n<p>All of this will help customers create a positive association with your brand and remember your brand when it comes time to make a purchase.</p> \n<p>For example, let's say I want to buy some gum. When I think about gum, one of the first things I think of are the commercials for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NemtQx0m0Ss\">Extra</a>. I've never forgotten those commercials because they were emotional and created a positive experience for me.</p> \n<p>Now, when I think about gum, I usually buy Extra even though that brand has never been my favorite gum company (I used to buy Orbit). But since those commercials, I've leaned toward Extra because of the positive association and it's one of the first brands I recall because of those commercials.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, brand salience is a combination of brand awareness, familiarity, relevance, frequent communication, and emotional connections between brand and consumer.</p> \n<p>Now, you might be thinking,<em> \"This all sounds great, but how can I measure this and prove its effectiveness to my managers?\"</em></p> \n<p>Let's dive into that below.</p> \n<h2>How to Measure Brand Salience</h2> \n<p>Brand salience is rather conceptual in nature. Unfortunately, it's not a mathematical metric that is easily measured. So, what do brands do?</p> \n<p>Well, one of the only ways to <a href=\"https://www.marketingscience.info/wp-content/uploads/staff/2015/08/9419.pdf\">measure brand salience</a> is through surveys and focus groups. It's important to ask your customers when they think of you, what they associate with your brand, and if they recall your company when making a purchasing decision.</p> \n<p>You can ask customers whether they recall or notice your brand relative to competitors. Then, ask whether your brand is just thought of or sought after to determine how favorably your brand is judged.</p> \n<p>Your survey can include descriptive assets to track your brand's distinctive assets. For instance, what tone of voice, logo, color, or slogan comes to mind when users think of soda. They might say red, because they've associated Coca-Cola branding with soda in general.</p> \n<p>To measure this, you can present survey respondents with a randomized list of cues and attributes by asking them which brands they associate with each statement. It could be questions like \"when I want to eat something quick and healthy\" or \"I know I will not overpay there.\"</p> \n<p>Using a survey or focus group will help you determine how high your brand salience is compared to competitors.</p> \n<p>Now, let's look at the brand salience model that you can use to strategize your brand positioning.</p> \n<h2>Brand Salience Model</h2> \n<p>In his book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Brand-Management-Building-Measuring-dp-0134892496/dp/0134892496/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\">Strategic Brand Management: Building, Measuring, and Managing Brand Equity</a>, Kevin Keller developed a model for brand salience that has become popular in digital marketing.</p> \n<p>In the graphic below, Keller creates a pyramid of building blocks to pay attention to when you're trying to increase your brand salience.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Keller's brand resonance model\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20Brand%20Salience%3F%20%5B+How%20Do%20You%20Measure%20It%3F%5D.png?width=624&amp;name=What%20is%20Brand%20Salience%3F%20%5B+How%20Do%20You%20Measure%20It%3F%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Brand-Management-Building-Measuring-dp-0134892496/dp/0134892496/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>This model focuses on increasing deep, broad brand awareness by creating an identity that customers remember. At the foundation of the pyramid is salience, which you can increase by defining your brand in detail, frequently communicating with your audience, and using creative assets to tell a story.</p> \n<p>Then, you create meaning and authenticity to differentiate your brand from the competition. And then, you use frequent messages to create positive, accessible reactions in your customers. And then you create loyalty by building a relationship and emotional connection with your audience.</p> \n<p>With this model, you can increase brand salience, drive revenue, and even attract investors.

You can optimize your videos for SEO right in the tool.</p> \n<p>This video hosting product also allows you to insert CTAs and forms into videos, trigger video workflows that provide targeted content to leads, and video analytics so you know which videos resonate with your audience.</p> \n<p>For sales reps, you can use the video hosting tool to send video voicemails or record your screen during a sales call. You can also see if a prospect has watched the video in HubSpot's tool.</p> \n<p>Video can also be used for customer service. You can send video tutorials and record your screen right from a ticket to share it with customers for personalized and quick support. Or you can insert these videos into your knowledge base articles or FAQ page.</p> \n<h4>2. <a href=\"https://www.twentythree.com/\">Twenty Three</a></h4> \n<p>Twenty Three is another great video hosting service for your business.

Additionally, this platform can host podcasts and images as well.</p> \n<p>With this hosting site, you can also combine your media gallery to create a video course with images, video, or podcast files. I don't know about you, but I've seen online courses become all the rage in recent years, so this is a great feature to consider.</p> \n<p>You can embed these videos on your site, social media, email, and more.</p> \n<h4>4. <a href=\"https://www.hippovideo.io/\">Hippo Video</a></h4> \n<p>Hippo Video is a video hosting platform that you can use to personalize your video emails for messages, demos, sales pitches, marketing campaigns, and more.</p> \n<p>Using videos in the sales cycle can actually get three times more prospect engagement.</p> \n<p>With this tool, you can record and send videos right in your email inbox. Additionally, you can integrate this tool with your current stack, including with Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoom, Zendesk, and more.</p> \n<h4>5. <a href=\"https://sproutvideo.com/\">SproutVideo</a></h4> \n<p>SproutVideo is a great option for a video hosting platform if you're looking for a no-frills, affordable platform.</p> \n<p>With this tool, you can create videos and collaborate with your team. You can share a secure internal video, or live stream a product launch. Whatever your video needs are, this is an excellent option to consider.</p> \n<h3>Free Video Hosting Sites</h3> \n<h4>6. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a></h4> \n<p>Vimeo is one of the most popular video hosting sites and for good reason. This simple tool can be used to create, manage, and share high-quality videos.</p> \n<p>To create videos, you can use templates, license stock footage, record video messages, or live stream. When you're editing your videos, you might be able to integrate Vimeo with your editor. Vimeo integrates with Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, and others. Then, your videos will be hosted in one central, secure location so you can seamlessly share them with anyone.</p> \n<p>You can even create a subscription streaming service for your videos on this platform.</p> \n<p>The best part? Vimeo is free. You can upgrade to paid plans, but you'll never have to pay for Vimeo if you don't want or need to.</p> \n<h4>7. <a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com/\">Vidyard</a></h4> \n<p>Vidyard is one of the only video hosting sites that is built directly with sales in mind. The idea is to build a great sales process to make remote selling easy, from prospecting to proposals, you can record and send videos that add a personal touch at all stages of the sales cycle.</p> \n<p>With Vidyard, you can create your videos in just a few clicks, with no video expertise required (that's great for tech-challenged people like me).</p> \n<p>This tool is also free. You don't ever have to pay unless you want to upgrade to a different plan with more features.</p> \n<p>My favorite feature of this tool is that you can easily create videos, track who watches them, and distribute them an unlimited number of times (yes, even in the free version).</p> \n<h4>8. <a href=\"https://wistia.com/\">Wistia</a></h4> \n<p>Another great video hosting site is Wistia. You can host videos and even podcasts on this hosting platform for marketers.</p> \n<p>On Wistia, you can upload, customize, and embed branded videos or podcasts on one platform. This also has a free plan that you can use, as long as you don't need to create too many videos a month (three is the max on the free plan). However, if you need more, there are paid plans as well.</p> \n<p>But my favorite feature of this tool is that it can integrate with your tech stack and send engagement data to your CRM, ad platforms, and marketing tools.</p> \n<p>Video is only continuing to grow, as people spend more time watching video than reading text. As your business continues to evolve, it's important to have a video hosting tool that can grow with you and help you use videos to drive results for all aspects of your business.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=24602c1f-158a-4419-b428-0ddc9092f2b0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Discover videos, templates, tips, and other resources dedicated to helping you  launch an effective video marketing strategy.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/24602c1f-158a-4419-b428-0ddc9092f2b0.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvideo-platforms&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Jul 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8f27c677-d952-4663-8787-bf65c6a1ecf2.png","linkMd5":"67412e945c19692a78245e521af25367","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn33@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-360_4f4e7f5d5c2f53ad.webp","destWidth":448,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5399,"destBytes":7402,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8f27c677-d952-4663-8787-bf65c6a1ecf2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn33@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-360_4f4e7f5d5c2f53ad.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/24602c1f-158a-4419-b428-0ddc9092f2b0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn25@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-49-838_1606a7f1b4009c0e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvideo-platforms&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn89@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-49-038_aa0ee6c6fda8c2e2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938120},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"Variable Cost Explained in 200 Words (& How to Calculate It)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/variable-cost","description":"<p>There’s a frustrating truth that every business deals with early into its growth: More money, more problems.</p> \n<p>It seems counterintuitive — if sales and revenue are up, isn’t that a good thing? How are bigger profits a potential problem?</p> \n<p>Put simply, it all comes down to the fact that the more you sell, the more money you need to spend. This includes marketing and sales campaigns to reach more customers, the production costs of more goods, and the time and money required for new product development.</p> \n<p>Known as variable cost, this sales/spend ratio is something every business owner should understand, but online advice listicles and action plans often assume readers have an intrinsic knowledge of this concept rather than providing a working definition.</p> \n<p>In this piece, we’ll clear up variable cost confusion: Here’s what you need to know about variable costs, how to calculate them, and why they matter.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3e2abb94-93d9-4cf5-bd8e-6a96ecc14270&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Click here to download 8 free marketing budget templates.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3e2abb94-93d9-4cf5-bd8e-6a96ecc14270.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Let’s examine each of these components in more detail.</p> \n<h3>Variable Cost Per Unit</h3> \n<p>The variable cost per unit is the amount of labor, materials, and other resources required to produce your product. For example, if your company sells sets of kitchen knives for $300 but each set requires $200 to create, test, package, and market, your variable cost per unit is $200.</p> \n<h3>Number of Units Produced</h3> \n<p>The number of units produced is exactly what you might expect — it’s the total number of items produced by your company. So in our knife example above,if you’ve made and sold 100 knife sets your total number of units produced is 100, each of which carries a $200 variable cost and a $100 potential profit.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Variable costs earn the name because they can increase and decrease as you make more or less of your product. The more units you sell, the more money you’ll make, but some of this money will need to pay for the production of more units. So, you’ll need to produce <em>more</em> units to actually turn a profit.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/image-png-Jun-14-2021-02-37-23-12-PM.png\" alt=\"Variable Cost Formula\" style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; font-size: 18px; font-family: AvenirNext, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"> \n<p>And, because each unit requires a certain amount of resources, a higher number of units will raise the variable costs needed to produce them.</p> \n<p>Variable costs aren’t a “problem,” though — they’re more of a necessary evil. They play a role in several bookkeeping tasks, and both your <em>total</em> variable cost and <em>average</em> variable cost are calculated separately.</p> \n<h3>Total Variable Cost</h3> \n<p>Your total variable cost is the sum of all variable costs associated with each individual product you’ve developed. Calculate total variable cost by multiplying the cost to make one unit of your product by the number of products you’ve developed.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/image-png-Jun-14-2021-01-56-19-58-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Total Variable Cost\"></p> \n<p>For example, if it costs $60 to make one unit of your product and you’ve made 20 units, your total variable cost is $60 x 20, or $1,200.</p> \n<h3>Average Variable Cost</h3> \n<p>Your average variable cost uses your total variable cost to determine how much, on average, it costs to produce one unit of your product. You can calculate it with the formula below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/average%20variable%20cost.png?width=690&amp;height=222&amp;name=average%20variable%20cost.png\" alt=\"Formula for average variable cost\" width=\"690\" height=\"222\" style=\"width: 690px;\"></p> \n<h3>Total Variable Cost vs. Average Variable Cost</h3> \n<p>If the average variable cost of one unit is found using your total variable cost, don’t you already know how much one unit of your product costs to develop? Can’t you work backward, and simply divide your total variable cost by the number of units you have? Not necessarily.</p> \n<p>While total variable cost shows how much you’re paying to develop every unit of your product, you might also have to account for products that have different variable costs per unit. That’s where average variable cost comes in.</p> \n<p>For example, if you have 10 units of Product A at a variable cost of $60/unit, and 15 units of Product B at a variable cost of $30/unit, you have two different variable costs — $60 and $30. Your average variable cost crunches these two variable costs down to one manageable figure.</p> \n<p>In the above example, you can find your average variable cost by adding the total variable cost of Product A ($60 x 10 units, or $600) and the total variable cost of Product B ($30 x 15 units, or $450), then dividing this sum by the total number of units produced (10 + 15, or 25).</p> \n<p>Your average variable cost is ($600 + $450) ÷ 25, or <strong>$42 per unit.</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Variable vs. Fixed Cost</strong></h2> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The opposite of variable cost? Fixed cost. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/fixed-cost?_ga=2.4707386.887401265.1623678100-516008119.1623678100\"><span>Fixed costs</span></a> are costs that don’t change in response to the number of products you’re producing.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Some common fixed costs include renting or leasing a building, utility bills, website hosting, business loan repayments, and property taxes.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Worth noting? These costs aren’t <em>static </em>— meaning, your rent may increase year over year. Instead, they remain fixed only in reference to product production.</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">To calculate the average fixed cost, use this formula:</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/1gkbyHvmGO0nskCHjYp6ytLfyTG_0dntkxdI3eiOeuJ1FbAiBF0sTwmaDXwCG22nayFmpC7AV2zAmGmb_vCBFcN6WNx2MaA576Sd3tIT3g5WB9OvLCjfuzp4FPa3PL_wjrlAUCYk\" width=\"624\" height=\"203\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Average Fixed Cost formula\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Both variable and fixed costs are essential to getting a complete picture of how much it costs to produce an item — and how much profit remains after each sale.</p> \n<p>To calculate variable cost ratio, use this formula:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Jun-14-2021-02-06-12-71-PM.png?width=451&amp;name=image-png-Jun-14-2021-02-06-12-71-PM.png\" width=\"451\" style=\"width: 451px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Variable Cost Ratio Formula\"></p> \n<p>Let’s put it into practice. If you’re selling an item for $200 (Net Sales) but it costs $20 to produce (Variable Costs), you divide $20 by $200 to get 0.1. Multiply by 100 and your variable cost ratio is 10%. This means that for every sale of an item you’re getting a 90% return with 10% going toward variable costs.</p> \n<p>Combining variable and fixed costs, meanwhile, can help you calculate your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/break-even-point\"><span>break-even point </span></a>— the point at which producing and selling goods is zeroed out by the combination of variable and fixed costs.</p> \n<p>Consider our example above again. If your variable costs are $20 on a $200 item and your fixed costs account for $100, your total costs now account for 60% of the item’s sale value, leaving you with 40%.</p> \n<p>Put simply? The higher your total cost ratio, the lower your potential profit. If this number becomes negative, you’ve passed the break-even point and will start losing money on every sale.</p> \n<p>So, what’s considered a variable cost to the business?</p> \n<p>Some of the most common variable costs include physical materials, production equipment, sales commissions, staff wages, credit card fees, online payment partners, and packaging/shipping costs.</p> \n<p>Let’s examine each in more detail.</p> \n<h3><strong>Physical Materials</strong></h3> \n<p>These can include parts, cloth, and even food ingredients required to make your final product.</p> \n<h3><strong>Production Equipment</strong></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">If you automate certain parts of your product’s development, you might need to invest in more automation equipment or software as your product line gets bigger.</span></p> \n<h3><strong>Sales Commissions</strong></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">The more products your company sells, the more you might pay in commission to your salespeople as they win customers.</span></p> \n<h3><strong>Staff Wages</strong></h3> \n<p>The more products you create, the more employees you might need, which means a bigger payroll, too.</p> \n<h3><strong>Credit Card Fees</strong></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Businesses that receive credit card payments from their customers will incur higher transaction fees as they deliver more services.</span></p> \n<h3><strong>Online Payment Partners</strong></h3> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Apps like PayPal typically charge businesses per transaction so customers can check out purchases through the app. The more orders you receive, the more you'll pay to the app.</span></p> \n<h3><strong>Packaging and Shipping Costs</strong></h3> \n<p>You might pay to package and ship your product by the unit, and therefore more or fewer shipped units will cause these costs to vary.</p> \n<h2><strong>Expect the Unexpected</strong></h2> \n<p>While variable costs, total variable costs, average variable costs, and the variable cost ratio often seem complicated on the surface, these terms are simply ways to represent the changing nature of costs to produce new items as your business grows.</p> \n<p>By understanding the nature of these costs and how they impact your current and projected revenue, it’s possible to better prepare for evolving market forces and reduce the impact of variable costs on your bottom line.<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9ce704de-19f2-4fd0-8041-22dc3c021b87&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

Find out what else your audience cares about in correlation with your mission.</h3> \n<p>If someone subscribes to your email list, it's safe to say they have already heard of your product or find it interesting, so it's important to dig deeper beyond that.</p> \n<p>Ariel Butler, founder and CEO of hair and skin products company <a href=\"https://sheaade.com/\">Shea Adé</a>, learned that people mainly care about when the company is emailing about sales when it comes to product-based businesses. It can also get daunting if emails are about the same products consumers have already heard about.</p> \n<p>\"I'd recommend brands find other topics to email their audience about (blog posts, free ebooks, etc.),\" she said. \"Everything outside of that should be emails about sales or new product releases as opposed to the emails that look like <em>'Hey, don't forget to buy this full-priced item that I've been bugging you about 4X a week!</em>'\"</p> \n<p>One strategy that works for Butler is sending daily affirmations to her customers. She started trying out this simple email tactic since her brand's mission is all about not only healing hair but healing beyond the scalp.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Ariel%20Butler%20quote.png?width=1600&amp;name=Ariel%20Butler%20quote.png\" alt=\"Email marketing strategy from Ariel Butler CEO of Shea Ade\" width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px;\"></p> \n<p>\"I want my customers to wake up every day and feel good about how they look,\" Butler said. \"Since I started sending out those emails, I have been completely blown away by how enjoyable daily affirmations have been for my customers. Some people have only been introduced to my brand because someone told them about our emails, and when they found out that Shea Adé is a hair company, they supported me because they resonated with my brand's mission to heal.\"</p> \n<h3>2. Connect with your customers weekly.</h3> \n<p>Every week, Raven Gibson, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://legendaryrootz.com/collections/shop\">Legendary Rootz</a>, sends out a campaign that allows email subscribers to download a free personal digital wallpaper.</p> \n<p>She says this is her best email marketing strategy, and she coined it \"Wallpaper Wednesday.\" Over the years, Gibson's audience has expressed to her that while they want to support her business, they don't have the funds to do so. She recognized this problem and came up with a free solution to still connect with her community.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"Typically, the design centers around celebrating Black culture or an important reminder of the day,\" Gibson said. \"This marketing strategy has allowed for our email list to grow, and given us the opportunity to connect with our community.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Gibson runs a similar campaign on Tuesdays where she connects with her followers by highlighting their love for natural hair. She sees this as a way to share community and emphasize the importance of Black hair culture. Gibson also uses these emails to share exclusive deals and product restocks specifically for email subscribers.</p> \n<p>These weekly email marketing campaigns have helped drive an excellent return on investment, Gibson said.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;\"Investing in email marketing has allowed us to stretch our marketing dollars while making a meaningful connection with our community,\" Gibson said. &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>3. Launch an engaging outreach campaign.</h3> \n<p>Creating outreach campaigns can grab people's attention while providing a more significant incentive beyond expecting folks to just read your emails.</p> \n<p>Alvarez Mckendall, a serial entrepreneur and digital marketing strategist, is responsible for social media and email marketing at <a href=\"https://realestatebees.com/\">Real Estate Bees</a>, a technology and marketing platform for the real estate industry. One of his most successful email marketing strategies is interviewing the professionals and business owners with which he's trying to connect.</p> \n<p>Mckendall said this strategy is most effective because it helps consumers understand what the business is offering and how potential customers can benefit from it based on what he learns in those interviews.</p> \n<p>Mckendall transformed Real Estate Bees' previous email questionnaire into an interview-style questionnaire and adjusted email templates and subject lines to indicate his company's desire to interview the business owner or a key member instead of completing a boring questionnaire.</p> \n<p>\"Just like your friends and family members, business owners love to get attention and feel important,\" Mckendall said. \"Appealing to one's ego is an extremely effective technique whenever you want to get their attention and start building a business relationship.\"</p> \n<p>When Mckendall launched the outreach campaign, Real Estate Bees' email open rate was 25-27%, and the response rate was about 1%.</p> \n<p>\"I was constantly thinking about how we could improve it,\" he said.</p> \n<p>Based on this campaign, Real Estate Bees' email open rate has improved to 42%, and the response rate increased by 3%. It's essential to make your campaigns engaging by including hyperlinks, photos, videos, and whatever else makes sense for your brand.</p> \n<h3>4. Make allies with other businesses by doing press partnerships.</h3> \n<p>Networking and building partnerships can be handy for email marketing strategies, too. Francis Perdue, CEO of public relations firm <a href=\"https://perdueinc.me/\">Perdue Inc.</a>, suggests Black business owners team up to expand their following by promoting each other.</p> \n<p>The free promotion exposes different audiences to new products and services, and it also helps build community by connecting various consumers.</p> \n<p>\"No money is exchanged, yet it does wonders for your businesses,\" Perdue said. \"Share each other's audiences to support one another. Creating an e-blast for an event or cause for someone in exchange for the same will grow your reach and show that you are committed to the community while promoting unity.\"</p> \n<p>If you don't know where to start, pick up your phone and see what emails you have in your contact list already. When Perdue launched her firm over a decade ago, she said she didn't know many people in the industry, but she had a strong community of friends, old colleagues, and former classmates.</p> \n<p>She did an e-blast to promote her new business, and right off the back, she got 200 subscribers. More than 2,500 people are subscribed to Perdue Inc.'s email list, all of which came from Perdue's organic outreach via her network.</p> \n<p>\"People want to support you; you'd be surprised,\" she said. \"Get out and network. I own a restaurant, so I know the importance of repeat customers.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Francis%20Perdue%20quote.png?width=1600&amp;name=Francis%20Perdue%20quote.png\" alt=\"Email marketing strategy from CEO Francis Perdue\" width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px;\"></p> \n<h3>5. Use tools, applications, and other digital resources.</h3> \n<p>Building email marketing strategies can be tedious and time-consuming, especially if you're</p> \n<p>releasing emails weekly. It's okay to build out your campaigns yourself, but if you're looking for something new or different, here are some tools, applications, and resources that Black business owners use to better connect with their audiences:</p> \n<ul> \n <ul> \n  <li>\"This may sound crazy, but I believe TikTok is an amazing way to drive customers to your brand and your email list.\" — Butler.</li> \n  <li>\"Switching to <a href=\"https://www.klaviyo.com/\">Klaviyo</a>&nbsp;for all email correspondence helped with increasing our abandoned cart click rate from 4% to 7%. I am so happy that I took the time to switch over from Shopify and set it up.\" — Gibson.</li> \n  <li>\"We have been using the <a href=\"https://www.buzzstream.com/\">BuzzStream</a>&nbsp;tool to send out emails and monitor all the analytics and stats.\" — Mckendall.</li> \n  <li>&nbsp;\"I love <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html\">Adobe XD</a>. It's a prototyping application; however, I use it to craft all of our email marketing collateral. My favorite feature is the ability to duplicate and switch up the content in a split second. After creating specific templates for Wallpaper Wednesday or an exclusive email-only sale, I can reuse them again with just the click of a few buttons. I've found that using these templates allows me to streamline the process immensely.\" — Gibson.</li> \n  <li>\"Some email marketing apps range from $0 to $100 a month. The good news is that usually, under 200 contacts are free. Use <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/\">GoDaddy</a>&nbsp;when you start your website to get coupons for marketing from their partners to cut costs as well.\" — Perdue.</li> \n  <li>\"I love the website <a href=\"https://reallygoodemails.com/\">Really Good Emails</a>. It is a gold mine for all things email. The site is very well-organized, and you can find just about any topic within the site. It's almost like the Pinterest of email marketing.\" — Gibson.</li> \n </ul> \n</ul> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=6496bbfa-2f4e-42ca-aa7c-7e4ee9cffe86&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"black at inbound\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6496bbfa-2f4e-42ca-aa7c-7e4ee9cffe86.png\"></a>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Femail-marketing-black-owned-businesses&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Jul 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6a35a2d8280138a72c0997cc6d103cff","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Michelai A.

The resulting text string is the combination of all strings in your CONCATENATE formula.</p> \n<p>Here's a look at how to concatenate in Excel:</p> \n<p>Let's say you have a list of customers whose first and last names are separate. You need everyone's full names to build a retargeting campaign, so you want to join text from column A (First Name) with the text from column B (Last Name).</p> \n<p>Before using the CONCATENATE function, you have to create a new column for your combined text. In the example below, it's column C (Full Name).</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Does%20it%20Mean%20to%20Use%20Concatenate%20in%20Excel,%20+%20Why%20It%20Matters-Jun-30-2021-05-34-06-78-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></p> \n<p>Now, you're ready to concatenate the first and last names. To do that, you need to understand both the syntax of the function and how to format the text strings that make up the formula.</p> \n<h2>Excel Concatenate Formula</h2> \n<p>Like all Excel functions, the CONCATENATE formula starts with the equals sign (=), followed by the function name, an open parenthesis, and the text arguments. No need to get heated – in this context, arguments simply tell the formula what cells to combine.</p> \n<p><strong>=CONCATENATE(text1, [text2], ...)</strong></p> \n<p><strong>=CONCAT(text1, [text2], ...)</strong></p> \n<p><strong>text1: </strong>This is the first argument to join and can be a number, text, or cell reference.</p> \n<p><strong>text2, text3, etc:</strong>&nbsp;These are the additional items to combine. The CONCATENATE formula can join up to 255 items, with a total of 8,192 characters.</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;In all versions of Excel 2016 and beyond, the CONCATENATE function has been replaced with the <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/concat-function-9b1a9a3f-94ff-41af-9736-694cbd6b4ca2\">CONCAT function</a>. This function works in the exact same way, with the added ability to combine text over a range of cells (i.e., =CONCAT(A2:D8)). While you can still access the CONCATENATE function for compatibility reasons, Microsoft warns that CONCATENATE may not be available in future versions of Excel.</p> \n<h2>Excel Concatenate with Space</h2> \n<p>Double quotations (\" \") include a space between the text arguments wherever you want one to appear. Just remember to insert a comma before and after each set of quotations or else an error message will pop up and the formula won't run. You'll know your formula is correct if you hit \"Enter\" and the new text string appears exactly how you want.</p> \n<p>In the name example, you want to combine the text in cells A16 and B16, so add those arguments to the formula. Make sure to place the arguments in the order you want them to appear. To get \"First Name Last Name,\" set up the CONCATENATE formula like this:</p> \n<p><strong>=CONCATENATE((B16, \" \", A16)</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Note: </strong>If at least one of the CONCATENATE function's arguments is invalid, the formula will return a #VALUE!

The formula is applied to each cell. This prevents you from having to type out the formula for each cell by letting you concatenate dozens of text strings in an instant.</p> \n<h2>Excel Concatenate Strings</h2> \n<p>Whether you combine text and numbers, the result of the CONCATENATE function is always a text string. The naming example above is a fairly simple example, but it's possible to create longer, more meaningful text strings in Excel. The key to doing so is to ensure your results provide value to whoever is using the information.</p> \n<p>Let's say you're working on an email campaign and want to personalize the subject line with each customer's name. Instead of manually typing out name after name, you can use the CONCATENATE function to combine the text strings. For this example, I used a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-email-subject-lines-list\">catchy email subject line</a>&nbsp;from Warby Parker.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Does%20it%20Mean%20to%20Use%20Concatenate%20in%20Excel,%20+%20Why%20It%20Matters-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></p> \n<p>I write the following formula, making sure to include commas and spaces where I want them to appear.</p> \n<p><strong>=CONCATENATE(B2,\" ,\", A2, \",\",\" \", C2)</strong></p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Does%20it%20Mean%20to%20Use%20Concatenate%20in%20Excel,%20+%20Why%20It%20Matters-4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></p> \n<p>I then apply the formula to the entire column to generate my list of personalized subject lines.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Does%20it%20Mean%20to%20Use%20Concatenate%20in%20Excel,%20+%20Why%20It%20Matters-Jun-30-2021-05-34-07-41-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></p> \n<p>As you experiment with longer text strings, know that every cell reference in the CONCATENATE function must be listed separately because it can't recognize arrays. For instance, your formula should look like =CONCATENATE (B1, B2, B3, B4) rather than =CONCATENATE(B1:B4).</p> \n<p>Combining text is simple enough, but throwing dates and times into the mix can result in a messy formula and error-ridden results.</p> \n<h2>Concatenate Date and Time in Excel</h2> \n<p>You can prevent issues with time and dates by embedding the TEXT function into the CONCATENATE Excel formula. This will let you control the formatting when combining text with a number or a date.</p> \n<p>Let's look at how to combine all of this information. In this worksheet, I want to record the date and time each blog post went live so I can reference the information during my monthly performance analysis.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Does%20it%20Mean%20to%20Use%20Concatenate%20in%20Excel,%20+%20Why%20It%20Matters-Jun-30-2021-05-34-07-03-PM.png?width=624&amp;name=What%20Does%20it%20Mean%20to%20Use%20Concatenate%20in%20Excel,%20+%20Why%20It%20Matters-Jun-30-2021-05-34-07-03-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: -5.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></p> \n<p>The formula needed to join these three strings may look complicated, but it's simple once you decide how to format the date and time. I want to leave the dates and times as they are, so I include the date (mm/dd/yyyy)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and time (hh:mm:ss) formatting into the CONCATENATE formula.</p> \n<p><strong>=CONCATENATE(A2, TEXT(B2,\"mm/dd/yyyy\"), \" at\", \" \",TEXT(C3,\"hh:mm:ss\"))</strong></p> \n<p>The result is a text string that provides meaningful context by sharing what date and time the posts went live.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20Does%20it%20Mean%20to%20Use%20Concatenate%20in%20Excel,%20+%20Why%20It%20Matters-Jun-30-2021-05-34-06-38-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Source</a></p> \n<p>Apply the function to the rest of the worksheet using the same steps as before.

Using the CONCATENATE function can speed up your work, but know that there are limitations.</p> \n<p>Excel only allows you to combine 255 items, up to a total of 8,192 characters, using the CONCATENATE function. So you have to work in sections if you want to create hundreds (or thousands) of new text strings.</p> \n<p>The CONCATENATE function doesn't accept arrays (A3:E5), so make sure to list out each argument you want to include in the formula. If you need to combine a massive range of tens or hundreds of cells, try out one of these shortcuts.</p> \n<p><strong>Use the CONTROL key. </strong></p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>Type in the first part of your formula =CONCATENATE(</li> \n <li>Hold down the CONTROL key and select the individual cells you want to combine.</li> \n <li>Release the CONTROL key, type a closing parenthesis, and hit ENTER.</li> \n</ol> \n<p><strong>Use the TRANSPOSE function.</strong></p> \n<p>If you need to combine hundreds of cells, you don't want to waste time clicking on each cell. Instead, use the TRANSPOSE function to create an array before swapping it out with the individual cells.</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>Select the cell you want to use the CONCATENATE function.</li> \n <li>Type in the TRANSPOSE formula to generate an array of cells. It will look similar to this: =TRANSPOSE(A1:A10)</li> \n <li>With the TRANSPOSE cell selected, press the F9 key in the formula bar to replace the array with the individual values to be concatenated.</li> \n <li>Delete the brackets around the values so you're left with only a list.</li> \n <li>Enter the CONCATENATE formula before the values, and close the formula with a parenthesis.</li> \n <li>Hit enter to see your new text string.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>While certain heavy Excel users say the CONCATENATE function is becoming outdated, it's still a useful shortcut for combining text strings without impacting the rest of your worksheet.

Ensure you have admin access to your Facebook Business Page.</h3> \n<p>Instagram and Facebook might be separate accounts to you personally, but businesses that want to automate their Instagram posting schedule will need to tether both accounts together. So, you'll need the username and password of your business's Facebook account to do this — in other words, head over to the <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/getting-started\">Instagram Business landing page</a> to set up your account if you don't already have one.</p> \n<h3>2. Switch to your Business profile on the Instagram mobile app and connect this account to Facebook.</h3> \n<p>If you have a personal Instagram account, you probably know you can manage more than one profile from the app — and the other profile is your business account (keep in mind you'll need an Instagram Business account <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social/connect-your-social-media-accounts-to-hubspot\">to schedule Instagram posts in HubSpot</a>).</p> \n<p>To switch to your Instagram Business page from your personal page, navigate to your profile on your mobile device and tap the three dots in the upper-right corner of your screen. Then, in the next screen, select \"Switch to Business Profile,\" as shown below:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-features-tricks\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-switch-to-business-profile.png?width=250&amp;name=instagram-switch-to-business-profile.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 250px;\" alt=\"Switch to Business Profile option on Instagram mobile app\" width=\"250\"></a></p> \n<p>Under \"Settings,\" select \"Linked Accounts.\" Here's where you can select Facebook and link your two accounts together. You might be asked to \"Log in With Facebook,\" at which point you'll enter your business account's username and password. Otherwise, select \"Continue as [yourself].\"</p> \n<h3>3. Open HubSpot and use the \"Social\" tool to integrate your Instagram profile.</h3> \n<p>Now that your Instagram profile is anchored to Facebook, you're ready to integrate it with your post scheduler. As mentioned, for our purposes, we'll be using HubSpot's Social tool.</p> \n<p>Open HubSpot, select \"Settings\" &gt; \"Marketing\" &gt; \"Social\" &gt; \"Connect Account\" &gt; \"Facebook and Instagram.\"</p> \n<h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-24%20at%2011.06.05%20AM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-24%20at%2011.06.05%20AM.png\" alt=\"connect social accounts to hubspot\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></h3> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Click the first option, \"Facebook &amp; Instagram,\" and follow the prompts to complete this step (<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social/connect-your-social-media-accounts-to-hubspot\">which are listed here in greater detail</a>).&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>4. Create your first social post for your Instagram account.</h3> \n<p>Once your Instagram account is integrated into HubSpot, you'll see an option to \"<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social/create-and-publish-social-posts\">Create social post</a>\" in your HubSpot dashboard. Click it, and you'll see icons for which social network you want to start with. Select the Instagram icon to compose your first post for your Instagram account.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>5. Compose a message with your desired visual assets, captions, and hashtags.</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social/create-and-publish-social-posts\">Customize your Instagram post and upload an image</a> using the landscape icons on the bottom-lefthand corner of the white text field that appears, as shown below:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/product-updates/now-live-publish-to-instagram-directly-from-hubspot\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/compose-instagram-message-hubspot-1.png?width=600&amp;name=compose-instagram-message-hubspot-1.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Box to compose a social post for Instagram via HubSpot\"></a></p> \n<p>Then, caption your image with the text, hashtags, and user mentions you'd like to post your photo with, as they should appear on Instagram.</p> \n<h3>6. Set the date and time of your Instagram post.</h3> \n<p>Just above the photo that you're posting, you'll see a field where you can <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social/create-and-publish-social-posts\">add the date and time that your post will be scheduled to go live</a>. Use this field to set the exact date and time you want your post to automatically go live on your Instagram profile.</p> \n<h3>7. Preview your post to make sure it looks right.</h3> \n<p>Any grammatical errors? Are all your intended hashtags included? Is the image successfully uploaded? Check to make sure, and you'll be ready to schedule.</p> \n<h3>8. Click \"Schedule message.\"</h3> \n<p>Got any more Instagram posts planned? Draft them now and schedule all of them at the same time — with HubSpot, you can schedule your social posts in bulk.</p> \n<p>Once every post you want to schedule has been loaded into HubSpot, you can hit the \"Schedule\" button on the page.</p> \n<h2>Schedule Your Instagram Posts</h2> \n<p>Start scheduling your Instagram posts to make your workflow more efficient and to ensure the content you need to get in front of your audience does so in a timely fashion.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"instagram statistics\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fschedule-instagram-posts-update&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"95be3f8e3a35c7c0dbd6af3088673390","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"afrost@hubspot.com (Aja Frost)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%209.36.16%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%209.36.16%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn84@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-50-111_2b92463ab3139f8c.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.03.08%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.03.08%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn58@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-49-013_de7708e933922457.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.06.17%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.06.17%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn65@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-51-219_2bf6133ae7af44dd.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.14.23%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.14.23%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-50-184_3e393f8b183fdea6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.23.59%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.23.59%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-52-669_81ee478e2f9daac5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.33.54%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-23%20at%2010.33.54%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn35@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-50-475_3f98dd97d9b34281.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-switch-to-business-profile.png?width=250&name=instagram-switch-to-business-profile.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn21@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-49-815_95b3da42756fdbc7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-24%20at%2011.06.05%20AM.png?width=600&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-24%20at%2011.06.05%20AM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn27@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-52-936_b11b1638981cef20.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/compose-instagram-message-hubspot-1.png?width=600&name=compose-instagram-message-hubspot-1.png":null,"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn6@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-49-299_a4245cc995397db3.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fschedule-instagram-posts-update&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn12@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-49-130_68ce747b2cdee10d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938161},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"Best Goal Setting Worksheet to Help You Plan & Achieve","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/goal-setting-worksheet","description":"<p>Accomplishing your goals is an incredibly gratifying feeling.</p>  \n<p>However, it can sometimes be challenging to get that feeling, as achieving your goals takes time, effort, and a structured process.

Identify your initial goal.</h3> \n<p>The first step of the process is to simply identify what your goal is. It doesn’t have to be convoluted, just merely the objective you’re hoping to achieve. For example, if you’re hoping to grow your website, your baseline goal could be “I want to generate more site traffic.”</p> \n<h3>2.Define your SMART goals.</h3> \n<p>The second step in the process is to use the SMART framework to elaborate your goals to ensure that they’re clear, measurable and that the process will help you get there. Here are is what each of the element in the acronym stands for:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Specific:</strong>&nbsp;A specific goal clearly outlines what you’re hoping to improve. If you share your specific goals with your team, it should be clear what your intention is.</li> \n <li><strong>Measurable:</strong>&nbsp;Making your goal measurable means attaching numbers to your objective that will help you understand what you have to meet, track your progress, and see how long it will take you to reach your end goal.</li> \n <li><strong>Attainable:</strong>&nbsp;Making sure that your goals are attainable means that they are realistic and that you have a chance of achieving them. Your goal is not too out of left field or so unrelated to your current practices that you wouldn’t be able to succeed.</li> \n <li><strong>Relevant:</strong>&nbsp;Ensuring that your goal is relevant involves answering the question of “Why are you setting the goal that you’re setting?” Your goal should directly relate to your business’ needs and help your business grow.</li> \n <li><strong>Time-Bound:</strong>&nbsp;The final aspect of your goal-setting process is to set a timeline. It helps you understand what your schedule should be and stay on track in terms of achieving your ultimate goal.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Goal Setting Template</h4> \n<p>It’s always helpful to have a worksheet guide you through your process, and the image below is an example.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/initial%20goals.jpg?width=2400&amp;name=initial%20goals.jpg\" alt=\"sample goal setting template section for outlining initial goals\" width=\"2400\" style=\"width: 2400px;\"></a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Download Template Here</a></span></p> \n<p>Once you've finished defining your goals, the next step is to calculate your targets so you know what your final numbers should be and so you can plan your process accordingly, so you’re able to meet those final numbers.</p> \n<h3>2. Calculate your goal outcomes.</h3> \n<p>The most challenging part of your plan might be coming up with numerical targets that coincide with achieving your goals. You can just say, “We want to increase blog leads by 25%,” but what would the 25% increase be in numerical form?</p> \n<p>When you have these numbers, you can set milestones for yourself and monitor your progress and make changes along the way if necessary.</p> \n<p>The image below is an example of a SMART goal calculation.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add%20numerics.jpg?width=2400&amp;name=add%20numerics.jpg\" alt=\"example template for applying numerical values to your SMART goals\" width=\"2400\" style=\"width: 2400px;\"></a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals?_ga=2.85371225.1166794584.1622232130-1838590087.1622232130\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<h3>3. Evaluate your SMART goals.</h3> \n<p>The template’s final step is to evaluate your goals, which helps you anticipate possible roadblocks and develop action plans for dealing with them. If you have multiple goals, aim to ask these questions for each one that you have:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>What is your SMART marketing goal?</li> \n <li>Do you feel that this goal is realistically attainable in the time frame you’ve set?</li> \n <li>How many hours per week can you dedicate to achieving your goal/your goal process?</li> \n <li>What is the biggest challenge preventing you from achieving this goal?

While most people reply to emails within a half-hour to an hour, 72% of consumers respond to texts within 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Aside from quick response rates, text messages can also receive very high engagement. 43% of surveyed business owners and digital marketers who use SMS marketing report click-through rates between 20% and 35%.</p> \n<p>One interesting piece of the <a href=\"https://simpletexting.com/2021-texting-statistics/\">SimpleTexting</a>&nbsp;survey reveals that 52% of brands reported increased opt-in rates between 2021. However, nearly 10% reported decreased opt-ins in the same year.</p> \n<p>While the increased opt-ins are in line with screen and text-message time increases, the opt-out increases do hint that consumers could be as quick to unsubscribe from text message content as they are to subscribe from it.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://simpletexting.com/2021-texting-statistics/\">SimpleTexting</a> study and other research points to reasons why people might opt out.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Too many text messages from one brand: </strong>60% of <a href=\"https://simpletexting.com/2021-texting-statistics/\">SimpleTexting</a>&nbsp;respondents say they've unsubscribed from SMS alerts from brands that send them too frequently. Furthermore, 56% of those consumers prefer to receive just one text from a brand per week.</li> \n <li><strong>Too many texts from multiple brands: </strong>If you do up your text cadence to two, keep in mind that your subscribers might be inundated with tons of texts from other brands as well. While your texts might still be meaningful, you might see more sensitivity to opt-outs simply because subscribers are tired of all the text alerts.</li> \n <li><strong>Meaningless content: </strong>Like email marketing, you'll need to hook your reader and keep them engaged with the content they've signed up to receive. Sending too much over-promotional content, boring content, or content that isn't what they signed up for might cause you to see unsubscribes. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"a chart shows that most people unsunscribe from text message alerts because they receive them too often.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Is%20SMS%20Marketing%20Dead%3F%20New%20Data%20Says%20Maybe%20Not-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 10px;\"><em><a href=\"https://simpletexting.com/2021-texting-statistics/\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<h2>Tips for Launching a Great SMS Strategy</h2> \n<p>While SMS certainly isn't dead, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/conversational-marketing?_ga=2.254005832.1199474365.1624373729-1356003865.1624373729\">text message or conversational marketing platforms</a>&nbsp;can be hard to master. As you consider or build out a text-based strategy, keep these quick tips in mind.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Know your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">persona</a>: </strong>Although people might quickly sign up to receive your messages, it won't take much to get them to opt out. Be sure you know exactly what your audience members are looking for and how often they want to receive that content to avoid sending meaningless texts that go ignored.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Give subscribers what they've signed up for: </strong>Remember, subscribers are trusting you with their contact information, and if you aren't transparent about what you'll be sending or how often you'll be texting them, they might quickly opt. out. Be sure you stay consistent with what they're expecting. &nbsp;</li> \n <li><strong>Remember, less is more: </strong>No one wants to get their phone blown up with tons of meaningless over-promotional tests. Before you launch an SMS campaign, ask yourself questions like, \"Am I contacting people too often?\" and \"Will they even engage with this content?\" If you worry that the content will be ineffective, consider streamlining your SMS schedule and only sending the most important text content.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li> \n</ul> \n<p>To learn even more about message-based marketing and SMS strategies, check out the great resource below.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=27a0c42e-ac29-4f9a-8b46-23bf884ee76b&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"SMS Templates for Marketing Sales and Service\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/27a0c42e-ac29-4f9a-8b46-23bf884ee76b.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fis-sms-marketing-dead&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Is%20SMS%20Marketing%20Dead%3F%20New%20Data%20Says%20Maybe%20Not.png","linkMd5":"e1ec8f2974edb6b3e63ebfc493d3069d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn19@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-38-492_db96ded43df7533e.webp","destWidth":948,"destHeight":257,"sourceBytes":23470,"destBytes":23470,"author":"pbump@hubspot.com (Pamela Bump)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Is%20SMS%20Marketing%20Dead%3F%20New%20Data%20Says%20Maybe%20Not.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn19@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-38-492_db96ded43df7533e.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c1b4a8fb-6392-4143-b13c-fc0e3be221e1.png":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Is%20SMS%20Marketing%20Dead%3F%20New%20Data%20Says%20Maybe%20Not-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn29@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-50-688_03087bc69977613a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Is%20SMS%20Marketing%20Dead%3F%20New%20Data%20Says%20Maybe%20Not-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn6@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-49-798_5664ccfa7347654d.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/27a0c42e-ac29-4f9a-8b46-23bf884ee76b.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn47@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-52-358_ac8bd14c17387117.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fis-sms-marketing-dead&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-50-166_5cc2fc454a23576e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938151},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"8 of the Top Marketing Challenges Faced Globally [New Data + Expert Tips]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33820/5-major-challenges-marketers-face-and-how-to-solve-them.aspx","description":"<p>Every marketer faces different challenges.

For that reason, it's important to pause for a moment and reflect on the biggest challenges marketers feel they're going to face this year.</p> \n<p>Why? Because problems are much easier to tackle once you've correctly identified them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So ... what's happening in 2021?</p> \n<p>Below, let's review the current global marketing issues impacting the industry, according to marketing experts.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: State of Marketing in 2021 Report\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Biggest Marketing Challenges [New Data]</h2> \n<p>To start, I surveyed over 120 marketers to gauge the biggest challenges affecting the industry as a whole.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/biggest%20challenges%20for%20marketers%202021.png?width=1080&amp;name=biggest%20challenges%20for%20marketers%202021.png\" alt=\"biggest challenges for marketers 2021\" width=\"1080\" style=\"width: 1080px;\">By far, \"Generating traffic and leads\" was marked by nearly half as the biggest challenge marketers are facing this year.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This challenge was followed by 21% who said \"providing ROI for your marketing activities\" was their biggest challenge.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\"Delivering an account-based marketing strategy\" (8%), \"securing enough budget\" (6%), and \"managing your website\" (5%) were the other three notable challenges marketers feel they're facing in 2021.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It's important to note, a few other marketers marked \"targeting content for an international audience\", \"training your team\", and \"hiring top talent\" as their top challenge ... but these three challenges were marked by less than 3% of the respondent pool, so they're less statistically significant.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Let's dive into these in more detail, along with expert tips to combat these challenges, next.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Generating Traffic and Leads</h3> \n<p>Generating enough traffic and leads is the top global marketing challenge in 2021, according to the data mentioned above.</p> \n<p>HubSpot's new <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">State of Marketing report</a> supports this — in fact, \"Generating more leads\" is the top priority of marketers in 2021.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Why It's a Challenge</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thejohnalee/\">John Lee</a>, Head of Evangelism at <a href=\"https://ads.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Advertising</a>, believes that generating leads will be a particularly big challenge for marketers in 2021. He told me, \"Getting quality traffic isn't a challenge today, and likely won't be tomorrow. There has been growth in search and content marketing in 2021. New channels continue to surface and show promise, too (TikTok or audio chat rooms anyone?).\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"Through the 2nd half of 2021 and beyond, the challenges will lie elsewhere – maintain and growing leads or sales, tracking and scaling, etc.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Lee adds, \"'Sea change' is the phrase that comes to mind for the state of digital marketing today. Change in the realm of <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/data-privacy/gdpr\">privacy</a>, identity, and changes to cookies. Change in the form of lost data clarity (will cookie-based conversion tracking continue to work, GA4, access to search queries, etc.). And all of this sits within the context of change to how and where we work and economies in flux as the world continues to move through the pandemic.\"</p> \n<p>Fortunately, privacy changes doesn't mean the end of generating leads — it simply means learning how to re-think strategy. As Lee told me, \"To weather this storm of change, marketers need to be vigilant in monitoring and understanding industry-wide acceptance of privacy protocols and updates to search, social, and display/native platforms (consumer-side and marketing/advertising-side). And last, but not least — lean into the power of peer support and networking for sharing best practices and learning.\"</p> \n<p>Additionally, marketers are struggling with producing enough demand for their content. And as the years progress and competition stiffens, this will only become truer. With so many options of platforms for marketers to publish their content and even more ways to promote it, it's hard to know where to focus your efforts.</p> \n<h4>What Can You Do?</h4> \n<p>When it comes to creating content that produces enough traffic and leads, marketers should ask themselves two questions: Are you truly creating high-quality content — the type of content people would <em>pay</em> for? And, do you know the type of content your audience actually wants?</p> \n<p>For instance, when asked how they’d most like to learn about a product or service in 2021, <a href=\"https://www.wyzowl.com/video-marketing-statistics/\">69% said they’d prefer to watch a short video</a> over a text-based article, infographic, or ebook. This means, if most of your product-related content is in ebook format, you could be missing out on the majority of consumers who prefer video.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the length of videos produced by businesses is increasing. In fact, the number of videos in the 30-60 minute category grew 140% in 2021, compared to 2019 — suggesting that long-form video content is becoming a more popular option for companies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To ensure you're creating content that resonates best with your audience, you'll want to refer to analytics often. Use effective tools to properly track the types of content that performs best with your audience to generate more leads in 2021.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Additionally, once you know you're creating the <em>type</em> of content your audience wants, the focus shifts to promoting it in a way that makes your audience take notice.</p> \n<p>More than ever before, people are being flooded with content. Consumers don't have to use a search engine to find answers. Instead, articles fill their news feed or buzz in their pocket via mobile notifications. To keep up, consider exploring alternate distribution methods — like social media or podcasting — to increase brand awareness.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Providing the ROI of Your Marketing Activities</h3> \n<p>Measuring the ROI (return on investment) of your marketing activities has remained a top marketing challenge globally year-over-year.</p> \n<p>In fact, when asked how confident marketers are when making budgeting decisions to invest in programs that influence revenue, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">roughly half (48%) said they were only somewhat confident</a>.</p> \n<p>It continues to be a vital way for marketers to understand the effectiveness of each particular marketing campaign or piece of content.</p> \n<p>Plus, proving ROI often goes hand-in-hand with making an argument to increase budget: No ROI tracking, no demonstrable ROI. No ROI, no budget.</p> \n<h4>Why It's a Challenge</h4> \n<p>Although return on investment is a crucial stat that shows your campaigns success or progress, tracking the ROI of every single marketing activity isn't always easy, especially if you don't have two-way communication between your marketing activities and sales reports.</p> \n<h4>What Can You Do?</h4> \n<p>Providing ROI often comes down to using effective analytics measurement tools. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.beautiful.ai/\">Beautiful.ai</a> Director of Marketing <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimgiroux\">Kim Giroux</a> told me, \"Marketers are constantly challenged to illustrate the ROI of their efforts and 2021 is no exception. Proving ROI doesn't always have to mean extra work or effort though. In fact, certain technologies bake ROI into existing work processes.\"</p> \n<p>Giroux adds, \"Take presentation software, for instance. Savvy marketers today can create and use pitch decks with built-in presentation analytics that offer real-time data — such as how much time was spent viewing individual slides. Armed with these insights, marketers can better gauge stakeholder interest, inform their strategies, and adjust their campaigns.\"</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinamautz/\">Christina Mautz</a>, CMO of <a href=\"https://moz.com/\">Moz</a>, believes measuring ROI comes down to redefining the marketing process as a whole. She told me, \"My biggest challenge, and one all marketers face in providing ROI, is the prospect of meeting traditional KPIs in the modern workspace.\"</p> \n<p>Mautz says, \"Instead of leads and trade show success, marketing wins are now largely digital: engaging prospects and generating more clicks, downloads, and page visits.\"</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>CMO of Moz Christina Mautz says, \"To better measure marketing progress, we have to redefine the marketing process, encouraging collaboration with sales and reaching KPIs together.\"</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>\"For example, statistics such as page visits per sale or rising higher in the search engine results page (SERP) give marketers and SEOs tangible evidence as to how their work is meeting their ROI. New buying patterns and a customer-centric world require a divergence from the old, but measuring ROI will look far different than it did before and some leaders may not understand how or why.\"</p> \n<p>When it comes to providing ROI, there's a strong case to be made for dedicating time and resources to establishing links between marketing activities and sales results. This means using both marketing software (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/demo\">like HubSpot</a>) and a CRM solution (<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/crm\">like HubSpot's free CRM</a>), and then tying them together to close the loop between your marketing and sales efforts with a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-align-create-an-effective-sla#sm.00000wq1gwz9o4dk0qqexui71uyd0\">service-level agreement (SLA)</a>. That way, you can directly see how many leads and customers are generated through your marketing activities.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Securing Enough Budget</h3> \n<p>How can you create a winning marketing campaign without a budget? The truth is, it's pretty hard. But, even when you have a great, revenue-generating idea, you still usually need to get your budget approved by a higher-up.</p> \n<p>Particularly in the aftermath of the global pandemic, some companies don't have the means to increase marketing budgets in 2021. As a result, marketers are faced with the challenge of achieving high levels of growth with minimal financial support.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Why It's a Challenge</h4> \n<p>Securing more budget is a pressing challenge for marketing globally. And often, getting more budget is easier said than done — especially for smaller organizations that aren't working with sizable or flexible marketing spend.</p> \n<p>But the key to securing more money for your team might not be that complex. Here's what you can do.</p> \n<h4>What Can You Do?</h4> \n<p>The key to unlocking budget lies in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi\">being able to prove the ROI</a> of your marketing efforts. According to our report, organizations that can calculate ROI are more likely to receive higher budgets.</p> \n<p>Again, success with inbound marketing also plays a large role in driving higher budgets. Effective strategies obviously produce results and make a strong case for increasing budget. But remember, inbound marketing is a long game. If you get off to a slow start, you shouldn’t back off — in fact, you might consider doubling down.</p> \n<p>To learn more about how to understand and leverage marketing ROI, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/measure-content-marketing-roi\">check out this simple guide</a>.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. Managing Your Website</h3> \n<p>In 2021, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">64% of companies are investing</a> in website upgrades.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Although managing a website is consistently a challenge to marketers, it seems to be growing less threatening. In the data mentioned above, only 5% of marketers listed \"managing your website\" as a top challenge.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Why It's Still a Challenge</h4> \n<p>Chances are, your website's performance is high on your list of priorities — particularly since website speed and performance <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo\">plays a major role in your website's SEO ranking</a>. It's an asset that works around the clock to draw in visitors, convert them, and help you hit your goals.</p> \n<p>Issues with website management include a variety of different factors, from writing and optimizing the content to designing beautiful webpages. Here are a few things marketers can do to deal with this challenge.</p> \n<h4>What Can You Do?</h4> \n<p>First, try <a href=\"https://website.grader.com/\">HubSpot's free website grader</a> to determine how your website stacks up on key metrics including SEO, mobile, and security performance — and how you can improve it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If your primary challenge with managing a website has to do with the skills and resources you have available, you aren't alone. This is especially true for small companies who don't have all the talent in-house required to cover content, optimization, design, and back-end website management.</p> \n<p>One solution?

Targeting Content for an International Audience</h3> \n<p>Targeting is a key component of all aspects of marketing.</p> \n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">65% of marketers currently marketing internationally</a>, and at least one-third of marketers planning to initiate an international strategy in 2021, it's important to have an international strategy.</p> \n<p>To be more effective at targeting, one of the first things any marketer needs do is <a title=\"identify their buyer personas\" href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates?_ga=2.212494036.15433278.1494794859-798140974.1486135114\">identify their buyer personas </a>to determine to whom they should be marketing.</p> \n<h4>Why It's a Challenge</h4> \n<p>If you're expanding internationally, it can be a big challenge not only to figure out the best ways to market to an international audience, but also how to to organize and optimize your site for different countries.</p> \n<p>Here are a few other top challenges when marketing internationally:&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-14%20at%204.53.46%20PM.png?width=1218&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-14%20at%204.53.46%20PM.png\" alt=\"challenges marketers face with international marketing\" width=\"1218\" style=\"width: 1218px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<h4>What Can You Do?</h4> \n<p>Download our free ebook, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/global-marketing-playbook\">The Global Marketing Playbook.</a> There are some really helpful tips in there that'll help give you some direction on global marketing, including how to identify your top three growth markets, how to explore local trends, and tips on choosing the best localization providers.</p> \n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/tools/state-of-marketing/PDFs/Not%20Another%20State%20of%20Marketing%20Report%20-%20Web%20Version.pdf\">when marketing to a new region, the most common tactic marketers use is to shift their product offering</a>.</p> \n<p>Remember, your website visitors might speak a plethora of different languages and live in totally different time zones.</p> \n<p>To make your content appealing to a wide audience, you'll need to keep your global visitors top-of-mind when creating all your content. This means being aware of seasonal references, translating units of measure and monetary references, and giving translators the tools and permissions to customize and adapt content for a specific audience when they need to.</p> \n<p>When in doubt, solve for local or cultural challenges by hiring locally.

Training Your Team</h3> \n<p>As companies scale and technologies continue to evolve, training your team will become a greater challenge for marketers.</p> \n<h4>Why It's a Challenge</h4> \n<p>Whether it's training them on the concepts and tools they'll be using every day or making sure they're achieving their full potential, the struggle is real across the board.</p> \n<p>To combat this, I’ll share some tips I’ve used during my trainings to make sure the concepts and tool tips stick and have a lasting effect on your team and your marketing.</p> \n<h4>What Can You Do?</h4> \n<p>To get an overall idea of where your team stands, take a few minutes to assess each of your team members' marketing strengths and weaknesses, levels of expertise, and passion/commitment to your company.</p> \n<p>Then, objectively rate the priority (or level of importance) of their expertise and their contribution to bottom line objectives (ROI) to date. <a href=\"https://www.lean-labs.com/marketing-team-evaluation\">Here's a simple assessment tool from Lean Labs</a> to help you evaluate your team so you can figure out who needs recognition and who needs coaching.</p> \n<p>You also might consider requiring your team members to rack up some online marketing certification. <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot Academy</a>, for example, offers certifications, documentation, and training programs to help people master the basics of inbound marketing. Google also offers training and certifications on analytics with their online <a href=\"https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/explorer\">Analytics Academy</a>.</p> \n<p>What about new hire training, specifically? We recommend creating a training plan for new team members. Here at HubSpot, each new marketer is given a document to lay out specific goals and help new hires demonstrate their effectiveness. To create your own 30, 60, or 90 day plan for new hires, take a look at <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/30-60-90-day-plan\">The 30-60-90 Day Plan: Your Guide for Mastering a New Job [Template + Example]</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">7. Hiring Top Talent</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/c/pdfs/Ultimate-List-of-Hiring-Stats-v02.04.pdf\">Hiring top talent</a> is another challenge marketers commonly report experiencing.</p> \n<h4>Why It's a Challenge</h4> \n<p>Many companies are shifting more resources to inbound marketing, which means higher and higher demand for top marketing talent. But supply simply isn't keeping up. From sourcing the right candidates to evaluating for the right skills, finding the perfect person could take months ... or more.</p> \n<p>What's more, the type of marketing talent companies are looking for is changing, too. According to a <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/trends-and-research/2020/most-in-demand-hard-and-soft-skills\">2020 report from LinkedIn</a>, employers are seeking marketers with soft creative skill sets as well as hard technical skills. And the quick rate at which the demand for these jobs are rising has caused a marketing skills gap, \"making it difficult to find candidates with the technical, creative, and business proficiencies needed to succeed in digital marketing.\"</p> \n<h4>What Can You Do?</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefaniegrieser/\">Stefanie Grieser</a>, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.shinebootcamp.com/\">Shine Bootcamp</a>, a professional speaker accelerator for women, understands the challenge of hiring top talent.</p> \n<p>She told me, \"When I talk to high-growth companies or marketing agencies (and the marketers running those teams), I've found that hiring not only top talent, but <em>diverse</em> top talent is extremely challenging. In fact, I was just having a conversation with an agency owner who hires SEO and paid marketers, and he told me, 'Hiring is still the biggest challenge we face.'\"</p> \n<p>In 2021, hiring talent can be incredibly difficult — particularly as more companies become competitive with 4-day work weeks, transparent salaries on job descriptions, and the adoption of remote work, which enables companies to hire anywhere. <br><br>Fortunately, Grieser provided me with a few tips for employers to stand out from the crowd. She told me, \"My suggestion here is for marketers to invest heavily in their employer brand for the long-term. Just like you need to market your product, you also need to dedicate resources, time and energy into marketing your company as an employer.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/biggest%20marketing%20challenges%202021.png?width=1104&amp;name=biggest%20marketing%20challenges%202021.png\" alt=\"biggest marketing challenges 2021 is hiring top talent\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\">Grieser adds, \"I would suggest <a href=\"https://www.diversifytech.co/\">Diversity Tech Co</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hiretechladies.com/\">Tech Ladies</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.girlboss.com/\">Girlboss</a> as go-to resources to post jobs. These organizations are run by incredible individuals who really care about diversity, equity, inclusion and intersectionality. I'm also seeing niche communities and job boards pop up. For marketers specifically, I would post your open roles here: <a href=\"https://dgmgjobs.com/\">Dave Gerhardt Marketing Group</a>, <a href=\"https://heymarketers.com/\">Hey Marketers</a>, and <a href=\"https://jobs.superpath.co/\">Superpath</a> (which is focused on content marketers specifically).\"<br><br>While it might seem random to discuss employer branding in a post about marketing challenges, it isn't — since it's often the marketing team that cultivates a strong employer brand. <br><br>As Grieser points out, \"Airbnb has an <a href=\"https://airbnb.io/\">Engineering and Data Science blog</a>, Intercom has an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/intercombrandstudio/\">Instagram</a> dedicated to their design team, and Dooly posts short, LinkedIn posts (see an example <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6803806600764252160/\">here</a>) interviewing their fun team with a few fun hashtags #doolydreamteam and #meetadooligan.\"</p> \n<p>\"Guess who leads this initiative? The marketing team. Think about how you and your team can showcase your work and your team's work. I won't try to assume that employer brand falls solely in your court, but as a marketer, you have natural skills that will lend themselves to marketing the company as whole.\"</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/c/pdfs/Ultimate-List-of-Hiring-Stats-v02.04.pdf\">LinkedIn data from 2020 </a>shows that 87% of active and passive job candidates will consider new job opportunities. Additionally, the number one reason candidates will consider or accept a job is career growth. This means that job listings and a company culture that offers employees a plan for growth will see the most interest from talent.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">8. Delivering an Account-Based Marketing Strategy</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-guide\">Account-based marketing (ABM)</a> is a new trend, which is a growth strategy in which marketing and sales collaborate to create a personalized buying experience for an identified set of accounts.</p> \n<p>However, interestingly, <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/tools/state-of-marketing/PDFs/Not%20Another%20State%20of%20Marketing%20Report%20-%20Web%20Version.pdf\">the most common challenge with ABM is delivering a personalized experience</a>.</p> \n<h4>Why It's a Challenge</h4> \n<p>Currently, there isn't a lot of software that's focused on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-automation\">account-based marketing</a>. Many companies that are implementing ABM strategies are using manual methods, which means some accounts are getting lost in the cracks.</p> \n<p>However,<a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/Forrester+Infographic+ABM+Maturity+Corresponds+To+Better+Revenue+Results/-/E-RES157155\"> marketers strongly agree that personalized content (56%) and advanced data management (43%) are keys to ABM's success</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-14%20at%205.26.18%20PM.png?width=479&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-14%20at%205.26.18%20PM.png\" alt=\"challenges marketers face with ABM\" width=\"479\" style=\"width: 479px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h4>What Can You Do?</h4> \n<p>To deliver a more personalized experience, you should use a software that helps you combine your sales and marketing information.</p> \n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/abm-software\">HubSpot's ABM software </a>help unite your marketing and sales teams with collaborative, intuitive ABM tools that create seamless buying experiences for your highest-value accounts.</p> \n<p>This software can enable collaboration among teams and personalize content.</p> \n<p>Additionally, HubSpot's software has account-level targeting added to the LinkedIn Ads integration, giving you the ability to target companies by target account status or tier, and contacts or subsets of contacts at target accounts.</p> \n<p>The account overview sidebar, the ABM playbook for sales reps, and a native integration to link your HubSpot and LinkedIn Sales Navigator accounts, help further deepen your relationships with people over time, helping build more authentic connections with stakeholders within each account.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Does your company face any of these marketing issues?</h3> \n<p>A thorough analysis of your marketing strategy and its current performance will help you discover where your biggest marketing opportunity lies. This will allow you to focus on improving the areas that need the most attention, so you can start making your marketing far more effective.</p> \n<p>If you're faced with a challenge and want ideas on how to best tackle it, you can always consider getting some help by any of the <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/marketing-training\">various types of marketing training that are available</a>.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in November 2012 and has been updated for freshness and comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"state of marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33820%2F5-major-challenges-marketers-face-and-how-to-solve-them.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png","linkMd5":"2aa427724dc829be6641840148648a85","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn5@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-586_88b93bfb7be7b212.webp","destWidth":442,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5404,"destBytes":7216,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b0f73a5e-16e4-41fd-9511-8564efc560a7.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn5@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-586_88b93bfb7be7b212.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/biggest%20challenges%20for%20marketers%202021.png?width=1080&name=biggest%20challenges%20for%20marketers%202021.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn100@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-52-398_87e7d5e4540e2392.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-14%20at%204.53.46%20PM.png?width=1218&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-14%20at%204.53.46%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-50-076_77d4acbcef47d6fd.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/biggest%20marketing%20challenges%202021.png?width=1104&name=biggest%20marketing%20challenges%202021.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn82@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-52-049_5a0ad27e145105c6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-14%20at%205.26.18%20PM.png?width=479&name=Screen%20Shot%202021-06-14%20at%205.26.18%20PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn21@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-52-510_ffc536da9e1f4672.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn78@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-48-782_ba6ee21c8b9c368e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fblog%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F33820%2F5-major-challenges-marketers-face-and-how-to-solve-them.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn61@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-48-738_71e71b31b27826e8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114938158},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:38","title":"Color Theory 101: A Complete Guide to Color Wheels & Color Schemes","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design","description":"<p>When you're sifting through your News Feed, what tends to catch your attention?

By understanding color theory basics, you can begin to parse the logical structure of color for yourself to create and use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-palette-inspiration\">color palettes</a> more strategically. The result means evoking a particular emotion, vibe, or aesthetic.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>While there are many tools out there to help even the most inartistic of us to create compelling visuals, graphic design tasks require a little more background knowledge on <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/design\">design principles</a>.</p> \n<p>Take <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-color-schemes?_ga=2.84043481.1301447038.1622646346-1029200885.1622646346\">selecting the right color combination</a>, for instance. It's something that might seem easy at first but when you're staring down a color wheel, you're going to wish you had some information on what you're looking at. Understanding how colors work together, the impact they can have on mood and emotion, and how they change the look and feel of your website is critical to help you stand out from the crowd — for the right reasons.</p> \n<p>From effective CTAs to sales conversions and marketing efforts, the right color choice can highlight specific sections of your website, make it easier for users to navigate, or give them a sense of familiarity from the first moment they click through.</p> \n<p>But it’s not enough to simply select colors and hope for the best — from color theory to moods and schemes, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-color-schemes?_ga=2.63612527.1301447038.1622646346-1029200885.1622646346\">finding the right HTML color codes, </a>and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-identify-web-accessible-colors-for-products-websites?_ga=2.63612527.1301447038.1622646346-1029200885.1622646346\">identifying web-accessible colors for products and websites</a>, the more you know about using color, the better your chances are for success.</p> \n<p>Read on for our designer’s guide to color theory, color wheels, and color schemes for your site.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Color Theory 101</h2> \n<p>Let's first go back to high school art class to discuss the basics of color.</p> \n<p>Remember hearing about primary, secondary, and tertiary colors? They're pretty important if you want to understand, well, everything else about color.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/123b.png?width=292&amp;name=123b.png\" width=\"292\" style=\"font-family: AvenirNext, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 600; font-size: 17.6px; width: 292px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Circular color theory model with labels for primary colors, secondary colors, and tertiary colors\" /></p> \n<h3>Primary Colors</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Primary colors are those you can't create by combining two or more other colors together. They're a lot like prime numbers, which can't be created by multiplying two other <em>numbers</em> together.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are three primary colors:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Red</strong></li> \n <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Yellow</strong></li> \n <li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Blue</strong></li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Think of primary colors as your parent colors, anchoring your design in a general color scheme. Any one or combination of these colors can give your brand guardrails when you move to explore other shades, tones, and tints (we'll talk about those in just a minute).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When designing or even painting with primary colors, don't feel restricted to just the three primary colors listed above. Orange isn't a primary color, for example, but brands can certainly use orange as their dominant color (as we at HubSpot know this quite well).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Knowing which primary colors <em>create</em> orange is your ticket to identifying colors that might go well with orange — given the right shade, tone, or tint. This brings us to our next type of color ...</p> \n<h3>Secondary Colors</h3> \n<p>Secondary colors are the colors that are formed by combining any two of the three primary colors listed above. Check out the color theory model above — see how each secondary color is supported by two of the three primary colors?</p> \n<p>There are three secondary colors: <strong>orange</strong>, <strong>purple</strong>, and <strong>green</strong>. You can create each one using two of the three primary colors. Here are the general rules of secondary color creation:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Red + Yellow = <strong>Orange</strong></li> \n <li>Blue + Red = <strong>Purple</strong></li> \n <li>Yellow + Blue = <strong>Green</strong></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Keep in mind that the color mixtures above only work if you use the purest form of each primary color. This pure form is known as a color's <em>hue</em>, and you'll see how these hues compare to the variants underneath each color in the color wheel below.</p> \n<h3>Tertiary Colors</h3> \n<p>Tertiary colors are created when you mix a primary color with a secondary color.</p> \n<p>From here, color gets a little more complicated, and if you want to learn how the experts choose color in their design, you've got to first understand all the other components of color.</p> \n<p>The most important component of tertiary colors is that not every primary color can match with a secondary color to create a tertiary color. For example, red can't mix in harmony with green, and blue can't mix in harmony with orange -- both mixtures would result in a slightly brown color (unless of course, that's what you're looking for).</p> \n<p>Instead, tertiary colors are created when a primary color mixes with a secondary color that comes next to it on the color wheel below. There are six tertiary colors that fit this requirement:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Red + Purple = <strong>Red-Purple</strong> (magenta)</li> \n <li>Red + Orange = <strong>Red-Orange</strong> (vermillion)</li> \n <li>Blue + Purple = <strong>Blue-Purple</strong> (violet)</li> \n <li>Blue + Green = <strong>Blue-Green</strong> (teal)</li> \n <li>Yellow + Orange = <strong>Yellow-Orange</strong> (amber)</li> \n <li>Yellow + Green = <strong>Yellow-Green</strong> (chartreuse)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>The Color Theory Wheel</h3> \n<p>Okay, great. So now you know what the \"main\" colors are, but you and I both know that choosing <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-combinations\">color combinations</a>, especially on a computer, involves a much wider range than 12 basic colors.</p> \n<p>This is the impetus behind the color wheel, a circle graph that charts each primary, secondary, and tertiary color — as well as their respective hues, tints, tones, and shades. Visualizing colors in this way helps you choose color schemes by showing you how each color relates to the color that comes next to it on a rainbow color scale. (As you probably know, the colors of a rainbow, in order, are <strong>red</strong>, <strong>orange</strong>, <strong>yellow</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, <strong>indigo</strong>, and <strong>violet</strong>.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/00-Blog-Related_Images/types_of_colors.png?width=450&amp;height=342&amp;name=types_of_colors.png\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Color theory wheel with labels for each color's hue, tint, tone, and shade\" width=\"450\" height=\"342\" /></p> \n<p>When choosing colors for a color scheme, the color wheel gives you opportunities to create brighter, lighter, softer, and darker colors by mixing white, black, and gray with the original colors. These mixes create the color variants described below:</p> \n<h4>Hue</h4> \n<p>Hue is pretty much synonymous with what we actually mean when we said the word \"color.\" All of the primary and secondary colors, for instance, are \"hues.\"</p> \n<p>Hues are important to remember when combining two primary colors to create a secondary color. If you don't use the hues of the two primary colors you're mixing together, you won't generate the hue of the secondary color. This is because a hue has the fewest other colors inside it. By mixing two primary colors that carry other tints, tones, and shades inside them, you're technically adding more than two colors to the mixture — making your final color dependent on the compatibility of more than two colors.</p> \n<p>If you were to mix the hues of red and blue together, for instance, you'd get purple, right? But mix a <em>tint </em>of red with the hue of blue, and you'll get a slightly tinted purple in return.</p> \n<h4>Shade</h4> \n<p>You may recognize the term \"shade\" because it's used quite often to refer to light and dark versions of the same hue. But actually, a shade is technically the color that you get when you add black to any given hue. The various \"shades\" just refer to how much black you're adding.</p> \n<h4>Tint</h4> \n<p>A tint is the opposite of a shade, but people don't often distinguish between a color's shade and a color's tint. You get a different tint when you add white to a color. So, a color can have a range of both shades and tints.</p> \n<h4>Tone (or Saturation)</h4> \n<p>You can also add both white and black to a color to create a tone. Tone and saturation essentially mean the same thing, but most people will use saturation if they're talking about colors being created for digital images. Tone will be used more often for painting.</p> \n<p>With the basics covered, let's dive into something a little more complicated — like additive and subtractive color theory.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Additive &amp; Subtractive Color Theory</h2> \n<p>If you've ever played around with color on any computer program, you've probably seen a module that listed RGB or CMYK colors with some numbers next to the letters.</p> \n<p>Ever wondered what those letters mean?</p> \n<h3>CMYK</h3> \n<p>CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (Black). Those also happen to be the colors listed on your ink cartridges for your printer. That's no coincidence.</p> \n<p>CMYK is the <strong>subtractive color model</strong>. It's called that because you have to <em>subtract</em> colors to get to white. That means the opposite is true — the more colors you add, the closer you get to black. Confusing, right?</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/cmyk.png?width=320&amp;height=314&amp;name=cmyk.png\" width=\"320\" height=\"314\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Subtractive color diagram with CMYK in the center\" /></p> \n<p>Think about printing on a piece of paper. When you first put a sheet in the printer, you're typically printing on a white piece of paper. By adding color, you're blocking the white wavelengths from getting through.</p> \n<p>Then, let's say you were to put that printed piece of paper back into the printer, and print something on it again. You'll notice the areas that have been printed on twice will have colors closer to black.</p> \n<p>I find it easier to think about CMYK in terms of its corresponding numbers. CMYK works on a scale of 0 to 100. If C=100, M=100, Y=100, and K=100, you end up with black. But, if all four colors equal 0, you end up with true white.</p> \n<h3>RGB</h3> \n<p>RGB color models, on the other hand, are designed for electronic displays, including computers.</p> \n<p>RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue, and is based on the <strong>additive color model</strong> of light waves. This means, the more color you <em>add,</em> the closer you get to white. For computers, RGB is created using scales from 0 to 255. So, black would be R=0, G=0, and B=0. White would be R=255, G=255, and B=255.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/rgb-1.png?width=320&amp;height=304&amp;name=rgb-1.png\" width=\"320\" height=\"304\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"Additive color model with RGB in the center\" /></p> \n<p>When you're creating color on a computer, your color module will usually list both RGB and CMYK numbers. In practice, you can use either one to find colors, and the other color model will adjust accordingly.</p> \n<p>However, many web programs will only give you the RGB values or a HEX code (the code assigned to color for CSS and HTML). So, if you're designing digital images or for web design, RGB is probably your best bet for choosing colors.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>You can always convert the design to CMYK and make adjustments should you ever need it for printed materials.</p> \n<h2>The Meaning of Color</h2> \n<p>Along with varying visual impact, different colors also carry different emotional symbolism.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Red — typically associated with power, passion, or energy, and can help encourage action on your site</li> \n <li>Orange — joy and enthusiasm, making it a good choice for positive messaging</li> \n <li>Yellow — happiness and intellect, but be wary of overuse</li> \n <li>Green — often connected to growth or ambition, green can help give the sense that your brand is on the rise</li> \n <li>Blue — tranquility and confidence, depending on the shade — lighter shades provide a sense of peace, darker colors are more confident</li> \n <li>Purple — luxury or creativity, especially when used deliberately and sparingly on your site</li> \n <li>Black — power and mystery, and using this color can help create necessary negative space</li> \n <li>White — safety and innocence, making it a great choice to help streamline your site</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<p>Worth noting? Different audiences may perceive colors differently. The meanings listed above are common for North American audiences, but if your brand moves into other parts of the world, it’s a good idea to research how users will perceive particular colors. For example, while red typically symbolizes passion or power in the United States, it’s considered a color of mourning in South Africa.</p> \n<p>While it’s possible to create your website using a combination of every color under the rainbow, chances are the final product won’t look great. Thankfully, color experts and designers have identified seven common color schemes to help jumpstart your creative process.</p> \n<p>Let’s examine each in more detail.</p> \n<h3>1. Monochromatic</h3> \n<p>Monochromatic color schemes use a single color with varying shades and tints to produce a consistent look and feel. Although it lacks color contrast, it often ends up looking very clean and polished. It also allows you to easily change the darkness and lightness of your colors.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/monochromatic-color-wheel.png?width=285&amp;name=monochromatic-color-wheel.png\" alt=\"Color wheel with two monochromatic colors plotted along the red hue\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 285px;\" width=\"285\" /></p> \n<p>Monochromatic color schemes are often used for charts and graphs when creating high contrast isn't necessary.</p> \n<p>Check out all the monochromatic colors that fall under the red hue, a primary color.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/monochromatic.png\" alt=\"Red color scheme example with red hue, tint, tone, and shade\" /></p> \n<h3>2. Analogous</h3> \n<p>Analogous color schemes are formed by pairing one main color with the two colors directly next to it on the color wheel. You can also add two additional colors (which are found next to the two outside colors) if you want to use a five-color scheme instead of just three colors.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/analogous-color-wheel.png?width=287&amp;name=analogous-color-wheel.png\" alt=\"Color wheel with five analogous colors plotted between blue and yellow\" width=\"287\" style=\"width: 287px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>Analogous structures do not create themes with high contrasting colors, so they're typically used to create a softer, less contrasting design. For example, you could use an analogous structure to create a color scheme with autumn or spring colors.</p> \n<p>This color scheme is great for creating warmer (red, oranges, and yellows) or cooler (purples, blues, and greens) color palettes like the one below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/analogous.png\" alt=\"Analogous color scheme pallette\" /></p> \n<p>Analogous schemes are often used to design images rather than infographics or bar charts as all of the elements blend together nicely.</p> \n<h3>3. Complementary</h3> \n<p>You may have guessed it, but a complementary color scheme is based on the use of two colors directly across from each other on the color wheel and relevant tints of those colors.<a href=\"https://www.color-meanings.com/split-complementary-colors/\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/complementary-color-wheel.png?width=321&amp;name=complementary-color-wheel.png\" alt=\"color wheel showing complementary colors on opposite sides of the wheel\" width=\"321\" style=\"width: 321px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>The complementary color scheme provides the greatest amount of color contrast. Because of this, you should be careful about how you use the complementary colors in a scheme.</p> \n<p>It's best to use one color predominantly and use the second color as accents in your design. The complementary color scheme is also great for charts and graphs. High contrast helps you highlight important points and takeaways.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/complementary.png\" style=\"width: 640px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"complementary color sceme example with oranges and blues\" /></p> \n<h3>4. Split Complementary</h3> \n<p>A split complementary scheme includes one dominant color and the two colors directly adjacent to the dominant color's complement. This creates a more nuanced color palette than a complementary color scheme while still retaining the benefits of contrasting colors.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/compound-color-wheel.png?width=277&amp;name=compound-color-wheel.png\" alt=\"color wheel with split complementary color scheme values plotted\" width=\"277\" style=\"width: 277px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>The split complementary color scheme can be difficult to balance because unlike analogous or monochromatic color schemes, the colors used all provide contrast (similar to the complementary scheme).</p> \n<p>The positive and negative aspect of the split complementary color model is that you can use any two colors in the scheme and get great contrast ... but that also means it can also be tricky to find the right balance between the colors. As a result, you may end up playing around with this one a bit more to find the right combination of contrast.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/compound.png\" alt=\"split complementary color scheme example with pale blue, peach, blue, and red\" /></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">5. Triadic</h3> \n<p>Triadic color schemes offer high contrasting color schemes while retaining the same tone. Triadic color schemes are created by choosing three colors that are equally placed in lines around the color wheel.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/triadic-color-wheel.png?width=307&amp;name=triadic-color-wheel.png\" alt=\"Color wheel with three triadic colors plotted between purple, green, and orange\" width=\"307\" style=\"width: 307px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>Triad color schemes are useful for creating high contrast between each color in a design, but they can also seem overpowering if all of your colors are chosen on the same point in a line around the color wheel.</p> \n<p>To subdue some of your colors in a triadic scheme, you can choose one dominant color and use the others sparingly, or simply subdue the other two colors by choosing a softer tint.</p> \n<p>The triadic color scheme looks great in graphics like bar or pie charts because it offers the contrast you need to create comparisons.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Triadic.png\" alt=\"Color scheme example with purple, green, and orange triadic colors\" /></p> \n<h3>6. Square</h3> \n<p>The square color scheme uses four colors equidistant from each other on the color wheel to create a square or diamond shape. While this evenly-spaced color scheme provides substantial contrast to your design, it’s a good idea to select one dominant color rather than trying to balance all four.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.tigercolor.com/Images/Square.gif\" alt=\"Square color scheme\" width=\"265\" style=\"width: 265px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-theory-intro.htm\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Square color schemes are great for creating interest across your web designs. Not sure where to start? Pick your favorite color and work from there to see if this scheme suits your brand or website. It’s also a good idea to try square schemes against both black and white backgrounds to find the best fit.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://www.color-hex.com/palettes/79747.png\" alt=\"Capital Square Color Palette\"><a href=\"https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/79747\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Image Source</span></em></a></img></p> \n<h3>7. Rectangle</h3> \n<p>Also called the tetradic color scheme, the rectangle approach is similar to its square counterpart but offers a more subtle approach to color selection.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.color-meanings.com/wp-content/uploads/rectangular-tetradic-color-wheel.png\" alt=\"Rectangle color Schme\" width=\"332\" style=\"width: 332px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.color-meanings.com/rectangular-tetradic-color-schemes/\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Image Source</span></em></a></p> \n<p>As you can see in the diagram above, while the blue and red shades are quite bold, the green and orange on the other side of the rectangle are more muted, in turn helping the bolder shades stand out.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.color-hex.com/palettes/21774.png\" alt=\"tetradic Color Palette\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/21774\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>No matter which color scheme you choose, keep in mind what your graphic needs. If you need to create contrast, then choose a color scheme that gives you that. On the other hand, if you just need to find the best \"versions\" of certain colors, then play around with the monochromatic color scheme to find the perfect shades and tints.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Remember, if you build a color scheme with five colors, that doesn't mean you have to use all five. Sometimes just choosing two colors from a color scheme looks much better than cramming all five colors together in one graphic.</p> \n<h3>1. Prioritize the user experience, first.</h3> \n<p>Before you add color to your website, app, product, or packaging, get the basic design downpat in greyscale.</p> \n<p>This lets you focus on what matters most: User experience. Instead of focusing on the color scheme of your overall site or the hue of specific buttons or links, make sure everything works like it’s supposed to. Make sure links aren’t broken, product pages are up-to-date and email opt-ins are ready to go.</p> \n<p>Here’s why: Even the best-looking website or product with perfect color selection won’t be enough to keep visitors if they can’t find what they’re looking for.</p> \n<h3>2. Leverage natural inspiration.</h3> \n<p>Once your site operations are solid, it’s time to start selecting colors.</p> \n<p>Not sure what looks good? Take a look outside. Nature is the best example of colors that complement each other — from the green stems and bright blooms of flowering plants to azure skies and white clouds, you can’t go wrong pulling context from natural colors and combinations.</p> \n<h3>3. Set a mood for your color scheme.</h3> \n<p>With a few color choices in mind, consider the mood you want your color scheme to set. If passion and energy are your priorities, lean more toward red or brighter yellows. If you’re looking to create a feeling of peace or tranquility, trend toward lighter blues and greens.</p> \n<p>It’s also worth thinking negatively. This is because negative space — in either black or white — can help keep your design from feeling too cluttered with color.</p> \n<h3>4. Consider color context.</h3> \n<p>It’s also worth considering how colors are perceived in contrast.</p> \n<p>In the image below, the middle of each of the circles is the same size, shape, and color. The only thing that changes is the background color.</p> \n<p>Yet, the middle circles appear softer or brighter depending on the contrasting color behind it. You may even notice movement or depth changes just based on one color change.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2JkvG270JO78cadBYLbuHGT0yFABGnsqgWM_HDmuAUi4qYgHfuKdHKMRsIAgevHZ5pI54apNZzI2zyvZ525hG6aKDyLckgYHohwFMNxQbV50lVIRhPK2emQ65mI9QfSdg2qy5iHI\" width=\"624\" height=\"403\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Color Context with backgrounds\" /></p> \n<p>This is because the way in which we use two colors together changes how we perceive it. So, when you're choosing colors for your graphic designs, think about how much contrast you want throughout the design.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you were creating a simple bar chart, would you want a dark background with dark bars? Probably not. You'd most likely want to create a contrast between your bars and the background itself since you want your viewers to focus on the bars, not the background.</p> \n<h3>5. Refer to your color wheel.</h3> \n<p>Next, consider your color wheel and the schemes mentioned above. Select a few different color combinations using schemes such as monochrome, complementary, and triad to see what stands out.</p> \n<p>Here, the goal isn’t to find exactly the right colors on the first try and create the perfect design, but rather to get a sense of which scheme naturally resonates with your personal perception and the look of your site.</p> \n<p>You may also find that schemes you select that look good in theory don’t work with your site design. This is part of the process — trial and error will help you find the color palette that both highlights your content and improves the user experience.</p> \n<h3>6. Use the 60-30-10 rule.</h3> \n<p>Often used in home design, the 60-30-10 rule is also useful for website or app design. The idea here is to use three colors: A main color for 60% of your design, a secondary color for 30% of your design and an accent color for the last 10%.</p> \n<p>While these aren’t hard-and-fast numbers, they help give a sense of proportion and balance to your site by providing a primary color with secondary and accent colors that all work together.</p> \n<h3>7. Draft multiple designs.</h3> \n<p>Draft and apply multiple color designs to your website and see which one(s) stand out. Then, take a step back, wait a few days and check again to see if your favorites have changed.</p> \n<p>Here’s why: While many designers go in with a vision of what they want to see and what looks good, the finished product often differs on digital screens that physical color wheels — what seemed like a perfect complement or an ideal color pop may end up looking drab or dated.</p> \n<p>Don’t be afraid to draft, review, draft again and throw out what doesn’t work — color, like website creation, is a constantly-evolving art form.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Put simply? Practice makes perfect. The more you play with color and practice design, the better you get. No one creates their masterpiece the first time around.</p> \n<h2>Color Tools</h2> \n<p>There's been a lot of theory and practical information for actually understanding which colors go best together and why. But when it comes down to the actual task of choosing colors while you're designing, it's always a great idea to have tools to help you actually do the work quickly and easily.</p> \n<p>Luckily, there are a number of tools to help you find and choose colors for your designs.</p> \n<h3>Adobe Color</h3> \n<p>One of my favorite color tools to use while I'm designing anything — whether it's an infographic or just a pie chart — is Adobe Color (previously Adobe Kuler).</p> \n<p>This free online tool allows you to quickly build color schemes based on the color structures that were explained earlier in this post. Once you've chosen the colors in the scheme you'd like, you can copy and paste the HEX or RGB codes into whatever program you're using.</p> \n<p>It also features hundreds of premade color schemes for you to explore and use in your own designs. If you're an Adobe user, you can easily save your themes to your account.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot_2015-08-03_17.24.23.png?width=669&amp;height=312&amp;name=Screenshot_2015-08-03_17.24.23.png\" style=\"width: 669px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"669\" height=\"312\" alt=\"Color wheel on dashboard of Adobe Color\" /></p> \n<h3>Illustrator Color Guide</h3> \n<p>I spend a lot of time in Adobe Illustrator, and one of my most-used features is the color guide. The color guide allows you to choose one color, and it will automatically generate a five-color scheme for you. It will also give you a range of tints and shades for each color in the scheme.</p> \n<p>If you switch your main color, the color guide will switch the corresponding colors in that scheme. So if you've chosen a complementary color scheme with the main color of blue, once you switch your main color to red, the complementary color will also switch from orange to green.</p> \n<p>Like Adobe Color, the color guide has a number of preset modes to choose the kind of color scheme you want. This helps you pick the right color scheme style within the program you're already using.</p> \n<p>After you've created the color scheme that you want, you can save that scheme in the \"Color Themes\" module for you to use throughout your project or in the future.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Color_Guide.png?width=669&amp;height=352&amp;name=Color_Guide.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"352\" style=\"width: 669px;\" alt=\"Color options on Illustrator Color Guide tool\" /></p> \n<h3>Preset Color Guides</h3> \n<p>If you're not an Adobe user, you've probably used Microsoft Office products at least once. All of the Office products have preset colors that you can use and play around with to create color schemes. PowerPoint also has a number of color scheme presets that you can use to draw inspiration for your designs.</p> \n<p>Where the color schemes are located in PowerPoint will depend on which version you use, but once you find the color \"themes\" of your document, you can open up the preferences and locate the RGB and HEX codes for the colors used.</p> \n<p>You can then copy and paste those codes to be used in whatever program you're using to do your design work.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/powerpoint-themese.png?width=670&amp;height=406&amp;name=powerpoint-themese.png\" width=\"670\" height=\"406\" alt=\"Color swatches and meters in PowerPoint\" /></p> \n<h2>Finding the Right Color Scheme</h2> \n<p>There's a lot of theory in this post, I know. But when it comes to choosing colors, understanding the theory behind color can do wonders for how you actually use color. This can make creating branded visuals easy, especially when using design templates where you can customize colors.</p> \n<div>\n  &nbsp; \n</div> \n<div> \n <a class=\"cta_button\"
