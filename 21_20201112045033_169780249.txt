Or rather, the two streaming hubs are working on two shows with nearly identical titles. In Netflix&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s a comedy panel aftershow called <strong><em>Netflix&#8217;s Afterparty</em> </strong>hosted by David Spade. In Apple&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a scripted comedy series titled <strong><em>The Afterparty</em></strong> from <b>Chris Miller </b>and<b> Phil Lord</b> starring <strong>Tiffany Haddish</strong>, <b>Ben Schwartz</b>, and more.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645358\"></span></p>\n<p>Hollywood is a small world — often you&#8217;ll have different studios release movies with similar titles or similar premises, but it&#8217;s rare that you&#8217;ll get two streaming platforms working on two separate shows with similar titles at the same time. But that&#8217;s what happening with Netflix and Apple TV+, as Apple announced new details about <em>The Afterparty</em> on the same day Netflix announced the existence of <em>Netflix&#8217;s Afterparty</em> (see, this is already getting confusing).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Netflix Afterparty</em> </strong>is &#8220;a first-of-its-kind weekly comedy panel show where comedians, casts, and creators come to chat about the buzziest shows and films,&#8221; which has just been ordered by Netflix. The aftershow is hosted by David Spade, Fortune Feimster, and London Hughes, who will be joined by a different Netflix comedian every week to celebrate the latest Netflix movies or TV shows to hit the cultural zeitgeist. Interviews, sketches, and other segments will be included. Executive produced and showrun by Brad Wollack and Tom Brunelle, the 18-episode aftershow will premiere in 2021 on Sundays.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;This show will be a blast,&#8221; Spade said in a statement. &#8220;I’m looking forward to putting Netflix on the map. I am huge in Tanzania and they finally get me once a week. I got your letters guys and they’ve been answered.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But let&#8217;s move on to the more interesting <em>Afterparty</em>: Apple TV+&#8217;s new comedy from Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the duo behind <em>21 Jump Street</em> and <em>The LEGO Movie</em>. Apple TV+ has announced new casting for <em>The Afterparty,</em> a murder-mystery comedy series set at a high school reunion. The show&#8217;s full cast officially includes<b> Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Zoë Chao, Ben Schwartz, Ike Barinholtz, Ilana Glazer, Dave Franco, Jamie Demetriou </b>and <b>John Early</b>. The show will consist of eight episodes, each retelling the same night through a different character&#8217;s perspective, &#8220;each with its own unique visual format and film genre to match the teller’s personality.&#8221;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Miller will serve as creator, showrunner and executive producer of <em>The Aftermarty</em>, and Lord will executive produce through the pair&#8217;s banner, Lord Miller. Lord Miller’s VP of Television Aubrey Lee will serve as producer. The series will be produced for Apple by TriStar TV and Sony Pictures Television, where <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/phil-lord-chris-miller-sony-deal-spider-verse/\">Lord and Miller currently have an overall TV deal</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/two-afterparty-netflix-apple-tv/\">Netflix and Apple Both Have Shows With &#8216;Afterparty&#8217; in the Title, So Prepare to Endlessly Confuse Them</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8S0CkpAqqrY:-E5cmNsQdJ0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8S0CkpAqqrY:-E5cmNsQdJ0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8S0CkpAqqrY:-E5cmNsQdJ0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8S0CkpAqqrY:-E5cmNsQdJ0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=8S0CkpAqqrY:-E5cmNsQdJ0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8S0CkpAqqrY:-E5cmNsQdJ0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/8S0CkpAqqrY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:30:49 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Netflix-Apple-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c0871b1d3d458d84fb8fdb0d58105162","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-36-459_319f7373c9bf335a.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":15904,"destBytes":6846,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Netflix-Apple-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-36-459_319f7373c9bf335a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8S0CkpAqqrY:-E5cmNsQdJ0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn37@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-26-817_39479954677b6e0e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=8S0CkpAqqrY:-E5cmNsQdJ0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn86@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-26-685_499ec093c8733cfd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/8S0CkpAqqrY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn99@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-25-686_830320fcf2a27f7a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575083},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"‘Inside Pixar’ Trailer: New Disney+ Documentary Series Debuts This Week","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645347","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-645362 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Inside-Pixar-trailer-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Inside Pixar trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Inside-Pixar-trailer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Inside-Pixar-trailer-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Intellectually, we all know that many hours of work go into making our favorite movies and TV shows. But having a vague sense of that work in the back of your mind is much different than actually <em>seeing</em> the work being done by the artists and creatives who do it.</p>\n<p>For those who are looking for a bit more insight into how Pixar movies are made, a new documentary series called <em><strong>Inside Pixar</strong></em> is coming to pull back the curtain. The show is premiering on Disney+ this week, and the streamer just released the first trailer. Check it out below.<br />\n<span id=\"more-645347\"></span></p>\n<h2>Inside Pixar Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kdgpeBpPyiA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Inside Pixar</em> is made up of four collections that will be released individually, and each collection consists of five short stories that revolve around a different central theme. The first collection&#8217;s theme is &#8220;Inspired,&#8221; which explores &#8220;what sparks inspiration and the journey from idea to execution.&#8221; <strong>Kemp Powers</strong>, the co-writer and co-director of the studio&#8217;s upcoming feature film <em>Soul</em>, briefly gets the spotlight in that episode, so be sure to check that out before the movie is released directly onto Disney+ this Christmas.</p>\n<p>Filmmakers<strong> Erica Milsom</strong> and <strong>Tony Kaplan</strong> are directing this show, and they have plenty of experience in this arena: the two of them have been crafting making-of documentaries about animation for more than a decade, with lots of time devoted specifically to Pixar. They jointly directed a project called <em>The Pixar Shorts: A Short History</em> and have individually tackled making-of projects for <em>Finding Dory</em> and <em>Cars 3</em>. Earlier this year, Milsom even directed <em>Loop</em>, one of Pixar&#8217;s Sparkshorts and the first Pixar project to feature a non-verbal autistic character. (That short is streaming on Disney+ right now if you want to give it a watch.)</p>\n<p>Obviously, you should not expect this show to capture any juicy drama or serious creative clashes since it&#8217;s produced by Pixar and made specifically for Disney&#8217;s streaming service. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t be able to offer fascinating insights into how the sausage gets made.</p>\n<p>Here is the official synopsis for the upcoming docuseries:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Produced by Pixar Animation Studios, Inside Pixar is directed by Erica Milsom and Tony Kaplan, the series offers insights into the personal and cinematic stories that provide an inside look into the people, artistry, and culture of Pixar Animation Studios.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The first collection of <em>Inside Pixar</em> content will arrive on Disney+ this Friday, <strong>November 13</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Correction: A previous version of this article implied that a new collection of this series would be released each week, but the four total collections have not all been scheduled yet.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/inside-pixar-trailer/\">&#8216;Inside Pixar&#8217; Trailer: New Disney+

But in recent years, he&#8217;s enjoyed a resurgence thanks to Disney Television Animation&#8217;s aptly titled <strong><em>Mickey Mouse </em></strong>shorts. Combining a classic artistic aesthetic that calls back to the old animated shorts that played in theaters with modern cartoon sensibilities, the show has created plenty of fun adventures for Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy and Pluto. That stylish iteration of Mickey and friends is back in <strong><em>The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-wonderful-world-of-mickey-mouse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a series of animated shorts</a> coming to Disney+ just in time for Mickey&#8217;s birthday.</p>\n<p>Watch <em>The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse</em> trailer below for a sneak peek.<span id=\"more-645268\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lnw6DFZTYo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<blockquote><p>In “The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse,” it&#8217;s nothing but fun and excitement for Mickey and his best pals – Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy and Pluto &#8211; as they embark on their greatest adventures yet, navigating the curveballs of a wild and zany world where the magic of Disney makes the impossible possible. Each seven-minute short is filled with laugh-out-loud comedy, modern settings, timeless stories, new music and the unmistakable classic art style of the “Mickey Mouse” shorts. The series will include stories inspired by various lands at Disney parks and cameos by classic Disney heritage characters.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Disney theme park fanatics can probably guess which lands inspired the shorts teased in the trailer above. The one that stands out most obviously is all the futuristic technology that comes from Tomorrowland. There are lasers, and instant breakfast from some kind of contraption, and a lot of dangling hands on cables meant to help Mickey and his friends. It just looks like good, clean fun.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never watched <em>Mickey Mouse</em>, you should know that the animated series is probably the best thing Disney has done with the trademark character outside of the theme parks in a long time. Not only is the animation outstanding, but it&#8217;s pretty funny too. Since this new series of shorts is inspired by various lands at Disney theme parks, it might ease your pain at not being able to easily attend the most magical place on Earth until there&#8217;s a vaccine for the coronavirus.</p>\n<p><em>The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse</em> shorts are directed and executive produced by <strong>Paul Rudish</strong> with music composed by <strong>Christopher Willis</strong>, and they hit Disney+ on <strong>November 18, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-wonderful-world-of-mickey-mouse-trailer/\">&#8216;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&#8217;

Now&#8217;s your chance to see what you&#8217;ve been missing!</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645209\"></span></p>\n<p>Jeff Nichols was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/a-quiet-place-3/\">just announced as the director of the third <em>A Quiet Place</em> film</a>, which caused some people to ask: Who is Jeff Nichols? Nichols is not exactly a &#8220;name director,&#8221; but he&#8217;s turned out consistently great little genre movies. Like a kind of indie Spielberg, he crafts stories that blend action, sci-fi, and horror with a personal, down-to-earth element.</p>\n<p><em>Midnight Special</em> is Spielbergian in themes, like <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> crossed with <em>E.T.</em>, with a little Superman-like mythology thrown in for good measure. Alton (Jaeden Lieberher) is a young boy with special powers. This makes him a target of both the government and a religious cult that he grew up in. Trying to protect the boy from both factions, Alton&#8217;s father Roy (Michael Shannon) hits the road with Alton, with both the government and the cult in hot pursuit.</p>\n<p>This allows Shannon to play something he doesn&#8217;t get to play too often – a nice guy. Shannon, who is inherently intense and kind of intimidating, is often cast as malevolent figures. But here, he&#8217;s a protector. And the clumsy-yet-warm way he watches out for Alton is genuinely touching. There&#8217;s a moment where son tells father not to worry so much about him, to which Shannon replies: &#8220;I&#8217;m always going to worry about you; that&#8217;s the deal.&#8221; It&#8217;s such a sweet little scene, and Shannon sells it perfectly.</p>\n<p><em>Midnight Special</em> is a slow-burn. Yes, this is a chase movie, but don&#8217;t expect a lot of action – although there are more than a few effects-driven moments. But Nichols isn&#8217;t interested in spectacle. Instead, he cares about character – and mystery. The film plays its cards close to its chest, perhaps to a fault – it doesn&#8217;t quite stick the big landing, even though it comes close.</p>\n<p>Nichols surrounds Shannon and Lieberher with great performers. Joel Edgerton is great as someone helping father and son with their escape. A <em>very</em> young-looking Adam Driver turns up as an NSA employee who turns out to be not all bad. Kirsten Dunst arrives late in the film as Alton&#8217;s mom. The late, great Sam Shepard and character actor extraordinaire Bill Camp are members of the cult trying to track Alton down. Paul Sparks is an FBI Agent. All of these people turn in solid work here. It&#8217;s quite subtle, work, too – there aren&#8217;t big speechy, showy moments.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re ready to dive into Nichols&#8217; filmography, this is a great place to start. Then go seek out titles like <em>Take Shelter</em>, <em>Mud</em>, and the recent <em>Loving</em>. Afterward you&#8217;ll start to realize he&#8217;s one of the best unsung directors working right now.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-midnight-special/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8216;Midnight Special&#8217; is an Underrated Gem</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AHxQL8WBvzw:tgZc59ScNug:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AHxQL8WBvzw:tgZc59ScNug:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AHxQL8WBvzw:tgZc59ScNug:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AHxQL8WBvzw:tgZc59ScNug:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AHxQL8WBvzw:tgZc59ScNug:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AHxQL8WBvzw:tgZc59ScNug:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AHxQL8WBvzw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:00:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/quarantine-stream-midnight-special-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"b4b5f203b76dae182e4151d463bcb2f0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-22-791_296455d253bd429a.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":24814,"destBytes":14952,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/quarantine-stream-midnight-special-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-22-791_296455d253bd429a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AHxQL8WBvzw:tgZc59ScNug:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn80@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-25-751_7afc46b3626a90f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AHxQL8WBvzw:tgZc59ScNug:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn53@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-26-365_c26b86012ba47c0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AHxQL8WBvzw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn2@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-25-880_2db6a26bac9112ae.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575081},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"Superhero Bits: ‘Pennyworth’ Season 2 Trailer, Canceled ‘Daredevil’ 2003 Video Game Footage & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645340","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-645438 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/younghellboy-hiddenland-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Young Hellboy: The Hidden Land\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/younghellboy-hiddenland-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/younghellboy-hiddenland-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Want to read a new <strong><em>Young Hellboy</em></strong> miniseries?

Having just starred in and executive produced the recent <em>Enola Holmes</em>, Brown will now star in and executive produce <strong><em>Damsel</em></strong>, a fantasy flick from <em>28 Weeks Later</em> helmer <strong>Juan Carlos Fresnadillo</strong>. The story reportedly has Brown playing a princess who is set to be sacrificed to a dragon. You know, fun stuff for the whole family.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645372\"></span></p>\n<p>Multiple outlets are reporting that Millie Bobby Brown will star in <em>Damsel</em>, a new fantasy film for Netflix. Deadline reports &#8220;Brown will play Princess Elodie, who thinks she is marrying Prince Henry, only to find out that she is being sacrificed to a dragon.&#8221; Collider <a href=\"https://collider.com/millie-bobby-brown-damsel-netflix-new-movie/\">adds</a>: &#8220;the story follows a young princess who is married off to a rival kingdom and immediately finds herself in danger when it’s revealed that her new home has a nasty little secret — during the harvest season, the kingdom sacrifices their princesses to a hungry dragon,&#8221; and that Brown &#8220;will play Princess Elodi, whose innocence gives way to a fierce warrior spirit when she finds herself fighting a dragon that’s out to kill her.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is Brown&#8217;s second feature with Netflix. She recently starred in and produced <em>Enola Holmes</em>. And of course, Netflix also gave her her big break with <em>Stranger Things</em>. So it definitely makes sense that both Brown and Netflix are eager to stick together. <em>Stranger Things </em>season 4 is still in production, and beyond Netflix, Brown will next appear <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em>, the sequel to <em>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</em>, which was Brown&#8217;s feature debut.</p>\n<p>Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, director of <em>28 Weeks Later</em> and the upcoming Disney live-action remake of <em>The Sword in the Stone</em>, is attached to helm <em>Damsel</em>. Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum will produce while Brown will executive produce along with Dan Mazeau, Zack Roth, and Chris Castaldi. The script comes from Mazeau, who also wrote <em>Wrath of the Titans</em> and the long-delayed Chris Pratt vehicle <em>Cowboy Ninja Viking</em>.</p>\n<p>Brown is a good actress – there&#8217;s a reason she broke out so big with <em>Stranger Things</em>. I haven&#8217;t seen <em>Enola Holmes </em>yet, but I did see <em>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</em>, and while the movie itself was shockingly disappointing, her work in the flick was solid, if not exactly memorable. As for director Fresnadillo, I was a fan of <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, but his follow-up film, 2011&#8217;s <em>Intruders</em>, was rather terrible. Fingers crossed that <em>Damsel</em> turns out better! It&#8217;s also curious that Fresnadillo is attached to both this and <em>Sword and the Stone</em>, since both are fantasy tales.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/damsel-millie-bobby-brown/\">&#8216;Damsel&#8217;: Millie Bobby Brown Will Fight a Dragon in New Netflix Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fokU4bfNfQs:UI9KTTNnv0s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fokU4bfNfQs:UI9KTTNnv0s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fokU4bfNfQs:UI9KTTNnv0s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fokU4bfNfQs:UI9KTTNnv0s:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fokU4bfNfQs:UI9KTTNnv0s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fokU4bfNfQs:UI9KTTNnv0s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fokU4bfNfQs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 22:00:54 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dasmel-millie-bobby-brown-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"dee8004e069815bbcb241d465adcc9f4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-49-58-957_c1da0820293ba06a.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":26906,"destBytes":15568,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dasmel-millie-bobby-brown-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-49-58-957_c1da0820293ba06a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fokU4bfNfQs:UI9KTTNnv0s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn36@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-50-25-704_d74308a5b9c66a65.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fokU4bfNfQs:UI9KTTNnv0s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn35@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-779_4d6cbfb8bc71b2c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fokU4bfNfQs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-50-25-683_a30fd8ff3c22d372.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575084},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"David Fincher Signs a Four-Year Exclusive Deal With Netflix","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645383","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-netflix-deal.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645398\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-netflix-deal-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"david fincher netflix deal\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-netflix-deal-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-netflix-deal-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-netflix-deal-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-netflix-deal.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>David Fincher</strong> has had a pretty good relationship with Netflix. He served as executive producer on the Netflix shows <strong><em>Mindhunter </em></strong>and <strong><em>House of Cards</em></strong>, and when <em>Mindhunter</em> went on indefinite hold, the streaming service gave him the chance to make one of his dream projects, <strong><em>Mank</em></strong>. Now, Fincher says he&#8217;s signed a four-year exclusive deal with Netflix, which means any Fincher projects in the foreseeable future will be housed there.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645383\"></span></p>\n<p>According to Premiere, via <a href=\"https://theplaylist.net/david-fincher-netflix-exclusive-deal-20201111/?utm_source=dlvr.it&#38;utm_medium=twitter\">The Playlist</a>, David Fincher has signed a 4-year deal with Netflix, making the streaming giant his new home for a little while. &#8220;Yes, I have an exclusivity deal with [Netflix] for another four years,&#8221; Fincher said. &#8220;And depending on <em>Mank</em>’s reception, I’ll either go see them sheepishly asking them what I can do to redeem myself or take the attitude of the arrogant asshole who’ll require making other films in black and white. [Laughs] No, I’m here to deliver them ‘content’ — whatever it means— likely to bring them spectators, in my small sphere of influence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Playlist adds that the deal was made before <em>Mank</em>, and that it&#8217;s a &#8220;major&#8230;deal worth over nine-figures.&#8221; In the interview, Fincher added: &#8220;Now [because] I signed this Netflix deal it’s also because I’d like to work like Picasso painted, to try very different things, to try to break the shape or change the operating mode. I like the idea of having a body of work. And yes, I admit that it feels strange, after forty years in this profession, to only have ten films under my belt. Well, eleven, but ten that I can say are mine. Yes, objectively, it is a pretty terrifying observation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now we just have to wait and see what Fincher does next. This deal doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s going to be directing movies for Netflix for the next four years – he could likely just serve as an executive producer on projects, including TV shows. But it does mean that anything Fincher has cooking will be at Netflix, and seeing as movie theaters are in trouble right now, that&#8217;s sensible. Hopefully, there won&#8217;t be a long gap between directorial efforts, though – <em>Mank</em> is Fincher&#8217;s first feature film in six years, since 2014&#8217;s <em>Gone Girl</em>.</p>\n<p>And hey, if we&#8217;re lucky, this could mean there&#8217;s hope again for <em>Mindhunter</em> season 3. While the Fincher-produced show hasn&#8217;t exactly been canceled it is on hold, with the cast released from their contracts. &#8220;Listen, for the viewership that it had, it was a very expensive show,&#8221; Fincher said in an interview back in <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mindhunter-season-3-not-happening/\">October</a>. &#8220;We talked about, ‘Finish <em>Mank</em> and then see how you feel,’ but I honestly don’t think we’re going to be able to do it for less than I did season two. And on some level, you have to be realistic — dollars have to equal eyeballs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/david-fincher-netflix-deal/\">David Fincher Signs a Four-Year Exclusive Deal With Netflix</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=h2zDWpAgh3w:AjW9Be1wCdo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=h2zDWpAgh3w:AjW9Be1wCdo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=h2zDWpAgh3w:AjW9Be1wCdo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=h2zDWpAgh3w:AjW9Be1wCdo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=h2zDWpAgh3w:AjW9Be1wCdo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=h2zDWpAgh3w:AjW9Be1wCdo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/h2zDWpAgh3w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 20:00:38 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-netflix-deal-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"a11c3cd52b452c434f8c23ff7bf6e26c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn25@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-49-35-340_d6f6c8b1c19c1cb1.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":23967,"destBytes":12458,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-netflix-deal-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn25@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-49-35-340_d6f6c8b1c19c1cb1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=h2zDWpAgh3w:AjW9Be1wCdo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn92@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-50-25-714_ba2ef7c26c938c02.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=h2zDWpAgh3w:AjW9Be1wCdo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn75@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-25-804_c5a340e498f1c112.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/h2zDWpAgh3w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn19@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-25-672_1ea80a301fbec3f4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575081},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"David Fincher Says There Are Only Two Seasons For Movies: “Spandex Summer” and “Affliction Winter”","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645284","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645285\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-1-e1605110576806-700x354.jpg\" alt=\"david fincher on hollywood\" width=\"700\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-1-e1605110576806-700x354.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-1-e1605110576806-360x182.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-1-e1605110576806-768x388.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/david-fincher-1-e1605110576806.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>David Fincher</strong> is famous (or maybe infamous) for being brutally honest, and the <strong><em>Mank</em></strong> director is certainly not holding his tongue when it comes to Hollywood and the &#8220;Happy Meal&#8221; tentpole movies that have taken over the entertainment landscape. Though Fincher doesn&#8217;t name names, the filmmaker behind <em>The Social Network, Gone Girl</em>, and the upcoming Netflix drama <em>Mank</em> is not happy with how Hollywood has become so dominated by superhero franchises and remakes that the movie slate has diminished to &#8220;only two seasons for movies.&#8221; According to Fincher: &#8220;There’s &#8216;spandex summer&#8217; and there&#8217;s &#8216;affliction winter.'&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645284\"></span></p>\n<p>In a new interview with <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/david-fincher-interview-mank/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Total Film magazine</a>, David Fincher bluntly gave his opinion on the state of Hollywood in 2020: &#8220;Unless you’re making a tentpole movie that has a Happy Meal component to it, no one’s interested.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fincher is referring to the abundance of big-budget superhero blockbusters and franchise remakes that have come to dominate Hollywood over the past decade, which have fundamentally changed the Hollywood landscape. Not so long ago, mid-budget movies could survive and even become box office hits in the summer. Now, they&#8217;re likely to die before they even get to the big screen, with studios unwilling to take the risk on a film that doesn&#8217;t star a superhero or a recognizable IP.</p>\n<p>The way this has changed the theatrical release calendar grinded Fincher&#8217;s gears in particular, with the director lamenting that if films don&#8217;t fall in the category of tentpole or awards movie, they&#8217;re dumped:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Look, the only reason we have these kind of conversations is because of the lack of imagination on behalf of the people who have behaviourally modified the audience’s expectations. There’s really only two seasons for movies. There’s ‘spandex summer’ and there’s ‘affliction winter.’ You’re making your movie for one of two seasons. And if you miss, you’ll fall into one of those other two seasons, which are nominally dumping grounds. Does that make sense?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That makes it difficult for filmmakers behind mid-budget movies or ambitious dramas to get their projects greenlit by a studio, which is why Fincher, like so many other auteurs, found a home at Netflix. The streamer was the home of the television shows he worked on, <em>Mindhunter</em> and <em>House of Cards</em>, and it&#8217;s set to debut his new drama <em>Mank</em>, a sweeping critique of the Hollywood studio system shot in black-and-white and created to look and sound like it was made in the 1930s. It&#8217;s the kind of hard-to-market film that has made Netflix so enticing to filmmakers like Fincher, Martin Scorsese, and Guillermo del Toro. That, and the fact that once <em>Mank</em> launches on Netflix, it will live on the streamer indefinitely. Fincher added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s not particularly a smart business plan to make a love letter to another movie that’s on [rival streaming service] HBO Max…But, listen, if we only did the stuff that was smart, there’d probably only be Marvel and Star Wars and Jurassic Park movies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>But Netflix is playing it smart with <em>Mank</em>&#8216;s release: with a November release first in select theaters, then on the streaming platform in December, which lands the Gary Oldman-starring drama smack dab in the middle of awards season, during which the streamer will likely campaign hard to make <em>Mank</em> an Oscar frontrunner. Fincher knows it, joking, &#8220;I’m not really just a jaded fuck. I’m an informed, jaded fuck.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Mank</em> is scheduled to be released in a limited theatrical release on <strong>November 13, 2020</strong>, before beginning to stream on Netflix on <strong>December 4, 2020</strong>.

The script for the film, penned by<strong> Chris Fedak</strong>, has actually been kicking around for a while. At one point, <em>Big Bad Wolves</em> directors Navot Papushado &#38; Aharon Keshales were attached to helm. But now, Bay has ahold of it. While the latest news about Gyllenhaal possibly joining the cast says that the plot is under wraps, previous reports reveal that Fedak&#8217;s script is a remake of the 2005 Danish film <em>Ambulancen</em>, which followed two brothers who use an ambulance as their getaway vehicle following a robbery.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645421\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has the scoop about Jake Gyllenhaal being in talks to join Michael Bay&#8217;s <em>Ambulance</em>. Their report says the &#8220;film is the vein of the great action thrillers of the ’90s like <em>Speed</em> and Bay&#8217;s <em>Bad Boys</em>,&#8221; but adds that there are no plot details. But that&#8217;s not exactly true. Back in 2017, when it was announced that Navot Papushado &#38; Aharon Keshales were directing the project, Deadline actually had this synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A vet just back from Afghanistan is drawn by his brother into a bank robbery in downtown Los Angeles. When the robbery goes horribly wrong, the brothers take hostages and hijack an ambulance. As the situation escalates, old wounds reopen in the relationship between the brothers as they fight to survive what seems like an impossible situation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They also added that the script was a remake of the 2005 Danish film <em>Ambulancen </em>in which two brothers commit a robbery to pay for an operation for their dying mother. When they&#8217;re unable to use their original getaway car, the brothers hijack an ambulance and speed away – before realizing that a dying heart transplant patient and a hospital intern are both in the back of the vehicle. The brothers can either turn around to return the patient to the hospital and risk getting caught or keep on speeding away to safety.</p>\n<p>This definitely sounds ripe for some Bayhem – I can already picture the speeding ambulance smashing through shit in slow-motion while Bay&#8217;s camera spins all over the place. Gyllenhaal is a wonderful actor, and he&#8217;s always more interesting when he&#8217;s playing someone unhinged. So I&#8217;m imagining he&#8217;s playing one of the brothers in this scenario and the movie will require him to yell a lot as he drives the ambulance all over town.</p>\n<p>As for Bay, well&#8230;he has his moments. He can be quite toxic at times, and some of his films – like the recent Netflix title <em>6 Underground – </em>are often downright awful. But every once in a while he delivers and creates something special – see <em>The Rock</em> or <em>Pain and Gain</em>, for example. Will <em>Ambulance</em> fall into the latter category? We can only hope. There&#8217;s no studio attached to the pic yet, but Universal seems interested.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ambulance-jake-gyllenhaal/\">Michael Bay WIll Direct &#8216;Speed&#8217;-Like Action Movie &#8216;Ambulance&#8217; Starring Jake Gyllenhaal</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9uHrkooIiQY:rA5AVLdJvFg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9uHrkooIiQY:rA5AVLdJvFg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9uHrkooIiQY:rA5AVLdJvFg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9uHrkooIiQY:rA5AVLdJvFg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=9uHrkooIiQY:rA5AVLdJvFg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9uHrkooIiQY:rA5AVLdJvFg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/9uHrkooIiQY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 23:00:14 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ambulance-Jake-Gyllenhaal-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"5c2ef351821aadb10aeb111ee7834497","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn8@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-49-514_b22f2c9cc50f711f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":31746,"destBytes":20198,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Ambulance-Jake-Gyllenhaal-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn8@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-49-514_b22f2c9cc50f711f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9uHrkooIiQY:rA5AVLdJvFg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn41@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-26-779_61baf6378d4783e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=9uHrkooIiQY:rA5AVLdJvFg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn97@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-50-25-712_5cdbdaa271c54285.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/9uHrkooIiQY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn32@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-25-689_a77fe551eb4b11c1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575085},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"The 80 Greatest Shots in Disney Animation History [Part Two]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645223","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-645229 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/101-Dalmatians-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Greatest Shots in Disney Animation\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/101-Dalmatians.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/101-Dalmatians-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/the-greatest-shots-in-disney-animation-history\"><strong>The Greatest Shots in Disney Animation History</strong></a>, a limited series where Disney expert Josh Spiegel selects and ranks the defining moments in one of the greatest, most important, and most influential collections of films ever made.)</em></p>\n<p>This part of the ongoing list covers entries 70 through 61.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645223\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/lxL3Qj.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>70.<i> Melody Time</i>: Beset upon by a snake-like piano</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a brief time in the 1940s when the thought was that Disney would revisit </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fantasia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a follow-up film. Sadly, that wasn’t to be, though as the 1999 sequel </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fantasia 2000</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> notes, there are some pieces of music that were considered for that earlier follow-up.

The brief, black-backgrounded section is a fun, snazzy bit of animation with a particularly striking moment in which the protagonist (a bumblebee, naturally) faces down a bopping, bouncing keyboard that appears to be a snake ready to strike.

The political satire of Carroll’s work is visualized here as a group of talking animals runs around in a never-ending circle in the sand, as the tide rolls in and gets higher around their necks. Alice struggles to get out of the caucus race, the idea being that such pointless endeavors are impossible to escape from. (I will leave it to you to tie this to recent political events.) Anyway, it’s how simply and matter-of-factly the animators bring the caucus race to life that serves as a great table-setter for the madness to come.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/BNpWPN.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>68.<i> Make Mine Music</i>: A large opera singer</strong></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make Mine Music</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, like a few of the package films of the 1940s, isn’t full of truly incredible animation, though there are a number of remarkable sequences. One of the standouts in the 1946 film is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is all about&#8230;a whale who&#8230;well, you can figure it out. The whale in the story is inexplicably gifted with a booming operatic voice provided by Nelson Eddy, and the simple, delightful, ridiculous image of Willie the Whale standing tall at an opera house, in full costumed regalia, bowing to the crowd after an aria, is truly unforgettable. The story in which the shot occurs is both charming and a little haunting, but this specific shot is kind of hilarious.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/p8MA8X.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>67. <i>Wreck-It Ralph</i>: Ralph squeezing into the penthouse</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wreck-It Ralph just wants to be accepted by the fellow denizens of the Fix-It Felix, Jr. game. (Leave aside why on Earth the other characters in the game would treat Ralph like a second-class citizen, seeing as once he departs the game, it’s clear that there is literally no reason for anyone to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">play</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the damn thing without a bad guy around. I digress.) His first attempt to do so in this 2012 film comes when he tries to join the Nicelanders in the penthouse of the building he typically is tasked with attacking, but the building’s not designed for him, as this shot displays, with his lumbering accidentally knocking Fix-It Felix, Jr. out. John C. Reilly does a great job of vocalizing Ralph’s awkwardness in trying to fit in, but so too does a shot like this one.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/nxXv3R.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>66.<i> The Sword in the Stone</i>: A heartbroken squirrel</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Great shots of animation can often boil down to great character animation. Such is the case with this example from the 1963 adaptation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sword in the Stone</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The story of King Arthur is largely whittled down here to the story of his youth, leading up to when young Arthur — known as Wart — pulls the eponymous sword and proves his place as the once and future king. At one point in his studies with the wizard Merlin, Wart and Merlin turn into squirrels, leading to a strange little scene in which an actual female squirrel sees Wart and falls for him fast. This, of course, poses a problem since Wart isn’t a squirrel. The problem is visualized when he turns back into a human, and the squirrel is left heartbroken. The scene doesn’t go much further than that, but the visual representation of her sadness is surprisingly affecting and the most memorable part of the film.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/k8Kpzr.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>65.<i> The Fox and the Hound</i>: Tod and Copper go their separate ways</strong></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Fox and the Hound</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is not often thought of as one of the great Disney animated films, and arguably for good reason. It was a film with a checkered history — its production was ankled when animator Don Bluth (yes, that Don Bluth) walked out of the studio with a group of animators to start a rival studio. The final film bears the mark of a fractured story, but it does have some remarkably intense sequences, such as the climax, in which a vicious bear attempts to kill off the title characters. Eventually, Tod the fox comes to the aid of his old ex-friend Copper the hound dog, a favor the dog returns when his master tries to kill Tod at point-blank range. After Tod’s master lowers his weapon, the two animals realize it’s time to say farewell. They give each other one last look, a nod of respect that signals the full conclusion of their friendship. It’s bittersweet and heavy with emotion, one of the few moments where the film reaches its full potential.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/wV8ZVR.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>64.<i> Ralph Breaks the Internet</i>: Ralph faces off against himself</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wreck-It Ralph</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had a villainous tweak on an old-school Disney character, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ralph Breaks the Internet</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> had something entirely different: a bad guy that is eventually visualized as a giant version of Wreck-It Ralph himself. The 2018 sequel is largely about how Ralph has to accept the limitations of his friendship with Vanellope Von Schweetz, but that’s only after he has to face off against a constantly expanding virus that he unleashed within the confines of the World Wide Web. The climax features Ralph against the virus, which is a giant-sized Ralph made up of duplicate versions of the good bad guy. Though the finale’s emotional oomph isn’t quite present, the visual representation of toxic masculinity is kind of stunning to behold.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/6XyPQl.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>63.<i> 101 Dalmatians</i>: Dalmatian puppies watching TV</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">101 Dalmatians</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Disney animated features weren’t at all modern. Because these stories were set in the past, they took place in a time when modern inventions weren’t even a wisp of a notion in a character’s head. The 1961 feature changed all that, with its characters interacting with cars, modern fashion, and one lead even working as a commercial jingle artist. One of the film’s most memorable images, both a reflection of the modernity of the story and of the technology that enabled Disney animators to animate a hundred dalmatians, is of the doggos watching TV. Thanks to a process known as Xerography, Disney animators could transfer their hand-drawn work onto animation cels without inking and painting, making shots like this possible. It was a sign of change to come, and an indelible moment.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/OMkrRG.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>62.<i> Lady and the Tramp</i>: Lady watches Tramp defend her honor</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the eponymous pooches of the 1955 romance first meet, it’s under mildly acrimonious circumstances. Lady is grappling with no longer being the most important part of her owners’ lives, now that they have a baby. The Tramp, for reasons unknown, is fully aware of what happens to a dog when a baby arrives, and tries to warn her but she doesn’t listen. Soon enough, thanks to a truly awful petsitter, Lady is muzzled and running loose through the city, about to be attacked by larger, more vicious dogs before the Tramp returns to rescue her. Before the two share a plate of pasta, we get this visceral fight, visualized beautifully as Lady, peering out from trash cans with muzzle atop her snout, watches the silhouette of Tramp coming to her aid. The love story starts here.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://j.gifs.com/nxXv1E.gif\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>61.<i> 101 Dalmatians</i>: The Twilight Bark</strong></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">101 Dalmatians</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a very heavily pro-dog film, even though there are other animals (including a friendly cat) in the mix. Once the litter of puppies sired by Pongo and birthed by Perdita are dognapped by the ruthless Cruella De Vil, the parents waste no time in attempting to get their brood back. Of course, they live in London, and their puppies could be anywhere in the United Kingdom at this point. What do they do to figure out the pups’ whereabouts? They call upon the Twilight Bark, which is basically a phone tree for dogs. The result is a cacophony of barks, woofs, howls, and more, visualized in this shot by all of the frustrated home owners who have to listen to the caterwauling. The domino effect of the Twilight Bark is captured so charmingly — it’s a great visual gag.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p>Part three of this series will run tomorrow.

The indie distributor has set the release date for Lee Isaac Chung&#8217;s critically acclaimed <em>Minari</em> for an awards-qualifying run in New York and Los Angeles this December before a wider rollout beginning in February 2021. This makes <em>Minari</em>, which won the Audience and Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, a surefire Oscar contender and star <strong>Steven Yeun</strong> a potential Best Actor nominee — which would make him the first Asian-American actor to be nominated for the category in history.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645332\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/awards/steven-yeun-minari-release-date-1234827448/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> reports that the <em>Minari</em> release date has been set for <strong>December 11, 2020</strong> in select theaters in New York and Los Angeles (whichever theaters are open, that is) before an expansion beginning on <strong>February 12, 2021</strong>. This limited theatrical awards season release means that A24 is throwing its full support behind <em>Minari</em>&#8216;s chances at the 2021 Oscars, which are currently scheduled for March 15, 2021.</p>\n<p>Written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung, <em>Minari</em> follows a Korean-American family in the 1980s as they relocate from California to a small Arkansas farm in hopes of making a new life for themselves. The family patriarch Jacob (Yeun) enthusiastically dives into farming the land, but finds himself out of his depth, as his wife and children struggle with their new rural home. Yeri Han, Alan Kim, Noel Kate Cho, and Yuh-Jung Youn also star in the film, which was met with rave reviews when it debuted at Sundance.</p>\n<p>But the release date had been noticeably absent <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/minari-trailer/\">from the trailer</a> that A24 debuted in September, putting into question whether the best-reviewed film of 2020 would even get to come out this year. This limited theatrical run in December means that most of us won&#8217;t be able to see it — theaters remain closed in New York and most fo Los Angeles — but the trade-off is that this could get Steven Yeun a historic Oscar nomination. Yeun has been receiving raves for his performance since the Sundance premiere, with the <em>Burning</em> actor named one of the frontrunners for the category. If nominated, he would be the first Asian-American actor nominated for lead actor, though other actors of Asian descent have earned the honor, such as Yul Brynner (<em>The King and I</em>) and Ben Kingsley (<em>Gandhi</em> and <em>House of Sand and Fog</em>). Variety notes that Yeri Han is also a dark horse for Best Actress, while Alan S. Kim, Will Patton and Yuh-Jung Youn have a fighting chance for the supporting categories.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Minari</em>, which opens in select theaters in New York and Los Angeles on <strong>December 11, 2020</strong> before expanding on <strong>February 12, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A tender and sweeping story about what roots us, Minari follows a Korean-American family that moves to a tiny Arkansas farm in search of their own American Dream. The family home changes completely with the arrival of their sly, foul-mouthed, but incredibly loving grandmother. Amidst the instability and challenges of this new life in the rugged Ozarks, Minari shows the undeniable resilience of family and what really makes a home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/minari-release-awards-season-steven-yeun/\">&#8216;Minari&#8217; Sets Awards Season Limited Theatrical Release, Priming Steven Yeun to Be Potential First Asian-American Best Actor Nominee</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ibfcjCSzlsI:i8NB3sSECR8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ibfcjCSzlsI:i8NB3sSECR8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ibfcjCSzlsI:i8NB3sSECR8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ibfcjCSzlsI:i8NB3sSECR8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ibfcjCSzlsI:i8NB3sSECR8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ibfcjCSzlsI:i8NB3sSECR8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ibfcjCSzlsI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 01:00:45 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/minari-1-e1605115664637-700x351.jpg","linkMd5":"345b65a35315aa585e8937ea387b5f43","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-49-36-834_c575fb7611768d57.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":351,"sourceBytes":41616,"destBytes":28166,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/minari-1-e1605115664637-700x351.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-49-36-834_c575fb7611768d57.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ibfcjCSzlsI:i8NB3sSECR8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn85@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-25-773_9c4031c4027d2840.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ibfcjCSzlsI:i8NB3sSECR8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn56@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-712_4ef95e10063ba4ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ibfcjCSzlsI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn90@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-25-578_46cec633c5775565.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575080},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"‘Another Round’ Trailer: Mads Mikkelsen Gets Drunk for Science","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645387","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645397\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/another-round-e1605123160343-700x334.jpg\" alt=\"another round trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/another-round-e1605123160343-700x334.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/another-round-e1605123160343-360x172.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/another-round-e1605123160343-768x366.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/another-round-e1605123160343.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>During uncertain times like this, it&#8217;s tempting to stay drunk all the time.

But emboldened by their newfound confidence, they take the experiment too far, and it begins to affect their personal and professional lives.</p>\n<p>Vinterberg and Lindholn, who both wrote the acclaimed 2012 Danish film <em>The Hunt</em>, which starred Mikkelsen as a teacher accused of sexually abusing a student, are typically known for more serious fare — Vinterberg in particular has helmed prestige flicks like <em>Far From the Madding Crowd</em> and a submarine disaster thriller called <em>The Command</em>. But <em>Another Round</em> looks like it has a touch of dry Danish comedy, with some offbeat humor and jokes sprinkled throughout a sobering drama about, well, being sober.</p>\n<p><em>Another Round</em> made the 2020 Cannes Film Festival Official Selection and world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it was a hit with critics, who raved about Mikkelsen&#8217;s performance in particular. Mikkelsen, who is best known Stateside for his roles in NBC&#8217;s <em>Hannibal</em>, Marvel&#8217;s <em>Doctor Strange</em>, and <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em>, leads a cast that includes <strong>Thomas Bo Larsen</strong>, <strong>Lars Ranthe</strong>, <strong>Magnus Millang</strong>, <strong>Maria Bonnevie</strong>, <strong>Susse Wold</strong>, and <strong>Helene Reingaard Neumann</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Another Round</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Four friends, all teachers at various stages of middle age, are stuck in a rut. Unable to share their passions either at school or at home, they embark on an audacious experiment from an obscure philosopher: to see if a constant level of alcohol in their blood will help them find greater freedom and happiness. At first they each find a new-found zest, but as the gang pushes their experiment further, issues that have been simmering for years come to a head and the men are faced with a choice: reckon with their behavior or continue on the same course.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Another Round</em> hits theaters <strong>December 4, 2020</strong> and arrives on digital <strong>December 18, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/another-round-trailer-official/\">&#8216;Another Round&#8217; Trailer: Mads Mikkelsen Gets Drunk for Science</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nNcvzERewEY:aXGkVJLadtA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nNcvzERewEY:aXGkVJLadtA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nNcvzERewEY:aXGkVJLadtA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nNcvzERewEY:aXGkVJLadtA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=nNcvzERewEY:aXGkVJLadtA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nNcvzERewEY:aXGkVJLadtA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/nNcvzERewEY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 00:30:19 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/another-round-e1605123160343-700x334.jpg","linkMd5":"4d355be23555ddf55d0684fd53504656","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-11-610_b8f85f947f05282c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":334,"sourceBytes":54967,"destBytes":41498,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/another-round-e1605123160343-700x334.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-11-610_b8f85f947f05282c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nNcvzERewEY:aXGkVJLadtA:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=nNcvzERewEY:aXGkVJLadtA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/nNcvzERewEY":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575082},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"Lucasfilm Defends Baby Yoda’s Unbridled Hunger for Eggs in Last Week’s ‘The Mandalorian’ Episode","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645277","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-645333 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-child-eatingeggs-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Yoda Eating Eggs\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-child-eatingeggs.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-child-eatingeggs-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Last week&#8217;s episode of <strong><em>The Mandalorian</em></strong> featured plenty of antics from the show&#8217;s breakout character, the Child (or Baby Yoda, as the internet likes to call him). However, some fans didn&#8217;t find the Child&#8217;s hunger for an alien frog woman&#8217;s eggs to be all that entertaining. There has been some outcry from those finding the sneaky snacking of the Child to be a little careless when it comes to the life that they represent. After all, these are an alien frog woman&#8217;s unfertilized eggs that she&#8217;s desperately trying to get to her husband.</p>\n<p>Lucasfilm has responded to the complaints that have been registered online about Baby Yoda eating eggs, but the answer doesn&#8217;t exactly make the situation much more forgivable. But it depends on how you feel about a presumably unknowing child satisfying his hunger for eggs. <span id=\"more-645277\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/flypaper_brain/status/1325922769561907203\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One complaint</a> about The Child&#8217;s appetite expressed (via <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-eating-controversy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Entertainment Weekly</a>): &#8220;I&#8217;m a mom. It&#8217;s not funny at all to hear mama frog lady go into great detail about how important and beloved her eggs are to her and have to watch them get eaten on three separate occasions for shits and giggles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another fan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oceanselene/status/1325913714445447168\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on Twitter added</a>, &#8220;T<span class=\"css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0\">he frog lady was very adamant about the fact that her eggs were important to her, and that it was her last and only chance to have kids, so it&#8217;s actually closer to fucking up someone&#8217;s <span class=\"ILfuVd\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">In Vitro Fertilization,</span></span> which would be incredibly upsetting for a wannabe mom. It&#8217;s not funny.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what Lucasfilm&#8217;s creative art manager <strong>Phil Szostak</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilSzostak/status/1325913062826651648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said on Twitter</a> about their intentions with The Child&#8217;s egg appetite:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For the record, Chapter 10 of #TheMandalorian makes it clear that the Frog Lady’s eggs are unfertilized, like the chicken eggs many of us enjoy. But obviously, chickens aren’t sentient beings and the Child eating the eggs is intentionally disturbing, for comedic effect. Fans of horror know that disturbing things make some of us laugh and some of us squirm, or both. Your mileage may vary.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>What the complaints probably boil down to is that for some it can be rather upsetting to see a creature that seems so innocent do something that is rather heinous. But at the same time, it&#8217;s not as if Mando didn&#8217;t try several times to keep the kid away from her eggs. Just like any child, this one doesn&#8217;t listen very well when there&#8217;s something they really want. Though the alien frog woman is sentient, to a child, the eggs are just food. He&#8217;s not being malicious, but just mischievous, and he probably doesn&#8217;t fully understand the gravity of the situation. He may be in tune with the Force, but he clearly has a lot to learn about civilization. After all, he tried to choke out Cara Dune when he mistakenly thought she was threatening Mando.</p>\n<p>Everyone is going to react to something differently based on their personal experiences. These complaints are valid when taken from another perspective, and this is where it might help Lucasfilm to have more of a female perspective in certain situations. Then again, Kathleen Kennedy is president of Lucasfilm, and she has two children with her husband Frank Marshall. Surely if she thought there was some kind of issue there, then she would have flagged it. Again, that doesn&#8217;t make these complaints invalid, they just come from a different perspective.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s important to remember that fictional characters aren&#8217;t created to be perfect either. Some of the complaints registered online these days think that any character&#8217;s expression of a controversial issue or inappropriate behavior means that the creators are condoning it. That&#8217;s simply not the case. That&#8217;s where Lucasfilm&#8217;s reference to horror comes into play, because plenty of people have experienced horrific things that have played out in many movies across the genre, but the intention of portraying those events is to convey fear and discomfort. For some it&#8217;s disturbing, for others it&#8217;s a entertaining adrenaline rush.</p>\n<p>The good news is there might be the slightest sliver of hope for potential redemption. It has been theorized that maybe the Child is keeping some of the eggs safe because the Force has allowed him to foresee that the eggs will be threatened in some way, possibly with the tank containing them being destroyed. But considering Lucasfilm&#8217;s explanation of the matter, that seems less likely. Plus, if that were the case, there&#8217;d be no real reason to sneak around to snarf them down.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll just have to chalk this up to nature. Not all creatures are so civilized as we, and animals eat other animals out in the wild all the time. Clearly the Child still has some more primitive impulses that he needs to be taught how to keep in check.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lucasfilm-responds-to-backlash-over-baby-yoda-eating-eggs-in-the-mandalorian/\">Lucasfilm Defends Baby Yoda&#8217;s Unbridled Hunger for Eggs in Last Week&#8217;s &#8216;The Mandalorian&#8217; Episode</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wF7LfoLu5ZQ:IUt_DhFDDJs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wF7LfoLu5ZQ:IUt_DhFDDJs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wF7LfoLu5ZQ:IUt_DhFDDJs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wF7LfoLu5ZQ:IUt_DhFDDJs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=wF7LfoLu5ZQ:IUt_DhFDDJs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wF7LfoLu5ZQ:IUt_DhFDDJs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/wF7LfoLu5ZQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 20:30:58 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-child-eatingeggs-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c1d9d1d8978da1910171f5c820b31aa6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-49-41-416_2a2d7a50545dfa74.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":21993,"destBytes":12406,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-child-eatingeggs-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn36@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-49-41-416_2a2d7a50545dfa74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wF7LfoLu5ZQ:IUt_DhFDDJs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn4@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-25-695_53de801e9063e1bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=wF7LfoLu5ZQ:IUt_DhFDDJs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/wF7LfoLu5ZQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn98@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-26-637_ed526957c8202c13.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575082},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"‘Halo’ TV Series Recasts Cortana, Hires Original Voice Actress from the Games","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645430","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-645444 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cortana-actress-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Cortana actress\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cortana-actress.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cortana-actress-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Assuming Showtime&#8217;s television adaptation of <em><strong>Halo</strong></em> ever actually makes it to the small screen (and considering this property&#8217;s rocky path through Hollywood, that is not a guarantee), the show will be porting over one of the game&#8217;s most famous voices into the world of the series. <em>Halo</em> has hired a new – um, old – well, not <em>old</em>, but a <em>prior</em> – Cortana actress during a recent recasting session. Get the details below.<span id=\"more-645430\"></span></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-tv-series-recasts-cortana-with-original-voice-actor\">IGN</a>, actress <strong>Jen Taylor</strong>, who has lent her velvety voice to the artificial intelligence unit Cortana in every single mainline <em>Halo</em> video game, has been hired to once again lend that distinctive voice to the A.I. character in Showtime&#8217;s upcoming live-action series. Taylor replaces actress <strong>Natascha McElhone</strong> (<em>The Truman Show</em>, <em>Ronin</em>), who was previously hired to voice Cortana and portray a live-action character named Dr. Catherine Halsey, who is Cortana&#8217;s creator in the Halo universe.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an interesting detail: IGN reports that &#8220;due to scheduling difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, McElhone can no longer complete her work as Cortana – but will continue in the role of Halsey.&#8221; Major Hollywood productions like this have the resources to transport voice recording equipment anywhere in the world and capture actors performing remotely, sometimes even having the actors run the equipment themselves. You&#8217;d think that a global pandemic, during which many actors are being even more careful about the jobs they take, would make it easier for someone to do voiceover work, not more difficult. But perhaps the scheduling difficulties meant that McElhone had another acting job that has now suddenly sprang back into first position, and she wouldn&#8217;t be able to give Cortana her full attention.</p>\n<p>In the games, Cortana is essentially a holographic character. As of now, it&#8217;s still unclear whether Taylor will do performance capture work so Cortana will look like her, or if she&#8217;ll just provide the character with her voice. Previously, Taylor has voiced Cortana and Dr. Catherine Halsey across several games, including <em>Halo</em>, <em>Halo 2</em>, <em>Halo 3</em>, <em>Halo: Reach</em>, <em>Halo 4</em>, <em>Halo 5: Guardians</em>, and the upcoming <em>Halo Infinite</em>, as well as the TV miniseries <em>Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn</em> and <em>Halo: The Fall of Reach</em>. She also provided the voice for Microsoft&#8217;s virtual assistant on Windows devices, which is named Cortana after the <em>Halo</em> character.</p>\n<p>Showtime has been working on bringing this game to the small screen for years, describing the show as &#8220;an epic 26th-century conflict between humanity and an alien threat known as the Covenant. Halo will weave deeply drawn personal stories with action, adventure and a richly imagined vision of the future.&#8221; It does not have a premiere date yet.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/halo-cortana-actress/\">&#8216;Halo&#8217; TV Series Recasts Cortana, Hires Original Voice Actress from the Games</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_xShNWbhMEE:HAkzVPKGiV4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_xShNWbhMEE:HAkzVPKGiV4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_xShNWbhMEE:HAkzVPKGiV4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_xShNWbhMEE:HAkzVPKGiV4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_xShNWbhMEE:HAkzVPKGiV4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_xShNWbhMEE:HAkzVPKGiV4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_xShNWbhMEE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 23:30:12 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cortana-actress-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"9dd0b914e48331b5a62e858f1fbf7ac2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn42@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-35-318_f6e2dad718753a88.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":30314,"destBytes":18662,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Cortana-actress-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn42@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-49-35-318_f6e2dad718753a88.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_xShNWbhMEE:HAkzVPKGiV4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn2@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_af69bd1c0ca5ee1e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_xShNWbhMEE:HAkzVPKGiV4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn11@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-25-699_b98f19e4d4d67a2c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_xShNWbhMEE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-25-659_c562ce3ff79068ca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575082},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"Christmas Comedy ‘Godmothered’ Will Debut Exclusively on Disney+ in December","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645331","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-release.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645348\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-release-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"godmothered release\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-release-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-release-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-release-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-release.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Godmothered</em></strong>, a new Disney movie that started filming right before the coronavirus lockdowns, is done and headed to Disney+ in time for Christmas.

Finding a mislaid letter from a 10-year-old girl in distress, Eleanor tracks her down and discovers that the girl, Mackenzie, is now a 40-year-old single mom (Isla Fisher) working at a news station in Boston. Having lost her husband several years earlier, Mackenzie has all but given up on the idea of “Happily Ever After,” but Eleanor is bound and determined to give Mackenzie a happiness makeover, whether she likes it or not.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a fairly cute premise, and the holiday setting will no doubt appeal to people looking for something holiday-themed to watch this December, especially since the holiday theatrical landscape is all but dead at this point. When the project was first announced back in 2019 there was some speculation that it was going to be a spin-off of Disney&#8217;s live-action <em>Cinderella</em> reboot. But it quickly became apparent that that wasn&#8217;t the case at all. Instead, this seems to be more in the same vein as <em>Enchanted</em>.</p>\n<p>In addition to Bell and Fisher, the cast includes Santiago Cabrera, Mary Elizabeth Ellis, Jane Curtin, June Squibb, Jillian Shea Spaeder, Willa Skye, Artemis Pebdani, Utkarsh Ambudkar, and Stephnie Weir. Sharon Maguire (<em>Bridget Jones&#8217;s Diary</em>) directs a script from Kari Granlund and Melissa Stack. Justin Springer (<em>Dumbo</em>, <em>TRON: Legacy</em>) produced, with executive producers including Diane L. Sabatini (<em>Lady and the Tramp</em>), Tom Pollock (<em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>), Ivan Reitman (<em>Ghostbusters</em>), and Amie Karp (<em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>).</p>\n<p>Since this thing is in the can and arriving very, very soon, you can expect Disney+ to release a trailer imminently.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/godmothered-release/\">Christmas Comedy &#8216;Godmothered&#8217; Will Debut Exclusively on Disney+ in December</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Mfx2DYBr56Q:_5l50_SDczw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Mfx2DYBr56Q:_5l50_SDczw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Mfx2DYBr56Q:_5l50_SDczw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Mfx2DYBr56Q:_5l50_SDczw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Mfx2DYBr56Q:_5l50_SDczw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Mfx2DYBr56Q:_5l50_SDczw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Mfx2DYBr56Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 21:00:39 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-release-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"3e5d49608b1dfb9206a31f2231d02133","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn13@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-49-41-394_200881761274c235.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":34684,"destBytes":21094,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/godmothered-release-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn13@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-49-41-394_200881761274c235.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Mfx2DYBr56Q:_5l50_SDczw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn46@2020_2/2020/11/12/04-50-26-820_05b982683fab4b90.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Mfx2DYBr56Q:_5l50_SDczw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn89@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-26-690_36fa020de2b4bb1b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Mfx2DYBr56Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn29@2020_3/2020/11/12/04-50-26-611_4b63971d1ef53ecb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575086},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"‘The Mystery of D.B.

Where he landed, no one knows: he was never seen or heard from again. But he certainly landed in the annals of folkloric history as a man who envisioned an audacious robbery and actually got away with it. He was seen by many as an aspirational figure, and he actually inspired a spate of similar hijackings soon afterward. Cooper is a major figure in American folklore, inspiring songs, books, and television episodes to be written about what may have happened to him.</p>\n<p>Cooper&#8217;s true identity remains a mystery, but an upcoming HBO documentary called <em><strong>The Mystery of D.B. Cooper</strong> </em>might change that&#8230;or it might just further contribute to his legendary status. Check out the trailer below.<span id=\"more-645198\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Mystery of D.B.

I like the occasional murder-related documentary too, but amid all of the fascination we all have with death, it&#8217;s sometimes nice to see something a bit lighter but which still conjures that incredulous, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe what I&#8217;m watching&#8221; feeling. (HBO Max&#8217;s recent documentary <em>Class Action Park</em> is a perfect example of what I mean.)</p>\n<p>Emmy-nominated filmmaker <strong>John Dower</strong> (<em>Thrilla in Manila</em>, <em>My Scientology Movie</em>) wrote and directed <em>The Mystery of D.B. Cooper</em>, which has a runtime of 1 hour and 27 minutes. Here is the official description:</p>\n<blockquote><p>THE MYSTERY OF D.B. COOPER<strong> </strong>brings to life the stories of four individuals fervently believed by their family and friends to be the mystery man who hijacked a 727 flying out of Portland, OR, traded the passengers&#8217; lives for $200,000 and four parachutes, leapt from 10,000 feet over some of Washington State&#8217;s roughest terrain, and was never heard from again. Almost 50 years later, the case continues to confound the FBI and inspire wild speculation as it remains the only unsolved airplane hijacking in United States history.</p>\n<p>Drawing from a combination of recreated and archival footage, as well as exclusive interviews with those most connected to the infamous case and its likeliest culprits, this edge-of-your-seat documentary also explores how the heist inspired copycat hijackings and elevated Cooper to &#8220;legend&#8221; status. THE MYSTERY OF D.B. COOPER paints a dynamic portrait of a fabled fugitive whose unparalleled story became folklore.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Mystery of D.B.

Cast members of the film in question come forward and say, &#8220;I shot a lot of takes!&#8221; We report it. Fincher rolls his eyes. Then we move on, only to revisit the story again whenever Fincher gets around to making another movie. After taking a hiatus from feature films, Fincher is back this year with <strong><em>Mank</em></strong>, and sure enough, stories are starting to trickle in about Fincher and all his damn scene takes.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645352\"></span></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been here before. Over the summer, I wrote up a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mank-takes/\">story</a> about <em>Mank</em> cast member <strong>Amanda Seyfried</strong> claiming that one of her scenes required something like 200 takes and about an entire week to film. &#8220;I was part of scenes with tons of people in it and we would do it for an entire week,&#8221; Seyfried said. &#8220;I can’t tell you how many takes we did, but I would guess 200, maybe I could be wrong and could be way off. Um, I could be underestimating by five days of one scene when I didn’t have one line… &#8216;You think I can just relax?&#8217; No, because there are probably about nine or 10 different camera angles that had been on me at one point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To be clear: there&#8217;s a good chance Seyfried is exaggerating a bit. But multiple Fincher takes have become a gold standard at this point. And a new issue of <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/mank-cast-on-working-with-david-fincher-it-does-feel-like-groundhog-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Total Film magazine</a> has more people involved with <em>Mank</em> talking about Fincher and his many, many, many takes. &#8220;We did take after take after take after take,&#8221; said <strong>Charles Dance</strong>, who plays William Randolph Hearst in the film. &#8220;And [<em>Mank </em>star <strong>Gary Oldman</strong>] said to David at one point, &#8216;David, I’ve done this scene a hundred fucking times.&#8217; And Fincher said, &#8216;Yeah, I know, but this is 101. Reset!'&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the same issue, Fincher doesn&#8217;t deny this. &#8220;I&#8217;m fairly didactic about, &#8216;These are the things that the scene needs to accomplish for me, and we will continue to play, to look for ways to underline these ideas that are as subtle as we can make them,'&#8221; the director said, adding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s a hard thing to say to actors, ‘I want a cohesive, great performance in the master [shot].&#8217; And then, &#8216;I want a cohesive, great performance in the alternate master.’ And then, &#8216;I want a cohesive, great performance in the over-the-shoulder. And I want a cohesive, great performance in his over-the-shoulder on to you. And I want the singles.&#8217; Because I don’t want to cut a scene based on where you are at personally on Tuesday. I don’t think I could go into the edit room knowing that I was going to have to cut around somebody who didn’t deliver. Part of it is you cast really great people and get the fuck out of the way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fincher has addressed this sort of thing before. &#8220;I like the idea that the first three takes, you&#8217;re just rehearsing,&#8221; he said in an interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript\">back in 2009</a>, and when the interviewer pointed out that Fincher was notorious for his many takes, the filmmaker countered: &#8220;This is bullshit. Look, you&#8217;re spending $150m, unbelievable amounts of money to ship period vehicles from Illinois down to Louisiana and get them working. There are teams of people making these cars work, all this stuff. So you get there and you&#8217;re going to shoot three takes and then go home?&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also added: &#8220;Some [actors] resent it and go, &#8216;My best stuff was when I had a lot of energy after my mochaccino and now my energy&#8217;s gone,&#8217; but a lot of actors work it out in their heads, they figure it out and have an idea of what they&#8217;re going to do. I can see that and I like to move past that, to where they&#8217;ve forgotten why they came, or who they are. And it is about choreography, where the eye of the audience finds that person and that person is revealed and they come forward and say their line. All those things in concert. So, you spend all that money to get there, so you might as well make sure you got it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In other words: Fincher is going to shoot as many damn takes as he wants until he gets exactly what he wants, and in his mind, to do otherwise would be a waste.

Now, <strong>Danielle Brooks</strong> (<em>Orange is the New Black</em>), <strong>Robert Patrick</strong> (<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em>), <strong>Jennifer Holland</strong> (<em>Brightburn</em>), and <strong>Chris Conrad</strong> (<em>Patriot</em>) have all been added to the cast.

But now we have a few details about these new additions.</p>\n<p>Brooks, who was absolutely tremendous on <em>Orange is the New Black</em> as Taystee, will star as Leota Adebayo, and Patrick, who has built a career alternating between playing absolute shitheels and grimy heroes, will portray someone named Auggie Smith. As far as we can tell, neither of those characters have ever appeared in a DC Comics film, TV series, or comic book before, so their identities and how they will factor into the action of this spin-off remains a mystery for now.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Holland, who has appeared on <em>American Horror Story</em> and <em>Sun Records</em>, will be reprising her role of Emilia Harcourt from <em>The Suicide Squad</em> film. You may recognize Chris Conrad from his role on <em>Perpetual Grace, LTD.</em>, or, perhaps more likely, as the slick American actor/fighter Johnny Cage from <em>Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</em>. He will play a character named Vigilante/Adrian Chase in this series, a former district attorney whose family is murdered and who dons a costume to punish criminals that the justice system let slip through the cracks.</p>\n<p>Gunn is writing all eight episodes and directing multiple episodes of the show, and he&#8217;s executive producing with <strong>Peter Safran</strong> (<em>Aquaman</em>). Official details about <em>Peacemaker</em> are still being kept under wraps, but we do know that the series will extend the universe that Gunn is creating in <em>The Suicide Squad</em> and that it will specifically &#8220;explore the origins of the character that Cena will play in the upcoming film, a man who believes in peace at any cost — no matter how many people he has to kill to get it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>The Suicide Squad</em> is slated to arrive in theaters on <strong>August 6</strong>, <strong>2021</strong>, and <em>Peacemaker</em> does not have a premiere date in place yet.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/peacemaker-cast-robert-patrick-danielle-brooks/\">&#8216;Peacemaker&#8217; Cast: James Gunn&#8217;s &#8216;The Suicide Squad&#8217; Spin-Off Adds Robert Patrick, Danielle Brooks, and More</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hXbiT5hXWEg:_683D0HZgYo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hXbiT5hXWEg:_683D0HZgYo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hXbiT5hXWEg:_683D0HZgYo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hXbiT5hXWEg:_683D0HZgYo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=hXbiT5hXWEg:_683D0HZgYo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hXbiT5hXWEg:_683D0HZgYo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/hXbiT5hXWEg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:30:54 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peacemaker-e1604067342820-700x320.jpg","linkMd5":"c432ec875a4cbfe90e42b4d35b4c02c7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn21@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-49-37-346_226a8e67ee5c6830.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":320,"sourceBytes":33474,"destBytes":21830,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/peacemaker-e1604067342820-700x320.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn21@2020_4/2020/11/12/04-49-37-346_226a8e67ee5c6830.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn23@2020_1/2020/11/12/04-50-25-710_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hXbiT5hXWEg:_683D0HZgYo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn77@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-27-119_6306d51a81526a46.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn81@2020_5/2020/11/12/04-50-27-215_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=hXbiT5hXWEg:_683D0HZgYo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn22@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-26-760_4cbcc013a0bc8374.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/hXbiT5hXWEg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn49@2020_6/2020/11/12/04-50-26-431_aa39ac4e850a54cb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605156575080},{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 12:49:35","title":"Decades Ago, ‘MASH’ Fought for the Soul of America – Its Battle Continues Today","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=644839","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-644851 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/MASH-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/MASH.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/MASH-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <strong><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/the-soapbox/\">The Soapbox</a></strong>, the space where we get loud, feisty, political, and opinionated about anything and everything.)</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hearing the gentle opening notes of Johnny Mandel’s folk anthem &#8220;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suicide is Painless&#8221; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">transports a person back to the Korean War and the combat medics of the 4077th.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the pandemic crushes spirits and keeps people home longer and longer thanks to the bungled response of our elected leaders, I sought somewhere—anywhere—to be. And the place I landed was </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>M*A*S*H</strong>. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show has been part of the cultural consciousness for so long, its ubiquity is taken for granted. I know I took it for granted, at least. It was just always around. I’d watched episodes as a child with my grandfather, who watched it whenever it was on TV. By the time I was aware of it, it was long over, but the reruns are still going strong.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It felt like a comfortable place to revisit chronologically, with the eyes of an adult and the discerning gaze of a critic. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And what I found was more incredible than I remembered.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-644839\"></span></p>\n<h2><b>Suicide is Painless</b></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> began its life as a novel, an absurdist memoir of a combat surgeon forced to cope on the frontlines. There was nothing inherently anti-war about the book. It was later reported that the author, Richard Hornberger, writing as Richard Hooker, did not appreciate the progressive commentary that made the adaptations of his work so daring for their time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For its part, the television show is blatantly anti-war. The 1970 Robert Altman film is more nihilistic in its approach, commenting little about the idea of war and instead playing into the absurd comedy of the situations in a subdued fashion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In every iteration of <em>M*A*S*H</em>, we’re introduced to a man named Hawkeye Pierce. A surgeon and a drunk. A womanizer. And someone who cares about saving people’s lives. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s about where the similarities end and the Hawkeye of the television series, played by Alan Alda, becomes the beating heart of the show and its message.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Biting Social Commentary and Incredible Filmmaking</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first thing I noticed about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H’s </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">television iteration when I revisited it as an adult was how surprised I was by the sharp writing and it’s incredibly progressive stances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larry Gelbart, the man who developed </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for television, honed in on the things that made Robert Altman’s film work and turned them up to eleven. One of those things was the social commentary. Another was the relentless march of casualties entering the camp. In the film, the surgery scenes are few compared to the rest of the running time. We might have spent as much time on a football field as the OR in the movie. But Gelbart guided us into surgery and allowed the doctors to show their true colors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social issues always took a front seat on the show for its duration. I lost count of the episodes where Hawkeye Pierce visibly shudders when another character uses a racial slur. He always takes the time to correct these people, confidently and matter-of-factly. These are people, not the slurs meant to degrade them. He models the behavior we should all have when calling out racism and bigotry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes the surgeons of the 4077th are on the wrong side of history, too. For all of its progress in some areas, the blatant sexism on the show drags it down at times. Margaret Houlihan is referred to as “Hot Lips” excessively, especially early in the show, and her treatment as head nurse is usually the butt of a joke. To the credit of the show and to Loretta Switt who played Margaret, they were able to let her stand her ground and grow into a woman who was strong on her own rather than creating punchlines at her expense. She became less and less defined by the man she was with, whether that was Frank Burns or Donald Penobscott, and became defined by her own interests and aspirations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But they also had the forethought to have the characters go too far in their quest to save lives. One specific episode comes to mind where Hawkeye opts to perform an unnecessary surgery on a commanding officer to keep him from mounting a suicide charge and risk the lives of his soldiers. Is it hypocritical of Hawkeye to fail his Hippocratic oath to do no harm by removing a healthy appendix if that saves lives? He can save the lives of the soldiers from the sausage grinder with one simple action. Was he wrong? We’re left to decide for ourselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show asked difficult questions and successfully blended the comedy and the drama into one seamless, bittersweet and maudlin package. It set the pattern for what a mix of drama and comedy on television could be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a one-camera set up, they were able to capture </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like a film and were free of the locked-down nature of a three-camera sitcom. The one downside of the show is the producers weren’t able to escape the dreaded laugh track and, if you’re in the United States, it still appears on Hulu. If someone from Hulu is reading, please give us the non-laugh track versions of the show they used in the UK, who rejected the offensive laugh track out of hand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show also broke ground with episodes that look brilliant in retrospect and are so well-copied that we think nothing of them anymore. Killing Col. Henry Blake (MacLean Stevenson) after he’d been sent home, was a masterstroke. In the rightfully famous episode, Radar O’Reilly (Gary Burghoff) comes in and somberly lets the doctors of the OR know the news, devastating both Blake’s friends and the audience as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another landmark episode was “The Interview,” the last that Gelbart delivered before moving on to other things. In it, they had the cast interview with a real news reporter in-character. The mix of sharp scripted responses and improv created one of the most compelling half-hours of television I’ve ever seen. </span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_WopzVVFXyM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These episodes set the template of how you could stretch the narrative of a television show and we now see these stretches all the time. There’s a lot left to study about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and we’ll be seeing shows emulating it for the foreseeable future.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Flag-Waving Buffoons</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One aspect of the show that feels relevant today is Frank Burns (Larry Linville). Burns is a flag-waving buffoon of the highest order. He is a dyed-in-the-wool conservative and hates everything about the progress made by Franklin Roosevelt. He treats the locals in Korea as though they’re animals and he believes whole-heartedly in the war and the American correctness of it all. He paints himself as a true patriot and feels like a completely relevant caricature of the jingoistic Trump supporters we see in our world today. Like Burns, they would rather wave flags and proclaim their own importance than have an ounce of empathy or learn what the right thing to do might be. Burns is an authoritarian, and we see the dangers of letting an authoritarian get command every time Burns is left in charge of the camp. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was somehow more prescient, but it was better at reading the room. Those authoritarian and jingoistic impulses </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lead </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to fascism. They always have. They are currently. It never ends well. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revisiting the series and seeing Burns brilliantly played as a complete buffoon no one takes seriously was a perfect antidote to the things I still see on the news today.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Hawkeye Today</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawkweye Pierce, played brilliantly by Alan Alda, is the beating heart of the show and its most important moral compass. His compassion and righteous fury added as much drama as the alleged comedy could bear. Alda threads the needle between the poles of comedy and drama, giving the show a gravitas that could sneak up on you if you weren’t careful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alda was the mouthpiece for the progressive vision of the show, and he found that important before he even agreed to take the part. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/janelevere/2013/10/31/alan-alda-reminisces-about-his-star-turn-as-hawkeye-in-mash/\">In an interview with Forbes in 2013</a>, he said that his “heart was always against any war,” and explained that the only way </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “could make a point about war was to be truthful about the Korean War.”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> And truthful they were. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For 11 years as the show ran, they told many pointed stories about the war. When the show started, the United States was embroiled in Vietnam, and having such popular anti-war programming about a war couldn’t have hurt the case for peace in that conflict.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Alda’s part, he never stopped being a moral compass for us, the impassioned viewer. It’s no surprise that Alan Alda ended up becoming a creative consultant on the show and won Emmys for writing and directing as well as acting. He inhabited the role and brought those lessons to the world for the 11 years </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was on the air.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even still, he persists.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Almost 63 million people voted for Donald Trump in 2016, but in 1983, more than 106 million people watched the last episode of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, it seems that by this president’s standard, I’m a bigger deal than he is,” Alda <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/29/alan-alda-vote-for-science-against-trump/?utm_source=reddit.com\">wrote in the Washington Post last month</a>. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He brought back the voice of the show and the morals it espoused to plead with the world to vote against Donald Trump. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Trump once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without consequences. At this moment, we are all on Fifth Avenue,” he wrote.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, people listened.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Back to the Swamp</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If episodes of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M*A*S*H </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were to air today, no doubt the network would be getting letters from angry Trump supporters asking why they allowed snowflakes and SJWs to be put in charge of a show set during the Korean War that featured soldiers and doctors and combat. They wouldn’t like having a finger wagged in their face about how wrong the concept of war was. And they certainly wouldn’t like the sacred lambs of capitalism and war profiteering and geopolitics being made the butt of jokes.
