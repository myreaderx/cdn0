To help people who are blind or low-vision complete these daily tasks faster and more easily, we’re introducing updates to Lookout on Android: new modes, a more accessible design, and expansion to even more Android devices. </p><br/><p>Lookout now has two new modes: Food Label and Scan Document. With Food Label, you can quickly identify packaged foods by pointing your phone’s camera at the label. Lookout will guide you to position the food product so that it can be properly identified through its packaging or barcode. This can be particularly helpful if you’re putting away groceries and want to make sure you’re handling the right items that might feel the same to your touch. For example, Food Label would be able to distinguish between a can of corn and a can of green beans.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"FoodLabel_1080X1080_TransparentBG.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/FoodLabel_1080X1080_TransparentBG_uuSCD3a.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Use Food Label to identify different food products.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Scan Document makes it easier to go through letters and mail.

This includes making more space for the camera view, which makes it easier to frame the object you want more information about. In addition, we’ve changed navigation between modes to require fewer taps and less time by making it possible to scroll between them at the bottom of the screen. </p><hr/>Related: <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/five-new-android-features--/\"><b>5 new things your Android phone can do</b></a><p></p><hr/><p>With this update, Lookout will be available on all devices with more than 2GB of RAM running Android 6.0 and later.
