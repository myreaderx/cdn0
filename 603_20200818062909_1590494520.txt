They have taken steps to “upgrade” World’s Edge with changes to The Dome, Drill site, and other Points of Interests. </p> <p>Read up on all the map changes from Jason McCord, our Design Director, on the previously released blog <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-6-map-updates\">here.</a></p> <h3>NEW LEGEND: RAMPART</h3> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/pj1qztv0dmh51.jpg?width=1431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55e9b79710cd9290c73021d7b5be2efc174b0f3f\">https://preview.redd.it/pj1qztv0dmh51.jpg?width=1431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55e9b79710cd9290c73021d7b5be2efc174b0f3f</a></p> <p>Ramya Parekh is a 21-year-old British Indian, blue collar, private business owner who just needs a big gun and a backpack full of scrap metal to get by in the dangerous, wild west world of the Outlands.</p> <p>Parekh brings her modded shields, and knowledge of heavy weapons, such as Sheila (well, that’s what she calls her minigun). </p> <p><em>Passive: Modded Loader</em></p> <p>Rampart has increased magazine capacity and faster reloads when using LMGs and the Minigun. Modded Loader also increases the amount of shots before overheating occurs and improves cooling when using the L-STAR. </p> <p><em>Tactical: Amped Cover</em></p> <p>Rampart builds a crouch-cover wall, which deploys a full-cover amped wall that blocks incoming shots and amps outgoing shots. A max of 5 amped walls can be deployed at a time.</p> <p><em>Ultimate: Emplaced Minigun “Sheila”</em></p> <p>Rampart places a mounted machine gun that anyone can use, with high ammo capacity and a long reload time. A max of 3 miniguns can be deployed at a time.</p> <p>For Parekh, the Apex card means more than just an invitation to compete. </p> <h3>NEW WEAPON - VOLT SMG</h3> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ca1jd1z5dmh51.jpg?width=1431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b75eb636aa2615a1b5595ef5c695b7b7deaf9e0\">https://preview.redd.it/ca1jd1z5dmh51.jpg?width=1431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b75eb636aa2615a1b5595ef5c695b7b7deaf9e0</a></p> <p>The first energy-based SMG to see regular use in the Frontier, the Volt allows its operator to fire a salvo of energy-based ammunition, decreasing drag and making it possible to hit multiple targets within a short window. </p> <h3>CRAFTING SYSTEM</h3> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/il7vfr0bdmh51.jpg?width=1431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dce7d50c1875c686a8ff440cb09efb54d996239\">https://preview.redd.it/il7vfr0bdmh51.jpg?width=1431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dce7d50c1875c686a8ff440cb09efb54d996239</a></p> <p>We all know the RnG gods are not always in your favor. With Season 6 we are introducing a crafting system. Find materials throughout the map via loot bins or material stations, then take these to a Replicator.</p> <p>In the Replicator, you’ll find eight different pieces of loot that you can craft, if you have enough materials. Some of this loot rotates on a weekly or daily basis, but you’ll always be able to see what’s currently craftable in the game mode selector or the map screen.</p> <p>Read more on the Crafting system from Systems Designer, Mark Yampolsky <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/season-6-crafting\">here</a>.</p> <h3>ARMOR META</h3> <p>With Season 6, we&#39;re introducing some big changes to the way armor works in the game.</p> <p>First off, all armor in the game is Evo Armor (except the Gold Armor).</p> <p>When you find a white, blue or purple armor on the ground, it&#39;s a pre-leveled Evo Armor. It can be picked up like normal, and continue to be evolved. Red Armor is not in the ground loot and can only be achieved through evolving.</p> <p>Gold Armor is not part of the Evo Armor track, and is only found in rare locations as usual.</p> <p>Another interesting change is that players spawn with level 0 Evo Armor. If you get in gun fights right away, and do enough damage, you will automatically level up into a White Armor. And you can continue to take that all the way to Red.</p> <p>We think this will really help with loot availability in the early game, without requiring players to drop hot when they don&#39;t want to.</p> <p>With all the changes in Season 6, players now have the opportunity to level up their shields through damage, luck in ground loot, or through crafting!</p> <p>The last big differences is that all Armor is coming down by 25 health. This means, players with Purple and Gold Armor have 175 health, not 200. Red Armor gets you to 200 health, and you can no longer get to 225.</p> <p>Our goal for this is to bring down the TTK (time to kill) a bit in order to better reward strategic positioning. </p> <p><em>New Damage Requirements:</em><br/> Damage to white: 50<br/> Damage to blue: 125<br/> Damage to purple: 250<br/> Damage to red: 500</p> <h3>HOLO SPRAYS</h3> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/i346ofeddmh51.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ebfb3da5f9c5b651d923ad3c93073bb7181a50\">https://preview.redd.it/i346ofeddmh51.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ebfb3da5f9c5b651d923ad3c93073bb7181a50</a></p> <p>Holo sprays are a new way to emote in the arena. By using the Emote wheel, you can throw down these legend specific calling cards to taunt bested enemies, or warn future challengers that you&#39;re not to be messed with.</p> <h3>BATTLE PASS</h3> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/062r5r6fdmh51.jpg?width=1431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0751d0e74ccdb33085db4a0121c38863843ef52\">https://preview.redd.it/062r5r6fdmh51.jpg?width=1431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0751d0e74ccdb33085db4a0121c38863843ef52</a></p> <p>This season’s battle pass includes the reactive Supersonic G7, Bloodhound Road Warrior, 5 new holo sprays, new skydive emotes, weapon charms and more! </p> <h3>QUEST</h3> <p>Follow the story from the Season 5 Quest, now in full color, illustrated comics!</p> <p>Collect Treasure Packs daily to earn your rewards including Crafting Metals, Challenge Points, Apex Packs, and a whole new suite of Gun Charms. </p> <h3>LEGENDS:</h3> <p>This patch, we&#39;re taking a look at the recon class. A class built around information gathering should be powerful in a BR where knowing where the enemy is is often the difference between life and death, but out of the three Legends in the recon class (Pathfinder, Crypto, and Bloodhound), one dominates in terms of in-game performance. (It’s the robot. The robot dominates.)</p> <p>In this patch, we’re mostly buffing Bloodhound as they needed the help the most. Crypto’s changes are a mixed bag as we also found one bug we had to fix that was giving Crypto a hidden advantage (TLDR: sometimes when you thought you were hitting the drone, you weren’t really hitting the drone). Between the buffs to Bloodhound&#39;s ult and the new utility Crypto gains on his drone, we hope to see a more diverse field of recon legends in game.</p> <h3>RECON CLASS:</h3> <ul> <li>All Recon legends (Bloodhound, Crypto, and Pathfinder) can now use Survey Beacons to get the next ring location. Crypto can use his drone to instantly get this information.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Pathfinder:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Context:</strong> Giving all Recon legends access to survey beacons makes Pathfinder less unique, and obviously we don’t love that. For now, we’re giving our friendly robot a small buff to his ultimate cooldown when he uses a survey beacon, but in the future we will take another look at Pathfinder to see what else we could do to make him feel more unique. </li> <li><strong>Passive:</strong> Each time Pathfinder scans a survey beacon, the total cooldown of Zipline Gun is reduced.</li> <li><strong>Numbers:</strong> Zipline Gun cooldown reduced by 10s each time Pathfinder scans a beacon. Up to 6 rings per game means the total cooldown of Zipline Gun can go from 120s to 60s.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Bloodhound:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Context:</strong> Bloodhound fulfills a very clear role in Apex Legends: they’re the information gatherer and tracker, but currently their performance leaves a lot to be desired. In this patch, we wanted to double down on their ultimate being their big moment of becoming a god-like tracker. Bloodhound already gives up some information to the enemy when they scan or use the ultimate (it makes a noticeable sound), so we think there is room for a lot more power during the ultimate.</li> <li><strong>Beast of the Hunt:</strong> Now gains even more duration when Bloodhound scores a knockdown or kill with the ultimate about to run out.</li> <li><strong>Eye of the Allfather:</strong> During Beast of the Hunt, Eye of the Allfather now comes out twice as fast and has a much shorter cooldown.</li> <li><strong>Numbers:</strong> <ul> <li>Beast of the Hunt duration extension 5s → [5s - 15s] based on remaining duration</li> <li>Eye of the Allfather CD during Beast of the Hunt: 25s → 6s</li> <li>Eye of the Allfather total use time during Beast of the Hunt: 1.8s → 0.9s</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Crypto:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Context:</strong> Crypto is a particularly interesting recon character: the amount of information he can gather for his team with the drone is very high, but the fact that he has to switch over to his drone leaves him vulnerable and often at a great distance from his team. Because he has no abilities without his drone, we figure there’s room for even more power when he’s in his drone.</li> <li><strong>Surveillance drone:</strong> <ul> <li>Crypto can now activate respawn and survey beacons from his drone. Doing so is instant instead of requiring a prolonged use. </li> <li>Made the surveillance drone slightly more consistent to hit but also doubled its hitpoints.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Drone EMP:</strong> <ul> <li>EMP will now slow teammates caught in the blast, even if they had no shields. This means that players who have used Revenant’s Death Totem will also be slowed.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Numbers:</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Surveillance Drone</strong> 30HP → 60HP</li> <li><strong>Surveillance Drone</strong> hitbox size: cube of edge length 16 → cube of edge length 24</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h3>OTHER LEGENDS:</h3> <p><strong>Revenant:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Context:</strong> We’re happy to see that dropping the range restriction on Death Totem brought a lot more Revenants into play, but we’ve been watching a particularly frustrating combo play out in professional level play involving a squad of Revenant, Wraith, and Crypto, where using the three ultimates together resulted in two back to back runs at the enemy team that they could do very little about. We’ve attacked part of that in the Crypto EMP change, but here’s the other part aimed at making this play less overwhelming.</li> <li><strong>Death Totem:</strong> <ul> <li>For 2s after being recalled by the Death Totem, players cannot use Wraith’s Dimensional Rift.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Octane:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Stim:</strong> Can now use Stim while healing, but stim will not remove the slow you incur from healing.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Loba:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Context:</strong> While Loba was initially very popular, she’s been struggling to keep up more recently, so we’re tossing her a little buff. If you’re curious why we’ve chosen to buff her ultimate rather than her tactical: we’re seeing that she has decent combat success but that teams with her on them don’t win as much as, say, teams with Lifeline or Wattson. This suggests to us that her out of combat utility (that is to say, how she funnels loot to her team) isn’t doing enough.</li> <li><strong>Black Market:</strong> <ul> <li>Lowered cooldown from 3min to 90s</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Gibraltar:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Defensive Bombardment:</strong> <ul> <li>Increased cooldown from 3 minutes to 4.5 minutes</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Bangalore:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Rolling Thunder:</strong> <ul> <li>Decreased cooldown from 4.5 minutes to 3 minutes</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Wattson:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Interception Pylon</strong> <ul> <li>Trophy system will now shoot down Caustic barrels in flight if they would have landed inside the range of the trophy.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h3>LOOT</h3> <p>Added:</p> <ul> <li>Extended Energy Mags. </li> <li>Turbocharger Hop-up</li> </ul> <p>Updated:</p> <ul> <li>Precision Choke - Removed Precision Choke from loot pool, but it will now be integrated into the Triple Take and Peacekeeper by default. Fire select toggles on/off the choke</li> </ul> <p>In Supply Drop:</p> <ul> <li>R99 <ul> <li>Damage increased from 11 to 12</li> <li>Increased magazine size to 32</li> <li>Ammo Reserve: 160</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Out of Supply Drop- Into Ground Loot:</p> <ul> <li>Devotion <ul> <li>Clip size reduced back to original values (36/40/44/48).</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h3>FULLY KITTED WEAPON SWAPS:</h3> <p><em>Removed:</em> </p> <ul> <li>DMR</li> <li>Hemlok </li> <li>Spitfire </li> <li>EVA-8 </li> <li>RE-45</li> </ul> <p><em>Added:</em> </p> <ul> <li>Devotion </li> <li>Mastiff </li> <li>Triple Take</li> <li>Flatline </li> <li>Volt</li> </ul> <h3>UPDATED LOOT</h3> <p>Sniper ammo</p> <ul> <li>Increased pick up from 8 to 12</li> <li>Increased Stack Size from 16 to 24</li> </ul> <p>Energy Ammo</p> <ul> <li>Reduce amount picked up from 30 to 20.</li> </ul> <h3>WEAPON UPDATES</h3> <p>Hemlok: </p> <ul> <li>Reduced vertical recoil in burst mod</li> <li>Slightly reducing recoil in pattern on 2nd and 3rd shot so first burst kicks less</li> <li>Burst mode time between bursts .32 -&gt; .28</li> </ul> <p>Charge Rifle</p> <ul> <li>Will now use 2 ammo per shot.</li> <li>Increased mag size from 4 to 8</li> </ul> <p>Triple Take Buff: </p> <ul> <li>Increase fire rate 1.25 -&gt; 1.4</li> <li>Increased Mag size from (5/6/7/8) to (6/7/8/9)</li> <li>Built the Choke hop up into the weapon by default.
