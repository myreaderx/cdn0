This week&#160;<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/liz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Liz Baessler</a> takes a look at the second season of His Dark</em><em> Materials</em> on HBO.</p>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>His Dark Materials</strong></em> has a storied adaptation past. Originally a beloved series of books by <strong>Philip Pullman</strong>, it was made into a film in 2007 that, despite being chock full of big names, utterly flopped. It was no <em>Cats</em> or anything, but it was promptly abandoned, and the second and third installments of the trilogy were never even filmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, HBO and the BBC launched an all-new attempt. Led by <strong>Dafne Keen </strong>(fresh from her dazzling <em>Logan </em>success) and spread out over an undefined number of TV seasons, it held the promise of being grittier, truer to the source material, and unflinching in the telling of an unreligious story for children. And yet it too fell short of expectations. <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/his-dark-materials-hbo-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mine, in particular</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With two lackluster attempts and counting, I chose not to approach the second season of the HBO series with my hopes set oo high. The chances of a beloved part of my childhood flopping, or at least being fumbled, were just too great. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m thrilled to report that <em>His Dark Materials</em> Season 2 is miles better than the first. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, it&#8217;s still not perfect. I would love a window into the mind of a viewer who hasn&#8217;t read the books because I imagine some things are still totally baffling. But by now at least <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/his-dark-materials-explained-daemons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the concept of daemons</a> (human souls embodied by physically separate talking animals) ought to be old hat, and the interaction with a familiar universe (presumably our own) should finally clear up any longstanding confusion about the way Lyra&#8217;s world works. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This expansion into a new universe, and the resulting meetings and culture clashes, go a long way to make the show more accessible. Mrs. Coulter (<strong>Ruth Wilson</strong>), in particular, undergoes some remarkable development. Unexpectedly confronted with a world in which women are allowed to compete with men, her deadly confidence and enigmatic self-loathing are cast in a whole new, sympathetic light. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the best of my memory, this isn&#8217;t addressed in the books. It&#8217;s quite an interesting turn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These little departures from the source material, while still remarkably few and far between, go a long way in making the show more lifelike, and less as though it&#8217;s just checking off a list of plot points &#8212; a serious problem in the first season). In particular, Mrs. Coulter&#8217;s relationship with Lord Boreal (<strong>Ariyon Bakare</strong>) is played up far more here than in the books, showing the incompatibility of two people firing on utterly different wavelengths in a way that&#8217;s refreshing and almost &#8212; <em>almost</em> &#8212; laugh out loud funny. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting change, of course, is the long awaited meeting of Lyra (Keen) and Will (<strong>Amir Wilson</strong>), the series’ two protagonists. It’s much more interesting to watch two people slowly grow to trust and like each other than it is to watch one person struggle along on her own. Or at least in this case it definitely is. And the two have genuinely good chemistry together. I&#8217;m excited to see them grow into their roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, the show still has its problems. There&#8217;s an entire subplot focused on the witches warring with the Magisterium that slogs on. Never before has a conflict been portrayed with less nuance, or featured more stilted avowals of vengeance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, however, the series has far more life than it did in its previous season. The action is picking up, the scope of the universes is expanding, and the stakes are becoming clearer. The two main characters have finally met and, thankfully, they get along. With luck, this show just might find its soul yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>His Dark Materials </em>premieres on HBO on Monday, November 16th at 9 pm EST and will continue to air every Monday at the same time. </strong></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/IHIzshIOlgc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 12:16:45 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"168fc94254541f61f60c1057ad274fc1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Liz Baessler","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/IHIzshIOlgc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn31@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-08-349_c0227e00c0295f10.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374989028},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","title":"To Split-Screens and Beyond: The Art of Creating Doubles","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359359","description":"\n<p id=\"block-04637504-093d-4be3-a121-b1015ed34453\"><em>Welcome to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web. Today, we&#8217;re watching a video about how filmmakers create the illusion of doubles, twins, and clones through various visual effects.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The gag of having one person appear on-screen as more than one character is almost as old as cinema itself. But <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/history-of-one-actor-playing-a-lot-of-roles-844675d80efb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">actors playing multiple roles in a film</a> is one thing. Having them share the screen and interact with each other is another matter altogether. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, numerous techniques have been used to pull off the illusion of twins, clones, and duplicates. Some films are lucky enough to have actual twins at their disposal. Others simply rely on body doubles, avoiding the need for visual effects entirely. For everyone else, until the advent of computer-generated effects, pulling off a &#8220;doubling&#8221; was a matter of editing. And the oldest and most effective trick in the book was the split-screen, which goes at least as far back as the French illusionist <strong>Georges Méliès</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as the video essay below emphasizes, the real magic happens when filmmakers <em>combine</em> techniques. When <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/contact-mirror-scene/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">optical mattes</a>, body doubles, and motion-controlled cameras are intertwined and mixed-and-matched to sell us on the trick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video offers an impressively dense look at examples of different &#8220;doubling&#8221; techniques across cinema history and how their limitations led to creative solutions. So, if you&#8217;ve ever wanted to know the ins and outs of one of film&#8217;s longest-serving visual effects, you&#8217;ve come to the right place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-b5ac606c-b74a-4cab-a663-701ec85c7024\">Watch &#8220;<strong>Creating Doubles: The Split-Screen and Beyond&#8221;</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Creating Doubles: The Split-Screen and Beyond\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mys8_k5PNPM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-da44f2c0-01e5-442d-b111-649cfba1b5a9\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This video is by <strong>RocketJump Film School</strong>, an ongoing series of online filmmaking tutorials and educational essays.

In some cases, we’ll also make a plea for them to be given another chance. This time, we head back to high school to revisit American Vandal.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The trailer for Netflix’s original series <strong><em>American Vandal</em></strong> opens with dramatic music and serious narration, and it&#8217;s the kind of thing you’d expect from a traditional true-crime documentary. A serious tone plays over various testimonials, slow-zooms, and close-ups, and if you weren’t paying attention, you’d be forgiven for doing a double-take when a teen named Dylan Maxwell (<strong>Jimmy Tatro</strong>) faces the camera and says, plain as day, “Another day, another dick.”</p>\n<p>The premise of <strong>Tony Yacenda</strong> and <strong>Dan Perrault</strong>’s satirical mockumentary is at once deeply recognizable to anyone who’s been to high school in the current millennium, and extremely surreal at the same time. <em>American Vandal</em>&#8216;s first season sees Dylan expelled from Hanover High School and facing felony vandalism charges for allegedly spray-painting phallic imagery on twenty-seven cars in the school’s faculty parking lot. Dylan’s reputation as a troublemaker serves to incriminate him, but his underclassman, self-styled documentarian Peter Maldonado (<strong>Tyler Alvarez</strong>), noting that all the evidence against Dylan is circumstantial, sets out with his best friend Sam Ecklund (<strong>Griffin Gluck</strong>) to prove Dylan’s innocence. In their investigation, they uncover dirty secrets and administrative corruption and explore the facets and nuances of the modern American high school.</p>\n<p>All of this is framed in-universe as a web documentary being produced by Peter and Sam. The mockumentary setup puts the camera eye in the hands of the students themselves, rather than an outside third-person perspective, and in doing so, drags the common film-and-television setting of “the American high school” kicking and screaming into the modern era. While high school stories have never been out of fashion, they have continued to rely on archetypes laid out by John Hughes in the 1980s. By diving deeper into the high school ecosystem, <em>American Vandal</em> breaks down these archetypes and modernizes them.</p>\n<p>The two seasons of <em>American Vandal</em> feature characters who feel fully realized and familiar in the best ways. Dylan is the perfect encapsulation of this: a stoner troublemaker, certainly, but also someone whose underprivileged background informs his attitude towards authority. Documentarians Peter and Sam are, in their own way, similar: a pretentious film snob and a theater geek madly in love with his upperclassman. From overbearing young teachers desperate for admiration to beloved education veterans and from nudity-comfortable swimming jocks to &#8220;Tank Top Todd,&#8221; the characters all feel distinctly and decisively modern &#8212; willing and unwilling participants in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>Outside of its characters, <em>American Vandal</em> also differentiates itself from other high school-set stories by exploring their peculiarly American ecosystems. The conflicts in this series span the characters’ interactions, but they&#8217;re also deeply intertwined with the sociological landscapes of the schools themselves. More often than not, contemporary films and television series set in high school treat the setting as a backdrop to the character drama. Teachers and principals are merely props and plot devices to the students’ own troubles &#8212; dealers of detentions but rarely exerting their influence beyond petty inconveniencing of our student protagonists. <em>American Vandal</em> breaks ties with this concept by digging into and exploring the very real nuances present within 21st-century schools. This series takes great pleasure in exploring the internal politics of educational institutions.</p>\n<p>For example, both seasons feature school officials who are willing and eager to let innocents take the fall for crimes they did not commit in order to achieve their larger goals. Finding the truth in spite of these authority figures becomes a major part of Peter’s investigations. The show is especially brutal in this honesty in <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/american-vandal-season-2-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Season 2 of <em>American Vandal</em></a> when Peter and Sam investigate a criminal incident at a privately funded Catholic school. The obviously satirical moments of private-school culture are paired with grave accusations of favoritism within Saint Bernardine, the fictional school that throws one of its “loser” students under the bus in order to protect its star athlete’s reputation.</p>\n<p>While all this would be more than enough to make a great series, <em>American Vandal</em> delves even further into the true crime genre it satirizes by addressing the ethics of the genre itself. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDk24vmYcBw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video essay by YouTuber Sarah Z</a> delves into this in-depth, but to summarize, the exposes uncovered by true crime investigative journalists often have very real effects on the people involved in the case, and revealing their secrets can often be very painful for them. True crime fetishizes peoples’ problems, and, in-universe, Peter’s investigations inadvertently airs out his classmates’ and peers’ dirty laundry as if it is public record, and throws many of their lives into chaos. This is milked for drama but leaves a very open-ended and real question about the true crime genre in the minds of the audience. Was the investigation ethical? Was finding the truth worth all the muckraking?</p>\n<p>All of this is sewn together with a remarkably organic form of authentic improvisational performance, as attested to by many members of the cast. Interviews with <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/american-vandal-tyler-alvarez-jimmy-tatro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tyler Alvarez and Jimmy Tatro</a> and <a href=\"https://decider.com/2017/09/27/g-hannelius-interview-american-vandal-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">G. Hannelius</a> describe how little of the whole story was given to them per episode script, and how their subsequently authentic performances evolved from this “need to know” method. Some sequences &#8212; most notably, the “party scenes” &#8212; were even filmed on iPhones, in order to capture that particular “phone footage” look. Despite the obvious satire inherent in <em>American Vandal</em>’s premise, the show’s feeling of authenticity draws viewers in and engages them in a fundamentally absurd premise; Who did the dicks? Who is the Turd Burglar? How can such seemingly sophomoric terminology exist within a suspenseful and seriously engaging series?</p>\n<p><em>American Vandal</em> was unfortunately cut short in 2018 when it was announced that Netflix would not be renewing the series. The story of Peter and Sam’s gradually evolving ability as documentarians aside, there are so many more subcategories of American education to explore. Hypothetical future seasons could follow the pair on adventures in university, public or private, or they could pivot to follow an entirely new documentary crew, inspired by the in-universe <em>American Vandal</em> series, making their own piece centered on anything from inner-city school issues to a petty rivalry between two small-town Midwestern schools. The US education system has any number of small-scale conflicts that could evolve into a fascinating case for the aspiring film student to do an in-depth documentary on.</p>\n<p>Rumors abound that <em>American Vandal</em>’s producers are shopping further seasons to other venues and platforms, but in any case, the cancellation of such a unique and brilliant series is an absolute tragedy. Rarely do audiences get to experience something as tongue-in-cheek as <em>American Vandal</em>, something that relentlessly mocks as much as it admires both popular entertainment conventions and real American educational institutions. We deserve more of it.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/ON98mS-4UeA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 21:16:45 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d4983df2e25bccedf4f7b380cfd3a4ad","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Hans Qu","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/ON98mS-4UeA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn55@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-08-351_40835ed26558704a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374989028},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","title":"Our Pick of the Week Explodes With Grief, Understanding, and Blood","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359442","description":"<p class=\"section-divider\"><em>Streaming might be the future, but physical media is still the present.

YA movies often fall into a couple different categories &#8212; they&#8217;re either serious romances, usually with illness of some kind, or they&#8217;re a fantasy of some kind. Spontaneous is a rarity in that it manages to combine both into something beautiful. There&#8217;s no magic or vampires here, but we do get an unexplained phenomena involving high school seniors blowing up. As a memorable image it&#8217;s undeniable seeing as they burst into splashes of blood, but as a metaphor it works beautifully for both the uncertainty facing teens these days, and more specifically, the ever present threat of a school shooting. It&#8217;s powerful stuff kept afloat with big laughs, real wit, and a terrific lead performance by Katherine Langford and Charlie plummer.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: None]</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--p\">The Best</h2>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-359576\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-beguiled.jpg\" alt=\"The Beguiled\" width=\"195\" height=\"249\" />The Beguiled [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A wounded Union soldier takes refuge with some females.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegel deliver a tense, dangerously sensual character study here, and while morals seem clear at first they&#8217;re anything but. There are few innocents here, and Eastwood&#8217;s character is far from the hero as he&#8217;s someone most of today&#8217;s leading men wouldn&#8217;t touch. The house becomes home to all kinds of manipulation and misdirection, and it builds to a suitably tragic conclusion.

Eugene Levy and Catharine O&#8217;Hara are expectedly superb, but it&#8217;s Dan Levy, Annie Murphy, and Emily Hampshire (as the motel owner they befriend once they&#8217;re forced to live there) who introduce viewers to new comedic talents. From line delivery to endearing mannerisms, they quickly grow on you not just as funny people but as characters we get to see truly grow. Most sitcoms don&#8217;t offer that &#8212; details of a character&#8217;s life change, but they typically remain the same &#8212; and it makes for a refreshing look at people who feel more real than their comedic trappings would suggest.

But oh boy, it&#8217;s about 80% miss when it comes to the laughs.A few segments show ingenuity and a sense of humor, but too much of it drags on.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentary, documentary, outtakes, deleted scenes]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> Bill and Ted search for the song that will unite the world.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> The <em>Bill &#38; Ted</em> films have always been most interested in delivering gentle comedy that skews silly, and the third film in the franchise manages more of the same while also being incredibly kind-hearted. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter slips pretty easily into their old skins, even if the former does feel a bit stiff at times, and they&#8217;re joined by fun turns from Samara Weaving and Brigette Lundy-Paine as their daughters. It&#8217;s a sweet film with harmless laughs and a warm sense of family and friendship.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Featurettes]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Burst City [Arrow Video]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A glimpse into the Japanese punk scene of the early 80s.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Sogo Ishii&#8217;s early 80s overdose of punk and metal is as memorable and accurate a look into that subculture as you&#8217;re likely to find. It&#8217;s constantly in motion as the sound of screams and revving engines and more fills the air. There&#8217;s only a slim narrative hanging across the antics as much of the film features music performances, pulsating crowds, and living gatherings celebrating the music and protesting societal norms. At two hours it&#8217;s a bit too long, but punk fans should quickly find themselves lost in its energy.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Commentary, interviews]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Bustin&#8217; Loose [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A criminally minded man finds love and more on a school bus.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Richard Pryor&#8217;s 80s filmography isn&#8217;t great, but there are some highlights here and there. This lightweight tale isn&#8217;t among them, unfortunately, but it has its charms as Pryor plays a conman who finds himself in the service of a nice woman (Cicely Tyson) and a group of troublemaking kids. All manner of zaniness follows before the film finds some heart for a soft ending.

I don&#8217;t know, but I do know that this really isn&#8217;t one. It is a sometimes engaging film, though, thanks to a strong cast (Jean-Louis Trintignant, Gina Lollobrigida) and some energetic style. The editing is frenetic at times, and while it feels at odds with the fairly sedate story it holds the attention. Ultimately, the film is more of an observational drama than a thriller, but it remains a memorable late 60s oddity.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Director&#8217;s cut and Italian version, commentary, featurette, interview, short film]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">The Eiger Sanction [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> An ex-assassin comes out of retirement.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> This early directorial effort from Clint Eastwood is an oddly challenging watch. On the upside, there is some interesting world-building at play here with the assassin agency, and the scenery is gorgeous &#8212; mountain climbing scenes in both the American West and Switzerland are fairly stunning and feature Eastwood engaging in much of the action. The problem is some ridiculously offensive portrayals when it comes to gays, women, Native Americans, and more. The film maintains a playful seriousness, but some of the scenes/dialogue are *not good.*</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: New 2K master, commentary, interviews]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Hosts</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> Aliens begin a low-key body snatch.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> There are some cool beats and bloody as hell sequences in this indie tale of invasion and terror, and they&#8217;re probably enough to make it worth a watch for genre fans. A bit where a hammer meets a human head is especially juicy. The characters, though, leave something to be desired, as an entire family falls prey to a couple despite numerous opportunities to do something. Anything. It&#8217;s frustrating because of their lack of action for so long.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Featurette, interviews]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Mortal</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A young man&#8217;s burgeoning powers causes problems in Norway.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Nat Wolff headlines this fairly sedate origin tale of a man discovering dangerous powers at his fingertips that he can&#8217;t yet control. The film delivers some solidly compelling visuals, but even during &#8220;action&#8221; sequences it all feels a bit subdued and minimized. The third act steps things up considerably, albeit a little too late maybe, with a pretty crazy reveal. It unfortunately ends on a note of &#8220;wait for the sequel&#8221; which probably won&#8217;t ever arrive, but it&#8217;s still engaging enough due to that reveal.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Featurette]</p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Play Misty for Me [KL Studio Classics]</h4>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>What is it?</strong> A radio DJ is stalked by a psychotic fan.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Why see it?</strong> Clint Eastwood delivers a template for later films like <em>The Seduction</em> and <em>Fatal Attraction</em> with a movie that&#8217;s closer to the former than the latter. That&#8217;s not a knock as there are some solid thrills here, but it just shifts so quickly into &#8220;crazy female jealousy&#8221; that there&#8217;s no room for nuance.

Back in the 40s, though, biopics of good enough men were all the rage. Van Heflin takes the lead role here and delivers a solid performance as a man who faced real struggles but persevered all the way up through the presidency. It&#8217;s Oscar-bait, despite not winning any (or even being nominated), but there&#8217;s a place for that in our movie diet.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">[Extras: Featurette, cartoon, short]</p>\n<hr />\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Also out this week:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><em>Guest House, Maybe Next Year, Secret Zoo</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/zO6Ppc312Vg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 02:51:36 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spontaneous.jpg","linkMd5":"44dd8c7b16e69cbde18f5d6ea4d6a567","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-07-337_8af802d3ed71329e.webp","destWidth":195,"destHeight":297,"sourceBytes":26149,"destBytes":18044,"author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/spontaneous.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-07-337_8af802d3ed71329e.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-beguiled.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-08-536_b59d42d69e24536a.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/brides-of-dracula.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn72@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-08-396_b18657911b4a677a.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/schitts-creek-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn12@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-08-486_d2398d5e4f70f042.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/zO6Ppc312Vg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn60@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-08-357_f8d2af276fc832d7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374989028},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","title":"The Interior and Exterior Worlds of Color in ‘Uncut Gems’","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359542","description":"\n<p><em>In our&#160;</em><strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/kino-color\" target=\"_blank\">Color Code</a></em></strong><em> column, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/hicks/\" target=\"_blank\">Luke Hicks</a> chooses a handful of shots from a favorite film in order to draw out the meaning behind certain colors and how they play into both the scene and the film as a whole. For his fourth entry, he digs into the Safdie brothers’ Uncut Gems.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Uncut Gems</strong> </em>is a visual feast, a masterclass in the art of color composition. Color is a prevalent aspect of filmmaking for which decisions must be made for every costume, prop, wallpaper, accessory, you name it. Holistic directors like the Safdie brothers toil over color choices with production designers, art directors, costume designers, cinematographers, etc. until the shot(s) in question achieves a certain color scheme or palette. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the kaleidoscopic opening crawl to the heart of the club to the Diamond District, there is a kinetic energy to the color of <em>Uncut Gems</em>, as if it&#8217;s been zapped into existence. Using color theory, I’ll unpack five shots that showcase the Safdies and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/darius-khondji-uncut-gems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DP Darius Khondji</a>&#8216;s use of color to create tonal and thematic consistency, draw out emotional upheaval, and keep us thoroughly immersed in the interior and exterior worlds of the film.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-gem-exterior.jpg\" alt=\"Uncut Gems Color Gem Exterior\" class=\"wp-image-359618\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-gem-exterior.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-gem-exterior-768x322.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Holy shit, I’m gonna cum,” says a nearly drooling Howard, fawning for the first time over the propulsive wonder that is <em>the</em> uncut gem – an Ethiopian black opal that yields prosperity and death in shocking fashion in 2012 Manhattan. This image, however, is our first glimpse, coming just before the camera zooms into the gem to find the title card. It takes place two years prior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dry beige rock is raw, sharp like an oyster, freshly chipped from the stone wall of the Welo mine shaft we’re in. Direct light from the flashlight above electrifies the window of the gem, the center of the shot swimming in voltaic shades of green and soft hues of cobalt blue. The red-orange pinpricks look like cells fusing into a drop of fire that creates a triadic scheme (three equidistant colors on the color wheel) in tandem with the lighter greens and violet blues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lime green commands the palette aesthetically and thematically. Green often represents energy and health, but the lime shade adds a sharpness. In the world we’re about to enter, health seems to exist at the mercy of energy – an acidic, battery-operated energy that fuels Howard with the preternatural ability to always continue lying, screaming, and betting his way into deeper shit. The color of money is also associated with greed and envy, which Howard exhibits ad nauseam. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it’s also associated with luck. Under a microscope, the anomalous breed of luck in <em>Uncut Gems </em>is a neutral force. The good and bad extremes cancel each other out. Consider the fact that no one has ever lost harder on two big wins in a row than Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). The serendipity of meeting Kevin Garnett is married to the baggage that follows him. The movie mirrors the gem in this way, a modern marvel of filmmaking excellence that simultaneously wows and wallops viewers with circumstantial distress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The red-orange glint is powerful for how small it is. A bullet hole waiting to manifest in Howard’s cheek in the exact same position, it warns of a looming danger that is impossible not to notice despite its minor role (cough, Phil, cough). Blue quietly lurks in the shadow of the lime green. It feels ominous and cold as if it’s waiting for us beneath the surface. And, well, it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-gem-interior.jpg\" alt=\"Uncut Gems Gem Interior\" class=\"wp-image-359619\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-gem-interior.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-gem-interior-768x322.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the previous shot is the big picture encapsulation, in color, of everything we’re about to experience, this shot is the immersion, our initial descent. It comes only seconds later after the camera has plunged deep into the pinfire pattern of the gem. Whatever we thought we saw in the previous image is now heightened by a <em>Magic School Bus</em>-esque trip through the looking glass scored by Daniel Lopatin’s transcendent “The Ballad of Howie Bling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They say you can see the whole universe in opal,” Howard tells Garnett. That’s because opals, unlike other gems, are not minerals. <a href=\"https://www.gia.edu/gia-news-research/real-gemology-ethiopian-opals-uncut-gems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">According to the Gemological Institute of America</a>, opals are a product of “centuries upon centuries of seasonal rains that leach microscopic silica particles from sandstone, carrying them deep into underground fissures and cavities.” As they dry, they form a clustered lattice of silica spheres that dance across the spectrum of light and give us the opal’s defining prismatic color.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Safdies must have known this because they created a gem interior that feels like the cosmos. We soar through the microcosm universe at an erratic pace (as we do in Howard&#8217;s universe), swallowed in its blackness, passing gaseous collections of color that resemble supernovas, taking sharp turns to god knows where. This cluster is one of many we encounter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sky blue and royal blue cloud the image with shades of red and orange knifing out in several directions. The distinction of red and orange in combination with the blues make this a split complementary color scheme, which is when a primary color is met by two colors that sit opposite of it on the color wheel. The blues are still ominous – cold, impersonal, and mysterious. The Safdies also use it as an associative color throughout the film that represents iciness, masculinity, and sadness (perhaps brokenness, as well).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The red and orange are close enough to act together, but they’re also distinguished from one another. Red once again represents danger and violence. But the more we dig into the meaning behind the color, the more we see Howie. For example, red also signifies obstinance and action, two things that define him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The burnt and golden shades of orange are complementary to this characterization through color. Like bullets frozen in slow motion, they shoot threateningly out of the clouds in streaks of risk, extroversion, and self-indulgence. Unsurprisingly, orange is also the color of adventure, a word malleable enough to apply in equal measure to <em>Dora the Explorer</em> and…<em>this</em>. Howard, or Howard’s adventure (i.e. the film as a whole), is contained in the image, itself a singular, haywire display of allure that is difficult to look away from.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-red-neon-tunnel.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Sandler Red Neon Tunnel\" class=\"wp-image-359620\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-red-neon-tunnel.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-red-neon-tunnel-768x322.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The previous shot also introduces us to the theme of tunnels, or portals. Passing through time and space inside the gem, we are transported from the Welo mines to New York City, or the inside of Howard’s colon, to be exact. The only other time we explicitly enter the gem is when Garnett peers into it for the first time only to see his life flash before his eyes, the gem a portal into his past. One could also argue we enter the gem after we enter Howie at the end, the hole in his face a tunnel that runs through the gem and into the afterlife.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This red, neon-striped club tunnel, however, is by far the coolest literal tunnel in the movie. I don’t point it out to harp on the meaning of red, but to emphasize the way the Safdies consistently use color in concert with theme. Here, we have a dark, villainous, Darth Vader-y tunnel that takes Howie from the main club to the VIP lounge where his girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox) is getting better acquainted with The Weeknd, one of many mini-bosses Howie must defeat to face Bowser (read: Phil).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wiry red neon signals the passion and anger that’s soon to burst from Howard in the form of a physical altercation, and the red-streak tunnel, as a whole, mirrors the inside of the gem. The vertical tubes are also an exact match to the red neon tubes we see running up the wall in his apartment when he surprises Julia. There, red denotes a different kind of passion but is still associated with Julia. In other words, the color and nature of the tunnel points to the endgame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Demany (Lakeith Stanfield) disappears into the Celtics locker room, he does so down a black and gray tunnel and we never find out where he goes. When anyone enters the brightly lit jewelry shop, they go through the sterile, glistening marble hallway, a sign of luxury. When Howard walks through a scaffolding tunnel, he has an amicable chat with his Diamond District pals just before the Safdies cut to the extended family at Seder dinner.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-club-orange-blue.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Sandler Orange Blue\" class=\"wp-image-359621\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-club-orange-blue.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-club-orange-blue-768x322.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the gemology world, the spectacular hues of black opal are referred to as “play-of-color,” a term that applies just as uniquely here. Demany&#8217;s tiger orange jacket glows in the blacklight, casting an incandescent red on everyone around him in one of the more memorable color plays on celluloid this side of the century. The neon of it all is captivating, no doubt, but stopping there would be taking the image at face value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When compared to the interior image of the gem, one can see how the Safdies use color to re-create that cosmological aura in the real world. Suddenly, Demany is the orange speckle from the gem swarming blue in the club. Instead of plunging into the rock, we’ve plunged into the club. Howard has just found out that Demany left the gem with Garnett again, and he’s furious. If it weren’t for Demany’s crew, Howard would’ve been kicked out for brawling before he ever knew Julia was in the bathroom with The Weeknd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the interior opal shot, this one follows a split complementary color scheme, piercing orange and pinkish-red sitting across the color wheel from Egyptian blues that verge on purple. The continuity of the colors across the film makes them thematically associative. The blue draped over the club still evokes Howard’s cold, cruel behavior along with the profound sadness he will eventually fess up to (“I’m so sad; I’m so fucked up”).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Darker shades of blue are also associated with pessimism and hypocrisy, concepts Howard has all but mastered. Here, he harangues Demany for not having the rock despite blatantly screwing over those he’s indebted to on a daily basis. Later, when the situation flips, so do the colors. The next day, Demany screams at Howie for running Garnett rampant, not having the championship ring, and loaning out the watches he was trying to sell. While Howard takes a phone call, Demany pours a drink into the aquarium, turning the water into the same shade of red that reflects from his jacket, which takes over the tank and is complemented by peripheral deep blues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back to this scene, the vivid fuchsia hair behind Howard is an extreme shade of pink that alludes to the hyper-emotional spirit of the club sequence and Howie’s inability to control himself. It stands in opposition to the kinder shade of pink that adorns his showroom and makes him feel at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-phil-stealing.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Stealing\" class=\"wp-image-359622\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-phil-stealing.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-phil-stealing-768x322.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The KMH Gems &#38; Jewelry showroom has a lot to offer by way of color. To start, it looks like a Kardashian Easter in there: pastel pink and yellow, bright whites, chrome, gold, luxury dangling from the walls, monotoned navy jewelry stands, blossomed flowers. It’s too messy to determine a clean color scheme, but we can interpret the colors into the ground, specifically the blush pink, canary yellow, and white.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shop is also chock full of glass that creates the thematic illusion of transparency, which couldn’t be more absent from a place than it is from KMH. This is Howard’s swindling hub after all. Like he is (or, in this case, was) a living, breathing obfuscation of honesty, the reflective glass around the shop is an obfuscation of fluorescence that keeps the place glowing, even when he’s dead and gone and there’s blood on the walls. Fluorescence is light at its most extreme, most unrelenting, and least tolerable. It matches Howard in that. Phil, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we see the putridly evil Phil (Keith William Richards) pillaging the shop for his loot after delivering one of the most notorious shocks in modern film history: a bullet that sends an elated Howard to his grave. If you were lucky enough to see <em>Uncut Gems</em> in theaters, the sound of the gunshot was probably drowned out by the shrieks it precipitated. But at least Howard died at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While KMH is probably none of these things to most of us, to Howard it’s calming, secure, and familiar, sentiments evoked by more delicate shades of pink. When Howard can’t go home because of a bloody nose, he goes to KMH. When he hits rock bottom after the auction goes south, he goes to KMH. When he needs to focus, he goes to KMH. There, he is in control. He has hope. He might even prefer it to his actual home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The white neon rods turn into a rosy glow the further we get from the center of them, both colors matching the beautiful flowers centered ironically on a doubly murderous Phil. The white flowers with yellow centers nearly blend into Phil’s inverse-colored button-down. White is often associated with sterility, which is ever-present here, but it’s also connected to businesses and institutions, and no one means business more than Phil, hence wearing a shirt crowned by a stiff white collar. And, if you’re secretly happy about Howard’s death for Julia’s sake, white happens to represent new beginnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yellow, on the other hand, signals impatience, egotism, cowardice, impulsion, and spite, all of which apply to the combustible Phil. I hate to kick him while he’s down, but they apply to Howard. He lays just below the screen, mouth slightly agape, his small, black, rimless glasses directing the attention away from his wide eyes and into the bullet-carved tunnel in his cheek that will lead us into the infinite beyond.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/iar62zjJh9M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 21:16:35 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-gem-exterior.jpg","linkMd5":"c36d6a04262a85110ac3cfc09bb39547","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn5@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-07-304_b5c2e3154ec92ca7.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":335,"sourceBytes":53090,"destBytes":22386,"author":"Luke Hicks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-gem-exterior.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn5@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-07-304_b5c2e3154ec92ca7.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-gem-interior.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn28@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-08-429_ae1a63dba0c02303.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-red-neon-tunnel.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn13@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-08-515_b70d54de6750cc23.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-club-orange-blue.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn36@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-17-740_4b55b59a10df6a6e.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/uncut-gems-phil-stealing.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn44@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-08-486_95427297ea01f142.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/iar62zjJh9M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn64@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-08-456_56c7da33016624cf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374989028},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","title":"25 Things We Learned from Bong Joon-ho’s ‘Parasite’ Commentary","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359388","description":"<p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Welcome to </i><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\"><a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/commentary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/commentary/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-521\">Commentary Commentary,</a></i></b><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\"> where we sit and listen to filmmakers talk about their work, then share the most interesting parts. In this edition, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/rob/\">Rob Hunter</a> revisits the best film of 2019, Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Bong Joon-ho&#8217;s Parasite.</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p>This may be hard to believe, but it was only nine months ago that <strong>Bong Joon-ho</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Parasite</em></strong> stormed the Academy Awards and won four Oscars including Best Picture. It&#8217;s been available on Blu-ray for some of that time, but now Criterion has released the film loaded with new extra features.</p>\n<p>Along with the new interviews we get a commentary track featuring Bong and a British film critic. The duo recorded the <em>Parasite</em> commentary during the pandemic with the filmmaker in Seoul and the critic in London, and it&#8217;s an informative and engaging listen. Now keep reading to see what I heard on the <em>Parasite</em> commentary!</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Parasite (2019)</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Commentators: Bong Joon-ho (writer/director), Tony Rayns (critic/moderator)</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> The onscreen title uses spirals in its script where normally there would be circles, and Bong says it originated with the original poster design. The artist did it there, and the filmmaker loved it &#8220;because a spiral feels like a parasite in our body.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Both families&#8217; homes were built from scratch as Bong wanted &#8220;full control&#8221; of their living spaces. The street outside the opening window is all a facade constructed inside a large water tank.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Rayns points out some similarities in scenes between this film and Bong&#8217;s earlier work &#8212; the fumigation in <em>Barking Dogs Never Bite</em> (2000), the shaking pizza boxes in <em>Tokyo!</em> (2008) &#8212; and Bong replies &#8220;Tony, you are the man who knew too much. I am very uncomfortable with it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Asked if he himself has a scholar&#8217;s stone (as seen in the film), Bong replies that he&#8217;s no fan of the real ones. &#8220;I hate something heavy.&#8221; His father collected them, though.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Bong storyboards everything, and that means he never has to shoot coverage shots as everything is planned out precisely.</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Akira Kurosawa&#8217;s <em>High and Low</em> (1963) is one of Bong&#8217;s favorite films, and elements of it inspired this movie.</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> The wealthy family&#8217;s home was built for the film, but only the first floor is real as the second floor of the exterior is CG. The interior of the second story, along with the basement, is a soundstage.</p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> Asked if there&#8217;s greater meaning to the Park family&#8217;s appreciation (appropriation?) of Native American paraphernalia, Bong suggests that it&#8217;s no deeper than someone deciding to wear a Che Guevara tee-shirt.</p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> Rayns asks about the arrow sticking out of the little boy&#8217;s behind, and Bong laughs. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t misunderstand, not every Korean nine-year-old boy has something on the butt.&#8221; It was a detail he just added to his storyboard of the scene even though it isn&#8217;t in the script.</p>\n<p><strong>10.</strong> Bong was never given an Americanized name like some of his fellow Koreans &#8212; and like Mr. Park in the film who goes by Nathan &#8212; but he mentions that he learned his surname, Bong, has a meaning in the US. His first distributor in the US actually sat him down and explained what a bong is &#8220;and they actually gave me a real bong as a gift after the promotion of <em>The Host</em>.&#8221; He adds that it caused him some trouble at the airport.</p>\n<p><strong>11.</strong> Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-sik, and Lee Jeong-eun were already in Bong&#8217;s mind when writing the script as he had worked with them all previously and knew they&#8217;d be perfect fits here.</p>\n<p><strong>12.</strong> He&#8217;s not sure why he named the rich father&#8217;s company Another Brick, but he thinks it might have been because he was a huge fan of Pink Floyd when he was in high school.</p>\n<p><strong>13.</strong> Rayns points out how Bong&#8217;s films, Parasite in particular, never stops to deliver exposition and instead builds its story on the move. &#8220;I was very inspired by George Miller&#8217;s <em>Mad Max Fury Road</em>. That movie never stops, all physical action and movement, it just keeps going going going, but all the background information and story occurs quite naturally.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>14.</strong> When it comes to scenes featuring long conversations between characters, Bong is inspired by the works of Martin Scorsese and the Coen Brothers who he views as masters of such things.</p>\n<p><strong>15.</strong> When the Parks leave on vacation and the Kims take over the house, the poorer family celebrates with food and drink. The alcohol opens the door to some ambiguity, though, regarding the Kim family&#8217;s tight relationship as friction grows between them. &#8220;Ambiguity makes audiences very nervous, and there is some tension,&#8221; says Bong.</p>\n<p><strong>16.</strong> A throwaway line early in the film regarding how the housekeeper eats so much, almost as if she&#8217;s eating for two, is one of many sly nods to the narrative surprise in the film&#8217;s second half with the man in the basement. Bong thanks Rayns for being the first person to mention that to him over the entire press tour &#8220;from Cannes to Oscar.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>17.</strong> &#8220;As a screenwriter,&#8221; says Bong, he really hates elements like CCTV recordings, mobile phones, and other technological advancements that get in the way of story.</p>\n<p><strong>18.</strong> The ram-don dish is popular in South Korea, but Bong added the sirloin into it for the film&#8217;s wealthy characters. &#8220;I never tried it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>19.</strong> The Park couple engage in some heavy petting and fully-clothed handy-work while on the couch, and Rayns mentions it&#8217;s as explicit of a sex scene as Bong has ever filmed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not that perverted guy,&#8221; says Bong. &#8220;I&#8217;m a very light and pleasant man.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>20.</strong> The gym in the film is the same place where Bong filmed the quarantine sequence in <em>The Host</em> (2006). He didn&#8217;t realize it and was reminded by a member of the crew. &#8220;Oh fuck!&#8221; was his reply.</p>\n<p><strong>21.</strong> Heads up to anyone planning a visit to South Korea &#8212; post-pandemic, obviously &#8212; as Bong points out that early September is the country&#8217;s sunniest time of year.</p>\n<p><strong>22.</strong> Real trees are expensive, so half of the ones seen encircling the Park&#8217;s back yard are created via CG composites.</p>\n<p><strong>23.</strong> Bong has shown black &#38; white versions of <em>Parasite</em> and <em>Mother</em> (2009), and Rayns asks him why. &#8220;I can not suppress my desire to have my own black &#38; white movie.&#8221; Criterion&#8217;s new Blu-ray of <em>Parasite</em> features the b&#38;w version as an extra feature.</p>\n<p><strong>24.</strong> <em>Parasite</em> brought Bong a level of exposure and success that he hasn&#8217;t known before, but he doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s affected him. &#8220;Still I don&#8217;t know what happened, it&#8217;s quite strange.&#8221; He&#8217;s writing the script for his next film and says it all feels the same as far as the process goes. He did send one of his Oscars to his mom&#8217;s house, though.</p>\n<p><strong>25.</strong> The song over the end credits is called &#8220;A Glass of Soju&#8221; and features lyrics written by Bong. &#8220;Please try this song in karaoke, so I can earn some money from it.&#8221;</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Best in Context-Free Commentary</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote\">“I love fumigation.”</p>\n<p>&#8220;He smells it. It&#8217;s very perverted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No self-incrimination on this commentary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wow, this is very violent. This is so crazy. So horrible. Who is the director?&#8221;</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Final Thoughts on the &#8216;Parasite&#8217; Commentary</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><em>Parasite</em> remains an all-timer and a film that no one will begrudge winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Bong Joon-ho&#8217;s commentary reveals him to be a talented filmmaker who shares his accolades with the cast and crew he brought along for the production. It&#8217;s a good listen.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Read more <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/section/features/commentary/\">Commentary Commentary</a> from the archives.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/MwCdmq9qOh4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 04:46:46 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"27cc25fbcc46d964e4e3e770382d8db8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/MwCdmq9qOh4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn52@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-11-260_23c97b892920eb76.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374989028},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","title":"What is a Western, Anyway?","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359357","description":"\n<p id=\"block-04637504-093d-4be3-a121-b1015ed34453\"><em>Welcome to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web. Today, we&#8217;re watching a dissection of the genre conventions of traditional Hollywood Westerns.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the great things about genres is that they work on a framework of expectations—a web of images, plot devices, stock characters, and themes—that create a promise with the audience. Whether that promise will hold over several decades and cultural shifts is another matter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as genres are concerned, the journey of the Western is one of the most intriguing. Pre-war classical Westerns laid the foundations for what were to become givens: desolate landscapes, dueling gun-play, and rogues partial to quelling violence with violence. At their best, these were stories about society and what the individual stood to gain and lose by entering it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, because the genre&#8217;s foundation is built on a specific flavor of heroism, shifting cultural attitudes around &#8220;what makes a hero&#8221; impacted the Western more directly than other genres. More specifically, the cynicism of the 1960s challenged the classical Western&#8217;s assumptions, sowing seeds of criticism that would complicate the genre&#8217;s stronghold on the cultural conscious. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video essay below charts the course of the Western in more detail from the genre&#8217;s key players to its shifting thesis and to its modern incarnations. It may not be possible to make a classical Western today, but we can still approach the good, the bad, and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-searchers-native-women/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the ugly</a> of the genre with some historical distance. And we can still work from inside the Western to make a point about our changing views of heroism. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-b5ac606c-b74a-4cab-a663-701ec85c7024\">Watch &#8220;<strong>Westerns: Is the Genre Dead?&#8221;</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"HOW TO SEE | Westerns: Is the Genre Dead?\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOeMHxBgShs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-da44f2c0-01e5-442d-b111-649cfba1b5a9\">Who made this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This video is a part of the <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong>&#8216;s &#8220;How to See&#8221; series, in which curators introduce their favorite film subjects. <strong>Dave Kehr</strong>, the Adjunct Curator in MoMA&#8217;s Department of Film, wrote and narrated this video.

This week, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a> reviews Season 4 of Netflix&#8217;s award-winning historical series The Crown.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>The Crown</em></strong> has always been a tragedy. Beginning with its earliest episodes, the impeccably made Netflix series has worked to lay bare the British monarchy’s vicious cycle of antiquated traditions, unforgivable actions, and soul-crushing personal standards. It’s no surprise, then, that the season that finally introduces Diana (<strong>Emma Corrin</strong>), Princess of Wales, is one of the series’ strongest.</p>\n<p>Season 4 of <em>The Crown</em> could’ve easily become the Princess Diana show, framing the young, ill-fated bride of Prince Charles (<strong>Josh O’Connor</strong>) as the protagonist. Corrin is phenomenal in the role thanks to both her grounded, complex performance and her uncanny likeness to the late royal; she has Diana down, from the wide, mascara-rimmed eyes to the ever-evolving personal style. It’s a shame that she’s only playing Diana for one season (Elizabeth Debicki <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/the-crown-princess-diana-elizabeth-debicki-season-5-and-6-1234736571/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">will play her</a> in Seasons 5 and 6), as it’s tough to imagine anyone else embodying Diana with the presence that Corrin does. Rather than put her front and center, though, <em>The Crown</em> opts for a more elliptical approach, with plots that veer away and circle back around Diana like a bird of prey closing in.</p>\n<p><em>The Crown</em> began to feel a bit unmoored after Claire Foy<strong>’</strong>s planned exit at the end of Season 2. It was as if the series&#8217; writers weren’t sure where to put its focus once Queen Elizabeth (played now by <strong>Olivia Colman</strong>) had settled into her role as monarch. But whereas the <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-crown-season-3-real-stories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">third season</a>’s uneven tone was likely accidental, Season 4 seems to be a bit off-kilter by design. This is a darker, more fractured picture of the royal family than we’ve seen before, and their anguish and infighting are mirrored on the world stage. South African Apartheid, The Troubles in Ireland, and the Falklands War all take place during this ‘70s and ‘80s-set season, which also somehow finds time to include a natural disaster, and several smaller palace scandals to boot.</p>\n<p>At times, <em>The Crown</em> Season 4 is overstuffed, but whenever it returns to Diana, the series captures an aching, isolated quiet that balances out everything going on beyond the palace walls. <em>The Crown</em> has always been open enough to appeal to viewers who come to the show with little historical context, but it also frequently digs deep to deliver lesser-known stories that would intrigue even the most obsessive followers of the monarchy. With Diana, this approach is impossible. Sadly, everyone who lived through this period in history knows nearly every private detail of her short life.</p>\n<p>Series creator/writer <strong>Peter Morgan</strong> seems to recognize this, and he accordingly imbues Corrin’s scenes with a sense of heartbreaking desperation for a fairy-tale ending that will never be. In fact, scenes between Diana and Charles &#8212; who doesn’t even attempt to hide his affair with married ex Camilla (<strong>Emerald Fennell</strong>) &#8212; are often so contentious that they make this season practically binge-proof. Just as Diana endlessly yearns for a safe haven, viewers will likely need some breathing room after a few hours trapped inside the couple’s claustrophobic marriage.</p>\n<p>If <em>The Crown </em>Season 4 has a secret weapon to smooth over its rough edges, it’s <strong>Gillian Anderson</strong> as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. As with John Lithgow’s Winston Churchill, Anderson&#8217;s take on Thatcher is complex, thorny, and mostly absent of absolution. Her performance is a steady one befitting of Thatcher’s Iron Lady title. At first, it’s tough to get past her big hair and gravelly voice, but by the season’s later episodes, the characters’ subtleties have become clear. A microscopic break in the stone-faced woman’s composure is equivalent to an average woman’s &#8212; or as Thatcher and her internalized sexism would put it, a lesser woman’s &#8212; teary breakdown. As we watch her stubbornly grimace her way through a man’s world, it’s impossible not to be impacted by her story, even as her political and ideological failures remain on full display.</p>\n<p>If the first few seasons of the series<em> </em>are connected by a through-line of reluctantly fulfilled duties, <em>The Crown </em>Season 4 marks a turning point by instead meditating on failure. Elizabeth has failed to raise well-adjusted children. Her sister, Margaret (<strong>Helena Bonham Carter</strong>), has failed to lead a happy life. Charles and Diana’s marriage seems to be failing from the start. The monarchy is failing to stay relevant, and the British government is failing to represent its people.</p>\n<p><em>The Crown</em> has always deftly created self-contained plots that hold a mirror up to the present day, reflecting our specific political and socio-economic issues back at us from a comfortable historical distance of half a century or more. But as it approaches the modern-day, <em>The Crown</em> has entered a dark night of the soul. Although the series itself remains untouchable among its contemporaries in terms of costuming, production design, and cinematography, by Season 4’s end, the monarchy itself has lost all beauty. The more damning Morgan’s historic retelling becomes, though, the harder it is to look away. God save the Queen.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/dkpdg6sMNR4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 12:15:49 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c29b28bd2f8effb8e50159a8bc82a4a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Valerie Ettenhofer","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/dkpdg6sMNR4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn76@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-22-826_e2eeb7ae92a45232.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374989028},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","title":"‘The Mandalorian’ Chapter 11 Exposes a Dark Truth About Our Hero","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359626","description":"<p><em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-mandalorian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The Mandalorian Explained</strong></a> is our ongoing series that keeps an eye on Lucasfilm’s saga about the Galaxy’s most dangerous single dad.

With each passing chapter of <strong><em>The Mandalorian</em></strong>, Han Solo’s bucket of bolts looks shinier and shinier.</p> \n<p>Ms. Frog (<strong>Misty Rosas</strong>)&nbsp;delivers on what she promised last week. Sorta. Like everything in <em>The Mandalorian</em>, the answers that are sought arrive in an unexpected and often backward fashion.</p> \n<p>Mr. Frog, Ms. Frog’s mate, points Mando to a local Trask cantina. Inside, the waiter accepts credits for information and draws a seat at Mando’s table for a Quarren, a.k.a. the Kenner action figure <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quarren\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">known as Squid Face</a>. Everyone in this galaxy seems to know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who has seen a Mandalorian. What’s Mando to do but trust he’s traveling in the right direction.</p> \n<p>Sailing aboard the Quarren’s barge, Mando and his egg-sucking, force-wielding traveling companion observe these simple fishermen at work. Except they’re not so simple, are they? They’re another bunch of traitorous jerks who joyously feed Mando and the child into the belly of a Mamacore, which must be the aquatic second-cousin to <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sarlacc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tatooine’s Sarlacc</a>.</p> \n<p>While Mando fruitlessly bashes his fists against the cage trapping him below water, and Baby Yoda navigates god-knows-what in their passage through the Mamacore’s bowels, rescue arrives from above. Three Mandalorian warriors land on the barge and immediately go to work against the Quarren fishermen. Their succinct annihilation of the squiddies highlights Mando’s embarrassing show as a badass.</p> \n<p>Frankly, ever since he started playing dad, Mando has lost his edge. Compassion for the green critter requires him to place his faith in others so that he may reunite the youngling with their people. With his fellow Mandalorians’ appearance, maybe Mando can shed his little bundle and get back into the selfish business of kicking butt.</p> \n<p>Ah, but the finish line keeps getting moved further and further away. These Mandalorians are not who our Mandalorian was expecting to find. These Mandalorians remove their helmets without the threat of dishonor. This is not “The Way.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-mandalorian-explained-bo-katan-kryze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As we were expecting</a>, <strong>Katee Sackhoff&nbsp;</strong>reveals herself to be the Mandalorian leader Bo-Katan Kryze and “The Heiress” of Chapter 11’s title. Most of her backstory exists within&nbsp;<strong><em>The Clone Wars</em></strong> animated series, but the basic gist is that she’s the surviving sister of Duchess Satine, struck down by Maul when he took command of their planet. She originally sided with the Mandalorian terrorist cell known as Death Watch, who aided Maul in his rise to power.</p> \n<p>Watching Maul rule over her people caused tremendous shame to boil in her soul. Bo-Katan led a civil war that nearly tore her planet apart during <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/clone-wars-explained-darth-maul-phantom-apprentice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Clone Wars</em>‘ final four episodes</a>. Eventually, Maul got booted from his seat of power, and Bo-Katan was named regent of Mandalore. However, as seen in <strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong>: <strong><em>Rebels</em></strong>,&nbsp;The Emperor placed his puppet Gar Saxon in charge, and a second civil war erupted.</p> \n<p>Mandalorian rebel Sabine Wren (who will no doubt appear in <em>The Mandalorian</em> sooner or later) wrestled the fabled Darksaber from Maul and bequeathed it to Bo-Katan. According to tradition, whoever wields the ancient weapon claims the right to lead all of Mandalore. We still don’t know how she lost the Darksaber to Moff Gideon (<strong>Giancarlo Esposito</strong>), the Imperial villain who climaxed last season by sawing his way out of his crashed Tie Fighter using the blade.</p> \n<p>If Bo-Katan wishes to redeem herself for the part she played in her sister’s death and restore harmony to her people, she must have the Darksaber. To do that, she’s gotta kill her way through a whole mess of Stormtroopers. Partnering with a Mandalorian armored in Beskar steel sure would be handy.</p> \n<p>Mando wants none of it. The moment these three remove their helmets ignites a shiver of contempt into his being. The way he sees it, Bo-Katan and her cronies are not true Mandalorians. They betray their people with their smiles.</p> \n<p>Bo-Katan recognizes his disgust as a trait held by “The Children of the Watch.” Meaning, Mando belongs to the zealots who once chose Maul as their master. Death Watch is an aggressive splinter group — a “my way or the highway” kind of organization. Cracking such stringent education will prove nearly impossible for Bo-Katan, but her knowledge of Jedi whereabouts proves to be enough encouragement to wrangle Mando to her cause for at least one mission.</p> \n<p>The four Mandalorians storm an Imperial cruiser looking to leave orbit. The Stormtroopers inside are a feckless lot of lemmings, practically throwing themselves in front of blaster fire. The ship’s poor captain (<strong>Titus Welliver</strong>) alerts boss Gideon of the invasion, and the Moff orders him to play Kamikaze and crash the ship.</p> \n<p>Mando and Bo-Katan stop him from doing so but cannot halt the captain from ingesting an eclectic suicide pill. The Mandalorians strike a tiny blow against the remnants of the Empire, but Bo-Katan is no closer to possessing the Darksaber. She could use Mando by her side, but he refuses the offer. The Child is his top priority.</p> \n<p>Bo-Katan is true to her word, giving thanks to Mando by supplying him with the last known coordinates of Ahsoka Tano. <em>The Clone Wars</em> and <em>Rebels</em> fans quiver in anticipation, as Tano proved to be the only Jedi worth a damn when <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/clone-wars-explained-ahsoka-gone-with-a-trace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">she turned her back on the Order</a> after it became clear they had lost their way. As an inevitable pair, Mando and Tano could prove to be two of the franchise’s most disgruntled warriors.</p> \n<p>Learning that there are many ways of being a Mandalorian, not just one, will cause a serious existential crisis for Mando. The dark history of Death Watch could knock a chink in the gunslinger’s armor and be the first step in freeing Pedro Pascal’s beautiful mug. He does not need to hide. He can be one tough dude and still expose his face now and again.</p> \n<p>The question remains whether finding Ahsoka Tano will bring him closer to offloading Baby Yoda. Considering that every step he has taken so far only leads to further travel, it’s looking less likely that the bounty hunter will ever separate from the kid. <em>The Mandalorian</em> Chapter 11 is the origin story of a family: a father and a son.</p> \n<p>The kid is showing Mando that there is more to life than killing goons and collecting credits. “The Way” is not adhering to doctrine; it’s caring for those that need it. Without Mando, the Child would have fallen under the scalpel of the Empire, and the galaxy would have returned to their grip sooner than it did (the First Order is still on the horizon, folks). Without the child, Mando would be just another bum bumbling from one corpse to the next.</p> \n<p>Baby Yoda offers Mando the chance to be one of the glorious heroes that populate Mandalorian legends. The kid is ridding the cowboy of selfishness. By extending his hand to one, Mando begins his reach to help many others. Bo-Katan has her cause, and now, Mando has his. The universe is better for it.</p> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/9hOS_bTzym0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 16:38:04 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"83dd67edb9dc69538b5bce32ea00caef","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brad Gullickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/9hOS_bTzym0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn18@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-08-464_29e4a0c51bac989f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605374989028},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:29:49","title":"The Ending of ‘Ad Astra’ Explained","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=359292","description":"<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/ending-explained\"><em><strong>Ending Explained</strong></em></a><i> is a recurring series in which we explore the finales, secrets, and themes of interesting movies and shows, both new and old. This time, we head out in search of the meaning of the ending of Ad Astra.</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From its opening sequence, <strong>James Gray</strong>’s </span><strong><i>Ad Astra </i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">promises to be an exciting outer space odyssey. The film hardly begins before we are thrust into the spectacle of rugged, space-suit-clad Roy McBride (<strong>Brad</strong> <strong>Pitt </strong>in a <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?s=ad+astra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">career-defining</a> performance) tumbling to earth from a Space Antenna in a shocking, nerve-pinching sequence. From this moment on, we settle in for what we assume will be a thrilling space-romp like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Man</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Martian</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. What we get, however, is much, much different. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason for Roy’s epic plunge is a power surge that came from a mysterious device near Neptune. Was this power surge a terrorist attack? It’s starting to look suspiciously like it. To make things more complicated, a space mission called The Lima Project went radio-silent right around that exact area. Oh, and just because things weren’t quite weird enough, Roy’s thought-dead father, H. Clifford McBride (<strong>Tommy Lee Jones</strong>), was a part of The Lima Project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how do we make sense of all of this? Is Roy’s dad alive? And, if so, is he behind a massive terrorist attack on Earth? Roy is sent to Mars to communicate with Clifford in the hopes that a response would help those on Earth identify his exact location, and hopefully prevent future mayhem. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ad Astra </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comes to its climax when Roy, after receiving communication from his father, disobeys the orders from his superiors and travels to the outskirts of Neptune to bring the senior Clifford back to earth. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Clifford doesn’t want to go home. It turns out that the reason The Lima Project went silent in the first place was that those aboard the mission failed to find anything to support their theory that extraterrestrial life exists out there. But Clifford believes it </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exist somewhere out there in space, and he’ll do anything to find it. And if that means becoming an old man, alone in a broken-down spacecraft, and never seeing his son again, that’s a price he’s more than happy to pay. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, Roy makes the most devastating choice of his life: he leaves his father behind forever and returns back home to Earth. Despite his heartache, waiting for Roy back home is his wife, Eve (<strong>Liv Tyler</strong>), and, most importantly, the revelation that there probably isn’t extraterrestrial activity in space like his father thinks. And that’s okay. And, furthermore, if there </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, well, it doesn’t matter anyway. Perhaps his father will find some alien forms up on Neptune. But regardless, Clifford will remain alone: physically and psychologically. Roy now knows that his home is on Earth, and that he is far from alone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ad Astra, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/8C9JZUXV5eI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roy is rescued from his spacecraft</a> back on Earth. A group of men runs toward him. At first, they look like aliens, but when they come into focus, they are unmistakably human. Roy seems to have this realization at the same moment we do and smiles as he is greeted, tears in his eyes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While being quarantined following his expedition, Roy says, “I look forward to the day my solitude ends, and I am home.” Indeed, Roy’s solitude in quarantine is physical, and he is looking forward to being physically reconnected with his loved ones. But his solitude up until this point has been persistently psychological. For his entire career, Roy felt as though there was something missing. He imagined that without his father, and without the knowledge that we are not alone in the universe, he was alone. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ad Astra</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> posits, then, that as long as you believe there is something greater waiting for you beyond your own home, you are living in solitude. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What begins as a space-adventure becomes much, much more about Earth than space. Great space films have always told us that we have to venture to the edges of the universe to really appreciate our own humanity. Take Andrei Tarkovsky’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solaris</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Stanley Kubrick’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2001: A Space Odyssey</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Both films feature a heroic venture to the outskirts of atomic capabilities only to discover a newfound appreciation for human life. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ad Astra </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does something similar, but it is never really about space to begin with. It is never about unexplored planets, or alien communication, or extraterrestrial properties. It is about a father and a son, and the sacrifices the son must make to be whole again.</span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/pGtlhnyWTb8\" height=\"1\"
