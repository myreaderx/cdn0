They actually lie, and say that nicotine can cause erectile dysfunction – literally the opposite of the truth.</p> \n<p>Note that I will not necessarily encourage people to consume tobacco, and there are other ways to raise testosterone. Virtually all of those natural ways to raise testosterone, however, are also under attack by the globalist and Jewish tyrannical democracy system. The biggest one of all – much bigger than tobacco – is red meat. And just as the Biden people are attempting to replace pro-masculinity smokable tobacco with anti-masculinity smokable marijuana, they are attempting to replace red meat with soy and other estrogen-boosting poisons.</p> \n<p>Cutting through the attack on testosterone this way is something that you virtually only see on /pol/ or Daily Stormer. But there it is on Fox News, thanks to Tucker Carlson.</p> \n<p>Biden is banning menthol first, saying that too many black people smoke it, and he is their big top mommy who will protect them from the black lung (which is a confirmed total hoax).</p> \n<p>He closed with: “poor people don’t have many pleasures left in this country, why don’t we leave them alone for once – that’d be great.”</p> \n<p>What I’m trying to communicate here is this: Tucker is leading a full frontal assault on this globalist system.</p> \n<p>The only thing I can think of as I watch him just hit every single point, on down the line, is the Limp Bizkit song “Rollin’.”</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"618\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYnFIRc0k6E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>This is effectively a kamikaze mission. There is no reality in which Tucker does not eventually get arrested for saying this stuff, except in some reality where the United States federal government breaks up before they get around to arresting him.</p> \n<h2>Compare Him to Race-Hoaxer Hannity!</h2> \n<p>Just to see how great Tucker Carlson truly is, you should compare his show to Sean Hannity’s show, which is a literal monkey circus, promoting the most useless possible GOP establishment talking points, which are literally just shittier versions of Democrat talking points.</p> \n<p>Here’s Sean Hannity on Thursday, with an absolute shill promoting a racism hoax.</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"618\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dh-GSFdTkLk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>That is Tim Scott, who gave a speech in response to Joe Biden. It was the official Republican response to Joe Biden, and he promoted Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd murder hoax. It was actually amazing that the Republicans pushed this, and even more amazing that Sean Hannity supported it.</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"618\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DbBnEd20myY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Imagine being this useless. Imagine promoting a racism hoax after this last year wherein racism hoaxes were used to sabotage the entire society. Sean Hannity thinks this is fighting fire with fire – racism hoaxing the racism hoaxsters.</p> \n<p>Racism doesn’t exist. It is not a real thing. Black people are often disliked because they are stupid and violent. That is to say: the issue is not some abstract thing about “race” or “color of skin,” it is a behavior issue. It just so happens that unfortunately, just as all behavior is tied to genetics, the collective behavior patterns of blacks are tied to their group genetics. There, I just summed up the racism hoax in five short sentences.</p> \n<p>I do judge people by their character first. That’s why I do actually like certain, specific black people. Watch this specific black person who I do like responding to the terrible and worthless black shill Tim Scott.</p> \n<p><iframe width=\"618\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vnzqPCak2nQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>(That’s a full stream, here are the timestamps.)</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://dstormer6em3i4km.onion/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-30-at-3.47.18-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-499024\" src=\"https://dailystormer.su/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-30-at-3.47.18-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://dailystormer.su/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-30-at-3.47.18-PM.png 758w, https://dailystormer.su/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-30-at-3.47.18-PM-300x264.png 300w, https://dailystormer.su/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-30-at-3.47.18-PM-618x543.png 618w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px\" /></a></p> \n<p>However, what I also realize is that these black people that I do like stand out drastically as not a part of the norm of the blacks. Most black people are dangerous, vicious parasites, and most who are not that are worthless shills like Tim Scott. On the whole, black people should be denounced as a group, because as a group they are horrible. We can then add: “not all, not all.” That’s fine. But to pretend like there is not a serious issue with the overwhelming majority of black people is simply a lie. The establishment will not use so many words, but they will admit this, cynically, by saying that blacks must be promoted because of their race in order to compete with whites. It’s very straightforward. The Democrats are not secret skin-haters for saying that in order for blacks as a group to compete with whites as a group blacks have to have a bunch of special privileges. They are simply acknowledging an obvious reality.</p> \n<p>But Sean Hannity doesn’t want to acknowledge that reality. He wants to say “they say we secretly hate the color of skin but actually, they secretly hate the color of the skin – for proof, let’s go to this completely pointless colored gentleman who spews utterly worthless talking points on behalf of a globalist corporate establishment.”</p> \n<p>With all that’s happening on the earth, this is what Sean Hannity thinks is important to talk about.</p> \n<p>I don’t even think Hannity is afraid of losing anything. I think he just legitimately believes in this stupid nonsense about how “our values” will eventually save us from the evils of the Demon-RATS.</p> \n<p>And here’s where the nightmare really begins: Hannity is actually a lot better than most other remaining conservative commentators. I used to make fun of the likes of Gavin McInnes and Sargon of Akkad, but those people are all gone now. What’s left is Hannity promoting race hoaxes and <a href=\"http://dstormer6em3i4km.onion/maga-2021-check-out-what-this-based-tranny-is-saying-about-fracking/\">Jack Posobiec promoting a literal tranny</a>.</p> \n<p>No one is even close to the level of Tucker, save for people who have already been marginalized completely, such as myself, Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes. The three of us have artificially had our audiences limited via massive, organized censorship – whereafter the government decided, in multiple Congressional committees, that our First Amendment rights are “not absolute.”</p> \n<p>The way Tucker stands out as both the most popular and powerful voice on the right, and also the most truthful, is simply amazing. It is amazing that at this time in history, he is allowed on air. What is not surprising is that the entire rest of the media is fixated on attacking him.</p> \n<p>This is what happens when you type “Tucker Carlson” into YouTube:</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://dstormer6em3i4km.onion/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-29-21.07.23-www.youtube.com-1a3d66c0d3ab.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-498890\" src=\"https://dailystormer.su/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-29-21.07.23-www.youtube.com-1a3d66c0d3ab.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"2892\" srcset=\"https://dailystormer.su/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-29-21.07.23-www.youtube.com-1a3d66c0d3ab.png 620w, https://dailystormer.su/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-29-21.07.23-www.youtube.com-1a3d66c0d3ab-64x300.png 64w, https://dailystormer.su/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-29-21.07.23-www.youtube.com-1a3d66c0d3ab-618x2883.png 618w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Tucker’s own shows are banned from appearing, and Google has hand selected only CNN and late night talk shows as being allowed to appear in the results. It’s not surprising really that Google would do this, but it is surprising just how much these people are talking about Tucker Carlson. (Note that Google is actually telling you to watch the Sean Hannity interview with that horrible colored chap instead of Tucker.)</p> \n<p>He is now Donald Trump. Well, technically, we’re all Donald Trump. But he is the head of the new collective Donald Trump that is “white supremacy” that is actually “normal Americans who just want to work, take care of their families, and be left alone.”</p> \n<p>Tucker might not save America. But he’s committed to going down with the ship.
