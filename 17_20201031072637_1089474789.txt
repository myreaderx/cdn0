And without the chromatic intensity of feeling life deeply and fully, why live at all? </p>\n<p>This elemental truth is especially pronounced in a creative life &#8212; a life that requires of us what Virginia Woolf called, in her <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/09/09/virginia-woolf-cotton-wool-moments-of-being/\">transcendent existential epiphany</a>, the &#8220;shock-receiving capacity&#8221; that makes an artist an artist. And yet we go to extreme lengths to avoid receiving this shock of aliveness, to avoid fully feeling the portions of the spectrum we deem unhandsome or inconvenient, to dull our own sadnesses and divert others from theirs, then walk away when we fail. It is a human impulse, this urge to shoo the sadness away. It is also dehumanizing, for only when we let the blues rush in with their full intensity do we become fully alive and awake to the dazzling spectrum of feeling that makes life worth living. </p>\n<p>That is what Canadian author <strong>Nadine Robert</strong> and Italian artist <strong>Valerio Vidali</strong> explore with great subtlety and tenderness in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Elephant-Nadine-Robert/dp/1592703127/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Shadow Elephant</em></strong></a> (<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/shadow-elephant/oclc/1200846436&#038;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shadow-Elephant-Nadine-Robert/dp/1592703127/?tag=braipick-20\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shadowelepant1.jpg?resize=680%2C565&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"565\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-71761\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shadowelepant1.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shadowelepant1.jpg?resize=240%2C199&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shadowelepant1.jpg?resize=320%2C266&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shadowelepant1.jpg?resize=768%2C638&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shadowelepant1.jpg?resize=600%2C499&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The book opens with a lovely quote from <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/03/exupery-little-prince-morgan-drawings/\"><em>The Little Prince</em></a>, line-broken like a poem:</p>\n<blockquote><p>And when you are comforted<br />\n(we all eventually are)<br />\nyou will be happy to have known me.<br />\nYou will always be my friend.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then the story unfolds, introducing the melancholy protagonist &#8212;

Self is thought, memory, belief. Self creates. Self destroys. Self learns, discovers, becomes. Self shapes. Self adapts. Self<br />\ninvents its own reasons for being. To shape God, shape Self.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>All prayers are to Self<br />\nAnd, in one way or another,<br />\nAll prayers are answered.<br />\nPray,<br />\nBut beware.<br />\nYour desires,<br />\nWhether or not you achieve them<br />\nWill determine who you become.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Butler&#8217;s sentiment is only magnified by knowing that the word <em>desire</em> derives from the Latin for &#8220;without a star,&#8221; radiating a longing for direction. It is by wanting that we orient ourselves in the world, by finding and following our private North Star that we walk the path of becoming. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_64209\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/i-see-great-cloud-masses-with-at-times-half-dimmd-saddend-far-off-star_framed-print?sku=s6-8967899p21a12v52a13v54?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=680%2C864&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"864\" class=\"size-full wp-image-64209\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=240%2C305&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=320%2C407&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=768%2C976&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/margaretcook_leavesofgrass23.jpg?resize=600%2C763&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Artist Margaret C.

E.E. Cummings knew this when he wrote half a century before Butler that <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/09/25/e-e-cummings-advice/\">&#8220;to be nobody-but-yourself &#8212; in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else &#8212; means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight.&#8221;</a> You win the fight, Butler intimates, by the clarity of your purpose and the perseverance with which you pursue it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you want a thing &#8212; truly want it, want it so badly that you need it as you need air to breathe, then unless you die, you will have it. Why not? It has you. There is no escape. What a cruel and terrible thing escape would be if escape were possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To want what you want so fiercely, to love it so absolutely, is not a personal indulgence in hubris or delusion &#8212; it is, Butler affirms, the mightiest antidote to the terrors of being alive and, in consequence, the fuel for your most generous contribution to the world:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Love quiets fear.<br />\nAnd a sweet and powerful<br />\nPositive obsession<br />\nBlunts pain,<br />\nDiverts rage,<br />\nAnd engages each of us<br />\nIn the greatest,<br />\nThe most intense<br />\nOf our chosen struggles.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Enlivening as this notion might be, even more enlivening is its manifestation in the shared struggle &#8212; for at its best, the art born of these private obsessions in the crucible of the Self goes on to touch other Selves, dissolving the isolating illusion of separateness and aloneness to furnish, in Iris Murdoch&#8217;s lovely phrase, <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2019/10/21/iris-murdoch-unselfing/\">&#8220;an occasion for unselfing.&#8221;</a></p>\n<hr /><h3>donating = loving</h3><p class=\"flipboard-keep\">Bringing you (ad-free) Brain Pickings takes me hundreds of hours each month.
