Here are a few ways Google can help you make informed travel decisions or revisit trips from holidays past.</p><p><b>Stay up to date on the latest travel information</b><br/></p><p>When you search on Google for information about hotels, flights or things to do, check to see if there’s a COVID-19 <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/flights-hotels/travel-advisories-and-airline-policies/\">travel advisory or restriction</a> for your destination. If there are no restrictions, you can see indicators for <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/flights-hotels/travel-decisions-with-confidence/\">travel reopening</a>, like the percentage of flights operating or hotels with availability, directly in your Search results. On <a href=\"http://google.com/travel\">google.com/travel</a> you can also see trends for flight and hotel availability over the past six months, as well as links to local resources, like the number of COVID-19 cases in the area.<br/></p><p><b>Book accommodation confidently</b><br/></p><p>Earlier this year we added a hotel <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/flights-hotels/travel-decisions-with-confidence/\">“Free cancellation” filter</a> on Search and google.com/travel to help you easily find properties with a refundable rate. In addition to refundable rates, many hotels and vacation rentals are taking additional measures to ensure the safety of guests in response to COVID-19. Now when you search for a place to stay on google.com/travel and view a specific property, you may see a tip when additional health and safety precautions, like enhanced cleaning, are being taken. Tap on the “About” tab to see the full list.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt='On google.com/travel on the hotels tab you see the Kimpton Brice Hotel overview with price and availability information.
