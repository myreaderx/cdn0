Ahead of the event, CEO Gregg Johnson (previously an executive at Salesforce) told me that customers have been asking Invoca to expand beyond its previous focus on providing &#8220;conversation intelligence&#8221; to marketing teams.</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8216;We need to get aligned on how we support the revenue journey,'&#8221; Johnson recalled businesses telling him. &#8220;We were already going down this path, but when COVID hit, we tripled down on it.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>He argued that the data that Invoca provides has become even more important during the pandemic and related lockdowns, when businesses only had &#8220;two sources of feedback&#8221; — digital interactions and customer conversations. And while there are plenty of analytics tools for tracking online behavior, Johnson said, &#8220;Customer conversations are really important because they get at why&#8221; people are behaving in a certain way.</p>\n<p>And at the same time, Johnson said call center teams have had to shift to working at home, which meant that they had to switch to online software and &#8220;everything broke,&#8221; while supervisors &#8220;no longer had any visibility into how agents were performing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2063347\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2063347\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2063347\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Invoca platform\" width=\"680\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg 1988w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg?resize=768,487 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg?resize=680,431 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg?resize=1536,974 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2063347\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Invoca</p></div></p>\n<p>Invoca is trying to address these issues by making sure that marketing, sales, customer experience and e-commerce teams all have access to the same call data.</p>\n<p>For example, he said that agents at Invoca customer <a href=\"https://www.bbqguys.com\">BBQGuys</a> need data to understand what products to recommend for their customers if the specific grill that they want isn&#8217;t available. Or a healthcare provider might use call data to predict and prepare when COVID cases might be rising in their area.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always viewed ourselves as an application and a platform,&#8221; Johnson added. &#8220;We already give you ability to use this data at Invoca to automatically apply these insights without any human intervention at all. So for us, we thought through use cases to feed this data into other tools and created four solutions &#8230; that are really joined at the hip.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Invoca for eCommerce, Invoca for Customer Experience and the existing Invoca for Marketing product are all available now, while Invoca for Sales is currently signing up beta testers for November.</p>\n<p>The Invoca Exchange, meanwhile, already includes more than 40 integrations, including Google, Salesforce, Facebook, Adobe, Tealium, and Five9. The company is also announcing new partnerships with FullStory and Criteo.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VS2cMJNHgS\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/call-intelligence-platform-invoca-grabs-30m-series-d-led-by-morgan-stanley-aip/\">Call intelligence platform Invoca grabs $30M Series D led by Morgan Stanley AIP</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Call intelligence platform Invoca grabs $30M Series D led by Morgan Stanley AIP&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/call-intelligence-platform-invoca-grabs-30m-series-d-led-by-morgan-stanley-aip/embed/#?secret=VS2cMJNHgS\" data-secret=\"VS2cMJNHgS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8YPb98FXWO8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 16:33:49 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg?w=680","linkMd5":"3882b6ac3d74e9f3f65b6418fc2f8147","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-54-04-904_8c5f3c5573287b7f.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":431,"sourceBytes":34300,"destBytes":34300,"author":"Anthony Ha","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Invoca_platform_view.jpg?w=680":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-54-04-904_8c5f3c5573287b7f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn68@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-55-34-838_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn1@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-55-34-994_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn66@2020_3/2020/10/20/16-55-34-826_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn78@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-55-34-855_ffed51ad4dcc0fd5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8YPb98FXWO8:J_yeV5ihNj4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn90@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-55-34-853_07d103763bb874e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8YPb98FXWO8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn5@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-55-34-814_93ce1e0f43eb1c28.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603212844792},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:54:04","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:54:04","title":"Google calls DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit “deeply flawed” in GIF-laden blog response","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2063319","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/google\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> was clearly anticipating today&#8217;s U.S. Department of Justice antitrust complaint filing – the company posted an extensive<a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj\"> rebuttal of the lawsuit to its Keyword company blog</a>. The post, penned by SVP of Global Affairs and Google Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker, suggests that the DOJ&#8217;s case is &#8220;deeply flawed&#8221; and &#8220;would do nothing to help consumers,&#8221; before going into a platform-by-platform description of why it thinks its position in the market isn&#8217;t representative of unfair market dominance that would amount to antitrust.</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s blog post is even sprinkled with GIFs – something that&#8217;s pretty common for the search giant when it comes to its consumer product launches.

These processes are both described as &#8220;trivially easy&#8221; by Walker in the post, but they do look like a bit of an own-goal when you notice just how many steps it takes to get the job done on desktop in particular, including what looks like a momentary hesitation in where to click to drill down further for the &#8220;Make Default&#8221; command.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2063330\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2063330\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2063330\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/setting_your_chrome_settings_on_desktop.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"864\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2063330\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Google also reportedly makes reference to companies choosing their search engine as default because of the quality of their service, including both <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Mozilla (with a link drop for our own Frederic Lardinois).
