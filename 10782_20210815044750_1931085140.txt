Each button is a mini-LCD screen, so you can customize it with any image or text you’d like, and you can have folders and multiple “Profiles” to add dozens and dozens of different shortcuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I purchased a <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/Stream-Deck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">15-button Stream Deck</a> just over a year ago to play around with, but I was skeptical: would I <em>really</em> find enough uses for it? Would it be worth taking up (an admittedly small amount of) space on my desk? Or would this be yet another device that would end up in The Box Of Broken Technology Dreams in my closet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year in, I can report that the Stream Deck has FAR surpassed my expectations, and is a tool I use throughout the day, every single day. It <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">saves me time</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/focus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">helps my focus</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I’m going to take you through the Stream Deck, how it works, what you can use it for, and what <em>I</em> use it for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is A Stream Deck?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name implies, the Stream Deck was originally designed for gamers and online streamers. You can see this when you go to <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the manufacturer&#8217;s website</a>, and when you do the initial setup, which we will see below, you’ll see a lot of the pre-loaded actions are for video and game streaming: things like switching cameras, soundboards, sending messages, recording clips, and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there’s a growing subculture that have found that even if you aren’t a gamer or a streamer (I am neither), the Stream Deck makes a <em>great</em> productivity tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using The Stream Deck for Productivity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some examples of the productivity things you can do with a Stream Deck, and remember: all of these happen with a single button press:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Launch apps, files, and folders</li><li>Control Zoom &#38; MS Teams (camera, mute/unmute, sharing, recording, leaving, etc.)</li><li>Automate Microsoft Office apps</li><li>Open a predefined set of browser tabs</li><li>Initiate keyboard shortcuts in any app (so you don’t need to remember them)</li><li>Start and display a mini-countdown timer or <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/pomodoro-technique/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pomodoro</a></li><li>Set up windows and apps exactly how you want them for specific purposes (examples: Email processing, writing, <a href=\"https://asianefficiencygo.com/organize-your-files-evergreen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">digital decluttering</a>, podcast recording, etc.)</li><li>Morning/Evening startup &#38; shutdown routines<br /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few examples but as you can imagine, the possibilities are endless.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stream Deck Models</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/Stream-Deck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stream Deck currently comes in 3 different sizes</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15-button model (this is the one I have).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1323\" height=\"948\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18169\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-15.jpg 1323w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-15-500x358.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-15-640x459.jpg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-15-768x550.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1323px) 100vw, 1323px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A larger 32-button model that also has a detachable cable</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1434\" height=\"1079\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-32.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18190\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-32.jpg 1434w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-32-500x376.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-32-640x482.jpg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-32-768x578.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1434px) 100vw, 1434px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A 6-button model</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1378\" height=\"946\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18170\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-6.jpg 1378w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-6-500x343.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-6-640x439.jpg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-6-768x527.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1378px) 100vw, 1378px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I am happy with the 15-button model, but if I were to go back in time I would probably purchase the 32. Even though you can expand the 15 button model with folders and Profiles (more on that below), you can have many more 1-press options with the 32.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would not recommend the 6 button model. It is so limited, and you will quickly wish “I had more buttons”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mobile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stream Deck Mobile</a> app for iOS and Android. For a monthly fee, you can use your phone or tablet as a virtual Stream Deck without needing to purchase extra hardware or having it take up space. I won’t be covering the mobile version because for me, the benefit is having those physical buttons there ready to press. The option is there for you if you want it, though!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How The Stream Deck Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve established that the Stream Deck has customizable buttons, so how do you customize them and start automating your workflow?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, you’ll need to download the Stream Deck app for Windows or Mac. Once you install it, you’ll be greeted with a blank Profile with one button.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1866\" height=\"1456\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-blank-profile.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18187\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-blank-profile.png 1866w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-blank-profile-500x390.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-blank-profile-640x499.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-blank-profile-768x599.png 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-blank-profile-1536x1199.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1866px) 100vw, 1866px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A <em>Profile</em> is a group of buttons that you can define. It could be buttons that you want collected by a certain work context (“I want my budget report buttons together”), or it could be buttons that you want to display only when a certain app is active (“I want my Outlook buttons to appear when I am in Outlook”).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the right is a list of predefined actions you can have the Stream Deck perform. To customize a button, you can drag one of the actions on to your desired buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let’s say we want to have a button that opens our Desktop folder. To do that, we will scroll down the list until we find the <em>Open</em> action. This lets you open apps, files, or folders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll drag it onto a button, give it a name if desired, and select the Desktop folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1868\" height=\"1456\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-open-desktop.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18173\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now when I press the physical button on my Stream Deck, my Desktop folder will appear in Finder or File Explorer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can customize the text size, position, or if you want a more minimalist look with no titles on the buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"980\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-text.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18180\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-text.png 980w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-text-500x208.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-text-640x266.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-text-768x320.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also change the icon to one from the Stream Deck’s built-in library, or you can add any image you’d like.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1070\" height=\"1062\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-icon.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18182\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-icon.png 1070w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-icon-500x496.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-icon-640x635.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-change-icon-768x762.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you do nothing else with the Stream Deck, the built-in <em>Website</em>, <em>Hotkey</em>, and <em>Open</em> commands are extremely helpful. They can open any URL, send a keyboard shortcut to an app, and open locations on your computer. You can automate a <em>lot</em> with these 3 commands.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"536\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-system-actions.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18172\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-system-actions.png 536w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-system-actions-465x500.png 465w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Expand Stream Deck with Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You aren’t limited to the actions that come with the Stream Deck. You can expand your device with plugins, which you can add in 2 ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Stream Deck Store &#8211; The “official” way</li><li>Import a custom plugin that you or someone else creates<br /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Stream Deck Store</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From the app, click the <em>Stream Deck Store</em> icon that looks like a mini rainbow Stream Deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1224\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-store.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18175\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-store.png 1224w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-store-500x152.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-store-640x195.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-store-768x233.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1224px) 100vw, 1224px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Store will open and you can add Plugins, Icons, Sound Effects, and more. You can scroll or search for the Plugin you want, and click the Install button.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3672\" height=\"2106\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-plugins-icons.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18183\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Custom Plugins</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many plugins that live outside of the Stream Deck store. For example, I use a <a href=\"https://github.com/Baptiewright/streamdeck-countdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Countdown Timer Plugin</a> as my Pomodoro timer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To install a custom plugin, download it from its website and unzip it if required, You will usually end up with a file that ends with <em>.streamDeckPlugin</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Double-click it and it will install it in the <em>Custom</em> section.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-custom-plugin.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18188\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p> In this example you can see the resulting <em>Countdown Timer</em> plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just be careful to only download custom plugins from sites you trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Profiles and Folders: Have More Actions Than Buttons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you buy a 6, 15, or 32-button Stream Deck, you aren’t just limited to that number of actions. Thanks to folders and Profiles, you can expand beyond the first “page” of buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Folders</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is my Stream Deck setup at the time of writing (don’t worry, I’ll cover each button below):</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1180\" height=\"766\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-profile.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18177\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-profile.png 1180w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-profile-500x325.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-profile-640x415.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-profile-768x499.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll see that I only have one free button. Does that mean I’m only limited to one more action? Of course not!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep it easy, let’s say I have a bunch of keyboard shortcuts that I can never remember.

The reason? You can use some automation tools on Windows and Mac to automate almost anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you can have your Stream Deck trigger those automations by pressing a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The automation tools are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Windows: <a href=\"https://www.autohotkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AutoHotkey</a></li><li>Mac: <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/keyboard-maestro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Keyboard Maestro</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Windows Automation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.autohotkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Autohotkey</a> is a scripting program, which unfortunately makes it a bit complex for less technical users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use AutoHotkey with Stream Deck, the usual workflow is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Create script to accomplish your desired automation</li><li>Assign the script a hotkey (<a href=\"https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here is documentation</a>)</li><li>Use the <em>Hotkey</em> action in Stream Deck to trigger that new hotkey from a button on the device<br /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is an example of <a href=\"https://nothans.com/stream-deck-autohotkey-powerpoint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using Autohotkey and Stream Deck to control Powerpoint</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t want to mess around with scripting, <a href=\"https://richday.uk/StreamDeck.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here are some awesome templates to control Teams, Outlook, Excel, and more</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac Automation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the Mac, <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/keyboard-maestro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Keyboard Maestro</a> is a visual tool that can control almost anything on your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a popular (albeit slightly dated) <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/technology/keyboard-maestro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Keyboard Maestro tutorial</a> to get started. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a number of options for triggering Keyboard Maestro automations from the Stream Deck:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hotkey</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Autohotkey on Windows, assign a hotkey in Keyboard Maestro, and then using the <em>Hotkey</em> action in the Stream Deck app, trigger that same hotkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Official Keyboard Maestro Plugin</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an “official” Keyboard Maestro plugin installable from the Stream Deck Store. All my older automations use this method.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is good that you can install it from the store, it is quite “fiddly”. You create the button using the Keyboard Maestro action, which gives you the row/column ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1086\" height=\"472\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18176\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro-2.png 1086w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro-2-500x217.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro-2-640x278.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro-2-768x334.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1086px) 100vw, 1086px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You then create the Keyboard Maestro automation and choose <em>this device key:</em> and press the Stream Deck button.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"424\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18192\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro.png 900w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro-500x236.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro-640x302.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-official-keyboard-maestro-768x362.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It works fine, but what happens if you decide to move the button or rearrange your Profiles?

So easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1050\" height=\"396\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-kmlink.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18185\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-kmlink.png 1050w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-kmlink-500x189.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-kmlink-640x241.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-kmlink-768x290.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t gotten around to switching up my old buttons, but all my new Stream Deck/Keyboard Maestro automations use KMLink.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How I Use The Stream Deck</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started using the Stream Deck, I followed our usual productivity advice: I started small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of trying to fill all buttons up right away, I started with one or two. Then I added button by button as more use cases came up. This is how I recommend you get started too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite things to use the Stream Deck for are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Setups</strong>: Press one button, and have my computer magically start and move apps, folders, and windows just as I like them.</li><li><strong>Zoom controls: </strong>I participate in a lot of online meetings (who doesn&#8217;t?), and I also record <a href=\"https://theproductvityshow.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Productivity Show </a>and other recordings for <a href=\"https://shop.asianefficiency.com/dojo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Dojo</a>, our online productivity community. So I am on Zoom and on camera a lot. I like having physical buttons to press so I can keep my focus on what is happening, and avoid the dreaded &#8220;Brooks, you&#8217;re on Mute&#8230;&#8221;</li><li>Other miscellaneous activities that I do multiple times a day.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not like I can&#8217;t do any of this without a Stream Deck, but having one-button access just makes things so much faster and easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At AE we like to say that <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcasts/352-small-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">small changes lead to big results</a>. In fact, as I type this, I am wearing a t-shirt that says <a href=\"https://theproductivityshow.com/plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">One Tweak A Week</a>. We truly believe this, and anything you can do to improve your <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/productivity/tea-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Time, Energy, and Attention</a> even a little bit will pay off over time. The Stream Deck does that for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"964\" height=\"582\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-numbered.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18194\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-numbered.png 964w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-numbered-500x302.png 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-numbered-640x386.png 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-bd-numbered-768x464.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 964px) 100vw, 964px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1: Blank</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will likely point to a Folder or Profile in the future. I left it blank for future use. Here’s where I’m really feeling the 15-button limit!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2: Morning Journaling Setup</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I do when I log in to my computer is press this button. It fires off a Keyboard Maestro automation that does the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Activate <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/omnifocus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OmniFocus</a> (my task manager)</li><li>Hits ⌘-7, the keyboard shortcut to show Completed tasks</li><li>Closes the OmniFocus inspector, closes the Sidebar, and moves the window to the right-side of the screen</li><li>Activates <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/ulysses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ulysses</a> (my writing app, where I am writing this and where I also happen to keep my Journal)</li><li>Move the Windows to the left-hand side of my screen</li><li>Jump to my Journal group in Ulysses</li><li>Create a new Sheet in Ulysses</li><li>Hits ⌘-3, the Ulysses shortcut to go to focused writing mode</li><li>Types out my Journaling Prompt, which also positions the cursor to the top<br /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a lot for one button! You can see there is then no friction to my doing my Journal. I hit 1 button and I can see what I did yesterday, and my cursor is ready to type my journal today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3: Podcast Setup</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot I need to set up when we’re about to record <a href=\"https://theproductivityshow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Productivity Show</a>. Having most of it wrapped up in this button helps: then everything is ready to go, and I can just focus on getting ready to record a good show. This also uses Keyboard Maestro to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Asks which episode number I’m recording</li><li>Activates my recording software and moves it to the top of my second monitor</li><li>Moves Slack to the bottom of my second monitor</li><li>Opens Google Chrome, opens it up to Google Docs and searches for the shownotes for this episode number so it is ready to open. Moves the Shownotes window to the right of my primary minter.</li><li>Creates a folder in our podcast editor’s Dropbox for this episode number<br /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to have it start the Podcast Zoom meeting too, but I found that often I want to do the setup before I want to go into the room itself. So now I move that to a separate button. I might change my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4&#38;5: Swap Google Chrome Profiles</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use different Chrome Profiles for my personal and Asian Efficiency stuff, and I am forever swapping between them through the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got annoyed with navigating menus to do that, so I created a Keyboard Maestro macro to do that for me. Then I added Stream Deck buttons to swap between them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a perfect example of automation that is so simple, but I love it so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6&#38;7: Start Zoom Meetings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have specific URLs for our internal AE meetings and recording The Productivity Show. These buttons go to those URLs, so I can just hit a button to go straight into Zoom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8: Countdown Timer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned before, this uses the custom <a href=\"https://github.com/Baptiewright/streamdeck-countdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Countdown Timer</a> plugin. Press the button once and it starts counting down with a little automation. Press within 1.5s and it ads 5 minutes. Press it again and it stops. Press it again within 1.5s and it resets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple but I like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>9: Start Podcast Recording</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fires off a Keyboard Maestro that starts up <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/audio-hijack-pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Audio Hijack</a> and hits the Record keyboard shortcut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I think about it, I don’t really need KM for this. Might refactor and simplify later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10: Turn on Do Not Disturb </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name says, turns on macOS’s Do Not Disturb feature. Uses the <em>Hotkey</em> action to send a keyboard shortcut that I defined in <em>System Preferences &#62; Keyboard &#62; Shortcuts &#62; Mission Control &#62; Turn Do Not Disturb On/Off</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>11-15: Controls Zoom</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These buttons come from the Zoom plugin that can be found in the Stream Deck Store. In order:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Turn Camera On/Off</li><li>Mute/Unmute Mic</li><li>Start/Stop Screen Share</li><li>Start/Stop Computer Recording</li><li>Leave</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It can do much more, but these are the features I use. I like this plugin because the buttons change based on on/off state, so you can see right away if you are muted/unmuted/etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, here is a picture I took during this morning&#8217;s Daily Huddle when I should have been listening to Thanh:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-active-zoom-640x209.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18202\" srcset=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-active-zoom-640x209.jpg 640w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-active-zoom-500x163.jpg 500w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-active-zoom-768x251.jpg 768w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-active-zoom-1536x502.jpg 1536w, https://www.asianefficiency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stream-deck-active-zoom-2048x669.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see that since I am in an active Zoom call, my buttons are blue instead of gray, and you can see my camera, mute, recording, and sharing status. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s Next For Me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My next steps are to add more &#8220;Setups&#8221; so that I can have more one-button control when I am switching roles and workflows. I will probably move those Zoom buttons into a folder, since they take up a whole row. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then again, despite what I said earlier, maybe that is a good excuse to upgrade to a 32-button model. Tempting…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do You Need A Stream Deck?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you need a <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/likes/Stream-Deck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stream Deck</a>? Well, unless you are a live streamer, I’d say of course you don’t <em>need</em> one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not like I am unproductive when I am away from my desk and therefore away from my Stream Deck. I don’t take it travelling with me. I can <a href=\"https://www.asianefficiency.com/systems/working-from-cafes-and-coffee-shops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">work from anywhere</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while I don’t <em>need</em> my Stream Deck, I do <em>love</em> my Stream Deck and would buy it again in a heartbeat. My skepticism from a year ago was completely unfounded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Setup buttons alone make it worth it to me, and over the next white, I plan to use Profiles and Folders, and other plugins to expand my use even more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any questions or favorite Stream Deck productivity tips, let us know on social media or leave a comment below.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 11:00:00
