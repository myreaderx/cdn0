Backpack</a> is designed to be a suitcase.  This one is designed <a href=\"https://www.enhancegaming.com/index.php?route=product/product&#38;path=675_839&#38;product_id=11489\" target=\"_blank\">to carry board games</a>.  This one is <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2018/05/20/belkin-classic-pro-laptop-backpack-review/\">for carrying a laptop</a>.  An <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/tag/edc/\">everyday carry</a> backpack, however, needs to find a sweet spot somewhere in the middle of these extremes.  It needs to be able to carry your laptop to the office, your books to class, and your clothes on a two-day business trip as well as have plenty of space for all the odds-and-ends that you might want to bring along.  Is the Drifter backpack from Targus the right bag for the job?  Read on to find out!</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>The name might make you think that this is only a bag for carrying your laptop around, but the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YABBWK\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">16″ Drifter II Laptop Backpack</a> is much more than that.  It’s an everyday carry backpack that has a secure compartment for a laptop but also has plenty of storage to help out employees, students, and travelers alike.  Its page on Targus’ website says that it is “built to last and made for travel.”</p>\n<h2>What’s in the

100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The design of this backpack is fairly standard.  It has a compartment for the laptop in the back, a large compartment in the middle, two smaller compartments up front, and a host of specialty compartments all around.  The bag is mostly black with a dash of grey on the front, and there are a handful of bright yellow accents, just enough to give it a splash of color.  The bag is reservedly attractive, providing a dignified look that would be appropriate in most offices and classrooms.</p>\n<h3>Installation and setup</h3>\n<p>No installation is required.  Take the backpack out of its bag, remove a label or two, and it’s ready to go.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304263\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-4-800x708.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"708\"

100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>First, let’s look at the various compartments in the Drifter, starting with the one in the back for the laptop.  As the name suggests, this backpack can hold up to 16” laptops. When I opened the zipper, I found there were actually 3 spaces in this compartment.  There’s one for the laptop, which easily accommodated my 15” MacBookPro; in fact, I think I could put two more laptops in there with it.  It has extra padding in front and behind as well as below, which I very much like, and a strap with Velcro to make sure the laptop doesn’t slip out.  My laptop should be well protected.  There’s a smaller, zippered mesh space, perfect for cables or a mouse.  The main space in the middle could hold a power brick, a mousepad, or anything else associated with a laptop.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304265\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-5-718x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"718\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-5-718x800.jpg 718w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-5-224x250.jpg 224w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-5-768x855.jpg 768w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-5.jpg 808w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px\"></p>\n<p>The next compartment is the main compartment.  It’s in the middle of the bag, and when I put my hand down into it and push towards the front of the bag, it extends out a full 7”, which provides a deceptively large amount of space.  I could easily fit enough clothes for a two-day business trip or a casual weekend at a friend’s house.  I put in eight full-sized, hardcover books, more than I would enjoy carrying around, and still had room left over!  This compartment also has a space to slip in a magazine and another zippered mesh space.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\"

100vw, 756px\"></p>\n<p>In front of the main compartment is a smaller one, about the right size for a couple of notebooks.  It’s deep but doesn’t have much volume.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304267\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-7-800x596.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"596\"

100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>At the very front is a smaller compartment with a host of pockets and spaces for storing all the little things that I inevitably need to take with me.  It can hold <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2020/04/27/mophie-powerstation-with-power-delivery-review/\">a power bank</a>, pens and pencils, USB keys, <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2020/02/15/the-fox-in-the-forest-card-game-review/\">a card game</a>, and so much more.</p>\n<p>Scattered around the Drifter are a host of smaller pockets.  On the front is a 4” padded and zippered pocket, perfect for slipping in your phone or a small journal.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304268\"

100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>On the top, just behind the handle, is a zipped compartment that is lined with soft fabric.  This is the perfect place to put my phone, <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2019/12/24/godbole-classic-and-slim-bifold-wallets-review/\">Godbolé wallet</a>, ring, watch, and other personal items when I’m going through security at the airport.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304269\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-9-800x508.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\"

100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>On the back of the backpack, somewhat concealed in one of the areas of the padding, is a hidden, 10” pocket.  If I were traveling overseas and doing some sight-seeing in a big city like London or Kuala Lumpur, then I would definitely use this to hide my most important valuables, like travelers checks, my passport, some extra cash, or a slip of paper with emergency phone numbers.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304270\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-10-798x800.jpg\" alt=\"\"

100vw, 798px\"></p>\n<p>Each side of the backpack has a pair of spaces.  One is for a smaller-size water bottle, held in place with some stretchy material, and another is a long, thin zippered pocket that looks like a great place to put some snacks.</p>\n<p>When all of these are considered together, it’s obvious that the Drifter has a lot of storage capacity and a wide variety of pockets and compartments for a wide variety of items.  I think it has a place for everything I would want to bring on a trip.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304271\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-11-762x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"762\" height=\"800\"

100vw, 762px\"></p>\n<p>Second, let’s consider the comfort of the backpack as a whole.  There are four areas of thick padding on the back, and the lower one is designed to provide lumbar support.  The straps are also padded along the entire inside length.  Taken together, they make wearing the Drifter pleasantly comfortable.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304272\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-12-800x431.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"431\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-12-800x431.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-12-300x162.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-12-768x414.jpg 768w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-12.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The straps can be adjusted in front, which tightens or loosens the backpack.  The only thing missing is a second set of adjustments on top of the straps, like those on <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2019/08/01/osprey-tropos-everyday-backpack-review/\">the Osprey Tropos</a>, which help to raise or lower the position of the backpack on the back.  This would be a nice addition but isn’t necessary.</p>\n<h3>Extra Features</h3>\n<p>The Drifter is made of durable nylon material, and thus I expect it will hold up under and normal wear and tear for many years.  The nylon is water-resistant, as is the specially-designed base, but it’s not waterproof, and Targus doesn’t advertise any rain covers that can be purchased.  I think this backpack will be fine in a brief shower, but I wouldn’t want to trust my laptop to it during a downpour or while hiking all day in the rain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304273\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/targus-drifter-13-800x486.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"486\"

100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The handle is made of sturdy plastic, and I can see the thick, metal wire that runs through it and the metal grommets that support it on each side.  The zippers are also sturdy, and I didn’t experience any problems opening or closing them.  I believe that this is a backpack that will last a long time; it’s an investment worth making.</p>\n<h2>What I like</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Spacious carrying capacity</li>\n<li>Many, varied storage compartments and pockets</li>\n<li>Strong, durable construction</li>\n<li>Comfortable padding</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I’d change</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>I’m very pleased with Targus’ 16” Drifter Laptop backpack.  I love all the various places to store items, the padding on the laptop pocket, the huge storage space in the central compartment, and the secret pocket in the back padding.  It has so many different places to store items that I don’t think I will ever say to myself, “I can’t find a place to put this!”  The construction is solid, and I believe that the Drifter will last a long time.  If you’re in the market for an everyday backpack, particularly one that can carry a laptop, then without any reservations I recommend that you put this backpack on your shortlist.</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong>: $47.74 on Amazon, $84.99 on Targus’ online

Specifically, it is an <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2020/06/07/ecovacs-deebot-ozmo-t8-aivi-robot-vacuum-mop-review/\">Ecovacs Deebot OZMO T8 AIVI</a> that I reviewed in June 2020. What I don’t like is how often I have to empty the teeny, tiny dustbin that all robot vacuums have. If only there was a way to not have to empty that dustbin every time I vacuumed.  If I only had to deal with the dirt and dust once a month, wouldn’t that be great? Ecovacs has heard my cries and has released a new auto-emptying recharging base.  Could this make my dust-free dreams come true or will it just suck?</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>The Ecovacs auto-empty station is a replacement charging base for Ecovacs T8 series robotic vacuums – the OZMO T8 AIVI and the newly announced OZMO T8. Along with recharging, it will empty the dustbin, capturing all the dirt and debris into a vacuum bag located in the canister.</p>\n<h2>What’s in the box?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304477\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"580\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-14.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-14-300x218.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-14-768x557.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Base charging pad</li>\n<li>Carpet ramp for base pad</li>\n<li>Canister with bag installed</li>\n<li>Extra bag</li>\n<li>Replacement dust bin with dust evacuation doors</li>\n<li>Dust bin pleated high-performance filter</li>\n<li>Dust bin sponge filter</li>\n<li>Screwdriver and three screws (in silver pouch) to attach the canister to the base pad</li>\n<li>Key to remove dust bin evacuation covers (in an envelope next to dust bin)</li>\n<li>Power cord</li>\n<li>Setup instruction page</li>\n<li>Quick start guide</li>\n<li>FCC compliance card</li>\n<li>User guide</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hardware specs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Dimensions: 17.5″h x 12″w x 17″d</li>\n<li>Bag capacity: 2L (about 30 days of dust and debris)</li>\n<li>Vacuum compatibility: Ecovacs OZMO T8 AIVI and OZMO T8</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design and features</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304473\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"467\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-10.jpg 467w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-10-146x250.jpg 146w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\"></p>\n<p>The auto-empty station, or “base” to make this review much easier to read, replaces the included charging base that comes with the robot vacuum.  It has a modified charging base that includes charging contacts (the silver pads in the black rectangle) and vacuum openings (the two large holes near the front of the base).  Those two holes allow the base to 1) blow high-velocity air into the dustbin, and, 2) suck that air and dirt into a bag.</p>\n<p>The bag is mounted inside the press-to-open canister on the back of the base. At the front of the lid, on the canister, there is an indicator LED that lights during charging and emptying operations.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304472\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"574\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-9.jpg 574w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-9-179x250.jpg 179w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\"></p>\n<p>If you have ever installed a bag in a vacuum, you’ll do fine here.  Each bag has a cardboard mount that slips into a channel in the back of the canister.  The bag will hold about two liters of dust and debris.  It is thoughtfully designed with a cover that automatically deploys when you pull the blue tab to remove the bag, trapping all that nastiness in the bag.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304471\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"627\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-8.jpg 627w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-8-196x250.jpg 196w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\"></p>\n<p>The entire base and canister is made from pebble-finished gray plastic and feels very solid.  The carpet ramp shown in an earlier photo is used if you set up the base on a carpeted floor.  Since I have the base on a hard floor, I did not use it.</p>\n<p>On the back of the base, we find the power port and a cord tender integrated into the base and canister. My power socket is close to where I have the base, so it would be nice if the cord tender held more core.  A minor quibble.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304468\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"707\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-5.jpg 707w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-5-221x250.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px\"></p>\n<p>The base also comes with a newly designed dustbin.  On the new dustbin on the left, you can see the input and output doors on the left and right.  These springloaded doors open automatically during dustbin cleaning.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304476\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"230\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-13.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-13-300x86.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-13-768x221.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<h3>Setup</h3>\n<p>Setting up the base comes with a few steps.

I tossed the covers and the removal key into the old dustbin, so I might be able to find them if I ever need them again.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304469\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-6.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-6-267x250.jpg 267w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-6-768x720.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>Once the base is assembled and the robot is modified, you’re ready to go.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>Vacuuming performance isn’t affected at all, as expected. Charging happens just like before.  The only difference is that now, at the end of vacuuming, the base can empty the dustbin so you don’t have to.</p>\n<p>The robot can tell that it now has this base.  The app changes to reflect this.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304543\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"519\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-15.jpg 519w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-15-162x250.jpg 162w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\"></p>\n<p>If you look just below and to the right of the map, a new “Dust collection” button appears.  This allows you to manually suck the debris out of the dustbin. But doing things manually is just so old school.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304465\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-2.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-2-300x144.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-2-768x369.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>Of course, the app comes with a setting that allows you to have the robot automatically empty the dustbin when it returns to the base.  When it is emptying, the app pops up a notification, just in case the loud vacuuming sound doesn’t tip you off.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304466\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-3.jpg 360w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-3-113x250.jpg 113w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\"></p>\n<p>How loud is it?  About as loud as a traditional vacuum.</p>\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container\"><iframe title=\"Ecovacs self-emptying base for The Gadgeteer\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XPe1d5svX4c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>As you can hear in the video, the robot plays voice prompts, letting you know exactly what’s going on. A voice prompt and app notification will tell you when the bag is full and needs to be replaced.  Believe me, you don’t want to hear that very often.</p>\n<p>The biggest drawback of the auto-empty station is the cost of the bags.  Excovacs is selling bags for a pricey $19.99 for three bags – that’s about $6.66 per bag.  Assuming that you use one bag every 30 days, you’re on the hook to Ecovacs for about $80 every year.  I get that the bags are hypoallergenic and have that nifty self-sealing feature, but, c’mon.  Kirby has long been a very expensive vacuum to both purchase and maintain.

The base blows high-velocity air into the dustbin through one of the new dustbin doors.  This loosens all the debris from the filter.  At the same time, it sucks air through the other new dustbin door, pulling all that loosened material into the bag.  I was shocked at how clean the dustbin was after the cleaning cycle.  A robot that not only cleans but cleans up after itself.  Who would have imagined? But, the high cost of bags tarnishes the shine a little bit for me.  Here’s hoping that someone discounts them.</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong>: $249.99<br>\n<strong>Where to buy</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.ecovacs.com/us/deebot-robotic-vacuum-cleaner/Auto-Empty-Station\" target=\"_blank\">Ecovacs</a><br>\n<strong>Source</strong>: The sample of this product was provided by <a href=\"https://www.ecovacs.com/us\" target=\"_blank\">Ecovacs</a>.</p>\n  <p>Filed in categories: <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/category/reviews/\" rel=\"category tag\">Reviews</a></p><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/tag/vacuum/\" rel=\"tag\">Vacuum</a></p><p style=\"background-color: #ddd;\"><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2020/08/26/ecovacs-auto-emptying-charging-base-review-make-the-ozmo-t8-vacs-even-better/\">Ecovacs auto-emptying charging base review &#8211; Make the OZMO T8 vacs even better</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com\">The Gadgeteer</a> on August 26, 2020 at 9:00 am.</p><p>Note: If you are subscribed to this feed through FeedBurner, please switch to our native feed URL <a href=\"http://the-gadgeteer.com/feed/\">http://the-gadgeteer.com/feed/</a> in order to ensure continuous delivery.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:00:09 +0000","feedId":2498,"bgimg":"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-4.jpg","linkMd5":"5741bd4a8cec7ce41aa8ee69617b54a1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-50-42-448_873f930eefa4dcaa.webp","destWidth":536,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":224558,"destBytes":31740,"author":"Garry Kolb","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-50-42-448_873f930eefa4dcaa.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-14.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn22@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-51-05-318_854e6e92caefd07d.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-10.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-51-04-901_b6a6beb464501b4c.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn62@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-51-04-319_4b8db91e5203aa52.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-8.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn46@2020_4/2020/08/31/05-51-05-091_e170da4d0b849320.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-50-47-162_b5660f0c0baec630.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-13.jpg":null,"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-12.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn36@2020_5/2020/08/31/05-51-03-840_7e95f25a69741240.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-11.jpg":null,"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/31/05-51-05-369_dfac5e07cc25c627.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn42@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-50-48-811_5b3cae8fc32eaf9a.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-15.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn68@2020_4/2020/08/31/05-50-59-829_79644ffc8d80fc96.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn100@2020_4/2020/08/31/05-50-52-772_9c6ccb545a151cf5.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exovacs-base-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn42@2020_5/2020/08/31/05-50-50-997_71d5b4492c0a700a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598853041853},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:50:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:50:41","title":"Electrohome Kingston 7-in-1 Record Player review","link":"https://the-gadgeteer.com/?p=304244","description":"\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-304246 aligncenter\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"643\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-01.jpg 643w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-01-201x250.jpg 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\"></p>\n<p><strong>REVIEW</strong> – Over the past few years, my younger son has developed an interest in jazz, both as a musician and as an enthusiast. He has been collecting vinyl records and has been, in his words, “slumming it” with my vintage turntable and a dedicated phonographic amp and Bluetooth transmitter (I keep trying to explain that my vintage turntable was an upper-end consumer model, but it’s old so…).  I also have a number of albums on vinyl that are either unavailable digitally (CD or download) or that I have been loathe to purchase again. The Electrohome Kingston 7-in-1 record player, which also includes a CD player, radio, Bluetooth / USB playback, and recording, looks like a solution to many of our problems.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>The Electrohome Kingston 7-in-1 record player (Model RR75) is a retro-styled multi-function device.  The Kingston 7-in-1 features the following functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>phonograph</li>\n<li>CD player</li>\n<li>AM / FM radio</li>\n<li>Bluetooth receiver</li>\n<li>USB playback</li>\n<li>auxiliary input</li>\n<li>Recording onto USB thumb drive from phonograph, CD, radio, Bluetooth, or auxiliary input</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the four integrated speakers, the Kingston sports a headphone jack and stereo RCA outputs.</p>\n<h2>What’s in the box?</h2>\n<p>The Kingston 7-in-1 Record Player comes packed in a relatively plain cardboard box. It is shipped surrounded by expanded polystyrene and is wrapped in a protective plastic envelope with an obligatory desiccant pack.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-304247 aligncenter\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-02.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-02-188x250.jpg 188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p>The power cord, remote (with batteries–nice to see), and user guide are packed in the bottom of the box in a separate bag.

There was no apparent damage to the stylus or to my test record and records have played well.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>My jazz-enthusiast son and I put the Kingston 7-in-1 through its paces during the last few weeks.  His primary interest was being able to play his expanding collection of small-press LPs with headphones so he could riff with the recordings. I was more interested in being able to transcode some of my rare LPs and promotional 45s into MP3s so I could listen to them without worrying about damaging the original vinyl records.</p>\n<p>We are happy to report that the Kingston lived up to its billing. The sound quality from all sources is better than what I was expecting from an all-in-one unit.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary input</h4>\n<p>Playback from the auxiliary input (1/8″ jack) was more than acceptable. I think part of our problem was that we used an old cable to connect my laptop to the Kingston.  The sound was comparable to the vintage bookshelf speakers that we used for comparison.</p>\n<h4>Bluetooth playback</h4>\n<p>Bluetooth playback was very good.  The sound was clear and at a good volume.</p>\n<h4>CD player</h4>\n<p>The CD player is a main-stream unit without any bells and whistles, just play/pause, stop, skip forward / backward, and eject.</p>\n<h4>Radio</h4>\n<p>We initially had some problems with radio reception, but we re-positioned the built-in antenna and eventually moved the unit away from some potential sources of interference and the problem was solved.  We were able to set and retrieve multiple station presets.</p>\n<h4>Record player</h4>\n<p>The record player function is what my son and I were most interested in.  The Kingston sports a basic turntable without a lot of the automation that those of us of a certain age remember from our younger days. To use the player, you place a record on the turntable, unlock the tone arm, raise the tone arm using the tone arm lever and then manually move the arm over the record and manually lower it. At the end of playback (when the arm reaches the center of the record) the turntable shuts off, but the arm does not automatically return.</p>\n<p>I would have liked to see at least automatic starting / cuing of records and automatic return of the tone arm at the end of playback, but this would add weight, complexity, and cost.  For many these additional features are not worth the risk of failure, additional cost, or weight.</p>\n<h4>USB playback</h4>\n<p>Like most of the other functions of the Kingston, the USB playback quite good (limited of course by the source files). The functions are limited to play/pause, skip forward/back, folder navigation, and special playback: repeat track, repeat folder, repeat all, or shuffle.</p>\n<h4>USB recording</h4>\n<p>The USB recording feature has a few qualifications. The USB drive must be formatted as FAT32 and have a maximum capacity of 32 GB. Files are transcoded as 128 kbps quality. The Kingston supports recording from records, CDs, auxiliary input, or Bluetooth (which is a nice bonus).</p>\n<p>The recording process starts by selecting the source and inserting a compatible USB drive into the USB-A port on the front of the unit. From there the exact process differs depending on the source.</p>\n<p>Recording from a record / aux / Bluetooth, playback is started manually and then the RECORD button on the front of the unit is pressed (I usually reversed these because I split tracks on my computer). Tracks can be manually split during playback by pressing the track skip button on the front panel or on the remote. Recording may also be paused using the play/pause button on either the remote or front panel. Pressing the record button again stops the recording.</p>\n<p>Recording from a CD is more automated. Once the CD is loaded and the USB drive is inserted, pressing record begins the recording process. The skip forward / back buttons are used to cycle through RECORD ONE, RECORD FOLDER, RECORD ALL (I’m not sure what recording a folder on a commercially produced CD means). Again press RECORD to stop recording early.</p>\n<p>The recorded files are stored in sub-directories on the USB drive: /RECORD/EXREC for non-CD sources and /RECORD/COPY for files sourced from CDs.</p>\n<h4>Connecting to an external amplifier</h4>\n<p>The only external amplifier that we had to test this feature with was a dedicated headphone amplifier.  This feature works, but I can’t really comment on the quality of the output because of the test environment.</p>\n<h4>Headphones</h4>\n<p>I found the headphone performance to be a bit of a mixed bag. This may have been due to the headphones that I used and the lack of personalized settings (I’m used to using tuning programs on my computer to compensate for the nuances of my headphones and my age-related hearing loss). My son thought the music sounded fine (we tested using his headphones).</p>\n<h2>What I like</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>All-in-one unit</li>\n<li>Can record from a variety of sources</li>\n<li>Includes a remote (with batteries)</li>\n<li>Easy-to-read, helpful manual</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What could be improved</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Slightly larger cabinet, so that standard-size LPs don’t stick out the back of the cabinet</li>\n<li>Use of a traditional-style stylus</li>\n<li>Recording from non-CD sources is clumsy — I just recorded whole LPs and then split out the tracks using other software (it reminds me of my days trying to record the top 40 countdown from the radio without also recording the commercials).</li>\n<li>Automatic cuing of LPs and return of the tone arm.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>The Electrohome Kingston 7-in-1 Record Player is a very nice unit that can fill most of your small-space entertainment needs.  It is certainly going to find a place in our home for many years. The Kingston comes with an easy-to-read and comprehensive manual that answered every question that came up during evaluation, which is a nice change from most consumer electronics these days.</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong>: $199.99<br>\n<strong>Where to buy</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.electrohome.com\" target=\"_blank\">Electrohome’s e-commerce site</a>, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32uptYK\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a><br>\n<strong>Source</strong>: The sample of this product was provided by Electrohome.</p>\n  <p>Filed in categories: <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/category/reviews/\" rel=\"category tag\">Reviews</a></p><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/tag/audio-gear/\" rel=\"tag\">Audio gear</a></p><p style=\"background-color: #ddd;\"><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2020/08/27/electrohome-kingston-7-in-1-record-player-review/\">Electrohome Kingston 7-in-1 Record Player review</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com\">The Gadgeteer</a> on August 27, 2020 at 9:00 am.</p><p>Note: If you are subscribed to this feed through FeedBurner, please switch to our native feed URL <a href=\"http://the-gadgeteer.com/feed/\">http://the-gadgeteer.com/feed/</a> in order to ensure continuous delivery.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 13:00:34 +0000","feedId":2498,"bgimg":"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-01.jpg","linkMd5":"b3fdd6ba97283abb99dd44be22df5351","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/31/05-50-44-553_9dbe4d142ec97b66.webp","destWidth":643,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":596770,"destBytes":56240,"author":"Matt Sailors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-01.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn47@2020_3/2020/08/31/05-50-44-553_9dbe4d142ec97b66.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-02.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_2/2020/08/31/05-50-50-732_ff9d2078c7578595.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-03.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn84@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-50-50-582_f47720fea1a873b0.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Electrohome-Kingston_7in1-06.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-50-56-790_a1feb870f1cfc4b8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598853041848},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:50:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:50:41","title":"Nuheara IQbuds2 Max wireless earphones review – your ears will thank you","link":"https://the-gadgeteer.com/?p=304355","description":"\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304342\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_7.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_7-300x235.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>REVIEW</strong> – In 2017, the <i>Over the Counter Hearing Aid Act </i>was passed providing greater public accessibility and affordability with over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids. Now, many earphone companies offer DIY hearing tests using your iPhone and an app. The results of these hearing tests allow personalized tuning of earphones, which can make them <i>yours. </i>The Australian company, Nuheara, was one of the first to offer a testing app with their <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2017/12/18/nuheara-iqbuds-intelligent-truly-wireless-earbuds-review/\">IQbuds wireless earphones</a> and then the <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2018/06/22/nuheara-iqbuds-intelligent-truly-wireless-earbuds-with-boost-review/\">IQbuds wireless earphones with BOOST</a>. These earphones were revolutionary when they came out, but time—and competition—marches on. Nuheara has just released the new IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max wireless earphones and they are an improvement in every way.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304339\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_10.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_10-296x250.jpg 296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></h2>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>The IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max wireless earphones are the latest in Nuheara’s line of totally wireless earphones (they call them “buds”—is that an Australian thing?) that feature Ear ID, which measures hearing levels and delivers calibrated audio to the user.

The first noticeable improvement is comfort. The Max earphones are more compact, so the fit feels more ergonomic than earlier IQbuds, which weren’t all that comfortable after using a couple of hours. These are way better. I can wear these all day—or until the battery runs out—with no issues. Having said that, the IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones are not the smallest earphones out there. They are still a bit on the large side, but it’s not surprising considering all the tech they hold.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_15.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304334\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_15.jpg 460w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_15-192x250.jpg 192w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\"></a></p>\n<p>The IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones are ergonomic in the way they fit into the ear. Place them into the ear with the ear tip in the 6 o’clock position and twist to “lock” into place. The earphone’s shape holds them in place, so you can go about doing chores or exercising without them falling out. About the only thing you can’t do is swim with them. They are sweatproof and water-resistant with an IP54 rating, but not <em>waterproof</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_12.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304337\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_12.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_12-300x227.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></p>\n<p>The earphone shell is matte black plastic and extremely light in weight. They come with 3 sizes of silicone and 3 sizes of Comply foam ear tips. I had no trouble finding a size that fit even though my ears are fairly finicky about ear tips. Included is a cloth bag for protecting the case from scratches.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304345\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_4.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_4-300x246.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></p>\n<p>The IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones snap magnetically into their hard case. This adds a level of security against falling out of the case as well as ensuring a solid connection for charging. The 5-hour listening rating isn’t great but will get you through streaming a movie. Battery life using World On and EarID is rated at 8-hours—and that’s where the IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones shine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Tap-Touch.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304353\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Tap-Touch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Tap-Touch.jpg 277w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Tap-Touch-115x250.jpg 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\"></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Both IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones feature tap touch. each earphone accepts three kinds of taps: short, double, and long tap. Each tap can be set to either Play/pause, Next track, Previous track, Volume up/down, or None. All these choices can be a bit of a learning curve. I have most of the taps set to None since I rely on my iPhone for most of these functions anyway. If you are more tap-tech savvy, you can utilize every setting available. It’s nice to have that choice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_EarID.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304354\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_EarID.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_EarID.jpg 277w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_EarID-115x250.jpg 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\"></a></p>\n<p>Before you first use the IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones, Nuheara provides an Ear ID hearing test via their free downloadable app for iOS and Android. The app will not provide a hearing analysis as detailed as an audiologist would (no app can do that) but based on the test’s outcome, it can tune audio to your specific needs. This can help you pick out and understand voices in a crowded environment, like a restaurant, school, or even at home. This has been my hearing issue: I can hear just fine—it’s <i>understanding</i> what’s being said that I have issues with. The IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones help clarify what my ears hear.</p>\n<p>Taking the app’s hearing test is similar to an audiologist test (again, not as detailed). While sitting in a quiet environment, you tap the screen each time you hear the tones, which become quieter in volume, while also changing frequencies. The test results help determine where your particular weaknesses are. For instance, mine is hearing higher frequencies due to aging—a normal occurrence. The app breaks down hearing issues into six frequency levels. It turns out that my right ear has better hearing than my left.</p>\n<p>A cool thing is that you can also take Nuheara’s hearing ID test <a href=\"https://www.nuheara.com/hearing-check/\" target=\"_blank\">online</a>. This way, you can see if your hearing can be improved before purchasing the IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones first. Nuheara provides explanations about the results.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_World_2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304352\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_World_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_World_2.jpg 277w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_World_2-115x250.jpg 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\"></a></p>\n<p>Within this app, there are a few different settings to further customize and dramatically alter the audio. These settings are grouped in what Nuheara calls World ON or OFF. When World is off, all settings are muted. When World is turned on, the following settings become available.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_ANC.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304349\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_ANC.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_ANC.jpg 277w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_ANC-115x250.jpg 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\"></a></p>\n<p>The first setting is turning Active Noise Canceling (ANC) on and off—more on this later in the review.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Sinc.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304351\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Sinc.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Sinc.jpg 277w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Sinc-115x250.jpg 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\"></a></p>\n<p>Sinc helps separate vocals from background noise. It’s controlled by dialing between ambiance and speech. I always have the dial moved towards speech because it helps lower distracting background noise.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_World.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304333\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_World.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_World.jpg 277w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_World-115x250.jpg 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\"></a></p>\n<p>World EQ increases and decreases both bass and treble. Decreasing bass makes speech sound sharper and more clear at the expense of sounding natural. Voices take on a metallic, “robotic” quality, but are easier to understand. Decreasing (or filtering) treble allows voices to sound much more natural at the expense of clarity. So you have to dial between the two to get the right balance for your hearing. I’m a fan of less treble because to my ears when the treble is filtered more (allowing more bass), audio sounds harsher.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Focus.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304350\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Focus.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"277\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Focus.jpg 277w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_App_Focus-115x250.jpg 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\"></a></p>\n<p>Finally, Focus narrows the field range of hearing. When left off, hearing is from a full 360°. With Focus on, the field is narrowed to an area in front of the listener. This can help accentuate the voice of people you are talking with while lowering the distracting vocals behind and to the side.</p>\n<p>Earlier, I mentioned ANC, which is new to the IQbuds earphones. Their previous models relied on passive noise reduction only. Active noise canceling is interesting because some earphones and headphones do it better than others. Nuheara’s ANC is effective at knocking out most of the “droning” hum of background noise, such as an air conditioner, fan, or car noise. I prefer Apple’s ANC in their AirPods Pro earphones, but they don’t do all that the IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones do.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Note that while World On helps with hearing, it has no effect on how music sounds. Only ANC works with music apps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_9.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304340\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"546\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_9.jpg 546w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_9-228x250.jpg 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px\"></a></p>\n<p>Be careful with the volume setting, especially with ANC off. If the earphones are too loud, some high-pitched feedback can be heard. This has been an issue since the first IQbuds, but it is noticeably better with the IQbuds<sup>2</sup></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304348\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_1.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_1-300x212.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></p>\n<p>Even though the IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones are made to enhance hearing, they make a decent pair of earphones for music listening. The large 9.2 mm diameter dynamic speaker sounds fairly balanced between frequencies. Bassheads may be disappointed, but since these earphones’ purpose is hearing, the added accuracy of music reproduction is welcome. I could listen to music all day with these, from a comfort standpoint and musical quality—if the batteries lasted all day, that is.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304343\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_6.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_6-300x229.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></h2>\n<h2>What I like</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Comfortable</li>\n<li>Great audio customization via App</li>\n<li>Effective ANC</li>\n<li>Clarifies vocals</li>\n<li>Filters out background noise</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I’d change</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Expensive</li>\n<li>Audio feedback sometimes happens</li>\n<li>Battery life isn’t as good as previous (and less expensive) IQbud Boost</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304347\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"483\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_2.jpg 483w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Nuheara_IQbud_Max_2-201x250.jpg 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\"></a></h2>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>The Nuheara IQbuds<sup>2</sup> Max earphones are an improvement over the original IQbuds and also the iQbuds Boost earphones—especially in comfort.

inch last year, I have intended to use it as a laptop replacement while not at my desk.  I’ve tried various case/keyboard/mouse combinations, and all have been frustrating enough to not work for me.  The Apple Magic Keyboard for iPad seems perfect, but the high cost is prohibitive for an occasional-use device for me. Enter the Logitech Folio Touch for iPad Pro.  I’ve been using it the past few weeks, including for writing this review, and it’s so handy it will be permanently affixed to my iPad going forward!</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304393\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/logitech-foliotouch-1.jpg\"

sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The Logitech Folio Touch has a fabric exterior (very similar to the Microsoft Surface tablet series keyboard cases), which is nice to the touch.  In my review period it didn’t seem to pick up too much dirt, but that would be my biggest worry over time.  The magnetic clasp can be folded back out of the way while not in use, and attaches magnetically to the back side of the case so it’s not flopping around.  It also doubles as a holder for a stylus like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Pencil</a> or the <a

sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The camera cutout works perfectly for both the first and second generation iPad Pro 11 inch models.  The fit and finish was good all around, I couldn’t find any defects on the fabric or burrs on the plastic.  The plastic parts do give a bit of a cheap feel to what would otherwise seem more of a premium device.  They’re good quality plastic, but it does feel toy-like.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304396\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/logitech-foliotouch-6.jpg\" alt=\"\"

sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The volume buttons are easy to locate by touch (the power button is a bit harder to feel).  All feel like they are a bit harder to push than the native buttons on the iPad, but I quickly adjusted to giving it that tiny extra bit of pressure and it was a non-issue for me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304397\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/logitech-foliotouch-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"564\"

and are the method of communication.  This is noticeably better than bluetooth based solutions that I’ve previously tried.  Not worrying about charging an extra device like a keyboard or having that charge fail while working is great.  The cutouts for the speakers and USB-C port were also excellent, I didn’t have any issues with any of my USB cables (some cases are too thick and block some cables from connecting properly).</p>\n<p>The iPad is easily pushed into this case, and is held quite securely once in.  To get it out, you have to peel away the soft rubbery plastic from a corner then pull it out.  I found the area by the camera to be the easiest, you can push a finger into the camera cutout to help push the iPad out.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full

keyboard, with a few iPad-specific tweaks.  Judging from pictures, it’s nearly identical to the Apple Magic Keyboard’s layout, with the addition of a row of function keys (most of which I find very useful).   These function keys can adjust the iPad’s brightness, the keyboard’s brightness, media controls and volume, as well as a few other functions.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304400\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/logitech-foliotouch-9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"

and adjusts from nearly fully upright to nearly fully laid back.  I found it to be great for any work or entertainment scenario on a flat surface, but like the similarly designed Surface Pro series stands it could be less than ideal for couch use on my legs.  It generally worked fine, but the stand is where the weight of the iPad is carried, and often needed to be hanging over my knees to stay in place and balanced.  Overall, this worked well for me once I got used to it, but there were some positions that work with a laptop but won’t work with the Logitech Folio Touch.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304401\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/logitech-foliotouch-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"653\"

you can store/charge an Apple Pencil – they attach magnetically to the top of the iPad, so this is a nice touch.  If you charge/store the Pencil there, when you close the case, the magnetic clasp secures it which is very handy (I’ve had the Pencil come off in bags or backpacks more often than it’s stayed in place on the iPad alone).</p>\n<h2>Installation and setup</h2>\n<p><img

First, I had to download the Logitech Control app from the App Store and insert my iPad into the Logitech Folio Touch device.  Upon opening the app, I was immediately prompted to update the firmware for the keyboard.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304403\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/logitech-foliotouch-13.jpg\" alt=\"\"

sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>This update took only a minute or two, then I was able to start using the trackpad and keyboard.  Everything worked well out of the gate except for the keyboard backlighting, it turns out you have to be on iPad OS 13.6 to support this feature.  One iPad update later and everything was working as expected.  Trackpad control was very good, it felt native and intuitive, with no lag like on bluetooth mice I’d previously tested.</p>\n<p>I didn’t notice any significant difference to my daily battery use during the review period.  Given that most similar devices with built-in small batteries last for weeks, I’d bet the power drain is very minimal.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304404\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/logitech-foliotouch-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"

is expected from a slim device/case), but I had no issues adjusting to typing on the keys.  They respond to light typing nicely (unlike my 2018 MacBook Pro, which you feel like you have to stab aggressively).  I typed most of this review on the Logitech Folio Touch and had no issues or complaints.  The function keys and the up/down arrow keys are tiny, but I had no problems using them when needed.  The keyboard deck is slightly recessed to avoid it touching the screen when closed.</p>\n<p>The one minor annoyance I had was the top left key, which acts as a Home key.  This is in the location of the Escape key on a normal keyboard, and I often hit it while working to instinctively invoke a menu and was surprised every time to be yanked out of whatever I was working on and dropped back on my Home screen.  This was even worse when using remote desktop tools: I would forget I was on an iPad while controlling a Windows PC, and then hit Escape and get taken to the iPad Home screen.  Apparently I use Escape fairly often, but I’m learning to adjust to this Escape-less world and I’m able to get things done without it.  I hope that remote desktop tools can re-map this key in the future, but I have a feeling that Logitech has built the function key to always act as Home, not sure if 3rd party developers will be able to ever “fix” it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304405\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/logitech-foliotouch-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"

which basically involve folding the keyboard back partially (for watching media or using a stylus) or all the way (to simply use the iPad as a handheld ipad).  These all worked well, the keyboard and touchpad input reliably disables when folded back so you’re not getting keypresses while moving or holding it in these positions.</p>\n<p>The device doesn’t add a lot of extra size or weight to the iPad.  I like that the case fully protects the iPad, but I’d also like a more minimalist version where it attached simply via magnets.  This may be wishful thinking, maybe the adjustable stand needs the solid wraparound case for leverage.  The iPad does feel about twice as thick with the case, but unlike other heavier cases (like the Brydge Pro) I didn’t find myself removing it often for non-keyboard use.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304412\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/logitech-foliotouch-18.jpg\" alt=\"\"

bright rooms, the keys are easily readable without the backlighting.  There are no RGB options here, only white.  The lack of backlighting is something that’s turned me off to other various iPad keyboard options. I often use it on the couch while half-watching some rerun of Archer or Arrested Development, and even though I’m a fairly good typist it’s always nice to be able to see the keys, especially when they have seldom-used function options.</p>\n<p>The trackpad is good, with one slight complaint.  It is a good size, not as large as the most recent trackpads on Macbooks, but larger than expected for a small device.  I never felt cramped or out of room while using the trackpad.  Multi-touch gestures worked great every time.  The one slight issue I ran into is that the top-left corner of the trackpad can’t be clicked.  I’m not sure if this is a design flaw or just my unit, and I only ran into it a few times, but it was strange when I did.  Every other part of the trackpad feels the same, with a solid click when pressed.  The top-left corner simply can’t be pressed in at all.</p>\n<h2>What I like</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Solid keyboard capabilities</li>\n<li>Excellent trackpad</li>\n<li>Versatile modes of use</li>\n<li>Not a lot of bulk added</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I’d change</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Trackpad top left corner unclickable</li>\n<li>Attach via magnets instead of wraparound</li>\n<li>Option to fully remove the magnetic clasp/stylus holder</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Overall, the Logitech Folio Touch is a great keyboard/trackpad case for the iPad Pro 11.  This device truly transformed my use of my iPad from a consumption-only device to a productive device.  The trade-offs (extra width and weight) to add a keyboard/trackpad/case/stand  are minimal.  The price makes it attractive as well, especially compared to Apple’s offerings.  I heartily recommend the Logitech Folio Touch to anyone looking for a laptop-like experience with their iPad!</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $159.99<br>\n<strong>Where to buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/folio-touch.920-009743.html\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech</a> and <a

around and get a rescue dog.  In our case, a rescue puppy!  He is a terrier/chihuahua mix.  He is very different from our previous dogs which have all been shelties.  For one, he is only around six pounds and he has very short fur.   I am learning the joys of having a short furred dog, even a very small one.  I don’t get the tumbling tumbleweeds of fur I used to get with our shelties, but I get small short fine bits of fur everywhere.  My home office furniture is dark, and I also have a dark workout mat on the floor.  Both items show the fur easily.  So when the chance came to review this Brigii Mini Vacuum I jumped on it.  Let’s see how it handles the dog fur!</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>The Brigii Y150 mini vacuum is exactly what it says.  It is a cordless (USB rechargeable) mini vacuum and blower.  One end sucks and the other end blows.  The supplied attachments can fit on either end.</p>\n<h2>What’s in the box?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304372\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_2-scaled-e1597672815954.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mini vacuum – the filter is

features</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304376\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_6-scaled-e1597672860521.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<p>The vacuum/blower comes apart in two pieces.  The bottom part (top item on the picture) contains the motor and the port where the air will blow out.  The top part (bottom part on the picture) contains the air filter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304375\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_5-scaled-e1597672850700.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<p>To remove the air filter you simply unlock the two halves of the machine and then pull out the filter from the top part as shown above.  I like to note that the filter is a HEPA filter and is advertised as completely washable.  I have not washed mine yet.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304377\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_7-scaled-e1597672869341.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<p>I took a picture of the motor half of the unit so you could see the locking mechanism that holds the two pieces together.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304378\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_8-scaled-e1597672879800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<p>This is a picture of the top half that has the slock the locking tab goes into.  You can see the filter inserted into the top half.  It simply slides in.  It does not have any grooves it has to fit into.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304379\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_9-scaled-e1597672891117.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"></p>\n<p>This is the picture of the top half of the vacuum.  This is the end that sucks.  The bottom half looks identical except you can see a small Phillips screw head in the middle.  There are no indicators to tell you which end is the blower and which end is the vacuum.  When you turn it on though, it is very easy to tell at that point.  The blowing end puts out a substantial amount of air and you can feel the suction from the opposite end.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304411\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_14-scaled-e1597685635405.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<p>The picture above shows the tool that can be used on the blower end.  Without the wide upper end, the slim nozzle helps to focus the air blowing out.  It is not as strong as a can of air would be, but it did do an excellent job of blowing the dust and particles off of my keyboard.  I have not used the widespread end.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304380\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_10-scaled-e1597672903260.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<p>I took a picture of the main tool I keep on the vacuum.    I love this crevice tool because it has a nice soft brush on the end I can use to pick up dust and dog hair off my desk and keyboard.</p>\n<h3>Setup</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304373\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_3-scaled-e1597672829988.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<p>Setup was really easy.  I simply plugged the USB-C cable into the vacuum and put the USB cable into the side of my PC.  It took several hours to charge there, but my laptop does not put a lot of power out of its USB ports.  When I plugged it into a charger in an outlet it charged much faster.  While charging, it has an LED light on the power button that glows red.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304374\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_4-scaled-e1597672839950.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<p>When it is fully charged, the LED turns green.  One note, on the Amazon website where these are sold, people mention the red light blinking.  It never blinked for me.  It stayed a solid red color.  I also want to note that the Amazon page shows a small tube coming out of the blower end of the device.  I do not have one of those attachments.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304381\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brigii_11-scaled-e1597672915419.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p>\n<p>I really like the performance of this vacuum.  It is perfect for keeping my keyboard and desk area clean.  It also does a really good job of spot cleaning my exercise mat.  It picks up the small dog fur easily.  If we still had shelties I can imagine the filter would get clogged pretty easily.  The above picture shows the filter after about five, two-minute vacuum sessions around my office.  I saw where some folks talk about using this vacuum in their car.  I think it would be ok for something like that, and handy to have if you have children who tend to leave crumbs in the car, but I don’t think it can beat the shop vacuum that I always use when cleaning my car.</p>\n<p>It also holds its charge a long time.  I went a week without using it, and it still had plenty of power.    I used it probably 15 times doing quick pickups around my office before it needed a recharge.  Using it daily on my keyboard it easily lasted over a week.</p>\n<h2>What I like</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Small and portable</li>\n<li>cordless</li>\n<li>holds a charge for a long time.</li>\n<li>I love that the filter is washable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What needs to be improved</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It could use more suction power, but hey, I say that about almost any vacuum except my shop vac.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>If you are looking for a small hand held cordless vacuum for small tasks like keeping your desk area clean including your keyboard, I highly recommend this product.  It does the job and it does it at a great price.  Do not buy this thinking you will vacuum out your entire car that you have not cleaned all year.  However, for spot jobs when your kid finishes eating a bunch of crackers, this should do the job.  Note, when shopping for this item, be sure you get the Pro version.  There is another version that is around $5 cheaper but it also has a smaller battery and does not come with the flexible hose.</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong>: $39.99<br>\n<strong>Where to

One thing that I hate about conventional flossing is that at times it makes my gums bleed. I have often thought about buying a Waterpik as an alternative but I never got around to it. I now get the opportunity to test the Toothshower 2.0. Let’s see how it goes.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>The Toothshower 2.0 offers an enhanced Open-air Handle Design and a more robust Magnetic Handle Cradle. It allows you to control water pressure on the console with an easy to turn Comfort Pressure Dial.  Additional accessory storage and/or travel-size toothpaste storage is available under the mirrored hood.</p>\n<h2>What’s in the box</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304498\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Toothshower-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Toothshower-2.jpg 450w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Toothshower-2-188x250.jpg 188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"><br>\n1 x Toothshower 2.0<br>\n1 x Irrigating Standard Tip (White)<br>\n1 x Irrigating Gum Massager (White)<br>\n1 x Irrigating Dual-Headed Toothbrush (White)<br>\n1 x Wall Plate<br>\n1 x Custom Diverter<br>\n1 x Plumber’s Tape<br>\n1 x 3M Command Waterproof Cord Clip<br>\n3 x 3M Command Waterproof Bath Adhesive Strips<br>\n1 x User Manual</p>\n<h2>Design and features</h2>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>EASY FLOSSING:</strong> For healthier gums, fresher breath, and happier teeth with less effort (Dentist and Dental Hygienist Approved) Customer Reviews.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>ATTACHES TO YOUR SHOWER:</strong> Saving counter space, no mess, endless water supply with no water reservoir to refill.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>NO BATTERY OR OUTLETS NEEDED:</strong> Powered by your shower with adjustable pressure dial, and shower-temperature control for comfort.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>INCLUDES MULTIPLE ACCESSORIES:</strong> Standard Water Flosser tip, irrigating Dual-Headed Toothbrush, and revolutionary 7-stream Gum Massager, which cleans around orthodontics and implants.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main section of the Toothshower 2.0 is made of plastic and comes with everything you need to use it.

Well, I will readily admit that I was wrong. This device is easy to install and after a few uses, I look forward to using it especially for flossing and gum massaging. The toothbrush also works well and the fact that it does not need batteries is fantastic. I give it a well done and two thumbs up!!</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $119.99<br>\n<strong>Where to buy:</strong> <a

Earlier this month I reviewed <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2020/08/19/level-invisible-smart-lock-review-a-smart-door-lock-that-doesnt-stick-out-like-a-sore-thumb/\">Level’s Invisible Smart Lock (which they now apparently call the Bolt)</a>, that transforms your existing deadbolt into a connected smart lock you’re able to control/manage via your iPhone or Android device. The Level Touch keeps all the stealth and features of Level’s original Invisible Smart Lock but includes exterior lock hardware plus adds a few high tech features designed to make your digital world even easier and more tech-Zen. As the name implies, you can now simply touch the lock and it will automatically unlock. Level also includes several smart cards that will seamlessly open the lock as well. <a href=\"https://level.co/shop/level-touch\" target=\"_blank\">The Level Touch is available directly from the Level website</a> for $329 and comes in Satin Chrome, Satin Nickel, Polished Brass, and Matte Black.</p>\n  <p>Filed in categories: <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/category/news/\" rel=\"category tag\">News</a></p><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/tag/home-security/\" rel=\"tag\">Home Security</a>, <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/tag/locks/\" rel=\"tag\">Locks</a></p><p style=\"background-color: #ddd;\"><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2020/08/26/level-introduces-their-latest-stealthy-smart-lock-the-level-touch/\">Level introduces their latest stealthy smart lock: the Level Touch</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com\">The Gadgeteer</a> on August 26, 2020 at 8:00 am.</p><p>Note: If you are subscribed to this feed through FeedBurner, please switch to our native feed URL <a href=\"http://the-gadgeteer.com/feed/\">http://the-gadgeteer.com/feed/</a> in order to ensure continuous delivery.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 12:00:16 +0000","feedId":2498,"bgimg":"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/level_touch-2-copy.jpg","linkMd5":"fa7ada45d24a5abb83b1f8844f9bf8be","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/31/05-50-43-463_0f13aedff9d2f149.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":588,"sourceBytes":31151,"destBytes":20888,"author":"Dave Rees","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/level_touch-2-copy.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn55@2020_3/2020/08/31/05-50-43-463_0f13aedff9d2f149.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598853041853},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:50:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:50:41","title":"Galan Leather Walden Woodworkers Washi Tape Dispenser review","link":"https://the-gadgeteer.com/?p=305349","description":"\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-305356\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-5.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-5-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p><strong>REVIEW</strong> – Here’s something you might not know about me. I’m a stationery nerd. I love journals, pens, and washi tape. If you don’t know what washi tape is, they are small rolls of decorative tapes that come in different widths and designs. You can use these tapes to decorate your journal pages. I love them, but finding a way to store them and have them easily available can be a challenge. That’s where a washi tape dispenser like Walden Woodworkers holder from Galan Leather can really come in handy. Let’s take a look.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>The Galan Leather Washi Tape Dispenser is a vintage styled wooden and cast iron holder for standard MT washi tape rolls (1.5 cm width).</p>\n<h2>Design and features</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-305350\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-11.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-11-300x225.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-11-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>First of all, here’s a small selection of my washi tape collection.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-305351\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-10.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-10-300x197.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-10-768x505.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The handmade Walden Woodworkers washi tape holder is available in either mahogany or walnut. The quality of the construction is wonderful. The wood is well finished with no splinters or rough edges. It reminds me of something you might see in a shop 100 years ago, especially with the brass plate on the front.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-305352\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-9.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-9-300x225.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-9-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The dispenser has 3 parts. There’s the base which is made of wood held together with strong cast iron plates, a wooden dowel that holds the tapes, and a cutting blade.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-305353\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-8.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-8-300x225.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-8-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The blade is like a steel hack saw blade with close-set shallow teeth.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-305354\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-7.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-7-300x225.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-7-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>To load the holder, you just lift out the wooden dowel, slide the tapes onto the dowel, and place it back in the holder.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-305357\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"581\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-4.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-4-300x218.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-4-768x558.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The number of tapes that can fit on the 10 inch long dowel really depends on the washi tapes which come in a variety of widths.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-305358\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-3.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/galanleather-washi-3-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p>\n<p>The design of this dispenser is simple and easy to use.

During this stage, your<br>\nbreathing becomes more regular and shallow as you transition into<br>\na deep sleep.<br>\nDuring <strong>deep sleep</strong>, many physical functions slow down, which is<br>\nnecessary to revitalize both the body and the immune system. During this<br>\nstage, your breathing rate is slowest and the most regular.<br>\n<strong>Rapid Eye Movement or REM</strong> is the period of sleep in which you<br>\ndream the most. Eye movements are rapid and random, memories are<br>\nstored and the brain is regenerated. During this stage, your breathing<br>\nbecomes more irregular as you process your dreams and your mind<br>\nrecharges.</p>\n<p>Screenshots from the app representing measurements:</p>\n\n<a

I have been able to study the information and I have been making progress. I am planning to post an update to this review if/when I am getting better and consistent sleep scores. I have tested many sleep-related devices and most have turned out to be gimmicks. However, I really like this device and have been using it non-stop. IMHO, well done!!</p>\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $149.99<br>\n<strong>Where to buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://shop.sleepscore.com/collections/validated/products/sleepscore-product\"

I’ve tried apps, podcasts, devices… I always seem to have a tough time getting focused.  The Core Meditation Trainer takes a different approach to helping you find your inner peace, no experience required. Let’s find out if Bob is on the pathway to enlightenment. To the review!</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>It’s an integrated device and app that combines a physical focus, haptic feedback, and ongoing measurement of your mental state to help you meditate. Please note that the app is only available for the iOS at the moment, but Android compatibility is in development.</p>\n<h2>What’s in the box?</h2>\n<p>You’ll get the Core trainer, a wall plug, a micro-USB cable, and a charging dock.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304089\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-16.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-16-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<h2>Hardware specs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>USB charging dock</li>\n<li>Natural wood integrated into the design</li>\n<li>Custom haptic measurement system</li>\n<li>Bluetooth 4 enabled</li>\n<li>Device battery operates for up to two weeks between charges</li>\n<li>iOS app compatible (Android coming soon)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design and features</h2>\n<p>The Core Meditation Trainer is a softball-sized device that, when when paired with the app. integrates a physical component that both focuses your efforts and provides feedback on your progress.

Here I’ve connected the base with the included cable to the USB charging port on my desk lamp.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304093\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-20.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-20.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-20-300x212.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p>The orb serves as your focus when you are engaged in meditation sessions, using a series of rising and falling vibrations that match the pattern of the breathing for the program you’re running. While this is happening, the sensors are continually monitoring your biometrics (heart rate and heart rate variability, specifically) to report on your levels of calm and focus. Let’s do a session to see how this all comes together.</p>\n<h3>Meditation Sessions</h3>\n<p>We’ll walk through the app features shortly, but one of the clever bits about the Core Meditation Trainer is that there’s virtually no learning curve to get started. You don’t even need to select a meditation program. Launch the app and a program is automatically queued up for you, like so:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304082\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-9-370x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-9-370x800.jpg 370w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-9-115x250.jpg 115w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-9.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\"></p>\n<p>Or you can select a program from the library, like the one I am showing here.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304077\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-4-370x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-4-370x800.jpg 370w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-4-115x250.jpg 115w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-4.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\"></p>\n<p>Either way you go, just find a place to get comfortable and sit with the orb in both hands.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304088\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-15.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-15-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p>Place your thumbs on the sensors, and the program automatically begins with a three second countdown.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304087\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-14.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-14-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p>This particular program was a five minute session. The soundtrack is a layered ]audio experience that includes gentle music and sound effects that rise and falls in a steady rhythm. The orb vibrates in a synchronization to the soundtrack, intensifying as the audio swells and then falling back as it recedes. This becomes your focus to match the breathing patterns. It’s quite soothing.</p>\n<p>At the end of your session the app presents the results. It shows you your heart rate during and the levels of calm and focus you were able to maintain during the session.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304074\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-1-370x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-1-370x800.jpg 370w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-1-115x250.jpg 115w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-1.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\"></p>\n<p>When you first start using the Core Meditation Trainer you’ll do a couple of sample sessions to collect some baseline biometrics. Heart rate and heart rate variability seem to be the key indicators that Core uses to determine dimensions like “calm” and “focus.” I’m not sure entirely how these calculated, but what’s interesting is that the Core starts to build a profile on you as you use it more often that shows your progress. You can see how stressed out you may have been today vs. other sessions, and get immediate feedback on the results for that exercise.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304075\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-2-370x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-2-370x800.jpg 370w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-2-115x250.jpg 115w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-2.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\"></p>\n<p>You can also keep notes on your sessions for future reference, which is handy if you find a specific set of programs that you really like.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304076\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-3-370x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-3-370x800.jpg 370w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-3-115x250.jpg 115w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-3.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\"></p>\n<p>As you collect more data Core builds a history of your progress, allowing you to keep tabs on your development.

It also runs you through some basic breathing exercises and trainings to prepare for what’s to come. When you’re ready to go deeper, the Explore option allows you to choose from dozens of different programs.</p>\n<p>The Guided programs are purpose-driven, organized by categories like “Productivity and Performance” and “Sleep” to enable sessions with specific mental/wellness goals. These are typically accompanied by an instructor that walks you through the program. Breath Training programs teach you different breathing methods to accomplish goals like stress relief and are also guided by an instructor. Sound programs are unguided audio soundscapes. In each case you get a full description of the session, and you can choose the length of the program. I snagged a sample of the “Coffee breathing”  program as an example. Pick that option from the menu.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304083\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-10-370x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-10-370x800.jpg 370w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-10-115x250.jpg 115w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-10.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\"></p>\n<p>You can now choose to run the introductory exercise, or choose the session length if you’re familiar with it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304084\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-11-370x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-11-370x800.jpg 370w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-11-115x250.jpg 115w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Core-MeditationTrainer-11.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\"></p>\n<p>Swipe up for a detailed description.

You don’t need to be practiced at meditation to get results. I see three elements to the experience that really work seamlessly together: <strong>form factor</strong>, <strong>measurement</strong>, and <strong>customization</strong>,</p>\n<p>The <strong>form factor</strong> is on point. The orb is easy to handle and comfortable to hold for extended periods. I find it much easier to concentrate on the exercises when there is a physical element involved as a point of focus. I’m also finding that the responsive nature of the device is also critical to getting better results. My earlier sessions (shown above) weren’t as good because I kept trying to force my breathing patterns on the thing. When I learned to simply follow the vibrations my recent experiences have shown steady improvement. I also really like the simplicity of the interface. Pick it up, close your eyes, put your thumbs on the sensors, and off you go. It encourages more active use as I get breaks in my day or need a minute to calm things down.</p>\n<p><strong>Measurement</strong> is critical to improving performance in any activity. The Core does an excellent job of providing meaningful measurement without getting so complicated that you don’t know how to interpret the results. I may not know exactly how they calculate the metrics, but I don’t need to. I get immediate feedback after a session, and have the ability to measure performance over a time that demonstrates improvement in simple terms. That’s all good for encouraging use and re-use.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s the <strong>customization</strong> element. You’re not locked into a specific meditation technique or fixed program here. You can try different techniques and tools to find what works for you, and change up the duration/variation to meet your schedule. The subscription service offers a wide range of instructors with different styles, so you can find one (or several) that you groove with to cater your programs to your liking. The wide variety of options available also encourages use and re-use as your needs change.</p>\n<p>I still have a ways to go to get good with this thing, but I’m enjoying the journey. And that’s half of the battle, right?</p>\n<h2>What I like</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Very user friendly, even if you are new to meditation</li>\n<li>Haptic feedback is excellent for focusing your efforts</li>\n<li>Excellent app with a wide variety of programs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What needs to be improved</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing that I am seeing so far</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>I’ve tried a number of different apps &#38; devices related to meditation, but the Core Meditation Trainer is my favorite so far. It’s the first solution I’ve seen that combines quality content, haptic feedback and measurables in one well-rounded package. The form factor and experience are so good that you don’t even need to think about it… which is kind of the point. We’ll see how it works over the long haul.</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong>: $169 for the unit, $59.99 annual fee for the Core Premium app subscription.

What’s that? You said you’d learn to play guitar, bass or ukulele? Well, Fender’s Play app can help you cross that one off in whatever time increments you can devote. Fender was gracious enough to not only give us access to the app, but also loan us a guitar to use while we put the app through its paces. Let’s take a closer look at both.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>Fender Play is an online course that will teach you the basics of guitar, bass or ukulele. The step-by-step lessons are led by knowledgeable instructors assisted by clear videos, visuals and tablature resulting in clear information you can absorb on your own schedule without any judgement.</p>\n<h2>What’s in the App…</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304037\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02.png 1000w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02-300x189.png 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02-800x504.png 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02-768x484.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the Fender Play app (you can find it in Apple App Store or on Google Play)</li>\n<li>Free trial (cancel anytime)</li>\n<li>Special offer – Get 10% off guitars, amps and gear</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>And in the loaner box?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304038\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02a.jpg 1000w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02a-300x105.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02a-800x281.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-02a-768x270.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Fender Player Mustang guitar</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hardware specs (guitar)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>24” scale length; “C”-shaped maple neck</li>\n<li>Two Mustang single-coil pickups</li>\n<li>9.5”-radius maple fingerboard with 22 medium jumbo frets</li>\n<li>Six-saddle string-through-body hardtail Strat® bridge with bent steel saddles</li>\n<li>Master Volume and Tone controls; three-way pickup switch</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design and features (app)</h2>\n<p>The app is laid out with different paths for you to follow.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304028\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-03.jpg 1000w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-03-300x142.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-03-800x378.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-03-768x363.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>You can choose from…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acoustic or Electric Guitar with focuses on Rock, Blues, Folk, Country or Pop</li>\n<li>Bass Guitar with focuses on Funk or Rock</li>\n<li>Ukulele</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Inside your path there are 5 levels for you to progress through, each with up to 21 courses.

You are free to pause and rewind and absorb at your own pace as you progress towards becoming a player.</p>\n<h3>Setup (app)</h3>\n<p>All you need to do is download the App and dive in. We loaded it up on my iPad Pro and my daughter’s iPhone SE. If you’d rather learn in front of your computer, you can also <a href=\"https://connect.fender.com/sign-up?ref=https://www.fender.com/play/plans?\" target=\"_blank\">log into</a> the service from a browser.</p>\n<p>From there you’ll need to choose which instrument you want to learn or “A Path” in the app. We chose electric guitar to go with the beautiful Player series Mustang guitar that Fender loaned us.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have an instrument yet, the initial lesson for a path will walk you through an instrument type calling out the different parts, functions and vocabulary. You’ll obviously need a guitar, bass or ukulele to actually start playing, but your new knowledge should prove helpful in discovering what you might be looking for. Not all of us have that one friend with too many guitars, so check with your local shop as many may allow rental dollars to go towards an eventual purchase.</p>\n<h3>Performance (app)</h3>\n<p>The thing about learning guitar always used to be finding a good teacher (friend, dad or instructor) and then working music you actually like into the lessons. If either of those weren’t quite right it made lessons tedious, frustrating or both.</p>\n<p>The Fender Play app solves the good teacher part of that equation from the get go. Within the guitar path, instructors rotate out from course to course for some variety, with all of them being easy to understand and as patient as I need them to be (I have a pause button after all).</p>\n<p>The below shot shows how clearly they show finger positions for chords. Compared to how I originally learned from just a paper chord chart, it’s really nice to have a clear image of proper finger and hand positioning. I realize that I sound old in the age of YouTube where one can find instruction on anything under the sun, but everything is here in a single, curated place with a progression order that is thought through and content that is age appropriate for everyone.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304034\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1432\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-09.jpg 1000w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-09-175x250.jpg 175w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-09-559x800.jpg 559w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-09-768x1100.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>On the music side the simplified versions of songs within the Rock path were great fits for me and ones I would pick from a list if given the option. There are typically 4-5 five songs per level, but here are some stand outs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level 1 includes great songs like <em>Satisfaction</em> by the Rolling Stones and <em>Come As You Are</em> by Nirvana.</li>\n<li>Level 2 has Judas Priest’s <em>Breaking the Law </em>and <em>Bad Moon Rising</em> by Creedence Clearwater Revival among others.</li>\n<li>Level 3 serves up a few like the classic <em>Louie Louie</em> by The Kingsmen and Weezer’s <em>Buddy Holly.</em>\n</li>\n<li>Level 4 rocks with <em>Carry on Wayward Son</em> by Kansas and <em>White Wedding</em> by Billy Idol.</li>\n<li>And Level 5 finishes strong with ZZ Top’s <em>La Grange</em> and <em>Purple Haze</em> by none other than Jimi Hendrix.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You’ll start with tuning and single note melodies with visuals and tablature before learning simplified chords and chord charts. As you move along, the difficulty ramps up as you’re ready to take on more. You’re able to repeat lessons and sections as much as you want. Your progress is kept by the app should you switch devices or even take a few days off, letting you start back in right where you left off.</p>\n<p>If you’ve dug into any of my previous music device reviews you may be aware that my son has been playing jazz guitar for nearly 1o years while I’m more of a three-chord punk type guy. My daughter Talula learned some chords and a couple of songs from Satch but has not had any other instruction, so she volunteered to dive in and give Fender Play (and the Mustang) a good run through.</p>\n<p>My own sessions with Fender Play were fun. While the first intro courses covered all the stuff I already know, I appreciated the content and the pace with which it was delivered. I learned the string names from knowing music theory as a vocalist, but the high-to-low string mnemonic the app used… <strong>E</strong>aster <strong>B</strong>unnies <strong>G</strong>et <strong>D</strong>izzy <strong>A</strong>t <strong>E</strong>aster definitely had me laughing.</p>\n<p>You’re able to change the playback speed in the practice sessions which is super useful if full pace is too fast at first. As a new player it takes some time to start developing muscle memory and finger dexterity.</p>\n<p>You can change paths for either instrument or genre at any point by clicking the<em> “Instrument: Genre Path” </em>header in the top left. After selecting a different instrument and/or a new genre’s “<em>Make this my path”</em> you have to click “<em>Done</em>” in the upper right to make your way back to courses.</p>\n<p>Here’s what the tablature looks like for <em>Hit Me With Your Best Shot</em> by Pat Benatar (Level 4), as you practice along.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTViyWAR9Co\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>And here’s Talula playing what she learned. Fun part is that she said this isn’t a song she would have picked herself, but she digs it and is glad she learned it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCQ6DNksPx0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>I also asked Satch to take a quick look at the App. He spent about an hour with it and gave me a “<em>this is pretty Good!</em>” nod, commenting that the Rock path difficulty was pretty mellow, but Level 5 on the Blues path felt a good deal more complicated in the higher levels.</p>\n<p>The app also isn’t just course progression. On the bottom nav bar, there’s a ton of <strong><em>Songs</em></strong> to dig into, a <strong><em>Skills</em></strong> section for continuing to learn, <strong>Collections </strong>for almost any interest (Crash Course: Punk Rock!) and a <em><strong>More…</strong></em><em> </em>section where you can manage your account, set practice reminders and more.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304032\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-07.jpg 1000w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-07-300x106.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-07-800x282.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FPLY-07-768x271.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<h3>How about that guitar?</h3>\n<p>If any of you were wondering about the loaner guitar, this section’s for you.

It’s definitely aimed at newcomers but there’s plenty to dig into for someone like myself that just learned what I learned and didn’t get all the foundation.

That’s what Wotancraft is all about, and I’m seeing plenty of both in the Pilot Camera Messenger Bag. This little guy is a solid multitasker that will appeal to both photographer and the daily carry crowd without compromises. It looks good, too! We’ve got a lot of pictures in this one. To the review!</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>It’s a messenger bag and a camera bag that adds modular expandability to meet your specific needs.</p>\n<h2>What’s in the box?</h2>\n<p>I’m reviewing the 10 Liter version of the bag. The bag includes 3 dividers for camera equipment (2 with lids), a detachable shoulder strap &#38; shoulder pad, and a storage bag.</p>\n<p>My review package also included 4 add-on modules available with the purchase. We’ll walk through them in the review.</p>\n<h2>Hardware specs</h2>\n<p>This bag comes in two sizes. I’m testing the Medium size which specs out as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall dimensions: 40 x 16 x 28 cm.</li>\n<li>Cordura 500D tear-proof waxed canvas</li>\n<li>Water-repellant teflon exterior coating, PU laminated interior coating</li>\n<li>10 liter capacity</li>\n<li>Total weight 900 grams</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design and features</h2>\n<p>Hailing from Taipei City, Taiwan, Wotoncraft’s design aesthetic is inspired by vintage military styles &#38; materials. The Lightweight Camera and Messenger bag I’m testing clearly pulls influences from WWII Swiss Army ammunition bags.

They keep stuff from falling out of the bag (or being grabbed by wandering hands), despite there being only one latch point keeping it anchored.

I got four different accessories to play with.</p>\n<p>The first two accessories are made to velcro to the panels on the interior main pocket. The Zipperless Pocket Module is a pocket with a hood, made for quick access. I have my mouse in this module, but it’s plenty big for a phone or additional components. I also like this one for collecting random small bits (like loose change or small tools).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304574\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"771\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-12.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-12-195x250.jpg 195w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p>The second velcro accessory is the Cord Organizer/Utility Fastener Module. It basically three wide elastic bands that will hold your MacBook power brick, batteries, cables, and other stuff you don’t want floating around in your bag. They make a version of this specifically for extra camera batteries and SD cards if that’s your thing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304580\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-18-577x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"577\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-18-577x800.jpg 577w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-18-180x250.jpg 180w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-18.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\"></p>\n<p>Either module will velcro to any of the interior panels of the main compartment.

This is especially important if you don’t want to be fiddling around in your main compartment for quick-grab items like keys, phones, headphones, etc.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304585\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-23.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wotancraft-PilotCameraMessengerBag-23-250x250.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p>The Wotancraft Pilot Camera Messenger also shines with respect to flexibility. You can reconfigure this bag for travel, for the daily office commute, for photo sessions, or for simple daytrips with a few tweaks to your add-ons and inserts. It’s a great multitasker, and that lightweight build makes it extremely shoulder friendly for long days.</p>\n<p>I’m also impressed with the overall carrying capacity. While it is only listed at 10 liters overall, the external pocketing and onboard modules on this bag are designed in such a way that they don’t compromise the main space. I find myself being able to load this thing up with as much stuff as I get in some of my 15- or 20-liter bags that have more rigid geometry.</p>\n<h2>What I like</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Super lightweight.</li>\n<li>Excellent organization and overall usability.</li>\n<li>Flexible and adaptable, especially when you leverage the add-on modules.</li>\n<li>Many configurations in one bag without compromising any details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What needs to be improved</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The velcro used on the inserts is super strong. This is great for stability, but can make for some wrestling to get the inserts into (or out of) position.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>This is my first experience with the Wotoncraft brand, and I’m really impressed. Excellent usability, simple functionality, modular flexibility, and vintage styling make this bag a true multitasker that fits a number of use cases. I’d wouldn’t just recommend this bag for photographers. There’s a lot to love for daily use and folks that carry a lot of tech gear as well. I’m looking forward to seeing more from this brand!</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong>: $199.

tried some of those wifi repeater products to boost the wifi signal in the dead spots in our house.  I was never really satisfied with the spotty results, and many of them require that you give it an SSID that is different than your main SSID.  And sometimes my devices would connect to the repeater even though the wifi strength was better connecting to another repeater in the house.  Anyway, I have never been really happy with those things, so I finally decided to give one of these ‘mesh wifi’ products a shot now that prices have seemingly come down as more competition is in the market.  I tested the Rock Space Whole Home Mesh Wifi product to see if those pesky dead spots disappeared.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is it?</strong></h2>\n<p>Three small boxes that you place around your house that communicate with each other, creating a ‘mesh’ wifi network.  The main box is located where your internet connection comes in the house, then it boosts the wifi signal to the other 2 boxes so that your wifi signal is stronger all over the house instead of just having 1 wifi router where the internet comes in the house.  All 3 boxes also use the same SSID (name of your wireless network) and password, making it easy to simply connect to 1 wireless network.</p>\n<h2><strong>What’s in the box?</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>3 Rock Space mesh units, with power supplies</li>\n<li>1 gigabit Ethernet cable</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Here are the wireless specs:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>IEEE 802.11 ac/n/a/ 5 GHz, IEEE 802.11 b/g/n 2.4 GHz</li>\n<li>Signal rate: 867 Mbps at 5 GHZ, 300 Mbps at 2.4 GHz</li>\n<li>Security: WPA/WPA2-PSK</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Here are the hardware specs:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ports: 2 LAN/WAN gigabit Ethernet ports, DC-in 2.1mm</li>\n<li>Power: 12V/1A</li>\n<li>Size: 4 in x 4 in x 4 in</li>\n<li>Weight: each unit weighs 10 oz.</li>\n<li>Model:  AC1200</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-303496\"

performance</strong></h2>\n<p>Each mesh box is about 4 inches square, colored black, and the top has a grey fabric surface on it.  On the bottom of the box are mounting holes to attach it to a wall if you wanted.  On the bottom are also the connections for the power cable and 2 Ethernet ports, 1 for connecting to your existing internet connection coming into your house, or the other for connecting to the Ethernet ports you may have in the walls of your house.  On top of each unit is a small LED light that gives you a status of the connection. I think it fits in with the décor in the house pretty easily and the size makes it pretty easy to place them where you need them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-303497\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"501\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-2.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-2-300x188.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-2-768x481.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></a></p>\n<p>Setup was pretty easy.  Just follow the included instructions, which include downloading the free app. (I am on Android, and it worked great!)  I plugged up the Rock Space where the internet comes into my house (in the back of the house right next to the bedroom and office).  I have a 2-story shotgun-type of house that is twice as deep as it is wide.  So with the internet router at the back of the house, it is almost impossible to get a good signal on the front porch, as well as on the second floor at the front of the house.  So I picked the living room on the main floor at the front of the house for the second Rock Space unit (right next to our wifi-enabled Samsung TV), and the 3<sup>rd</sup> unit I placed upstairs in the bonus room at the front of the house.  We have almost given up trying to get a signal in those places, so I was eager to see if the Rock Space could solve that.</p>\n<p>Before I mention my test results, let me comment on the various features available with the Rock Space, which are many.  First of all, the security features are very strong.  Protecting your wireless network from hackers becomes more important every day, so having the WPA2-TSK protocol is the minimum that I would expect.  In layman’s terms, what WPA2-TSK does is create a unique encrypted connection password (called a ‘key’) between the Rock Space boxes and every device on the network, and that special encrypted key is automatically, constantly changed so it is not easy to break.  The technology provides a much higher level of security than just plain WPA, which hackers can break in minutes.  It is true that higher levels of wireless security are rolling out, and WPA2-TSK is not impossible to break, but for now, everyone needs to be using WPA2-TSK at the very minimum.</p>\n<p>The Rock Space also includes a firewall that provides some great features, which you set inside the app.  For example, you can block specific websites you don’t want available on your network.  You can create a temporary ‘guest’ wireless network and password that times out after a set amount of time.  You can create groups and add devices to those groups (for example “kid’s devices”) and then add as many devices as you want to those groups.  Then you can disable access to all of them with 1 click.  Pretty cool.  If you are going to have more than 30 devices connected at once to your network (like during a party) you can turn on ‘capacity-oriented mode’ to control the bandwidth to all the devices.  The Rock Space has UPnP, which means it automatically recognizes the required ports of gaming devices, P2P devices, etc.</p>\n<p>The Rock Space also has a feature called QoS (Quality of service), which means that you can specify what the maximum upload and download speed should be for every device on the network and no device will be able to go over those speeds.  In this way, devices such as a gaming consoles or streaming movie services can’t hog the entire bandwidth.  This is particularly helpful for those folks who work out of their home and don’t want the kid’s hogging the bandwidth!  You cannot, however, get granular control over which devices are limited in bandwidth, which would be really nice. The limits you set apply to every device.  Some other products with QoS features do provide the ability to have granular control over specific devices, but the Rock Space QoS feature is a simple version and doesn’t provide that.</p>\n<p>The Rock Space also uses the MU-MIMO technology, which is awesome.  Again, in laymen’s terms, that means that when multiple devices are using bandwidth they all share the bandwidth.  Basically, that means that all devices on the network download at the same speed instead of fighting to get the same speed.  It just makes things smoother and with less buffering.</p>\n<h2><strong>Now, a word about how I tested the Rock Space</strong></h2>\n<p>What I did first was leave my existing wireless network in place and plug the first Rock Space device into the back of my existing router using the Ethernet cable. Then I set up the other 2 Rock Space mesh devices around the house.  That way, I had 2 wireless networks that I could test at the same time.  So I then went around to locations in the house and tested the upload/download speeds of my existing router (I did 10 tests at each location and averaged the results).  I then did the same thing with the Rock Space SSID.  So I had 2 sets of results that I could use to compare the 2 different wireless networks.  And yes, before you ask, when I tested the Rock Space network I disabled the SSID on the existing router so that network wouldn’t disrupt my up/down speeds!</p>\n<p>What I discovered was that the Rock Space mesh network performed just as good as the router from my internet provider and eliminated the dead spots on the front porch and the upstairs bonus room at the front of the house because I placed the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> mesh devices close to the front of the house.  It was wonderful. No more dead spots! The Rock Space also has a feature called ‘fast roaming’ that will automatically switch your device to the nearest mesh device if you are moving around the house.  I tested this and it worked great with my cellphone.  The app even has several screens where you can see which devices are connected to each mesh device, and you can even look at how much bandwidth (up and down) that any individual device is pulling at that moment.  So you can easily troubleshoot which device in your house might be hogging bandwidth at any moment.  Pretty neat.</p>\n<p>Finally, the app also lets you check for firmware updates and automatically install them on each mesh device.  Nice touch.</p>\n<h2>What I like</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Great price</li>\n<li>Easy-to-use setup and a great smart-phone app</li>\n<li>Strong security</li>\n<li>Many firewall features</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I’d change</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Not much.  I would like more granular control over individual device bandwidth usage</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>I am now a fan of mesh networks.  The convenience of having control over the network through an easy-to-use app is great, and the automatic “fast roaming” switching for my devices was seamless.  Setup was easy and worked with the instructions provided.  The security features provide me with some level of comfort, and the dead spots have been eliminated in my house, which is probably the best part of the whole thing. I compared the price of the Rock Space to other mesh network products and the price is very competitive.  There are mesh networking devices out there that have the very latest wireless networking protocols with much higher speeds, but right now they are much more expensive, and my internet connection couldn’t take advantage of those speeds anyway.  My negatives are basically none, and really the only feature I would want to see enhanced is more control over specific devices in the QoS section of the app.  But at $129.99 on Amazon, I see no reason not to purchase this.  If you have dead spots in your house and want more control over your network, with a strong level of security to protect yourself, the Rock Space is a great product!</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong>: $149.99<br>\n<strong>Where to buy</strong>: Buy here on <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aZRhbc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rockspace.cc/ac1200-dual-band-mesh-wifi-system-rockspace-usa.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rock Space</a> ($169.99 on their site)<br>\n<strong>Source</strong>: The sample of this product was provided by <a href=\"https://www.rockspace.cc/ac1200-dual-band-mesh-wifi-system-rockspace-usa.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rock Space</a>.</p>\n  <p>Filed in categories: <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/category/reviews/\" rel=\"category tag\">Reviews</a></p><p>Tagged: <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/tag/desktop_pc_products/\" rel=\"tag\">Computer Gear</a>, <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/tag/network/\" rel=\"tag\">Network</a>, <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/tag/routers/\" rel=\"tag\">Routers</a></p><p style=\"background-color: #ddd;\"><a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/2020/08/27/rock-space-whole-house-mesh-wifi-system-review/\">Rock Space Whole House Mesh Wifi System review</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com\">The Gadgeteer</a> on August 27, 2020 at 8:00 am.</p><p>Note: If you are subscribed to this feed through FeedBurner, please switch to our native feed URL <a href=\"http://the-gadgeteer.com/feed/\">http://the-gadgeteer.com/feed/</a> in order to ensure continuous delivery.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 12:00:37 +0000","feedId":2498,"bgimg":"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-1-2.jpg","linkMd5":"bd0622f9f65ce041d955df51c919f12a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/31/05-50-42-327_45c58736c273070e.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":516,"sourceBytes":224701,"destBytes":33914,"author":"Steve Holt","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-1-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/31/05-50-42-327_45c58736c273070e.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/31/05-51-05-829_96e6891291110d1f.webp","https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rock-Space-wifi-mesh-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn65@2020_6/2020/08/31/05-51-05-435_073956920441d21b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598853041848},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 13:50:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 13:50:41","title":"Scotts Gro 7 zone sprinkler controller review","link":"https://the-gadgeteer.com/?p=302492","description":"\n<p><strong><br>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304299\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_10.jpg 610w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_10-191x250.jpg 191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\"></strong></p>\n<p><strong>REVIEW</strong> – It is forecasted to be hotter and drier than normal through fall across the lower 48. This means that residents should water conservatively. The Scotts Gro 7 is a smart sprinkler controller that can precisely control the watering schedule and use local weather to water intelligently. Read on to see what I think!</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>The Scotts Gro 7 Zone controller is a device that connects to the solenoids that determine what zone is watered in an underground sprinkler system. The system also connects to a local 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. The Scotts Gro is controlled through the cloud with an app that runs on iOS or Android, or through a smart speaker powered by Alexa or Google Home. The controller was at one time branded as the Blossom. I actually have the Blossom controller but it works with the new app and as a like-for-like equivalent product.</p>\n<h2>What’s in the box?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Controller</li>\n<li>Power Supply</li>\n<li>Wall Screws</li>\n<li>Wire Labels</li>\n<li>Quick Start Guide</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Hardware specs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Zones: 7 (8 if not using a pump start relay)</li>\n<li>Connectivity: Wi-Fi</li>\n<li>Placement: Indoors</li>\n<li>EPA WaterSense Certified: Yes</li>\n<li>Dimensions: 6.95″ x 6.95″ x 1.55″</li>\n<li>Power input: 120 VAC</li>\n<li>Station input: 24 VAC</li>\n<li>Zone detection: automatic</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design and features</h2>\n<p>The Scotts Gro 7 Zone controller is different than most every other controller on the market. While most of the other controllers have faceplates of confusing buttons and switches, electromechanical timers, or hard to read and cryptic LCDs, like my old controller below, the Gro has a single glowing LED in its center. It looks like the environmentally friendly cousin of HAL 9000, without the penchant for eavesdropping or insubordination.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-304294\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_05.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_05-188x250.jpg 188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The design of the chassis takes into consideration that the unit must be wired by the user but also ensures that the integrated circuit board is protected. the front cover is easily removed to reveal the terminal block for wiring the stations but also keeps the main circuitry hidden behind a translucent plastic panel.</p>\n<p>The terminal block uses spring-loaded fasteners to hold the station wiring in place, so no bending wires around screws is required.</p>\n<p>The unit is powered by a 120 power adapter attached to a 6 foot cable. Normally, an irrigation controller is installed at least 6 feet from an outlet or power source, so this should meet most installation requirements.</p>\n<h3>Setup</h3>\n<p>Setup does involve a handful of steps but they are all easy and well documented in the literature that comes with the unit. The instructions are written out in English and include detailed pictures or diagrams so that no guesswork is required that is normally expected for assembling furniture.</p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304291\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_02-800x267.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_02-800x267.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_02-300x100.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_02-768x256.jpg 768w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_02-1536x512.jpg 1536w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_02-2048x683.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304292\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_03-800x263.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_03-800x263.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_03-300x99.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_03-768x252.jpg 768w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_03-1536x504.jpg 1536w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_03-2048x673.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304293\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_04-800x263.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_04-800x263.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_04-300x99.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_04-768x252.jpg 768w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_04-1536x505.jpg 1536w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_04-2048x673.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></strong></p>\n<p>The steps include:</p>\n<p>1. Label the wires on the existing system so that each zone is numbered consistently on the old and new system and that the common wire is identified. The system comes with self adhesive labels with pre-printed numbers.</p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304295\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_06-800x373.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_06-800x373.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_06-300x140.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_06-768x358.jpg 768w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_06-1536x716.jpg 1536w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_06.jpg 1717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></strong></p>\n<p>2. Remove the old controller. Before doing this it may help to record the existing settings if the current watering scheme is providing satisfactory results. The old weather sensors may also be removed. The new controller uses real-time weather forecasts from the internet to adjust watering.</p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304297\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_08.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_08-188x250.jpg 188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></strong></p>\n<p>3. Install the new controller. The screws provided mount through the front panel.</p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304298\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_09.jpg 600w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_09-188x250.jpg 188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></strong></p>\n<p>4. Connect the wires to the corresponding ports on the new controller. The controller supports a pump start relay used in irrigation systems that draw upon a well for a water source. This may also be attached to the main solenoid if the irrigation system comes of an artesian well. If neither of these situations applies to the irrigation system then this circuit may be used to control the 8th zone.</p>\n<p>5. Power the controller</p>\n<p>6. Record the pairing code off of the front of the unit and attach the faceplate.</p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-304296\" src=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_07-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_07-800x600.jpg 800w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_07-300x225.jpg 300w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_07-768x576.jpg 768w, https://the-gadgeteer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scotts_Gro_07.jpg 1067w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></strong></p>\n<p>7. Download the app. The GRO app will work with the Blossom controller. The reverse may not be true. Setting up the app and account will allow control and monitoring of the irrigation system from anywhere there is internet access.</p>\n<p>8. Pair the controller to the existing Wi-Fi. The Blossom requires a 2.4GHz network.</p>\n<p>9. Pair the controller to the app account. This requires using the code that is on the inner faceplate of the controller.</p>\n<h3>Operation</h3>\n<p>Operating the Gro from the mobile app is easier than using a traditional zone controller, mostly because it does not require the operator to be directly near wherever the controller is installed. For each zone there are a number of different options that can be set. The watering schedule allows for Fixed days of the week, interval days of 2 through 7 days, or odd or even days. The watering time can be set for sunrise, sunset, or a specified time. The sunrise and sunset times allow hourly offsets from two hours before up to two hours after each event.</p>\n<p>The watering mode allows for either smart watering or a custom duration. A custom duration allows just a specific time to water. Smart watering adjusts watering based on the plant type: succulents, shrubs, flowers, trees or grass (in order of how much water each type of plant needs). The watering mode also bases the time on the nozzle type: drip, bubbler, sprays, rotors and sprinklers. There is a switch to indicate if the area gets rainfall. Finally, there is a slider to adjust rainfall from 20% t 210% of the calculated values the program selects.</p>\n<p>On the zone screen there is also an option to set a soak cycle so that the watering will happen multiple times a day. This is useful to limit runoff of water.</p>\n<p>There is an on-demand portion of the app that allows running a particular zome or running all of the zones for a specified time.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there is a section that shows a historical calendar of what zone was run and for how long.</p>\n<p>While the app is very useful, there are some things I wish the app were better at. When there is a program running the app does not provide notifications that it is operating or that a cycle has started. The app does alert the operator that a cycle will be skipped based on the sufficient amount of recent rainfall. Also, there is no ability to pause the operation, so that someone may cross the yard to put away a toy, for example. These are two things that a mobile controlled irrigation system should be designed to do.</p>\n<p>When your phone is not around you can turn the irrigation system on or off using an Alexa or Google Home smart speaker. The smart speaker will turn all zones on, turn on a specified zone for a specified time, or stop all watering.</p>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>Some existing product reviews have correctly indicated that if the internet is disconnected that the device will not function. This is an accurate assessment – it does not seem that the device is preloaded with cycle information and even if it were, that controlling the pre-programmed cycle would be impossible.</p>\n<h2>What I like</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Very configurable and easy to read app</li>\n<li>lots of control options</li>\n<li>Easy Set up</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I’d change</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow the watering to be paused</li>\n<li>put a play / pause button on the controller</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>The added flexibility and local weather control the Scotts Gro has mare than makes up for the lack of a local on off button. For more money there are competitors from Orbit and Rachio that have more zones and a local display.</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong>: $65.90<br>\n<strong>Where to buy</strong>: <a
