How a Virtual Private Network can help protect your privacy online</bi-shortcode><p>VPNs create private internet connections across public networks, not only keeping your IP address confidential but ensuring that others can&#39;t gain access to your devices and allowing you to navigate the internet without being tracked. </p><p>Companies like NordVPN and ExpressVPN have offered a subscription-based VPN service for many years, but Google is getting in on the security game with its new VPN by Google One service. </p><h2>What is VPN by Google One </h2><p>Available exclusively to people in the United States for $9.99 per month, those who purchase the monthly subscription get access to several services and online security benefits - all tied directly to your Google account. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606f333b4d3e410018b70075?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google One VPN 1\" height=\"1291\" width=\"2363\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Google One&#39;s VPN service offers online security for Android users.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Abbey White/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>That includes increased security, allowing you to download and stream via a private encrypted internet connection and protect against hackers on public networks such as a coffee shop or library&#39;s WiFi connection. Users also get a shielded IP address so that no one can track them by their location. </p><h2>How the Google VPN works </h2><p>Unlike some other VPN programs, using Google&#39;s VPN service doesn&#39;t require any special configuration.</p><p>Instead, it&#39;s accessed via the Google One app and can be turned on and off within the Benefits menu. Simply toggle the VPN option to the on position when you want to use it and tap again when you want to turn it off. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606f352130004b0019b26ae5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google One VPN 2\" height=\"1145\" width=\"720\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Just toggle on the VPN in the Google One app to instantly get online protection.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Abbey White/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>According to Google, the VPN won&#39;t slow down your internet connection, nor will it track or sell your browsing history or use your connection to personally identify you. </p><h2>What you need to use the Google One VPN</h2><p>At present, the Google VPN service is only available on Android devices. However, on the VPN&#39;s site, Google does note plans to expand the service to iOS, ChromeOS, Windows, and Mac in the near future. </p><p>Using Google&#39;s VPN service requires you to have a paid <a href=\"https://one.google.com/about/plans\">Google One storage plan</a> of 2 TB, with the service automatically included at no additional cost. It is easily accessible through the Google One app.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606f358a30004b0019b26aed?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google One VPN 3\" height=\"920\" width=\"720\"

connection can be set up simultaneously across six separate devices per plan, so long as the Google One app is installed on each of them. </p><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module-end-of-article\"

Still, there are a few key factors to consider.</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Size:</strong> Just like laptops, portable monitors are typically available in 13.3-, 15.6-, and 17.3- inch sizes. Consider what it is you'll be using it for before you decide. Larger displays offer a better viewing experience so they're best for games and entertainment. However, they also tend to be heavier. If portability and traveling light are your main concerns, then a smaller screen might be a better choice.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Resolution:</strong> The resolution of a portable monitor determines how sharp and detailed the image will look. Portable monitors are available in 4K, Full HD 1080p, and lower resolutions &#8211; though 1080p is the standard.&#160;</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> A USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 connection is the best available. It's more powerful, has faster transfer speeds, and is becoming the standard on many laptops. However, some portable displays also include common video connections like HDMI, allowing you to easily connect them to game consoles and media players. Others still have USB ports, some of which can also be used to power the monitor directly from a connected device.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Refresh rate and response time:</strong> If you're buying a portable monitor for gaming, you should be mindful of the display's refresh rate and response time. Refresh rates higher than 60Hz can provide a smoother experience when gaming at higher frame rates. Some portable gaming monitors come with 240Hz refresh rates, which is pretty impressive considering it outpaces frame rates in most PC games.</li></ul>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/best-portable-monitor'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Ekwbb05ZwMM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:54:44 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f3bfce0a3eafa001de06be6?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"767729223e944b146d91ef99d3dcd7af","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn76@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-21-162_494ad7b96535bb2e.webp","destWidth":1200,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":43756,"destBytes":43756,"author":"insider@insider.com (Michelle Rae Uy,Sarah Lord)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f3bf4b3650894001d0721bc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn11@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-17-835_b6397ace91dd024b.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f3bf67d650894001d0721d0?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn75@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-20-044_e9b013f2c8d13cf8.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f3bf7aea3eafa001de06bb6?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-21-780_7b5bdcfe7db56cc1.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f3bfafd650894001d0721f1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn92@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-18-884_c3cce5e98fa548ac.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f3bfc38650894001d0721fe?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn40@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-435_1da5170b42f99d09.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-967_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-23-136_f54d837ac65efbde.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-19-389_ff04879c760ad6b8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-669_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Ekwbb05ZwMM:74S6gtm5BPY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn87@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-20-161_45df75a707086160.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Ekwbb05ZwMM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn72@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-20-015_b6c34d149312de99.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986505564},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","title":"The SEC says it's looking closely at the wild earnings projections attached to many SPAC offerings","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/sec-spac-earnings-wild-projections-offering-black-check-ipo-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60704f294d3e410018b7031a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission logo adorns an office door at the SEC headquarters in Washington, June 24, 2011.

The agency added that it will &#34;look carefully&#34; at SPAC filings and disclosures as well as those of their private targets.</p><p>John Coates, the agency&#39;s acting director for the corporation finance division, said <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/spacs-ipos-liability-risk-under-securities-laws?campaign_id=4&emc=edit_dk_20210409&instance_id=29035&nl=dealbook&regi_id=85242594&segment_id=55266&te=1&user_id=b7ecb39412279947d1966b4c36d2a5e0&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdeliveryium=email&#38;utm_source=govdelivery\">on Thursday</a> that a company would be on &#34;shaky ground&#34; if it only disclosed favorable projections and omitted &#34;equally reliable but unfavorable projections.&#34;</p><p>Special purpose acquisition companies or SPACs have been booming, enabling many pre-revenue startups to go public. SPACs are essentially shell companies seeking to merge with private companies with the intention of taking them public. SPACs are often considered a cheaper, faster alternative to a traditional IPO.</p><p>SPAC sponsors have also generally been allowed to more freely give projections of future growth than is allowed for companies going public via traditional IPO, which are not allowed to broadcast future sales or earnings.</p><p>Coates pointed to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act safe harbor, a legal liability SPACs often refer to when making optimistic forward-looking statements. </p><p>&#34;This...is the reason that sponsors, targets, and others involved in a de-SPAC feel comfortable presenting projections and other valuation material of a kind that is not commonly found in conventional IPO prospectuses,&#34; he said, referring to the safe harbor. </p><p>This, he said, raises significant investor protection questions, and is why he is calling on the agency to treat SPAC deals with the same level of scrutiny as IPOs. </p><p>&#34;Any simple claim about reduced liability exposure for SPAC participants is overstated at best, and potentially seriously misleading at worst,&#34; Coates said. &#34;Indeed, in some ways, liability risks for those involved are higher, not lower, than in conventional IPOs, due in particular to the potential conflicts of interest in the SPAC structure.&#34;</p><p>Coates added that while projections are woven into the fabric of business combinations, they have to be fair. Forward-looking information, he said, can be &#34;untested, speculative, misleading or even fraudulent, as reflected in the limitations on the PSLRA&#39;s liability protections.&#34; He floated the possibility of having guidance about how projections and related valuations should be presented.</p><p>SPACs have attracted a number of high-profile investors including famed fund manager Bill Ackman and billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya.

the secretary of state added. </p><p>Former President Donald Trump had a starkly different perspective on foreign affairs, as evidenced by his &#34;America First&#34; philosophy. Trump often took a unilateral approach to foreign policy, pulling the US out of major agreements and railing against international institutions the US played a key role in establishing, like the United Nations and NATO. Experts and diplomats warned that Trump&#39;s handling of foreign policy <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-chaotic-coronavirus-response-has-created-void-china-is-filling-2020-4\">created a void in global leadership that China was rapidly filling.</a></p><p>Blinken&#39;s summary of Biden&#39;s foreign policy to The Post presented a picture of a president with a decidedly traditional, but also pragmatic worldview. Biden believes the US should be at the helm in terms of global leadership, which includes challenging China and Russia, but also views cooperation and compromise as crucial aspects of effective foreign policy.</p><p>&#34;The president is very clear-eyed about two things,&#34; Blinken told the Post: He must &#34;hold Russia to account for any reckless or adversarial actions it takes&#34; while simultaneously remaining open to &#34;areas in which it may be in our mutual interest to work with Russia.&#34; Biden recently referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose critics often wind up dead or seriously harmed, as a &#34;killer.&#34; This prompted outrage from the Kremlin. </p><p>Blinken, who got into a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-proud-of-blinken-after-confrontation-with-chinas-top-diplomat-2021-3\">public spat with China&#39;s top diplomat in Alaska</a> last month after bringing up the Chinese government&#39;s human rights abuses, also said it&#39;s not the goal of the US to &#34;contain China, hold China back, keep it down.&#34;</p><p>This, however, deviates from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-says-wont-let-china-become-most-wealthy-powerful-country-2021-3\">Biden&#39;s recent messaging on China</a>. The president in a recent speech, for example, said that he wouldn&#39;t let China become the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world. </p><p>&#34;They have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world.

I promise you, they are not waiting,&#34; Biden said in a speech earlier this week touting his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. &#34;But they are counting on American democracy to be too slow, too limited, and too divided to keep up the pace.&#34;</p><p>The Biden administration this week also took steps to derail China&#39;s effort to build the world&#39;s fastest supercomputer, necessary for the development of virtually-unstoppable hypersonic missiles and other advanced weapons. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/blinken-biden-believes-when-us-isnt-leading-world-creates-chaos-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/WZ5jDovhrfU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:37:20 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60707a464943790018bb1a28?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"e5e1864364f1f4d26b46c25670dcf28b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn40@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-21-220_e5d3aabce5463fb2.webp","destWidth":1778,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":53666,"destBytes":53666,"author":"insider@insider.com (John Haltiwanger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60707a344943790018bb1a27?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn96@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-21-679_b7c3ee0aa4bb96e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-967_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn92@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-18-336_fddf7cb505fd37d1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn4@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-712_7d871556b13423e4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-669_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=WZ5jDovhrfU:YMcELHXy7gk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn75@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-19-793_19e5e9f12476bf0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/WZ5jDovhrfU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn31@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-204_25b69f74532da1d3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986505565},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","title":"Billionaire investor Peter Thiel called out Apple and Google, warned about TikTok and bitcoin, and criticized China at a recent event.

But they have been very good at copying things, stealing things.&#34;</p><p><strong>2.</strong> &#34;I criticized Google a few years ago for working with Chinese universities and Chinese researchers. And since everything in China is a civilian-military fusion, Google was effectively working with the Chinese military. One of the things that I was sort of told by some of the insiders at Google was they figured they might as well give the technology out the front door, because if they didn&#39;t give it, it would get stolen anyway.&#34;</p><p><strong>3.</strong> &#34;I had a set of conversations with some of the DeepMind AI people at Google. I asked them, &#39;Is your AI being used to run the concentration camps in Xinjiang?&#39; and they said, &#39;Well, we don&#39;t know and don&#39;t ask any questions.&#39; You have this almost magical thinking that by pretending everything is fine, that&#39;s how you engage and have a conversation, and you make the world better.&#34; - <em>A DeepMind spokesperson told Insider: &#34;This claim is entirely false. We have never worked with the Chinese military and have been clear since DeepMind was founded that our research and technology is intended for use in ways that are beneficial to society.&#34;</em></p><p><strong>4.</strong> &#34;If you look at the big five tech companies, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft all have very, very little presence in China. So they aren&#39;t a naturally pro-China constituency. Apple is probably the one that&#39;s structurally a real problem, because the whole iPhone supply chain gets made from China.&#34;</p><p><strong>5.</strong> &#34;We need to call companies like Google out for working on AI with communist China. I also think we should be putting a lot of pressure on Apple.&#34;</p><p><strong>6.</strong> &#34;At Facebook, during the Hong Kong protests a year ago, the employees from Hong Kong were all in favor of the protests and free speech. But there were more employees at Facebook who were born in China than who were born in Hong Kong. And the Chinese nationals actually said that it was just Western arrogance, and they shouldn&#39;t be taking Hong Kong&#39;s side and things like that. The internal debate felt like people were actually more anti-Hong Kong than pro-Hong Kong.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-arbitrage-trading-strategy-alameda-research-sam-bankman-fried-billionaire-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A 29-year-old self-made billionaire breaks down how he achieved daily returns of 10% on million-dollar crypto trades, and shares how to find the best opportunities</a></em></p><p><strong>7.</strong> &#34;TikTok is problematic because it has this incredible exfiltration of data about people. You are creating this incredibly privacy-invading map of a large part of the population of the Western world. It is a fairly powerful application of AI in a certain sense, as they find ways to make it especially addictive and figure out what videos to show you to keep you watching more and more. It doesn&#39;t seem that if you shut it down, it would be an economic catastrophe.&#34;</p><p><strong>8.</strong> &#34;In a totalitarian society, you have no qualms about getting data on everybody, in every way possible. That makes AI a very tricky technology, because there are a lot of ways we don&#39;t actually want to apply it in the US or West.&#34; - <em>highlighting the Chinese government&#39;s use of AI for widescale facial recognition.</em></p><p><strong>9.</strong> &#34;People often say crypto or bitcoin is a vaguely libertarian technology. If crypto is kind of libertarian, AI is kind of communist.&#34;</p><p><strong>10.</strong> &#34;Even though I&#39;m sort of a pro-crypto, pro-bitcoin maximalist person, I do wonder whether bitcoin should be partly thought of as a Chinese financial weapon against the US. It threatens fiat money, especially the US dollar, and China wants to do things to weaken the dollar. If China&#39;s long bitcoin, perhaps the US should be asking some tougher questions about exactly how that works.&#34;</p><p><strong>11.</strong> &#34;An internal stable coin in China - that&#39;s not a real cryptocurrency. That&#39;s just some sort of totalitarian measuring device.&#34;</p><p><strong>12.</strong> &#34;Make it harder for Chinese investors to invest in the US, and perhaps we should also make it a little bit harder for American investors to invest in China. We have US investors that invest in China and become a big constituency for open capital flows. I think a decent part of the Wall Street crowd is pretty bad in this regard. I would dial it back on both sides - making it harder for US investors to invest in China is an almost equally important part of this.&#34;<br><br><strong>13.</strong> &#34;China doesn&#39;t like the US having the reserve currency, because it gives us a lot of leverage over Iranian oil supply chains and all sorts of things like that. You can think of the Euro in part as a Chinese weapon against the dollar. China would have liked to see two reserve currencies.&#34;</p><p><strong>14.</strong> &#34;One of the very strange dynamics in Silicon Valley is people don&#39;t do very much with semiconductors anymore. One of the weird problems with 20 years of intellectual property theft, and where IP doesn&#39;t really have as much value as it used to, is that you learn not to invest in things like that.&#34;</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-stock-picks-for-higher-eps-earnings-growth-consensus-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goldman Sachs handpicks 40 stocks that will enjoy bigger earnings growth than Wall Street expects in 2021</a></em></p><p><strong>15.</strong> &#34;People are too anchored to doing things that worked in the past or copying some model. Building a new search engine was the right thing for Google to do in 1999. It&#39;s probably not the right thing to do today. It&#39;s very hard to compete against Google by doing the exact same thing they are doing.&#34;</p><p><strong>16.</strong> &#34;You can think of big tech as something that&#39;s very natural. It&#39;s maybe unnaturally big. It&#39;s unhealthy. It&#39;s too strong. But there&#39;s something in the nature of tech to be big. Big science is actually an oxymoron. If you have some giant science factory, there&#39;s probably not much science going on at all.&#34; - <em>criticizing how science has become overly institutionalized and dominated by large corporations.</em></p><p><strong>17.</strong> &#34;De-platforming President Trump was really quite extraordinary. That does feel like you really crossed some kind of Rubicon where you declare war on maybe a third, 40% of the country - that seems really crazy.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-thiel-criticizes-apple-google-warns-tiktok-bitcoin-china-threat-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/V3grwtBKI6k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:06:35 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/55313468eab8ea514c8b456a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"204cb67cb80f4b667858049652554943","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn67@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-639_e6eb1489dee10b92.webp","destWidth":4985,"destHeight":3739,"sourceBytes":284344,"destBytes":284344,"author":"tmohamed@businessinsider.com (Theron Mohamed)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/540ff874eab8ea281c65a625?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn48@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-18-903_7cc8270525b2cfeb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-967_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn20@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-23-064_48e31a1f7bfa6222.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn63@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-18-310_3cb6170c99ae5b63.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-669_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=V3grwtBKI6k:oL2jQxR5ifw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn99@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-21-037_027baa42e28bac1f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/V3grwtBKI6k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn36@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-860_22ad850305f57d71.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986505574},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","title":"Former GOP House Speaker John Boehner says he wishes he'd fought against Bill Clinton's impeachment by Republicans","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/john-boehner-says-he-wishes-hed-fought-bill-clintons-impeachment-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60704f384d3e410018b7031b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Former U.S. President Bill Clinton shakes hands with House Speaker John Boehner at the Inaugural Luncheon in Statuary Hall on Inauguration day at the U.S. Capitol building January 21, 2013 in Washington D.C.\" height=\"640\" width=\"1280\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Former U.S. President Bill Clinton shakes hands with House Speaker John Boehner at the Inaugural Luncheon in Statuary Hall on Inauguration day at the U.S. Capitol building January 21, 2013 in Washington D.C.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Allison Shelley/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>John Boehner, the former Republican House Speaker, wrote in his forthcoming memoir that he regrets supporting former President Bill Clinton&#39;s impeachment. </li>\n<li>He argued that the impeachment was a political effort by his party to win House seats in the midterms. </li>\n<li>&#34;I regret it now,&#34;

He said the few vacations he&#39;d taken in the pandemic had allowed him to read, play his guitar, and spend more time outside.</p><p>Canada&#39;s second-biggest bank also offered its global workforce of around 86,000 workers a free one-year subscription to Headspace, which usually <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/subscriptions?gclid=CjwKCAjw9r-DBhBxEiwA9qYUpXlpH4gbUYZI45K3Xexhj15ZyPYoytNGhTIsK6xcmmGdpHQjwKwB_xoCLbQQAvD_BwE\">costs $69.99</a>.</p><p>&#34;Beyond this extra day off, we recognize the ongoing pressures of the pandemic, especially for those in regions that have reverted back into lockdown,&#34; McKay said. Canada is currently in a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/canada-3rd-covid-19-wave-young-people-new-variants-2021-4\">third wave of coronavirus infections</a> which has mainly hit the province of Ontario, where RBC headquarters are. The province has introduced new restrictions to stop the spread.</p><p>&#34;I encourage all of you to prioritize your personal time and continue to be mindful about work-life boundaries wherever possible,&#34; McKay told staff in the memo.</p><p>Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada&#39;s largest bank, has also told staff they would get an extra day off work. CEO Bharat Masrani said in a memo to staff, seen by Bloomberg, that they should take the day off when they need it the most. </p><p>&#34;After a year of sacrifice and disruption, we must all endure these challenging circumstances for a bit longer,&#34; Masrani said in the memo. &#34;I know that this has not been easy, and everyone is tired.&#34;</p><p>The bank&#39;s decisions to give staff an additional day off come after Goldman Sachs was criticized for making <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-junior-bankers-inhumane-working-conditions-survey-2021-3\">junior bankers work 100-hour weeks</a> in &#34;inhumane&#34; conditions, leading to poor mental health.</p><p>Citigroup also launched a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/citigroup-ceo-jane-fraser-bans-friday-video-calls-zoom-vacation-2021-3\">&#34;Citi Reset Day&#34;</a> on March 28 - a company-wide holiday to relieve stress on staff.

a cold, rainy February evening back in 2017, my father-in-law and I were frantically taking turns manning a pair of wet/dry vacuums as we fought to keep a flood contained to a basement room since known as the &#34;sewer closet.&#34;</p><p>We won the battle and kept the carpet of the adjoining playroom clean and dry, but I lost the larger war, having to call in professional plumbers to clear out our sewer line the next day. The cause of the backup? Baby wipes. And only a few, mind you. Usually, our household doesn&#39;t flush wipes, but I had slacked a time or two and those few fateful flushes were all it took.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"5ac7c65f7ec3bb1b008b4a14\" data-title=\"The best hand soaps of 2021\" data-url=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-hand-soap\" data-thumbnail=\"https://i.insider.com/undefined\">Related Article Module: The best hand soaps of 2021</bi-shortcode><p>Disposal issues and plumbing catastrophes aside, over-relying on wet wipes is ethically questionable. Since most are nonbiodegradable, they linger in landfills and can potentially make their way into the ocean. So, what can you do if you love keeping clean with wet wipes (hey, all parents know that there&#39;s no law stipulating they&#39;re just for babies) but want to avoid the risk of causing damage to your toilet <em>and</em> the environment?</p><p>Well, there&#39;s the excellent option of converting your toilet paper into a wet wipe using <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1319806&u=1088116&m=86257&urllink=fohm%2Eco%2F&afftrack=biipf%5F022219%5Ffohm%2Ddispenserfohm%2Ddispenser\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fohm</a>. No, not foam, Fohm. Although, Fohm <em>does</em> use foam.

The pH-balanced formula contains water, aloe, citric acid, and sulfates (this provides the foaming action), but is free of parabens, alcohol, and fragrance. The brand says the ingredients are quite close to what you&#39;d find in a baby wipe and that they&#39;re well-rated from the <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/&source=gmail&ust=1583609437663000&usg=AFQjCNGMTQMTaeIn45vEmswumyzQcuKh1QwumyzQcuKh1Q\">Environmental Working Group&#39;s Skin Deep Directory</a>. </p><p>You simply hold toilet paper under the unit&#39;s sensor-operated nozzle and it automatically deposits a dollop of skin-safe foam, effectively turning it into a &#34;wet wipe.&#34; And once you&#39;re done with the DIY wet wipe, you can toss it into the toilet and flush away, knowing the paper will break down as it should, not clogging pipes or posing a risk to aquatic life down the line.</p><p>One more thing to note: as fancy as this system might seem, it actually saves you money in the long run. The starter pack costs $49, and after that, refills are $19 every three to five months (how often you&#39;ll need to re-up depends on the number of people in your household). This means a family of four could spend almost $7 on a single pack of baby wipes <em>or</em> put that money towards a month&#39;s worth of eco-friendly, plumbing-safe <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffohm.co%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Fohm</a> foam.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"button\" data-pid=\"5e625a28fee23d701e01546c\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Home Starter Pack (button)</bi-shortcode><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/fohm-dispenser-review-wet-wipe-alternative'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/zdhZK0UxvVo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:17:47 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5c70330a342cca28282d9f07?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"8cb39749860e7644d5a0fbba99ea92b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn52@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-21-502_559e25af78fd076f.webp","destWidth":869,"destHeight":652,"sourceBytes":12942,"destBytes":12942,"author":"stevenjohn23@gmail.com (Steven John)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5c70332b2628984765223acd?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn79@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-22-026_36d74c405342e8b0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-967_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn52@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-23-285_0783f0d1b02ffa27.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-18-747_eed7b5cfb05529a4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-669_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=zdhZK0UxvVo:1hosqOf8NVk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn55@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-20-010_deac427468434c07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/zdhZK0UxvVo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn16@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-21-116_42663c933222a63a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986505569},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","title":"Officials in Georgia and Colorado pause distribution of J&J vaccine after minor adverse reactions","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/colorado-and-north-carolina-pause-distribution-of-jj-vaccine-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606f7cf930004b0019b26c5f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"GettyImages 1231620333\" height=\"1249\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which only requires one shot instead of two.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Stephen Zenner/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Less than 1% of Johnson &#38;

burgers, is exploring a public listing that could give the company a valuation of $10 billion, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-impossible-foods-m-a-exclusive-idUSKBN2BV2SF\">Reuters reported</a> on Thursday.</p><p>At its last funding round in March 2020, the plant-based meat company was valued at <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/impossible-foods-raises-$500-million-at-nearly-$4-billion-valuation---source-8634005\">$4 billion</a>.</p><p>Impossible is now weighing options between going public via an initial public offering or a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, Reuters said, citing sources. This could happen within a span of the next 12 months.</p><p>Financial advisers have been approached to help manage discussions with SPACs that have already extended offers at a lucrative valuation, sources told Reuters. The SPAC route could diminish the positions of existing shareholders more substantially compared to an IPO.</p><p>Impossible Foods was founded by CEO Pat Brown in 2011 when he was on a sabbatical from teaching biochemistry at Stanford University&#39;s medical school. Brown previously <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/impossible-foods-ceo-pat-brown-career-advice-2020-1\">told Insider</a> he wished he gained an understanding of the meat industry earlier in his career, so he could&#39;ve launched Impossible Foods sooner.</p><p>The company is backed by venture capitalists Khosla Ventures and Horizons Ventures, and more than a dozen superstar investors ranging from pop icon Katy Perry to tennis champion Serena Williams and rapper Jay-Z.</p><p>Shares in rival plant-based company <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/bynd-stock\">Beyond Meat</a> are trading more than 400% higher above its public debut price in 2019.</p><p>Several private companies are eager to be acquired by SPACs after a surge in popularity within the space last year. More than $98 billion has been raised across 306 SPAC IPOs so far in 2021, surpassing last year&#39;s record of $83 billion, according to <a href=\"https://spacinsider.com/stats/\">data from SPACInsider.com</a>.</p><p>Many of these companies may be unaware of the legal implications of not fully understanding the disclosures they can and can&#39;t make when going public. For this reason, the Securities and Exchange Commission has <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/spac-blank-check-merger-sec-official-blank-dealmakers-risks-complexities-2021-4-1030267783\">warned SPAC dealmakers</a> of the risks and governance issues related with raising capital through blank-check firms.</p><p>A spokesperson for Impossible declined to comment on the Reuters report.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/impossible-foods-ipo-spac-stock-market-listing-10-billion-valuation-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/wvwVWXh1ivs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:19:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606ffb944d3e410018b7028a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"95bb96bfff59462f669963553ddec874","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn56@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-17-967_d3bbbd3db600bb4b.webp","destWidth":877,"destHeight":658,"sourceBytes":54432,"destBytes":54432,"author":"snagarajan@businessinsider.com (Shalini Nagarajan)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606ffbdd4d3e410018b7028c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn7@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-22-099_3dc7b6ca9c34a8ec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-967_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-19-536_b0b98053b4ad4cc0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-21-459_3927690870a12ca2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-669_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=wvwVWXh1ivs:H-1McuC8ehU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn92@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-848_b2ab6b2ebbfe326d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/wvwVWXh1ivs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn28@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-22-188_7a425a254c3bb134.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986505542},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","title":"The best deals and sales happening on Amazon right now - save $30 on a Google Nest thermostat","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-deals-on-amazon","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>If you buy through our links, we may earn money from affiliate partners. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/600eee2f1958200011554c2c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Amazon Best Deals and Sales 2x1\" height=\"1667\" width=\"3334\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alyssa Powell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>We update this list of Amazon deals every day with the new discounts as they crop up.</li>\n<li><strong>You can</strong> <strong>sign up for a free 30-day </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/31Q1AK6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>membership trial</strong></a><strong> to get Prime shipping along with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-benefits-what-is-included\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other perks</a>. </strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visit Insider Reviews&#39;

used clothes. Fueling the movement? Gen Z, of course.</p><p>The secondhand clothing market is a growing one. It&#39;s currently worth $30 billion, according to a recent Jefferies note, and is estimated to grow annually by 18% through 2024. About a quarter of the secondhand market is resale clothing, which Jefferies estimates to grow by 39% annually in the same time frame to eventually comprise over half of the market.</p><p>Based on these estimations, Jefferies forecasts the secondhand clothing market will comprise a mid-teen percentage of the overall apparel market over the next decade, driven by online resale, and when that happens, every other demographic will just be catching up to Gen Z, who&#39;s already there.</p><p>Look no further than social shopping apps like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/poshmark-sellers-made-side-hustles-six-figure-businesses-2020-1\">Poshmark</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/depop-sellers-turn-side-hustles-into-full-time-businesses-2020-2\">Depop</a> for proof. Both have garnered large Gen Z user bases, who have taken to the apps to sell and buy secondhand clothing and accessories.</p><p>&#34;This company is for the next generation,&#34; Rachel Swidenbank, vice president of marketplace at Depop, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/teens-earn-money-fashion-depop-app-2019-4\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"87df5ed4bc51f3c3467e31cd5f88aa54\">previously told Insider&#39;s Mary Hanbury</a>. She said that 90% of Depop&#39;s users are under the age of 26.</p><p>Recycling and reselling clothes helps the digitally native generation wear new-to-them outfits on a budget they haven&#39;t yet posted to social, avoiding repeating looks. There, too, is the sustainable aspect of secondhand clothing - Gen Z is more willing than any other generation to pay more for sustainable products, according to a <a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/160569/1.14.2020%20The%20State%20of%20Consumer%20Spending%20Gen%20Z%20Shoppers%20Demand%20Sustainable%20Retail.pdf?utm_campaign=Report%3A%20Generation%20Z%20Demands%20Sustainable%20Retail&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=81840717&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KnjMMpk6jXj5rZMQXtGXpayoLmYGW9K36iVFMnUEQJsSWcqzDgukq6CfjFcy3WhJo-BNMFhO8FPaCQmU-JWI6VB2nwQo7qxwJ2ALQmv9ocp7LH4k&utm_content=81840717&utm_source=hs_automationsource=hs_automation\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"ac8941f14f4414f09f062776139608e8\">consumer spending analysis by First Insight</a>.</p><p>For active sellers, it&#39;s also a tool to start a lucrative side hustle. Depop sellers can pull in as much as $300,000 a year and have been able to buy houses and cars before they&#39;ve even reached college age, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/depop-sellers-turn-side-hustles-into-full-time-businesses-2020-2\">Swidenbank said</a>. And young sellers on Poshmark <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/poshmark-sellers-made-side-hustles-six-figure-businesses-2020-1\">told Insider&#39;s Jennifer Ortakales Dawkins</a> they were able to grow their resale hustle into a full-time business earning six figures or more in annual sales. </p><p>But even though Gen Z is driving the secondhand frenzy, they&#39;re not the only ones getting swept up in the trend. Emily Farra <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/the-year-in-secondhand-vintage-upcycling-sustainable-fashion\">reported in November for Vogue</a> that secondhand, vintage, and upcycling caught steam in 2020. She cited Lyst&#39;s annual <a href=\"https://www.lyst.co.uk/year-in-fashion-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-event-click=\"{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.lyst.co.uk/year-in-fashion-2020\"}co.uk/year-in-fashion-2020&#34;}\">Year in Fashion report</a>, which revealed a 35,000 increase in searches for &#34;vintage fashion&#34; and a 104% increase in entries for secondhand-related keywords in September.</p><p>Shoppers are rethinking their carbon footprint and looking for more unique pieces as clothing companies become more ubiquitous, she wrote, and brands are accommodating the rising interest. But there&#39;s also something to be said of the more subtle statement of a vintage piece of clothing over a flashy logo in a pandemic world.</p><p>As Farra wrote, &#34;In a difficult year that&#39;s seen staggering unemployment and countless shuttered businesses, the shift toward vintage and secondhand could come down to a desire for less-conspicuous fashion.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-driving-online-resale-secondhand-clothes-thrifting-poshmark-depop-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/W5I8OqiIM3Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:53:17 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606fc1114d3e410018b7025e?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"dd20816684c3cc6fc6d6385b8381115f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-46-053_3ac5a3685500c7e9.webp","destWidth":2500,"destHeight":1875,"sourceBytes":237046,"destBytes":237046,"author":"hhoffower@businessinsider.com (Hillary Hoffower)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606fc1114d3e410018b7025e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-46-053_3ac5a3685500c7e9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-967_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn52@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-475_4a4a606684c7a86a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn35@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-628_e60fe2b927b71b2f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-669_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=W5I8OqiIM3Y:51s6vv-Dp90:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn31@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-18-223_5bd44567beb13f3f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/W5I8OqiIM3Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn75@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-21-945_8c72b5c6acbe8285.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986505566},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","title":"Kim Kardashian West's shapewear line, Skims, is now worth over $1 billion after leaning into loungewear during the pandemic","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-west-skims-worth-over-1-billion-nyt-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60704edc30004b0019b26d44?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Kim Kardashian Skims\" height=\"2052\" width=\"2730\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Kim Kardashian West at the launch of Skims at Nordstrom in New York City in February 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Nordstrom</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Kim Kardashian West&#39;s shapewear brand, Skims, is valued at $1.6 billion, The New York Times reports.</li>\n<li>Skims offers shapewear and loungewear that&#39;s inclusive of a range of sizes and skin tones.</li>\n<li>Kardashian West is worth $1 billion in her own right thanks to Skims and her KKW Beauty makeup line.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Kim Kardashian West&#39;s shapewear company has joined the unicorn club. </p><p>The 2-year-old brand, called Skims, has raised $154 million in new funding from Josh Kushner&#39;s Thrive Capital, as well as from existing investors, Imaginary Ventures and Alliance Consumer Growth.

is a popular saying within some parts of the cryptocurrency community, and for good reason.</p><p>It&#39;s a reminder that if you choose to store your <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bitcoin</a> on a cryptocurrency exchange account, the exchange actually owns the key to your digital assets. And if you don&#39;t own the private keys needed to transfer and access your bitcoin, you don&#39;t control it.</p><p>So how exactly do you control your keys and, by extension, your bitcoin? A dedicated Bitcoin wallet. </p><p>Bitcoin wallets are designed to store the private keys to your cryptocurrency, enabling you to move your funds without having to rely on a third-party. Here&#39;s what you need to know about what a Bitcoin wallet is and how it works. </p><h2><strong>What is a Bitcoin wallet?</strong></h2><p>A Bitcoin wallet is a software program that allows you to transfer and store bitcoin. Bitcoin isn&#39;t technically &#34;stored&#34; anywhere so the wallet actually stores a private security key that corresponds to the Bitcoin address of your wallet. The key is actually what gives you ownership and control of bitcoin stored in it, making it an invaluable tool as an investor.</p><p>A Bitcoin wallet is &#34;a way for you to store your digital keys, or access, to certain locations on the blockchain,&#34; says <a href=\"https://www.lexsokolin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lex Sokolin</a>, global fintech co-head at blockchain firm ConsenSys.</p><p>Similar to other cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is stored in addresses on its blockchain, which is essentially a ledger or database that can&#39;t be modified or erased. Each address has two keys (i.e., alphanumeric codes) associated with it, a public key and a private key. The public key is what other people can use to send bitcoin to it, and the private key is what you&#39;d use to send bitcoin from it.</p><p>This is precisely why some investors prefer storing their bitcoin on a wallet instead of a third-party platform.  A wallet holds the private key, which is necessary to validate that the true owner of a Bitcoin address is really requesting that bitcoin be sent from that address. </p><aside class=\"quick-tip headline-regular\"><p><strong>In the news: </strong>There is <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-btc-inaccessible-cryptocurrency-digital-currency-wallet-security-blockchain-2021-1-1029961482\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$140 billion of inaccessible bitcoin</a> in the world  as a result to lost or locked-off crypto wallets. If you decide to buy a bitcoin wallet, it&#39;s extremely important to keep it and your password safe.</p></aside><h2><strong>Types of bitcoin wallets</strong></h2><p>All bitcoin and cryptocurrency wallets revolve around the storage of a private key. When it comes to wallets, you basically have two options: hardware or software.</p><h3>Hardware wallets</h3><p>Hardware wallets are generally small, handheld devices that store your bitcoin offline and can be plugged into your computer in order to verify transactions. &#34;A hardware wallet stores private keys through a device that is not your computer, while a software wallet runs on your computer or phone,&#34; says Sokolin.</p><p>Hardware wallets remain offline at all times (and are often referred to as &#34;cold&#34; wallets for this reason), theoretically making them safer when compared to their digital counterparts.</p><p>While the cost of hardware wallets vary from one manufacturer and model to another, wallets can generally range from $60 to $180. Wallets at the lower end of this spectrum will be just as secure as those at the more expensive end, although they may lack certain extra features, such as Bluetooth connectability and support for a wider range of cryptocurrencies.</p><h3>Software wallets</h3><p>Software wallets, also known as &#34;hot&#34; wallets, can be accessed either via a desktop browser or smartphone app. Whereas hardware wallets are used for long-term storage of large amounts, software wallets are better for storing smaller amounts and making daily spending and receiving payments convenient and fast.</p><p>&#34;A software wallet is an app on your phone or computer containing your private keys. Because it&#39;s usually connected to the internet, it&#39;s theoretically hackable, though the most reputable software wallets are considered extremely difficult to hack,&#34; says <a href=\"https://www.glengoodman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glen Goodman</a>, a cryptocurrency analyst and author of <em>The Crypto Trader.</em></p><p>Software wallets can come in three varieties:</p><ul><li><strong>Desktop wallets: </strong>These wallets are installed directly onto a computer, where the private keys are stored on its hard drive. Funds can be accessed only from that computer, allowing you to have full control over your wallet. </li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Mobile wallets: </strong>These wallets function the same way as desktop wallets, but designed for the mobile experience. Mobile wallets are convenient and can be used on the go, but can carry a greater risk of malware.</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Web wallets: </strong>These are wallets that can be accessed through a web browser, oftentimes hosted by a provider who manages the security of your private keys. </li></ul><p>In theory, software wallets are more user-friendly than hardware alternatives, if only because they don&#39;t require you to keep track of the whereabouts of a physical device. Some software wallets also offer built-in trading features, so you can quickly sell your crypto through their app or desktop site.</p><p>Another advantage of the software wallet is that it can be cheaper than a hardware equivalent. Many of the most popular software wallets charge only transaction fees, which are set by the network of the cryptocurrency you&#39;re using. That said, with average bitcoin fees hitting as high as $30 during peak periods, multiple transactions can certainly take a bite out of your wallet.</p><aside class=\"quick-tip headline-regular\"><p><strong>Important:</strong> Paper wallets are an outdated and highly risky way to store your own bitcoin. As the name suggests, they&#39;re pieces of paper on which you write the private and public key to your Bitcoin address, which can be auto-generated using a dedicated website. </p></aside><h2><strong>Why are Bitcoin wallets so important?</strong></h2><p>The main advantage of a Bitcoin wallet is that it protects investors from potential cryptocurrency exchange hacks. While the major exchanges are improving their cybersecurity constantly, breaches <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.in/business/news/russian-cryptocurrency-exchange-livecoin-hacked-and-lost-control/articleshow/79962952.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">still occur from time to time</a>, with Binance - the world&#39;s biggest exchange - being <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/btc-binance-suffers-40-million-hack-2019-5-1028182318\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hacked as recently as May 2019</a>.</p><p>&#34;If someone has a very large amount of cryptocurrency, an offline hardware wallet is a must. For people who only have small amounts of crypto, a decent software wallet can provide a reasonable level of security for most purposes&#34; says Goodman.</p><p>Having your own wallet means you&#39;re protected from potential hacks, and yet it also protects users from situations where an exchange freezes a customer&#39;s funds or account. For example, popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase <a href=\"https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/other/does-coinbase-freeze-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acknowledges</a> that in &#34;extremely rare circumstances,&#34; it will prevent access to customer funds when required to comply with an order from a court or other authority.</p><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><h2><strong>Best bitcoin wallets</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606f846f30004b0019b26c77?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ledger wallet\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Ledger Nano S, a popular hardware wallet option.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/ledger-hardware-wallet-for-cryptocurrency-with-royalty-free-image/951988442\" target=\"_blank\">AndreaAstes/Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>When it comes to hardware wallets, the two major brands are <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ledger</a> and <a href=\"https://trezor.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trezor</a>.

The most secure wallets are hardware-based, since they involve the use of devices that never go online. That said, software wallets may afford a greater level of convenience and ease.</p><p>However, while cryptocurrency wallets help you gain control of your funds, they require you to step up your security game. You generally need to store hardware wallets - and their seed phrases - in secure places, otherwise you may have to kiss goodbye your bitcoin in the event of loss or theft.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module-end-of-article\" class=\"mceNonEditable\"><a data-type=\"5fd2657a83bd0b4a7c28e05f\" data-title=\"What is Bitcoin?

on how NFTs will be displayed in the future on his podcast Next with Novo following a conversation he had with Urs Fischer, a Swiss visual artist in a previous episode. Fischer released his first NFT artwork, a combination of an egg with a BIC lighter, earlier this week. It will be on sale from Sunday.  </p><p> &#34;I thought, what about that egg floating over my shoulder as I&#39;m walking down the street&#34;, Novogratz said on his podcast. &#34;It&#39;s the only one of its kind and just like people wear jewellery, maybe I&#39;ll wear that egg&#34;, he continued. </p><p>Passersby would be able to see it through their augmented reality glasses. Wearing NFTs as jewellery would allow people to show off their unique digital assets in the form of earrings or rings for example, said Novogratz.</p><p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital artworks that include images, videos or audio that are unique and registered on a blockchain. NFTs have surged in popularity recently, as more artists flock to the digital space and auction houses sell pieces for sky-high prices. </p><p>Auction house Christie&#39;s announced on Thursday that it would be <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/christies-auction-cryptopunk-nfts-larva-labs-ethereum-ether-cryptoart-2021-4-1030288724\">presenting a set of nine so-called CryptoPunks</a>, some of the first crypto artwork at an auction next month and were expecting the digital asset to sell for $7 million-$9 million. The auction house was also behind the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/art-auction-nft-beeple-top-selling-most-expensive-sale-millions-2021-3?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\">sale of an NFT by Beeple</a>, which was purchased for a record-breaking $69 million. </p><p>Talks of the NFTs being in a bubble have surfaced recently. Bobby Lee, crypto exchange founder, told Insider that <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nft-market-outlook-huge-risk-beeple-buyer-bubble-vignesh-sundaresan-2021-4-1030282090\">bubbles may be developing in some areas</a> of the market. </p><p>Novogratz, who is bullish on crypto assets generally, said he believes that NFTs will be displayed in virtual and physical reality, for example &#34;in your little digital man cave&#34; but also on screens in physical spaces.</p><p>&#34;None of us really know how far this NFT thing can go&#34;, the billionaire investor said. But he believes that the way reality is experienced will change in the coming years, as different screens and versions of reality come together and interact with each other. </p><p>&#34;NFTs are going to be much bigger than everyone thinks they&#39;re gonna be&#34;, he ended.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/mike-novogratz-nfts-worn-like-jewellery-virtual-reality-crypto-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/X2xQ-dJxvds\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:48:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f92fde4212113001874073c?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"71b49136c4a5ee2f794fb0258fa10e9d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn63@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-17-820_772aad579b92989d.webp","destWidth":4731,"destHeight":3548,"sourceBytes":356048,"destBytes":356048,"author":"skiderlin@businessinsider.com (Sophie Kiderlin)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f92fdd5abcd0c0018d695d1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn63@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-19-548_b473a7b57008af81.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-967_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn19@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-19-269_4e4e3958ee7967eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn91@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-20-560_0a6aa72f4d0dae4c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-669_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=X2xQ-dJxvds:CaDebWPQt04:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn87@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-19-683_43020e0bbef6a18c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/X2xQ-dJxvds":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn31@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-23-160_58032f0526efac37.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986505557},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","title":"How to watch 'Made for Love,' the new HBO Max sci-fi series","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-watch-made-for-love","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>If you buy through our links, we may earn money from affiliate partners. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6064c30f6183e10019819926?format=jpeg\" alt=\"MadeForLoveHBOMax\" height=\"1056\" width=\"1408\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Photography by John P.

Cuomo has denied that allegation, and his office disputed her claim that she was alone with the governor, a state trooper, and a press staffer.</p><p>Boylan, who is currently running for Manhattan borough president, did not return Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>The governor also uses a private plane for non-governmental travel that&#39;s paid for by in-kind donations, a former aide familiar with his travel patterns and logistics told Insider.</p><p>Insider used a list of state police planes and helicopters from the New York State Trooper&#39;s website and tail wing numbers registered as New York State Police aircraft to identify the passenger aircraft model used by Cuomo.</p><p>By reviewing five years of the governor&#39;s monthly public schedules, Insider identified that Cuomo flew in this state plane over 460 times accruing some 400 hours of total flight time over 5 years.</p><p>The Cuomo administration has not yet responded to Insider in its Freedom of Information Law request for financial records detailing his air travel expenses. A Cuomo spokesperson referred Insider&#39;s list of questions to New York State Police.</p><p>Nel Stubbs, Vice President at Conklin &#38; de Decker, an aircraft market intelligence and consulting company, estimates that this plane model costs $1,616 per hour to operate, according to her company&#39;s database. This figure is calculated using estimated fuel cost, plane maintenance, landing fees, and crew incidental expenses not including salary.</p><p>Flight crew salary, insurance, or the cost to maintain the plane in its Albany hangar, however, are not included.</p><h3>&#39;It is crazy old. Terrifying to fly on it.&#39;</h3><p>The twin propeller plane used by Cuomo has had <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-a-few-hairy-incidents-gov-cuomo-wants-new-aircraft-1484265403\">several safety scares</a>, with the governor&#39;s office pushing in recent years for an updated fleet of aircrafts they share with New York State Police.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s crazy old,&#34; the former aide told Insider, recalling dicey flights that left newcomers on King One thoroughly spooked. &#34;Terrifying to fly on it.&#34;</p><p>One of the helicopters had to make an <a href=\"https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2017/01/11/cuomos-helicopter-makes-emergency-landing/96462302/\">emergency landing in 2017</a> after the cockpit began filling with smoke, according to local news reports at the time.</p><p>As a general practice, Cuomo uses the chopper for trips downstate to New York City, Long Island, or the Hudson Valley, according to the former staffer. If an event is outside of those regions or within driving distance in the Capital Region surrounding Albany, the governor takes King One.</p><p>However, the flight records obtained by Insider show some flights as short as 15 minutes without a return trip. King One&#39;s return to the hangar from those trips were not factored into Insider&#39;s cost estimate analysis.</p><p>The time saving of air travel in a state as big as New York is significant, particularly when it comes to the far flung cities and towns across the Upstate region.</p><p>Cuomo&#39;s flights from Albany to New York City were usually around 40 to 45 minutes, while driving a motorcade into the city would take between two and a half to three hours. For a trip west to Buffalo, flying takes a little over an hour, while the one way trip by car would take at least four hours.</p><p>The governor&#39;s travel sometimes came in bursts, such as on April 21, 2020, when he flew from Albany to Buffalo, then from Buffalo to Washington D.C., and then back from the nation&#39;s capital to Albany.</p><p>If the main chopper known as Sikorsky is undergoing maintenance or repairs, an older helicopter called Bell 430 is used instead, the former aide said.</p><p>&#34;I swore never to fly on that helicopter again,&#34; Melissa DeRosa, Cuomo&#39;s top aide who has been <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cuomo-advisers-altered-report-on-covid-19-nursing-home-deaths-11614910855\">implicated in allegedly manipulating data on COVID-19 nursing home deaths</a>, told the Wall Street Journal in 2017 when she was serving as his chief of staff. </p><p>&#34;Unfortunately, given the demanding schedule we keep, it&#39;s not really an option.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-cuomo-air-travel-taxpayer-expense-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/dd5jrjcHVGA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:56:51 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606f489830004b0019b26b5f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"bfda72e7815cefc7e6c663c9778f0edd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn96@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-091_7be5c91847bc7afa.webp","destWidth":1107,"destHeight":830,"sourceBytes":42092,"destBytes":42092,"author":"insider@insider.com (Jake Lahut,Hannah Beckler)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606f48be4d3e410018b70107?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn4@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-737_6b4e07a20905e5ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-967_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-23-318_2f9370a370dc0840.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn84@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-20-889_a43d46db5cebffc9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-669_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=dd5jrjcHVGA:XGao3jdoorY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn43@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-18-783_76b4648d62e79a55.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/dd5jrjcHVGA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn60@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-19-038_aa5d3a7b87f54eed.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986505571},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","title":"Tesla just hiked the prices of its most popular cars - here's how much each model will set you back","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-cost-breakdown-buying-guide-2021-3","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60705a0630004b0019b26d80?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Lineup \" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla&#39;s cars range in price from around $40,000 to $150,000\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Tesla sells four models - the Model S, 3, X, and Y - in several different trim levels.  </li>\n<li>Options for them include different interior colors, extra seats, and performance packages. </li>\n<li>Teslas range in price from roughly $40,000 to $150,000.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Tesla is known to quietly raise and lower prices seemingly at random.</p><p>In October, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-model-s-price-cut-lucid-unveils-air-2020-10\">dropped the price of the Model S sedan to $69,420</a> after rival Lucid announced its sedan would start at $69,900.

The luxury four-door got an overhaul at the top of 2021, which included an updated exterior and a controversial new steering yoke. It&#39;s the choice for EV buyers who have a little more to spend and don&#39;t want a crossover. </p><p>Here&#39;s how each Model S breaks down:</p><ul><li><strong>Long Range</strong>: For $79,990, the base Model S delivers an estimated range of 375 miles, a top speed of 155 mph, and a 0-60-mph time of 3.1 seconds. </li><li><strong>Plaid</strong>: The $119,990 Model S Plaid, whose name is a reference to the movie &#34;Space Balls,&#34; travels 350 miles on a charge, hits a top speed of 200 mph, and sprints to 60 mph in 1.99 seconds, Tesla says. Both Plaid models have three motors good for more than 1,000 horsepower. </li><li><strong>Plaid Plus</strong>: The $149,990 Plaid Plus is the most advanced Model S yet. Tesla says it will do 0-60 mph in under two seconds, has a top speed of 200 mph, and has a range of more than 520 miles. Deliveries are set to start in 2022. </li></ul><p>A paint color other than white will run you $1,500 to $2,500, 21-inch wheels cost $4,500, and a white or off-white interior costs $2,500. </p><h2>Model 3</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f89fded9e9fe40019009e2c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Model 3 update\" height=\"653\" width=\"1142\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla Model 3.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>With the debut of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-i-decided-against-buying-a-tesla-model-3-2019-8\">Model 3</a> in 2017, Tesla made good on its promise to build a more affordable vehicle than the Model S or Model X that came before it. And since it launched, the Model 3 has proved wildly successful, becoming both Tesla&#39;s most popular model and the overall best-selling EV in the world in 2020. </p><p>The Model 3 comes in three flavors:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard Range Plus</strong>: The $38,490 base Model 3 gets an estimated range of 263 miles, a top speed of 140 mph, and a 0-60 time of 5.3 seconds. </li><li><strong>Long Range</strong>: The $47,490 Long Range model has an EPA-estimated range of 353 miles</li><li><strong>Performance</strong>: For $56,990, the sporty Model 3 Performance delivers a 315-mile range, a top speed of 162 mph, and a 0-60-mph time of 3.1 seconds.

It&#39;s based on the same platform as the Model 3, but has more cargo capacity, rides higher, and has a general shape more like the Model X. It&#39;s proving to be a hot seller just like its sedan sibling. </p><p>The Model Y comes in two versions:</p><ul><li><strong>Long Range: </strong>The $50,490 base vehicle has an EPA-estimated range of 326 miles, a top speed of 135 mph, and makes the sprint to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds. </li><li><strong>Performance: </strong>The sportier option costs $60,990, and although it gets a lower range of 303 miles, it makes up for it in performance upgrades. The crossover accelerates to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds, has a higher top speed, and comes with bigger wheels, better brakes, and a lowered suspension. </li></ul><p>There&#39;s also a more affordable Standard Range model that Tesla <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-launches-new-model-y-standard-range-7-seat-option-2021-1\">briefly sold</a> starting in January.

Those planes could also carry &#34;attritable&#34; systems - <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/future-war-losses-like-wwii-top-air-force-officer-says-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reusable but also expendable</a> - for the same purpose.</p><p>Central to all of that is &#34;battlespace awareness,&#34; of which most of the mobility fleet has &#34;zero&#34; right now, Van Ovost said, adding that putting aircraft on the same network would give them a common picture of incoming threats.</p><p>&#34;So now I may not need fighters immediately by our aircraft. Perhaps they can intercept it forward of the aircraft or ... we can have defensive counter-air attritables that are either on the wings that could launch out and do a headshot or simply electronic warfare in those pods so ... we can deflect the missile.&#34;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fecdc55a644880018193e6f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Air Force B-52 KC-135 refueling\" height=\"1336\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A US Air Force KC-135 refuels a B-52 over the Middle East, December 30, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Senior Airman Roslyn Ward</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Van Ovost cited the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&#39;s &#34;<a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/gremlins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gremlins</a>&#34; as an example of an &#34;attritable&#34; that could be launched from a C-17 or C-5 against aerial threats and then be recaptured and rearmed.</p><p>Other traditional defenses are also an option. &#34;We have hardpoints on the C-17. We have hardpoints on the KC-46 - not a hard stretch to think that we could put one or two missiles on there for self-defense,&#34; Van Ovost said.</p><p>Talk of new roles for the airlift fleet has prompted questions about whether there are enough of those planes to do those tasks and conduct standard mobility operations, but &#34;the next fight&#34; likely won&#39;t have &#34;an iron build up&#34; at a major bases or drawn-out attrition warfare, Van Ovost said.</p><p>&#34;The next fight is going to be just-in-time, and I think the intensity is going to be much shorter,&#34; Van Ovost added. &#34;So we really have to think about how we&#39;re going to use the airplanes in the future and what warfare is going to look like.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/air-force-cargo-tanker-planes-do-more-in-next-war-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Uvb_sr7U_EA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:08:02 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5bdc8f1bbde70f4be358b09d?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"c9693b28360ccdcdf2a6c20a11dadc02","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn88@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-721_2f000bf35813420e.webp","destWidth":970,"destHeight":727,"sourceBytes":37784,"destBytes":37784,"author":"insider@insider.com (Christopher Woody)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60705c1f4d3e410018b7035f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn7@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-20-303_58049bb43d225cf1.webp","https://i.insider.com/5e9a0fed92e8ba0c2423c0b6?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn84@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-19-204_4e6fd71a3a9797d9.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f9e096569331a0011bc6943?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn47@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-23-115_61021e9b75380cdf.webp","https://i.insider.com/57b4b803db5ce954008b74cc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn67@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-21-958_43d6cdfeaa6e43ae.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fecdc55a644880018193e6f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn16@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-18-336_5b271e6c7b91040c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-21-967_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn40@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-22-622_32291374ecd5b5ad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn55@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-22-009_7c586171e0fe86a8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-19-669_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Uvb_sr7U_EA:_wlhZT0u8xQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn100@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-18-623_631f130af0e30afb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Uvb_sr7U_EA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn96@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-19-751_34d71231f8bc8a6d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986505548},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:45","title":"European regulators are watching J&J's vaccine for unusual blood clots","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ema-investigates-reports-of-clots-and-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60705f9830004b0019b26d9d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Vaccine\" height=\"2827\" width=\"3770\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Registered Nurse Robert Orallo administers the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at the Blood Bank of Alaska in Anchorage on March 19, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">FREDERIC J.

Management, took around $200 million in 2013 and turned it into a $20 billion net worth by betting successfully on technology stocks, <a

yet.</p><p>But it all came crashing down at the end of March when some of Hwang&#39;s highly leveraged bets started to go wrong and his banks sold huge chunks of his investments. The sales knocked <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-wall-street-speculating-hedge-fund-liquidation-archegos-2021-3\">around $35 billion</a> off the value of various US media and Chinese tech firms in a day.</p><p>Bloomberg reported that Hwang&#39;s early investments through his Archegos Capital Management <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/archegos-liquidation-spotlight-unregulated-family-offices-leverage-swaps-2021-4\">family office</a> included <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amzn-stock\">Amazon</a>, travel-booking company <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/expe-stock\">Expedia</a>, LinkedIn and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/nflx-stock\">Netflix</a>, the latter of which reaped a $1 billion payday.

The surge in home sales has left mere months of supply left, and contractors are struggling to keep up. Prices leaped at <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/home-prices-climb-february-housing-market-supply-mortgage-rates-corelogic-2021-4\">the fastest rate since 2006 in February</a>, and while the pace of sales has slowed, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/existing-home-sales-february-supply-shortage-rising-prices-housing-market-2021-3\">it remains at historically elevated levels</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the median house price has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/existing-home-sales-february-supply-shortage-rising-prices-housing-market-2021-3\">kept setting new records</a>, putting affordability more and more out of reach. For much of the boom, mortgage rates were falling to new lows south of 3%, but that trend has reversed in 2021, presenting another affordability challenge for prospective buyers. Jefferies expects those dynamics to rein in the rally and set the stage for sustainable and inclusive market growth.</p><p>&#34;The pandemic has been the catalyst for many buyers that were on the sidelines, pushing homeowners and renters to reevaluate their living quarters and driving the surge in demand,&#34; the team led by Philip Ng said, adding that new volatility stands to derail the market&#39;s momentum.</p><p>Here are the four trends contributing to a shakeup in the housing market&#39;s growth, according to Jefferies.</p><h2>(1) Construction will catch up</h2><p>Perhaps the biggest constraint on the housing market is its meager supply, but the supply-demand gap should spur a correction. The construction industry underbuilt for more than a decade after the housing market sparked the global financial crisis. The weak building activity led to a shortage of 2.5 million homes, but activity seen over the last year stands to change that, the team said.</p><p>&#34;The pandemic has been a catalyst for many buyers that were on the sidelines, pushing homeowners and renters to reevaluate their living quarters and driving the surge in demand,&#34; the analysts said.</p><p>The shortage now serves as &#34;an opportunity for homebuilders to pick up incremental demand,&#34; they added. Jefferies estimates another 1.8 million homes would need to be built to balance out the market.</p><h2>(2) Millennials reaching peak buying age</h2><p>Contractors will also ramp up building to match nascent demand from millennials, the firm said. Homeownership rates begin to rise with 25- to 29-year-olds and accelerate further for 30- to 34-year-olds as people get married and start families.</p><p>The population of 25- to 34-year-olds is currently 9% larger than the 35- to 44-year-old group, signaling to homebuilders that a wave of demand is on the horizon. The bank&#39;s modeling suggests monthly housing starts will land between 1.7 million and 2 million through 2024, markedly higher than the February reading of 1.4 million.</p><h2>(3) Home inflation set to cool</h2><p>Expectations for stronger inflation contributed to soaring lumber prices over the past year. Costlier building materials were estimated to be <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-homebuying-soaring-lumber-prices-new-homes-construction-2021-3\">adding $24,000 to the cost of every new home</a>, further boosting prices amid the supply shortage.</p><p>That pressure will soon be alleviated as the economy reopens and commodity-price inflation moderates, the team said. Futures contracts suggest lumber prices will sink 26% through 2022, just as construction picks up to match robust demand, they added.</p><h2>(4) Interest rates have room to run</h2><p>Mortgage rates have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mortgage-rates-climb-inflation-fears-housing-market-economy-freddie-mac-2021-3\">only recently started swinging higher</a> after tumbling to record lows through 2020. The reversal stands to cool the market&#39;s buying spree as borrowing costs rise, but it won&#39;t halt purchases in their tracks, according to Jefferies.</p><p>For one, mortgage rates still sit at relatively low levels. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at 3.13% this week. Rates haven&#39;t had a cooling effect on housing-market growth since 2018 when they reached 5%.

A new era of remote work has taken its place, bringing far more flexibility than the traditional 9-to-5 ever gave us. </p><p>While juggling childcare and crafting an office out of your bedroom closet probably wasn&#39;t your idea of work-life balance, there are two sides to every coin, and the pandemic has forced some positive changes in the way we work, too.</p><p>Flexibility has become a necessity rather than a luxury. After permitting work schedule flexibility <a href=\"https://www.basicops.com\">BasicOps</a>, I&#39;ve seen positive shifts in our employees&#39; overall mindsets and productivity.</p><p>Here are the top five benefits of this flexibility that I&#39;ve witnessed reshaping our workplace.</p><h2>1. Flexibility leads to higher productivity</h2><p>There&#39;s a myth perpetuated by traditional office culture that our most productive hours happen between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. This schedule may work for a portion of the population, but there&#39;s growing evidence that at least half of us operate on an altogether different productivity timeframe - and much that is calculated by our circadian rhythms.</p><p>In &#34;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/21/why-we-sleep-by-matthew-walker-review\">Why We Sleep</a>,&#34; sleep researcher Matthew Walker describes how up to 50% of us aren&#39;t programmed to wake up early. Our genetics determine our circadian rhythms: While you might have no trouble turning in at 10 p.m. and rising at 7 a.m., these hours may force your colleague to wake up far earlier than their natural sleeping patterns. </p><p>Losing early morning sleep has been linked to poor memory recall, trouble concentrating, poor communication, and lost productivity. Beyond the cognitive difficulties, it&#39;s also costly for companies: In a study across four large US companies, researchers found insufficient sleep costs employers almost $2,000 per employee per year. </p><p>Companies including <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/nap-job-10-companies-100300632.html\">Nike and Google</a> allow employees to time their work hours to match their circadian rhythms. Employees at these companies are even encouraged to take cat naps during their workdays, with &#34;nap pods&#34; scattered throughout corporate headquarters. Other than scheduled meeting times, my employees can plan their days as they please. If they&#39;re tired after lunch and need a nap, I&#39;m totally fine with that. </p><h2>2. Remote workers take fewer sick days</h2><p>The standard workday leaves very little room for the unexpected. The 9 a.m. punch-in doesn&#39;t account for a feverish child at home or a rough night of sleep, meaning it&#39;s likely your employees will opt to call in sick. </p><p>With flexible scheduling, your employees will feel comfortable starting later to get a few extra hours of sleep or tend to a sick child at home. Rather than losing an entire day, employees can start when it suits them.</p><p>Rigid working hours lead to higher stress levels, and higher stress weakens our immune systems. One powerful way to help keep your employees healthy is by providing flexibility - that alone will decrease stress and anxiety in their daily lives. They&#39;ll take fewer sick days, and you&#39;ll likely see more motivated workers, too.</p><h2>3. Flexible schedules lead to happier employees </h2><p>If you&#39;re skeptical that a flexible schedule can improve happiness levels, look no further than Finland, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/finland-coronavirus-united-nations-worlds-happiest-country-pandemic-2020\">the happiest country in the world</a>. </p><p>Finnish workplace culture is a far cry from the American standard: For nearly 25 years, the Finns have been able to set their work hours - by law. <a href=\"https://finrepo.fi/en/news-new-working-hours-act\">The Working Hours Act</a>, put into law in 1996, allows most workers in Finland to adjust their hours as needed. With that much flexibility and control over their lives, it&#39;s not surprising that the Finns are happier than, well, everyone.</p><p>By offering a working agreement that mimics the Finns, you&#39;re allowing your employees to incorporate personal errands such as picking up the kids, attending courses, or exercise, all of which will make it far easier for your employee to juggle life and work. They&#39;ll be less stressed, more productive, and feel more balanced.</p><p>At BasicOps, all employees have the opportunity to take weekdays off and make up the time over the weekend if that works better for them. One of our employees takes hikes every Wednesday, which I think is great.</p><h2>4. Communicate more effectively with flexible work</h2><p>This may come as a surprise, but communication is far more efficient when an employee works from home or works on a flexible schedule. Between excessive coffee breaks and idle chit-chat, there&#39;s a surprising amount of time wastage in the office place.</p><p>With the pandemic has come a heavy adoption of workflow management software programs. While these programs existed pre-pandemic, the work-from-home mandates made them all the more necessary to keep projects and collaboration flowing. </p><p>Flexible and remote workers are far more likely to use these platforms to connect with colleagues than those who are in the office on a rigid schedule. By adopting such platforms, communication among teams becomes far more streamlined and efficient, saving everyone time and energy. </p><h2>5. A flexible work culture improves employee retention </h2><p>Work-life balance is the Holy Grail of today&#39;s professionals. Millennials (who now make up the largest generation in the US workforce) and Gen Z both place a high value on achieving that balance, so finding and retaining new talent will be likely more successful with flex work.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, a flexible working agreement indicates trust and transparency between employee and employer.

However, the future of work is still looking pretty bright for medical and tech jobs, based on data and projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p>As Americans look forward to finding their next potential job, Insider decided to look at high-paying jobs that have bright futures ahead of them. To do this, we used two datasets available on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website.</p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics' <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/emp/home.htm\">Employment Projections program</a> publishes estimates for job growth across hundreds of occupations. The <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/emp-by-detailed-occupation.htm\">most recent release</a> compares how many people worked in each occupation in 2019 with the Bureau's projections for 2029. BLS notes that these estimates do not include the impact that the coronavirus pandemic has had on employment.</p><p>However, BLS published two <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/emp/publications/pandemic-scenarios.htm\">alternate projections</a> that include the pandemic's impact to see how long-term economic impacts <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/employment-projections-pandemic-bureau-of-labor-statistics-report-2021-2\">may affect employment growth in the various occupations.</a> With any projections, the estimates may not be exactly what pans out over the next decade but can give a sense of where there may be some job growth.</p><p>We combined those job growth projections with the latest May 2020 median annual wages for each occupation from the Bureau's <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm\">Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics</a> program (previously called the Occupational Employment Statistics program) using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean\">geometric mean</a> of the two numbers to find roles that are both growing and high-paying.</p><p>Since we are focused on high-paying jobs, we restricted our ranking to occupations with 2020 median wages above the median among all occupations of $41,950.</p>\n</div><div

US.</p><p>The vote count finished early Friday afternoon. The final tally was 1,798 votes against unionizing and 738 votes for the union, with 505 ballots challenged and 76 ballots being voided. 70.9% of valid votes counted were against the union.</p><p>With a majority of votes against the union, Amazon has successfully defeated the unionization attempt.</p><p>Since Amazon&#39;s margin of victory was higher than the total number of challenged ballots, the challenged ballots won&#39;t be opened and the votes inside them won&#39;t be counted.</p><p>In a statement on the victory, Amazon said it was glad workers&#39; &#34;collective voices were finally heard.&#34; </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that&#39;s not true,&#34; the company said. &#34;Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us. And Amazon didn&#39;t win - our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union.&#34;</p><p>The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) announced it is filing official objections with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleging that Amazon illegally interfered with the vote.</p><p>&#34;Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees. We won&#39;t let Amazon&#39;s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote,&#34; RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement.</p><p>Unfair labor practice charges are common in contentious union elections, John Logan, a labor and employment professor at San Francisco State University who specializes in tactics companies use to defeat union drives, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-pushed-usps-to-install-mailboxes-outside-warehouse-report-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-pushed-usps-to-install-mailboxes-outside-warehouse-report-2021-4\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">previously told Insider</a>. He said it&#39;s &#34;fairly difficult&#34; to predict how the NLRB will ultimately rule on those charges.</p><p>Before Thursday&#39;s public vote count, both Amazon and the RWDSU also had the the opportunity to challenge employees&#39; eligibility to cast a ballot. Hundreds of ballots were challenged, mostly by Amazon, according to the RWDSU.</p><h2>A union vote that drew national attention</h2><p>The 5,800 warehouse workers had from February 8 until March 29 to cast their mail-in ballots. Amazon <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-union-alabama-workers-describe-anti-union-tactics-bessemer-2021-3\">led an aggressive anti-union campaign</a> and has fought workers&#39; efforts to organize across the country.</p><p>In Bessemer, the company papered bathroom stalls, distributed anti-union merchandise, and ran targeted advertisements encouraging workers to vote no, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-union-alabama-workers-describe-anti-union-tactics-bessemer-2021-3\">Insider previously reported</a>.</p><p>One of the RWDSU&#39;s objections centers around a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-pushed-usps-to-install-mailboxes-outside-warehouse-report-2021-4\">US Postal Service mailbox</a> that was installed outside the warehouse, in which Amazon encouraged workers to cast their ballots. According to a Freedom of Information request obtained by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/08/amazon-bessemer-mailbox-union/\">The Washington Post</a> on Thursday, Amazon pushed for the USPS to install the mailbox there. This came after the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-union-vote-nlrb-mail-ballots-election-bessemer-alabama-2021-2\">NLRB rejected a bid from the company</a> to make in-person voting obligatory in February.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6059c6510d155e0019ef620a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mailbox Amazon Bessemer\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The mailbox outside the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer.\n<p class=\"copyright\">RWDSU</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>&#34;Even though the NLRB definitively denied Amazon&#39;s request for a drop box on the warehouse property, Amazon felt it was above the law and worked with the postal service anyway to install one. They did this because it provided a clear ability to intimidate workers,&#34; Appelbaum said in his statement.</p><p>&#34;We said from the beginning that we wanted all employees to vote and proposed many different options to try and make it easy,&#34; an Amazon spokesperson told Insider. &#34;The RWDSU fought those at every turn and pushed for a mail-only election, which the NLRB&#39;s own data showed would reduce turnout. This mailbox - which only the USPS had access to - was a simple, secure, and completely optional way to make it easy for employees to vote, no more and no less.&#34;</p><p>Amazon has been vocally anti-union, in some cases sending <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-union-alabama-workers-describe-anti-union-tactics-bessemer-2021-3\">multiple text messages a day to workers and handing out &#34;vote no&#34; pins.</a> The company has also repeatedly stated that its starting wage and benefits are comparable to what a union would offer.</p><p>The union effort received bipartisan support from politicians over the course of the vote. Sen. Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-visiting-amazon-workers-unionizing-alabama-2021-3\">visited Bessemer</a> along with union organizers to shore up support. Sen. Marco Rubio <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rubio-brings-bipartisan-support-to-amazon-union-push-2021-3\">spoke out</a> in support of the union effort. And President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-defends-workers-rights-warns-of-threats-as-amazon-employees-vote-on-union-2021-3\">spoke broadly</a> about the benefits of unionization, but did not explicitly reference this union effort.</p><p>The union vote was marked by appeals from Amazon to change the NLRB&#39;s practices. In February, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-union-vote-nlrb-mail-ballots-election-bessemer-alabama-2021-2\">Insider reported</a> that the NLRB had denied Amazon&#39;s request to conduct an in-person union election, saying that the company must allow mail-in voting.

These Islamists began providing financial assistance to local communities and told residents their lives would be better under stringent Islamic law, known as Sharia.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/607078c64943790018bb1a17?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Cabo Delgado Mozambique displaced persons\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>People who fled attacks by insurgents in the northern part of Cabo Delgado at a meeting in Matuge in northern Mozambique, February 24, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">ALFREDO ZUNIGA/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>To receive support from ISIS - mostly in the form of weapons - all the locals, and later the members of Ansar al-Sunna, had to do was recognize ISIS, promoting the group&#39;s propaganda and efforts to expand.</p><p>For its efforts, ISIS can extend its reach to a new region - where ungoverned spaces further facilitate that expansion - and access valuable resources, profits from which can be <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/10/the-power-of-affiliates-which-islamic-state-franchise.html\">redistributed to other needy franchises</a>.</p><p>That violence and the stakes involved are why US Special Operations Command has tripled its forces in the province.</p><p>The response likely reflects a mix of political and commercial interests.

and images in a laptop containing lurid details of Hunter Biden&#39;s private life.</p><p>DailyMail.com, the US-focused website run by the British tabloid, published a long article detailing the laptop&#39;s contents on Thursday.</p><p>The laptop was the subject of intense controversy in the runup to the November presidential election, when <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-post-hunter-joe-biden-giuliani-red-flags-disinformation-2020-10\">The New York Post claimed</a> that the laptop contained emails harmful to Joe Biden.</p><p>The Post claimed Biden - then the Democratic nominee for president - was compromised by his son&#39;s business dealings in Ukraine, where he worked on the board of energy firm Burisma. </p><p>Other emails, said critics, contained evidence of influence-peddling by Hunter Biden in China. Neither claim was ever substantiated.</p><p>The story of how the Post and later the Mail obtained the machine is convoluted, with it having initially reportedly been abandoned in a Delaware computer shop then handed to allies of Donald Trump. </p><p>Amid doubts over the authenticity of the information, and briefings from US intelligence agencies that it was likely <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-laptop-real-fake-russian-intelligence-2020-10\">part of a Russian disinformation campaign,</a> Facebook and Twitter introduced measures to stop it being shared. </p><p>But according to the Mail, the laptop is indeed Hunter Biden&#39;s, and contains 103,000 text messages, 154,000 emails, and more than 2,000 photos.</p><p>The Mail said the contents were verified by cyber forensics experts at Maryman &#38; Associates, a California-based company which <a href=\"http://www.maryman.com/our-firm/\">says on its website</a> has 20 years of experience.</p><p>The company claims to have matched contents of the laptop with email addresses, contents from an iPad, and an iPhone serial number connected to Biden.</p><p>Insider attempted to reach Hunter Biden for comment with emails to his attorney and book publishers, but did not immediately receive a response.</p><p>The publication of new material from the laptop comes days after the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hunter-bidens-memoir-beautiful-things-out-in-april-2021-2\">publication of Hunter Biden&#39;s memoir,</a> &#34;Beautiful Things,&#34; where he describes his struggles with drug addiction. </p><p>The Mail claims the material from the laptop shows that Hunter Biden &#34;chose not to divulge&#34; parts of his life in the book.  </p><p>It published pictures of Hunter Biden which it said showed him with prostitutes, and showed evidence of drug use.</p><p>There is no politically substantive new information in the report. It claims to contain text messages between Biden and his father, most of which show the elder Biden offering Hunter support.</p><p>The Mail claims material from the computer show that Hunter Biden was able to evade prosecution for drugs and prostitution offences.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Aaron Rupar  (@atrupar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1380379731753893890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>It contains details of messages from Hunter Biden about an incident in which the Secret Service got involved after he abandoned a firearm in a bin after an argument with Hallie Biden, the wife of his deceased brother Beau Biden, with whom he was having a relationship.

And so I don&#39;t know is the answer.&#34;</p><p>Giuliani has said that he played a part in getting the laptop to members of the media.</p><p>Last year Trump allies seized on an email in the laptop which appeared to show Hunter trying to broker a meeting between an associate at Burisma and Joe Biden while he was Barack Obama&#39;s Vice President. No evidence has emerged to indicate the meeting ever took place.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/14/biden-campaign-lashes-out-new-york-post-429486\">In a statement to Politico last year a Biden spokesman</a> said Joe Biden may have had an &#34;informal interaction&#34; with the Burisma associate of his son&#39;s but any interaction would&#39;ve been &#34;cursory.&#34; </p><p>After being abandoned in the computer repair shop, the laptop hard drive is s<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/22/hunter-biden-giuliani-hard-drive-431022\">aid to have been obtained by Rudy Giuliani</a>, then working as Donald Trump&#39;s personal lawyer.</p><p>Giuliani led a longstanding campaign to link Joe Biden to his son&#39;s dealings in Ukraine.

The big box chain partners with national chains and local businesses, depending on the needs of the community, a spokesperson told Insider. Pizza chain Domino's is an especially good fit, since the restaurants mostly depend on pick-up and delivery, they said.</p>\n<p>So far there are <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-is-closing-hundreds-of-its-walmart-restaurants-11617960602\">30 Domino's in Walmarts</a> across the country, WSJ reported, noting that Walmart is also working with Taco Bell on installing locations.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/retailers-physical-locaiton-outlook-predictions-post-pandemic-2021-4\" data-e2e-name=\"inline-read-more-link\">Experts say brick-and-mortar retailers could rebound post-pandemic - but only if they channel the e-commerce boom back to their physical outposts</a></em></p>\n<p>Not all leased Walmart storefronts are restaurants, and they're often tailored to specific needs of the area. For example, a store in rural Texas has a tool rental shop that wouldn't necessarily make sense in other areas, Walmart says. </p>\n<p>Walmart and McDonald's have worked together since 1994, with 800 locations in 2012 and about 500 in 2012.</p>\n<p>Two series of closures were planned for 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic, with another wave planned to finish this summer, leaving 150 remaining locations. McDonald's has previously shared these plans with shareholders in earnings calls, including saying \"the majority of closures across the U.S. market are from <a href=\"https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/gwscorp/assets/investors/financial-information/2021%20Planned%20Net%20Unit%20Openings%20by%20Segment.pdf\">lower sales volume</a> McDonald's in Walmart store locations,\" in a fourth quarter 2020 note on openings and closings.</p>\n<p>The business relationship between Walmart and McDonald's no longer made sense for either business. McDonald's restaurants inside Walmarts don't have drive-thrus, which have become increasingly important across the fast food industry. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-chick-fil-a-drive-thrus-ipads-and-video-technology-2021-3\">70% of orders</a> in top markets come from drive-thrus, the chain says.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Walmart has been growing e-commerce and curbside pickup, meaning that fewer customers were coming inside and deciding to buy McDonald's during the trip. COVID-19 also accelerated this trend as indoor dining was closed in many locations.</p>\n<p>\"We have a great opportunity with our leased space business to help our stores become even more convenient and relevant to local communities.

The plan represents a an early glimpse into President Joe Biden&#39;s domestic spending priorities, ramping up spending on education, health, and climate initiatives while keeping military spending relatively flat.</p><p>It&#39;s Biden&#39;s first budgetary pitch to Congress, which can also reshape it in an aproppriations process which will likely take months.</p><p>The so-called &#34;skinny budget&#34; calls for an $118 billion increase in discretionary spending from fiscal year 2021 - the type of spending that lawmakers can change from one year to the next. That would be a 16% increase from current levels of domestic spending. Programs like Social Security and Medicare are not included, and will be part of a fuller spending proposal later in the spring.</p><p>The 58-page Biden blueprint includes significant spending boosts to agencies critical to achieving his domestic priorities, such as the Education Department.

It also proposes a new medical research agency with the aim of curing diseases like cancer, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2021/04/09/white-house-push-new-agency-aimed-at-curing-cancer/\">Stat News reported.</a></p><p>In a letter to congressional leaders, acting Office Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young said the current crisis brings with it &#34;a moment of possibility.&#34;</p><p>&#34;The upcoming appropriations process is another important opportunity to continue laying a stronger foundation for the future and reversing a legacy of chronic disinvestment in crucial priorities,&#34; she wrote.</p><p>This is a sharp break from President Donald Trump&#39;s conservative agenda. Trump&#39;s <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/budget-proposal-trump-whats-included-main-points-safety-net-2021-2020-2-1028893397#military1\">budget plan last year</a> sought to slash major domestic programs such as Medicaid and the size of federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>This budget arrives as the White House prepares to dive into congressional negotiations on its multitrillion-dollar infrastructure package, with Congress returning to session next week. Lawmakers must also strike a deal on the federal budget before funding expires at the end of September.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-bidens-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan-means-for-you-2021-4\">Biden&#39;s $2.3 trillion infrastructure package</a> would allocate major funding to roads and bridges, clean energy incentives, and in-home elder care, among other measures. A second proposal of a similar size is expected later this month. These plans are separate from the White House budget plan.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that Democrats could opt to bypass Republicans to approve the package sometime in July. The GOP is strongly opposed to the scope of the plan as well as its corporate tax hikes.</p><p>&#34;If we have to go to reconciliation, that&#39;s a lever, but I hope it&#39;s not something that we need to do,&#34; Pelosi said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Hwang&#39;s family office, Archegos, utilized equity-swap agreements to take on massive leverage and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/archegos-capital-margin-call-20-billion-liquidation-8-stocks-plummeted-2021-3-1030254795\">make concentrated bets on a handful of stocks</a> like ViacomCBS and Discovery.</p><p>But a sharp decline in ViacomCBS sparked a massive margin call that Archegos was unable to meet, leading to a massive liquidation that cost some banks billions of dollars in losses. Credit Suisse seems to have been most exposed to Archegos after not unwinding Hwang&#39;s positions fast enough amid the market tumult last month. The bank said it <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/credit-suisse-posts-loss-after-archegos-blow-up-exec-departure-2021-4-1030275805\">booked a $4.7 billion writedown related to the event</a>.</p><p>Now, to prevent a similar blowup from happening again, Credit Suisse is tightening its financing terms given to hedge funds and family offices, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/credit-suisse-tightens-hedge-fund-limits-amid-archegos-fallout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a Bloomberg report.</a></p><p>The bank is changing its margin requirement on swap agreements to dynamic from static, which is similar to the terms given in its prime-brokerage contracts, Bloomberg said, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter. A dynamic margin requirement would force its clients to post more collateral as a position moves down, rather than setting a fixed margin requirement at the onset of the contract.</p><p>The shift to dynamic margin requirements will increase the costs for hedge funds and family offices looking to unitize swap agreements, making the trades less profitable. Credit Suisse is now asking some clients to immediately switch to the news margin methodology, according to the report. </p><p>Whether Credit Suisse&#39;s move is more indicative of a broader limitation on the leverage hedge funds and family offices can take on remains to be seen.</p><p>It would not be surprising if some banks follow suit, given that the Switzerland-based bank wasn&#39;t the only one that lost billions. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nomura-takes-2-billion-loss-after-last-weeks-sell-off-2021-3-1030252569\">Nomura has said it lost as much as
