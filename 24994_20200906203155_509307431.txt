But kids are natural explorers and when they have access to great content, it can be a magical experience--they can read up on their favorite dinosaur, watch videos on how to bake a treat or discover new hobbies.</p><p><a href=\"https://families.google.com/familylink/\">Family Link</a> was created and built into our core products to give parents the tools they need to stay involved and help manage their child’s online experiences, from setting screen time limits to content safety filters, privacy controls and more. But we’ve heard that parents want more than just parental controls; with so much content out there, they also need help finding things that are enriching and engaging for their kids. To help meet this request, we took a first step with the launch of a new <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/google-play/teacher-approved-apps/\">kids tab</a> in Google Play that helps parents easily find and pick “teacher-approved” apps for their kids.</p><p>Today, we’re continuing to build upon these efforts with <a href=\"https://families.google.com/intl/ALL_us/kidsspace/\">Google Kids Space</a>, a new kids mode on select Android tablets that features apps, books and videos for your kids to explore, learn and have fun.* Kids Space will be available globally on certain <a href=\"https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-makes-learning-and-entertaining-at-home-easier-than-ever/\">Lenovo™ tablets</a> first, including the new Lenovo Smart Tab M10 HD Gen 2, and will be coming to more Android tablets soon.<sup>†</sup></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Designed for nurturing your kid’s curiosity and creativity</h3><p>Kids Space is designed with your kid at the center of the experience and made for them to become explorers of the things they love. By selecting their interests, your kids will see new and engaging content to read, play and make. Kids can even customize their experience by creating their own character.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_carousel\"><div class=\"h-c-page article-module\"><div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\"><ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\"><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure><div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Homescreen_V3oI5WU.gif);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Homescreen.gif</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Kids Space features daily content recommendations, fun facts and silly jokes.</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure><div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Interest_Picker_4wMChBB.gif);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Interest Picker.gif</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Pick and choose interests for a more customized experience. </p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\"><figure><div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Avatar.gif);\"><span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Avatar.gif</span></div><figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Build your own avatar to join in on the fun. </p></div></figcaption></figure></li></ul><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-previous uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - left click\"\n           }' data-glue-pagination-label=\"Previous\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\"><svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-left\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use></svg></div></div><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-next uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - right click\"\n           }' data-glue-pagination-label=\"Next\" data-glue-pagination-update-model=\"false\"><div class=\"h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap\"><svg class=\"h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-right\" role=\"img\"><use xlink:href=\"#mi-keyboard-arrow-right\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"h-c-carousel__navigation\"><div class=\"glue-pagination-page-list uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n            \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n            \"category\": \"interaction\",\n            \"action\": \"image carousel\",\n            \"label\": \"arrow - dot click\"\n           }'></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Recommended library of free books, apps and videos </h3><p>To evaluate and select “teacher-approved” apps in Google Play, we worked with academic experts and children’s education specialists to define rubrics. For Kids Space, we’ve built on that foundation and applied our quality standard to an ever-expanding library of apps and books in the Play and Read tabs. We worked with top publishers to make popular children’s books free of charge, and have over 400 free books available in the U.S. alone. In the Watch and Make tabs, your kids can view creative and fun videos from YouTube Kids that are engaging and encourage off-screen activities. And if you’re looking to customize even more, parents can download additional content from Google Play.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Tabs.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Tabs.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Access content that’s age-appropriate, thoughtfully designed and fun or inspiring. </p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Join us in our journey as we continue to create productive and healthy experiences for kids that adapt to the evolving world and needs of your family.</p><p><sub>* Kids Space requires a Google Account for your child.
