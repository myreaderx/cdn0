This new app was produced in-house over several months, allowing us to completely rewrite the code with a focus on improved security.</p> \n<p>If you are currently using ProtonVPN for Linux Version 2.0, we recommend that you upgrade to the new official client (there are a small number of user cases where this may not be desirable, which we detail below).&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>ProtonVPN for Linux features</h2> \n<p>Our new Linux app has been rebuilt from the ground up. Its streamlined code improves stability and performance, and provides a firm foundation for future developments.</p> \n<p>It also improves security, allowing us, for example, to properly embed an <strong>always-on kill switch</strong> into the codebase. And because the app minimizes the need to execute code with privileged access, <strong>no sudo rights are required</strong>.</p> \n<p>The new app is initially available for Debian-based systems, such as Debian itself, Ubuntu, Mint, or Kali, with support for other distros rolling out over the next few weeks.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It features <strong>DNS leak protection</strong> and <strong>IPv6 leak protection</strong>, and will <strong>automatically re-establish the VPN connection </strong>when you switch networks (for example when moving between office and home WiFi networks, or when you suspend and resume your laptop session).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Once our repository has been added to your system’s software sources (see install instructions below), the app will be kept updated by your default package manager.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our new client is <strong>completely integrated with NetworkManager,</strong> and therefore with the GNOME and KDE Plasma desktop environments. It uses OpenVPN UDP by default, but OpenVPN TCP mode is available. This can be useful for defeating censorship.</p> \n<p>At launch, the beta app does not support split tunneling, and does not work on headless systems. If these features are important to you, then the community version will remain available until they are supported in the official app. We do, however, recommend upgrading to the official app where possible.</p> \n<p>1. Add the ProtonVPN repository to your system’s software sources:</p> \n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">wget -q -O - https://repo.protonvpn.com/debian/public_key.asc | sudo apt-key add -&nbsp;</pre> \n<p>Followed by:</p> \n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://repo.protonvpn.com/debian unstable main'</pre> \n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Once this repo has been added, the app will be kept updated by your default package manager.</p> \n<p>2. Install the client:</p> \n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install protonvpn</pre> \n<h2>How to install the official Linux beta app</h2> \n<p>Please use the following commands in Terminal to install the Linux beta app. If you already have the community Linux app installed, please follow these instructions to upgrade to the official app.</p> \n<h2>How to use the official Linux beta app</h2> \n<p>To start using the client you must log in with the command:</p> \n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;protonvpn-cli login</pre> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n <img src=\"https://protonvpn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ProtonVPN-Linux-login-2.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4462\" />\n</figure> \n<p>Then simply run:</p> \n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">protonvpn-cli c&nbsp;</pre> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n <img src=\"https://protonvpn.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ProtonVPN-Linux-connect.gif\" alt=\"GIP of ProtonVPN Linux connect\" class=\"wp-image-4447\" />\n</figure> \n<p>To disconnect, enter:</p> \n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">protonvpn-cli d</pre> \n<p>The always-on kill switch must be enabled with the following command:</p> \n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">protonvpn-cli ks --always-on</pre> \n<p>Detailed instructions on how to use our official Linux CLI client are available <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/knowledge-base/official-linux-client\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>, or to see the full list of commands available, enter:</p> \n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">protonvpn-cli -h</pre> \n<h2>We salute the Proton community</h2> \n<p>Our official new Linux client replaces the community Linux client that we first <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/blog/linux-vpn-command-line-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched</a> in 2018, but all of our products will always be powered by our community.
