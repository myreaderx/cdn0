The agency was commissioned to work on a new brand identity for Revay, a construction management firm specializing in overcoming complications and stimulating developments. Sid Lee came up with a logo design based on the letter ‘R’, which is inspired by the loops of highway interchanges. It acts as a visual magnifying glass that can be used independently or together with dynamic workplace images. Solid yet light, organic yet angular, the visual identity tells Revay’s brand story while reflecting their ability to bypass issues through care and attention to detail.</p> \n<p>Below you can find a few images of the branding project.

His images are clearly not what most people expect when thinking of portrait photography. The Russian photographer often depicts people in unconventional poses and facial expressions. Consisting of several image pairings set side by side, Dmitri Pryahin’s photo series ‘Every Day’ shows various scenes of people in different places along with kind of disturbing close-ups that pull the viewer under their spell. It seems the photographer is more interested in showcasing our most hidden states of mind instead of taking photographs of an opaque shell.</p> \n<p>Below you can see a selection of photographs from Dmitri Pryahin’s series ‘Every Day’.

These pillars are Society, Memory, Equality, Knowledge, Existence, and Creativity.</p> \n<p>In addition to the creation of a printed program,&nbsp;another brand collateral has been designed including a responsive website, posters, postcards, tote bags, and a long banner that was displayed in the historic building of the University of Barcelona.</p> \n<p>Below you can see some images of the communication and branding materials.

The Freigeist font family captures the untamed pioneering innovations of type foundries from the 19th century such as Caslon or Stephenson Blake and puts them into a contemporary context. The result is a multi-faceted font family with a wide range of applications, styles, and features for today&#8217;s typesetting.

It is inspired by various historical typeface designs such as Caslon’s Doric or the Grotesque variants of Stephenson Blake. Freigeist&#8217;s narrow terminals as well as its serpentine letter &#8216;S&#8217; or the dynamic letter &#8216;g&#8217; result in a unique appearance—especially in combination with ascenders that reach the cap-height only. Freigeist is available in five widths and six weights ranging from thin to black plus matching Italics. It supports both Latin and Cyrillic-based languages and covers over 210 languages. Furthermore, the family comes with numerous alternative letterforms as well as many OpenType features including ligatures, different number sets, etc. For further information, just click on one of the following links.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/freigeist/?refby=watc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download at MyFonts</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/rene-bieder/freigeist?refby=watc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download at Fontspring</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/freigeist/?refby=watc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://weandthecolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Freigeist-font-family-by-German-typeface-designer-René-Bieder.png\" alt=\"Freigeist font family by German typeface designer René Bieder.\" class=\"wp-image-122305\" srcset=\"https://weandthecolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Freigeist-font-family-by-German-typeface-designer-René-Bieder.png 1440w, https://weandthecolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Freigeist-font-family-by-German-typeface-designer-René-Bieder-120x300.png 120w, https://weandthecolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Freigeist-font-family-by-German-typeface-designer-René-Bieder-696x1740.png 696w, https://weandthecolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Freigeist-font-family-by-German-typeface-designer-René-Bieder-614x1536.png 614w, https://weandthecolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Freigeist-font-family-by-German-typeface-designer-René-Bieder-819x2048.png 819w, https://weandthecolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Freigeist-font-family-by-German-typeface-designer-René-Bieder-1068x2670.png 1068w, https://weandthecolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-Freigeist-font-family-by-German-typeface-designer-René-Bieder-168x420.png 168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></a><figcaption>Freigeist font family by German typeface designer René Bieder.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/freigeist/?refby=watc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download at MyFonts</a></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/rene-bieder/freigeist?refby=watc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Download at Fontspring</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not hesitate to find other inspiring typefaces in our recommended <a href=\"http://category/recommendations/fonts-2\">Fonts</a> category.

These are usually elements that show how humans engage both deliberately and unintentionally with their environment. Some of his artworks are also altered by computer-generated effects to reveal underlying features or dynamics that can’t be shown with photography alone.</p> \n<p>Below you can find a handpicked selection of photographs from his ‘Fever Dream’ series.

With an eye for detail and her strong fictional imagery, she has the ability to convey certain emotions through her artworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her recent project &#8216;On Pause&#8217;, Vicki Ling masterfully explores the threshold between stillness and inertia. Consisting of five illustrations, the series is capturing the moment between the beginning and the end. Vicki Ling has created these artworks during the stay-at-home order in the era of the global pandemic of COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vicki Ling says: <em>&#8220;Since the world was paused, many habitual routines and plans in life have been affected or suspended. However, the energy still accumulates to a certain extent and provides a perspective to withdraw from inertial thinking. It also offers a possibility to appreciate the unusual beauty in the forced state of stillness.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you can find all five artworks.

The talented photographer has just released a highly-anticipated new photo series called “Pools From Above”. The photo series is a tribute to the beauty found in the shapes, colors, and textures of diverse swimming pools. All images are characterized by Brad Walls’ clean and minimalist aesthetic to showcase interesting pools from around the globe.</p> \n<p>Inspired by Brad Walls’ trips throughout Southeast Asia as well as within his own home country of Australia, his photo series initially came to life by taking photos of the bodies of water just to document some of his holiday memories. As Brad Walls picked up the bestselling Annie Kelly coffee table book ‘<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XCbGxH\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Splash: The Art of the Swimming Pool</a>‘, he was intrigued and inspired to start investing time and passion into curating a series.</p> \n<p><em>“As I turned each page of Kelly’s book, a wave of childhood nostalgia washed over me, spending hours in the pool over summer,”</em> Brad Walls says. <em>“I fell in love with the lines, curves, and negative space of the pools, which without an alternate perspective from a drone, would have been lost,”</em> he continues.</p> \n<p>Below you can find a selection of images from the photo series. For more, just visit Brad Walls’ <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.bradscanvas.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">website</a> or follow him on <a

an organic grotesque typeface with a flourishing touch.</h2> \n<p>Designed by Paul Eslage and published just recently by foundry TypeMates in 2020, Sombra is an organic sans serif font family with a flourishing dynamic style. It combines a basic geometric structure with organic, sharply swelling strokes and extreme incisions. The tension between this organic dynamic design and the geometric construction makes it a distinctive font for various projects including branding, editorial, and packaging design in numerous areas such as nature, urban, art, or culture.</p> \n<p>Equipped with seven weights and 680 glyphs per style, the Sombra font family supports more than 140 Latin-based languages. Furthermore, it is packed with lots of typographic features including arrows, starry icons, circled numbers, compact figure settings, alternates, and eye-catching ligatures.&nbsp;The entire family is currently available as an introductory offer (50% off)—only for a very limited time! To learn more, just click on one of the following links.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons\"> \n <div class=\"wp-block-button\">\n  <a class=\"wp-block-button__link\"

designed a circular house open to the sky and the horizon.</h2> \n<p>Inspired by Andreu Alfaro’s “The door of the Universe” from 1983 as well as “In Praise of the Horizon” by Eduardo Chillida made in 1989, the team of <a href=\"https://weandthecolor.com/tag/fran-silvestre-arquitectos\">Fran Silvestre Arquitectos</a> designed a circular house on a plot of great slope in the city of Marbella, Spain. With its fantastic views, the architectural concept is open to the sky and the horizon while simultaneously protected from the gaze of others and the strong winds of this region. Below you can see a few images of this outstanding architecture project.

The talented freelance designer has recently completed this beautiful branding project for a Moscow-based bookstore.</p> \n<p>Her proposed logo concept combines a paragraph symbol with the shape of a seahorse. So why did she use precisely the shape of a seahorse? <em>“If you read ‘Konkovo’ in Russian, you might notice that the name consists of the word ‘horse’. That’s why I took the word as a basis, changing it to a seahorse because in its image and shape it looks more like a paragraph,” </em>Anastasia Kurilenko explains.</p> \n<p>The work also included the development of a stationery system as well as packaging and communication design.
