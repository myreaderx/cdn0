That‚Äôs right, we‚Äôre talking about World Emoji Day.</p><p>Never heard of it? Before my career in the world of emoji neither had I. But soon enough, I learned that the calendar emoji (of which there are three¬† üìÖ üìÜ üóìÔ∏è) has officially ordained July 17 as the day we honor all things emoji. Traditional ways of celebrating include: sending emoji, receiving emoji, asking existential questions about emoji...or offering a sneak peek at some new emoji.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Image showing three emoji characters in a wedding dress, a tux, and holding a baby, changing skin tones and genders.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Emoji-Skintones_FVUuuDf.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Did someone say new emoji?!</h3><p>Last year, we sent a proposal focused on introducing more empathetic expressions and finding opportunities to bring <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/five-many-new-emoji-coming-android-year/\">equity to the keyboard</a> to the <a href=\"https://home.unicode.org/\">Unicode Consortium</a>, the nonprofit organization that maintains emoji standards and guidelines. We‚Äôll see some of those efforts released this fall with a slightly smiling face, an emoji of two people hugging, a man in a veil, a woman in a tuxedo, and a person feeding a baby.¬†</p><p>Other emoji will be added as well‚Äîhit that pi√±ata or bang on the long drum to celebrate. Send an anatomical heart when the love is so real, so raw. Or perhaps you‚Äôll identify with one of the new animals, like a super cute bison, an eager beaver or a polar bear that just needs a little love. There are also new food emoji, like a tamale (nom nom), a boba tea sure to make you thirsty (\"black milk tea, boba, 30 percent sugar please\") and even a teapot for those who felt the ‚Äúhot beverage‚Äù emoji (‚òï) was simply not ‚Äútea time‚Äù enough.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Animating gif showing a tamale, a bison, a beaver, a polar bear, a boba tea, a tea pot, a stump, a magic wand, a hand making the chef's kiss movement, a pinata, a long drum, and an anatomical heart.\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/New-Emoji.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Additional characters across nature, activities and beyond will launch later this year, including a stump of wood (sure, OK), a magic wand (ta-da), and a woolly mammoth (better late than never, I guess).

First, we gazed into the eyes of our favorite smileys <a href=\"http://workshop-proceedings.icwsm.org/abstract?id=2020_04\">to understand them on the inside and outside</a>. Then, we designed the emoji to make sure they work just as well with dark-mode for late night texting üòâ.
