Again, you can think of this as your social media analytics strategy.</p> \n<h3>1. Set SMART social media analytics goals.</h3> \n<p>Create and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\">set SMART goals</a> to help you achieve your social media analytics goals. By ensuring your goals are SMART, they’ll be Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound — meaning, you’ll be able to focus your strategy to reach or even exceed your expectations efficiently.</p> \n<p>To begin, ask yourself, “What do I want to learn from my social media analytics?” Then, dive into each part of the SMART goal. Here’s an example of a SMART goal related to your social media analytics strategy for reference.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase&amp;_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Use a free template to help you create SMART goals and achieve them</a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Specific:</strong> I want to use social media analytics to identify specific data points related to my marketing tactics to determine which posts and campaigns are working best in reaching and engaging our audience members.</li> \n <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> I want to be able to identify some specific data points to accomplish this goal.</li> \n <li><strong>Attainable: </strong>I will work to identify <em>three</em> specific data points to help accomplish this goal.</li> \n <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> These data points will help my team and I measure our success in reaching and engaging our audience members across social media channels as well as identify any gaps or areas for improvement in our social media strategy.</li> \n <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> I want to identify these specific data points over the course of the next month — this way, in four week’s time, we can begin using them to measure our success in reaching and engaging audience members across social channels and identify gaps and areas for improvement in our social media strategy.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Decide which metrics you’ll and focus on and track.</h3> \n<p>Now it’s time to decide which <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-metrics-ceos-cares-about?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\">social media metrics</a> you’re going to track. There are a number of commonly-tracked social media metrics for your consideration. Metrics may vary by social platform as well as which analytics tool you chose. But, here are some all-encompassing metrics applicable to virtually every social channel and analytics tool to get started.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Reach</strong> is the total number of people who have seen your content.</li> \n <li><strong>Engagements</strong> are all interactions including shares, likes, and comments.</li> \n <li><strong>Impressions</strong> are the number of times or content is displayed on someone’s feed.</li> \n <li><strong>Mentions</strong> are the times your business and brand are referenced on social media by audience members or other businesses.</li> \n <li><strong>Social ROI</strong> provides insight into whether the investment you've put into your social media marketing is resulting in an increase or decrease in customers, sales, brand awareness, and customer loyalty.</li> \n <li><strong>Social listening</strong> is when you monitor conversations about your business and brand on social to see what customers and audience members are saying about you.</li> \n <li><strong>Likes</strong> are when an audience member taps (or double taps) on your social content to show they’re a fan of your post.</li> \n <li><strong>Retweets/shares/reposts</strong> are when audience members post the content your business published on their profiles.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Determine which social media analytics tools you’ll use.</h3> \n<p>Next, determine which social media analytics tools you’ll use — <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-analytics#social-media-analytics-tools\">we covered some popular choices above</a> but you can always review other options through a simple Google search.</p> \n<p>Before making a decision regarding which tool or tools you’ll use, think about the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you want a tool or software to help you manage your social media analytics across multiple channels and platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) or just one (e.g. Twitter)?</li> \n <li>Which metrics did you decide you’re going to track (as we touched on in the above step)?</li> \n <li>What is your budget? Do you need a tool with flexible pricing options and features that you can add to or remove from over time? (To find this information, review the pricing pages like <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/pricing/\">this page on Sprout Social’s website</a>.)</li> \n <li>Which tools and software options are suited to help you achieve the SMART goals you set? (Check out feature pages for this type of information, like <a href=\"https://www.oktopost.com/platform/social-media-analytics\">this page on Oktopost’s website</a>.)</li> \n <li>Do you want your tool to integrate with the greater software your team uses to run your business (such as <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?_ga=2.81024276.2097981921.1583513905-1675356138.1572978608\">HubSpot’s CRM</a>, for example)?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Measure the success of your social media analytics efforts.</h3> \n<p>Once you implement your social media analytics software, you’ll be able to measure the success of your efforts. To do this, you may use the analytics tool you implemented — depending on your software, you might have the ability to create customized reports and dashboards or pull the specific details about data points you care most about.</p> \n<p>In addition to applying your tools to help measure your success, you may also consider your answers to the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Did you achieve your SMART goals?</li> \n <li>Did the metrics you chose to focus on tell a story that’s helpful for your business?</li> \n <li>Did the software or tool you implemented support your business needs?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>5. Make necessary social media analytics adjustments.</h3> \n<p>Once you measure the success of your social media analytics efforts, you’ll be able to determine whether or not any part of your strategy needs to be changed or updated.</p> \n<p>Maybe you realize one of your data points isn’t providing the level of insight into your marketing efforts across social platforms, so you need to identify a new one to measure.

And while everybody seems to know what <em>not</em> to publish these days, many marketers are asking: what <em>should</em> we put out into a world in the throes of a crisis?</p>  \n<p>It's a conundrum facing countless creators across the globe.</p> \n<p>They're wondering how to be empathetic without being disingenuous. How to offer value without seeming opportunistic. And how to be there for their audience without adding to the noise.</p> \n<p>These are important questions to ask at a time like this. Essential, in fact. But underpinning all of them is a much simpler question that gets to the very heart of what content marketing has always been about. A question that every creator staring at a blank canvas right now should be asking: <em>how can we help?</em></p> \n<p>Because now, more than ever before, audiences are seeking help.</p> \n<h2><span>Increasing Engagement Rates</span></h2> \n<p>Entire industries have been forced into hibernation in recent weeks, but this does not mean audiences' appetites for helpful content has gone away. On the contrary. Consumers are increasing searches for valuable information and engaging with businesses at record rates.</p> \n<p>According to an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data-edition3\">analysis of anonymized data from HubSpot's global customer base</a>, engagement with marketing emails, website traffic, and live chat sessions have all been on the rise, with email open rates an eye-catching 25% higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png?width=1500&amp;name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png\" alt=\"increasing engagement rates\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Meanwhile, traffic to <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot Academy</a>, our free online training program, has more than doubled in recent weeks, and our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing\">Marketing Blog</a> has experienced a 40% increase in weekly organic traffic.</p> \n<p>The pandemic has triggered a striking surge in the very thing that many marketers care about most: audience attention. And such a high level of interest in the content companies are sharing, coming at such a sensitive time, places a huge responsibility on marketers to deliver materials that are not only relevant to the current moment, but genuinely impactful, too.</p> \n<p>Those that fall short run the risk of doing damage to their reputation — according to <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/research/covid-19-brand-trust-report\">Edelman</a>, \"71 percent of consumers agree that if they perceive that a brand is putting profit over people, they will lose trust in that brand forever.\"</p> \n<p>But those that succeed will leave a lasting impression on their audience — according to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/adapt-the-marketing-strategy-for-covid-19\">Gartner</a>, brands that meet consumer's needs at this time can \"re-establish trust through customer-centric actions.\"</p> \n<p>So, it is not only engagement rates that are high during this crisis. The stakes are high, too. And a situation this unique requires a unique strategy to match.</p> \n<h2>When a Crisis Descends, Pause Before Planning</h2> \n<p>When times of crisis strike, the first thing marketers should think about is what <em>not</em> to do. Planned projects, campaigns, and announcements should be reviewed and postponed if possible. For those assets that are released as planned, it's likely they'll need a new tone that's appropriate for the new environment.</p> \n<p>Marketers should examine every article, email, ad, and social media post scheduled to be published to ensure that the tone of each asset is empathetic and respectful.</p> \n<p>If this sounds like a lot of work, it's because, in many cases, it is. No one team can manage a company-wide content audit alone.</p> \n<p>Communications teams have expertise in developing messaging, social media teams have deep connections to their online community, email marketing teams have a strong understanding of brand tone, and customer-facing teams, including sales to service, have their fingers on the pulse of how customers are feeling — all of these teams should be consulted on content strategy during a crisis to ensure that a consistent and helpful approach is adopted across every touchpoint with the public.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, before we began creating new content for the new environment, we significantly reduced the frequency of our social media posting, dialed back the promotion of a major product launch (<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">CMS Hub</a>), and created a centralized set of guidelines on how we as a company should be communicating during this crisis.</p> \n<p>Making such sweeping adjustments on short notice isn't simple, but for us, two things helped make it easier.</p> \n<p>First, we have an established decision-making process for crisis communications that minimizes confusion in the moment.</p> \n<p>Second, by centralizing all of our customer interactions in a shared CRM, we're able to see what communications customers are getting and roll out adjustments quickly to marketing, sales, and service.</p> \n<h2>Creating New Content in Times of Crisis</h2> \n<p>When it comes to creating new content during a crisis, marketers' sole focus should be on delivering work that is genuinely helpful to their audience, without being opportunistic or adding more noise to a topic that has already been widely covered by others.</p> \n<p>According to research conducted by <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/research/covid-19-brand-trust-report\">Edelman</a>, 85% of people expect companies to use their power to educate their audiences during the COVID-19 crisis. For some companies, that could mean writing in-depth articles that offer expert advice on relevant topics or aggregating publicly available information to make it more accessible for readers.</p> \n<p>Intuit, for example, did this well when they teamed up with GoFundMe to create a <a href=\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com/small-business/coronavirus/\">Small Business Relief Initiative</a> and when they built an <a href=\"https://aidassist.intuit.com/app/home#/home\">interactive tool</a> to help small businesses learn if they are eligible for government-provided financial relief.</p> \n<p>We saw similarly helpful content from Care.com, whose team leveraged their deep knowledge of caregiving best practices to share <a href=\"https://www.care.com/c/stories/16747/navigating-covid-19-care/\">expert advice</a> on the precautions for families and caregivers facing the global health crisis.</p> \n<p>These powerful examples directly address the situation at hand. But for other companies, providing helpful content could mean offering an alternative to the cacophony of crisis-centric content flooding feeds all day, every day.</p> \n<p>For example, NPR has unsurprisingly witnessed a spike in listenership to its news shows as people seek up-to-date, reliable information as the pandemic evolves. But it has also seen a 120% increase in weekly visits to its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/\">Tiny Desk Concerts</a> — an entertainment series — indicating that audiences are not only interested in information directly about the crisis, but are also desiring content that provides an escape from it.</p> \n<p>This should make content marketers feel encouraged.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>It suggests that help can take many forms in the midst of a crisis and that there are multiple ways creators can add value to the lives of their audiences at this time.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For marketing teams that don't have the necessary resources to create new content given the trying economic environment, there are still creative ways to adapt to audiences' needs. Gathering together old content that's relevant to the current situation, updating it as needed, and presenting it as an easily digestible ebook or content series can be efficient ways of overcoming resource shortages.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we did just this when we published <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/topic-learning-path/remote-work\">a new landing page featuring all of our articles about remote work</a> to offer some timely support to companies and employees adjusting to the new normal of working from home.</p> \n<p>During times of crisis, there are a number of ways for marketers to approach new content creation — some that directly address the unique environment at hand, others that look to complement the new patterns of behavior that are emerging — but the one thing that should be consistent is an honest effort to help.</p> \n<h2>Choose Channels Carefully, Distribute Delicately</h2> \n<p>Marketers have an abundance of options for how they distribute their work, but just because we <em>can</em> publish content on multiple channels doesn't always mean that we <em>should</em>.</p> \n<p>Our research tells us that marketing email send volumes have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/covid-19-benchmark-data-edition4\">increased significantly in recent weeks</a>, meaning that subscribers' email inboxes are even busier than usual. As well-intentioned as a new article or video might be, if it isn't distributed delicately and at a considerate cadence, it could end up doing more harm than good in a company's efforts to help audience members.</p> \n<p>Marketers should reserve their most intimate communications channels, like email and push notifications, for key content updates during a crisis and adopt more subtle distribution approaches for their more niche materials.</p> \n<p>For example, an SEO-optimized article that's easily discoverable through search may be a more appropriate way to share certain new content offerings than a direct email or paid social media post, both of which could come across as excessively promotional or tone-deaf.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, when the pandemic was declared, we cut our social media posting by approximately 50% in the first week and reduced the number of ads we were sending to avoid overloading our audience with information at a time when there's already a lot to process.</p> \n<p>And when we developed a new educational content series, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/adapt2020\">Adapt 2020</a>, we made clear to potential subscribers what type of content to expect, as well as where and when it would be distributed.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png\" alt=\"content marketing adapt 2020 campaign\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>The Adapt series became the cornerstone of our content strategy during the current crisis and provided a powerful proof point of the value of the diverse app ecosystem that's deeply integrated with HubSpot's suite of tools.</p> \n<p>With Looker we've been able to share regular updates on shifting trends in sales and marketing, with Canva we've been able to quickly design on-brand assets to promote upcoming webinars, and with Slack we've been able to collaborate with confidence on all of the elements that make up the weekly content series.</p> \n<p>With distribution channels and cadence established with our subscribers, we have been able to turn our attention towards monitoring how the crisis and the needs of our audience are evolving from week to week.</p> \n<h2>Adapt Early, Adapt Often</h2> \n<p>Crises are unpredictable by nature. And what was deeply valuable to audiences last week, may be irrelevant by the next. To provide helpful content for the duration of a crisis, marketers should prepare to continually evolve their strategy in line with their audiences' shifting needs.</p> \n<p>Choosing the right metrics to monitor is key to not falling behind the pace of change. Creators should closely monitor metrics that indicate engagement — such as 'average time spent on page' for articles and show-up rates for webinars — to gain an insight into whether or not their new content is resonating with audiences. And from there, they can use those learnings to look for ways to improve the relevance and helpfulness of their next offering.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we initially focused on delivering content aimed at helping businesses to set up virtual events and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/topic-learning-path/remote-work\">adapt to the new normal of remote work</a>.</p> \n<p>We then quickly shifted focus to creating content to help businesses take advantage of new relief measures available by publishing the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/en-us/coronavirus-response\">pricing and packaging changes we've made</a> along with an<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/us-stimulus-package\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/us-stimulus-package\">overview of the U.S. Stimulus Package</a>.</p> \n<p>Following that, we shifted focus to creating content to help businesses adjust their medium- and longer-term strategies and prepare for the post-pandemic economy.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>We have never witnessed such sudden and dramatic shifts in what audiences need, and the marketers that are nimble enough to adapt their strategy quickly are the ones most likely to provide meaningful help for the duration of the crisis at hand.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And by doing so, they stand to establish long-lasting levels of loyalty with their audience.</p> \n<h2>What Content Marketing Has Always Been About</h2> \n<p>It's no secret that consumers' trust in companies has been dwindling in recent years. According to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-acquisition-study\">HubSpot Research</a>, 55% of people no longer trust the companies they buy from as much as they used to, and 71% do not trust sponsored ads on social networks.</p> \n<p>However, times of crisis create unique environments and unexpected outcomes, one of which can be the recovery of some of that lost trust, and the deepening of long-term relationships between consumers and companies.</p> \n<p>Audiences are turning in record numbers to businesses for resources, information, and support. Customers are taking to social media to rally support for their favorite businesses. And content marketers are returning to first principles and re-establishing helpfulness at the heart of their strategies.</p> \n<p>There are many challenges facing businesses at this time — content strategy is just one of them — but I am hopeful that marketers adopting the advice outlined here will see their efforts rewarded in the form of closer relationships with the audiences, and the fulfillment of knowing they've provided help when it's been needed the most.</p> \n<p>After all, that's what content marketing has always been about.</p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcontent-marketing-playbook-for-times-of-crisis&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/content-marketing-2020.jpg#keepProtocol","linkMd5":"c5760aa0fc813a19a26af70839ac7c61","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn30@2020_4/2020/08/12/17-30-15-963_29b1ce9b289228a5.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/content-marketing-2020.jpg#keepProtocol","author":"manderson@hubspot.com (Meghan Keaney Anderson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png?width=1500&name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn72@2020_2/2020/08/12/17-30-15-677_b3f407fe1f42c77d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png?width=1500&name=Content%20Creation%20in%20Times%20of%20Crisis-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/12/17-30-15-342_3fae8f649b5c442c.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fcontent-marketing-playbook-for-times-of-crisis&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/12/17-30-15-344_d469ddd1ee8ae4cd.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-13 01:30:13","updatedTime":"2020-08-13 01:30:13","title":"12 Social Media Tools You Need to Use in 2020","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-tools","description":"<p>You already know how important <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/social-media?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=social_media\">social media </a>is to increase brand awareness, generate more leads, and ultimately score more conversions.</p> \n<p>The world is on social media — <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/pages/digital-2020\">50% of it</a>, at least — so if you want your product, service, and mission to reach the maximum amount of people, your business needs to be on social media, too.</p>  \n<p>Social media, however, can be extremely time-consuming. Additionally, it spans so many diverse tasks, ranging from number-based activities like tracking analytics, to creative jobs such as designing graphics.</p> \n<p>It can be difficult to find the skills and manpower needed to execute a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing?_ga=2.148338675.551210183.1559051592-1451183703.1557949920\">good social media strategy</a> — which is why you need social media tools to help you out.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll cover the top 12 <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/social-media-management/\">social media tools</a> you should be using in 2020 to help you save time and increase conversions.</p> \n<h2>What makes for a good social media tool?</h2> \n<p>Although the term \"social media tool\" is very general and can apply to a wide range of services, there are a few key features each social media tool should have.</p> \n<h3>1. It saves you time.</h3> \n<p>The goal of a social media tool is to save you time while getting similar — or better — results than you could without it. Look for social media tools that automate a process, but make sure the process still happens correctly, since some shortcuts might be too fast and therefore won't focus on quality.</p> \n<h3>2. It helps you increase brand awareness.</h3> \n<p>One of the biggest benefits of social media is its ability to increase your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness\">brand awareness</a>, which is why each social media tool you select should perform its services with brand awareness in mind.</p> \n<p>Maybe your tool of choice is an editing platform such as <a href=\"http://lightroom.com\">Lightroom</a>, which can help you create images to match the rest of your feed. Or, maybe it's an Instagram scheduler like <a href=\"http://later.com\">Later</a> so you can preview your profile before you post images. Whatever the case may be, social media tools should focus largely on brand awareness.</p> \n<h3>3. It's easy to use.</h3> \n<p>Social media tools are only a time-saver if they're easy and intuitive. Each tool you select should be super user-friendly so that, if needed, your accounting team could edit photos and your creative, right-brained writers could still use the analytics function to track daily social metrics.</p> \n<p>Many social media tools provide tutorials on their websites. Others, such as <a href=\"http://Kicksta.com\">Kicksta</a>, have top-notch customer service so you can get immediate expert advice if you need help getting off the ground.</p> \n<h3>4. It's affordable.</h3> \n<p>Social media tools should be affordable (and most of them are).

Sometimes, we hit a wall with planning content that aligns with our company and goals.</p> \n<p>If you're just starting out in <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/social-media?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=social_media\">social media marketing</a> or are looking for a few tips to get inspiration, we've compiled some helpful knowledge to beef up your accounts — no matter your skill level.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Sync posts across all social media accounts.</h3> \n<p>If you're just starting out, it's a good idea to invest in a social media management service like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox\">HubSpot's Social Inbox</a>. This tool can help you schedule posts, monitor mentions, track your social analytics, and keep an eye on all your accounts. Similar tools include <a href=\"https://later.com/\">Later</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/\"> TweetDeck</a>.</p> \n<p>These apps will also let you sync posts across various accounts. Keeping content synced will ensure you post across all of your platforms and introduce followers with multiple accounts to your brand.</p> \n<h3>2. Republish and update older posts.</h3> \n<p>If you have a backlog of content that's outdated, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guide-to-updating-republishing-blogging-content-ht\">update and republish it</a> with fresh ideas for SEO. This tactic has the potential to draw in new readers and take less time than continuously pumping out new ideas.</p> \n<p>This can be blog posts, landing pages, and offers that you have on your website. Your social media strategy exists to put your best foot forward by building engagement, and you don't have to start from ground zero.</p> \n<p>In fact, this exact post is an update from 2017, originally posted in 2013. We regularly update posts to ensure our readers are getting fresh content on our blog, social channels, and emails.</p> \n<h3>3. Schedule posts for evenings.</h3> \n<p>Don’t be afraid of weekends either. Scheduling content launches for evenings opens up a door for engagement that isn't cut off by time zone. That way, even if it's 3 AM in your geographic location, your tweet about your new app update reaches audiences around the world.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspotlife/?hl=en\">HubSpot Life</a> is a behind-the-scenes look at HubSpot's culture, posting content from global offices on social media. During what's considered \"off\" hours in the US, HubSpot Life features posts during work hours in other countries, like Paris, Bogota, or Dublin.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-11%20at%2010.25.49%20AM.png?width=1500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-08-11%20at%2010.25.49%20AM.png\" alt=\"hubspot life instagram\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hubspotlife/?hl=en\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>This ensures that global audiences are able to get fresh content during their work days, as well.</p> \n<p>When scheduling posts for evenings, avoid content that requires engagement from your team. For instance, an Instagram photo that invites followers to <i> \"Comment below!\"</i> about something might not be the best idea to post at midnight, when you're not able to engage.</p> \n<h3>4. Include hashtags to increase engagement</h3> \n<p>Hashtags are like a golden ticket to increasing your online reach. Common tags like #SocialMedia and #MarketingGoals are great, but try searching for less-used ones like those of bigger brands (such as Adobe's #CreateYourStory), or community-based (#BrightonMA). Those are going to be the ones an active audience is checking out.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Buffer-on-Instagram-bio-example.png?width=1500&amp;name=Buffer-on-Instagram-bio-example.png\" alt=\"buffer on instagram hashtags\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.business2community.com/brandviews/buffer/the-science-behind-the-best-instagram-bios-02246266\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>As well as using existing hashtags, try your hand at creating your own branded hashtags, like <a href=\"https://buffer.com/\"> Buffer</a> did in the example above (#BufferLove). This allows you to track what your followers and customers are saying about your media presence and product.</p> \n<h3>5. Use visuals whenever possible.</h3> \n<p>If you're getting your feet wet with the social media game, it's okay not to invest a fortune into visual content. However, it's always a good idea to include pictures, videos, or graphics in posts whenever you can.</p> \n<p>There are a number of free services, like <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\"> Canva</a> , to help you edit and create content. <a href=\"https://giphy.com/\"> GIFs</a> are a great way to engage with a younger audience. And never forget the smartphone most likely in your pocket they produce beautiful pictures you can definitely use on socials.</p> \n<p>If you've tried your hand at social media before and feel comfortable branching out, these intermediate tips are for you. They're aimed at easing the process of creating uniform content across your channels while increasing clicks.</p> \n<h3>1. Post multiple times a day.</h3> \n<p>You don't need to post every hour, but one to three times a day keeps your brand fresh in your audience's mind. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-user-generated-content-campaigns\">Reposting user-generated content</a> also counts, so don’t stress about coming up with dozens of new content ideas.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/guide-user-generated-content-ecommerce\"><em>Download this free guide to learn how to leverage user-generated content to improve your conversion rates.</em></a></p> \n<p>If you’re looking for ways to brush up your content marketing, how about incorporating an infographic or eBook into that Facebook post? For more tips like those, check out our list <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-types?_ga=2.163078463.2000696366.1572268289-940436819.1565181751\"> here.</a></p> \n<h3>2. Incorporate your brand into your social strategy.</h3> \n<p>Your brand should speak for you. Once you've established your brand, think of ways to blend it into your social media marketing. This can mean adding your logo to posts, including a company hashtag, or highlighting your employees.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/metter%20media%20branding.png?width=1500&amp;name=metter%20media%20branding.png\" alt=\"Metter Media branding example\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 1500px;\" width=\"1500\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mettermedia/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Check out this branding from social media management company, Metter Media. From a quick scroll through their Instagram homepage, you can quickly spot company colors, get a look into their team, and gain an idea of who they represent.</p> \n<h3>3. Engage audiences with interactive content.</h3> \n<p>From Twitter polls to Instagram Q&amp;As, there are many ways to engage your audience and make your company’s content diverse. You can use interactive content to educate your audience about your products or to connect with your audience.</p> \n<p>Think of ways your audience engages with competitors and how you can add your company into the mix. You can even ask your audience what type of content they prefer to see on an Instagram story, like this example below:</p> \n<div> \n <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/polling%20screenshot-1.png?width=359&amp;name=polling%20screenshot-1.png\" style=\"width: 359px; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Instagram poll example\" width=\"359\"><a href=\"http://instagram.com/frommybowl\"></a></p> \n <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://instagram.com/frommybowl\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n</div> \n<p>The story of this food blogger begins to recap previous recipes with links to corresponding blog posts. To put this in a B2B perspective, say you wanted to boost clicks on previous blog content. You could poll followers, <i> \"Which type of post goes best with your coffee?\" </i> and link to two options in the next parts of your story.</p> \n<h3>4. Invest in more visual content.</h3> \n<p>As you get into the swing of posting on social media, invest more time into visual content. On average, retweets with pictures gain more clicks and views than text-only posts.</p> \n<p>Visual content isn't just restricted to Instagram. Post infographics about your industry on LinkedIn, tweet a funny meme relating to your office culture, or post a video on Facebook taking viewers on a high-speed tour of your office.</p> \n<p>Next up are some advanced tips. These ideas are for social media pros in need of a new direction or options to brighten their feeds.</p> \n<h3>1. Use new app updates to your advantage.</h3> \n<p>Have you tried <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-tiktok\"> TikTok</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/igtv\">IGTV</a> yet? If not, we suggest expanding your strategy to include these channels. After all, you don’t want to miss out on your content having the potential to meet <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-hit-1-billion-downloads-surpassing-instagram-in-2018-2019-2\">one billion</a> phones.</p> \n<p>New apps and app updates add to the ability to diversify your brand and keep things fresh. If you're looking to show your company's humorous side, try uploading a little <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brands-on-tiktok?_ga=2.157622713.2000696366.1572268289-940436819.1565181751\"> dance</a> video on TikTok. If you want to bring that podcast of yours to visual audiences, upload it to IGTV.</p> \n<div>\n <iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto display: block display: block; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed/6720653674525363461\" width=\"340\" height=\"700\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div> \n<h3>2. Invest in influencers to promote your product or service.</h3> \n<p>It's official: young audiences listen to their idols. <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/youtube-stars-influence/\"> Four in 10</a> millennials trust the products their favorite influencers promote on their social channels, so <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-work-with-influencers\">investing in influencers</a> might be an avenue to look into when trying to generate sales.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/influencer-marketing-guide\"><em>Download our free ultimate guide to getting started with influencer marketing.</em></a></p> \n<p>If you have an audience that's younger, research influencers in your industry and pitch potential partnerships. Or, for a more budget-friendly option, look at how influencers are branding their content — you may be able to incorporate some ideas into your strategy.</p> \n<h3>3. Diversify content on every social media platform.</h3> \n<p>You can update and sync content on your accounts like a pro. Now it's time to make that content unique. Save your high-definition videos for Facebook and meme posts for Twitter.</p> \n<p>When diversifying content, make sure they all relate back to your company's goals and mission. There's no need to post a recipe for falafel on your marketing company's Instagram, but an infographic displaying the 'recipe' for a perfect caption would be a compelling, spot on example.</p> \n<div> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p>If you're a writer, a filmmaker, or really anyone who’s looking for good career advice, check out this thread from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrismcquarrie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@chrismcquarrie</a>. 🙌 <a href=\"https://t.co/RRCbxoO8kg\">https://t.co/RRCbxoO8kg</a></p> — LinkedIn (@LinkedIn) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LinkedIn/status/1187391628916510720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</div>   \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/linkedin%20diversifying%20content%20example.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"LinkedIn Facebook post\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://facebook.com/linkedin\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>On October 24th, LinkedIn highlighted a blog post on Facebook. On the same day, LinkedIn promoted a Twitter thread aimed at aspiring filmmakers. Threads are a Twitter-specific tool aimed at sectioning off long thoughts, while the Facebook post gives LinkedIn more clicks from their Facebook followers.</p> \n<h3>4. Start promotions to build audience growth.</h3> \n<p>Have you run a contest on your Twitter account yet? Totino's does them well.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/totinos%20promotion.png?width=1500&amp;name=totinos%20promotion.png\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"Totinos promotion tweet example\" width=\"1500\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/totinos\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Don't worry, promotions don't have to be this fancy. Running a promotion can be simple as giving 10% off of your product or service to a lucky winner who retweets. This expands your reach and sparks lead generation among your customers' followers.</p> \n<h3>5. Create timely content that resonates with audiences.</h3> \n<p>As a huge believer in taking advantage in the meme of the moment, creating timely content adds some fun to your channels and can explain the uses of your product in a new way. Memes aren't the only way to accomplish this, seasons are, as well.</p> \n<p>Is it wintertime in your part of the world? Celebrate by snapping a pic of your company's favorite snowy activity and share it to Facebook. Alternatively, #NationalSandwichDay is November 3rd. Popeye's used this holiday to announce the comeback of a recent fan favorite.</p> \n<div> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p>Y’all…the sandwich is back Sunday, November 3rd.

This kicks off their buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg?width=600&amp;name=buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg\" alt=\"buyer's journey showing progression through the awareness stage, consideration stage, and decision stage\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When you don't have a complete understanding your audience, a disconnect is created between your business and your potential customers. For content marketers, this usually means you're putting out content that your readers don't really relate with, which can cause you to lose them.</p> \n<p>As is the case in all marketing disciplines, it’s <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">important to understand your audience</a>:&nbsp;how they think, the answers they seek, and the path they tend to take to find a solution. From that research, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\">begin crafting a documented content strategy</a> that maps your content to the various stages of the buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>Developing the buyer’s journey for your business is the first step to creating content that resonates with your buyer and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33711/The-Steps-You-Need-to-Define-the-Stages-of-Your-Sales-Marketing-Funnel.aspx?&amp;_ga=2.183949606.1430126461.1594683485-303082430.1584047107#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">building out your marketing funnel</a> so that you can meet them at each stage of their journey.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What Is a Marketing Funnel?&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>A marketing funnel — more commonly known as a sales funnel since its output is revenue — describes the different stages a customer goes through leading up to their purchase, from looking at your website for the first time and subscribing to your email list to reading your emails and talking to a sales associate.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-engage-delight.jpg?width=787&amp;name=attract-engage-delight.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of marketing funnel with marketing at the top, sales in the middle, and customers at the end. Also shows corresponds to the attract, engage, and delight strategy.\" width=\"787\" style=\"width: 787px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>How the funnel works is simple. The top of the funnel indicates they are further away from a purchasing decision while those who make it to the bottom of the funnel are closer to a purchasing decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Often, it’s a marketer’s job to <strong>attract</strong> your buyer persona in the early stages of their journey and hand off qualified prospects to the sales team to <strong>engage</strong> them. Once they become a customer, your service team <strong>delights</strong> them so that they buy from you again and again and tell all their friends.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The funnel is a useful tool when used in the context of the buyer’s journey. However, keep in mind that the funnel has one issue: It puts customers as the output. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QC2SHjBiag\">INBOUND 18</a>, HubSpot officially <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/our-flywheel\">retires the funnel in favor of the flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif?width=450&amp;name=Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif\" alt=\"an animation of the funnel morphing into a flywheel, a circle with marketing, sales, and service surrounded by growth (or customers) at the center\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">The result puts customers at the center, which creates a more unified and less linear approach to all your marketing, sales, and service activities.</img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif?width=400&amp;name=Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif\" alt=\"flywheel with attract, engage, and delight, spinning and feeding into each other as it shows strangers becoming prospects, customers, and promoters\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>Marketing Funnel Stages</h3> \n<p>Even so, the funnel is still a good starting point before you begin moving to your flywheel strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All you have to do take the buyer’s journey and ask the question: “How do we attract and engage this person so they become a customer?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whether you subscribe to the funnel or the flywheel methodology, earning business from your prospects comes down to three simple things:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Attracting strangers</li> \n <li>Engaging prospects</li> \n <li>Delighting customers</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As you create create content that performs these functions, you'll consider the stage they're at in their journey and the best channels to put the content in front of them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The internet has made it easier for marketers (and salespeople) to engage customers at the various stages of their journey&nbsp;using content marketing.&nbsp;That’s one of the main reasons that<strong><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\"> 60% of marketers</a> consider content as 'very important' or 'extremely important' to their overall strategy.</strong></p> \n<p>However, it can be challenging to create the right content, for the right people, at the right time.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Channels for Each Stage of the Funnel</h2> \n<p>Building a content strategy starts with identifying the channels in which you’ll reach your audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"marketing channels for each stage of your strategy: attract, engage, delight\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Attract Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=attract-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Attract Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you use your expertise to create content and conversations that start meaningful relationships with the right people.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Remember, a large majority of your prospects may even be in the awareness stage of their buyer’s journey when you begin to attract them. That means your goal is to solve for their pains/problems by creating content they can easily discover and consume.</img></p> \n<p>At this point, a buyer is trying to solve problems, get an answer, or meet a need. They’re looking for top-level educational content to help direct them to a solution, like blog posts, social content, and ebooks.&nbsp;Their&nbsp;value as a lead is low because there’s no guarantee that they’ll buy from you. But those who find your content helpful and interesting may journey on to the middle of the funnel.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your attract stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Blogging</li> \n <li>Search Engine Marketing</li> \n <li>Social Media Marketing</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Engage Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/engage-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=engage-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Engage Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you build lasting relationships with people by providing insights and solutions that align with their pain points and goals\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When someone moves into the middle of your funnel, it means you’ve captured their attention. They know they have a problem that has to be solved, and now they’re trying to discover the best solution. The need for a future purchase commitment creeps up as they’re evaluation their options.</p> \n<p>While the top of the funnel is designed to educate a prospect, this is the stage where you want to show why your solutions in particular are the best fit.</p> \n<p>(You also want to help people determine if they're <em>not&nbsp;</em>a good fit, which will be very important later for healthy customer retention. If you convince customers to buy who aren't a good fit for your business in the long run, you could be shooting yourself in the foot in the form of high churn rate later.)</p> \n<p>The middle of the funnel is typically a point of extended engagement where you’re nurturing a lead, building a relationship, and establishing trust between the audience and your brand.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your engage stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Social Media</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You also need to engage prospects at the bottom of your funnel.</p> \n<p>The bottom of the funnel is where someone is making the actual purchase decision. They're ready to&nbsp;buy, but that&nbsp;still doesn’t guarantee that they’re going to buy from <em>you.</em> That’s the last choice they have to make: Where do they get the solution they’re seeking?</p> \n<p>In most cases, leads at the bottom of your funnel just need that final nudge and that compelling call-to-action to get them to make a purchase decision. The right offer and content at this stage can have a dramatic impact on lifting your conversions.</p> \n<p>You might also consider sales outreach to engage qualified prospects and continue to engage them through personalization and contextual marketing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Delight Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/delight-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=delight-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Delight Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you provide an outstanding experience that adds real value, and empowers people to reach their goals and become promoters of your company.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Marketing shouldn’t stop once someone becomes a customer. Cultivating a relationship with your customer beyond the sale can lead to higher customer lifetime value as well as word-of-mouth referrals and more.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The key here is to go above and beyond their expectations and provide a customer experience that’s easy and frictionless.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your delight stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Self-Service Channels Such as Knowledge Bases</li> \n <li>Live Chat and Chatbots for Service</li> \n <li>Loyalty Programs</li> \n</ul> \n<p>On the surface, this process seems really linear, but you can also target multiple stages of the buyer’s journey across channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, you may still be able to attract someone in the consideration stage or delight someone who isn’t a customer yet. Your knowledge base might convince someone in the consideration stage to buy since they perceive that you have great service, or someone in the awareness stage could engage your chatbot to find the content they need.</p> \n<p>One of the joys of content marketing is thinking outside the box.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Creating Content for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Once you have an idea of who your buyer persona is and what channels will work best for your business, you can begin creating content for your buyer at different stages and tailor that content per channel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Doing so can help you <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/customer-journey-map-template\">map your content to the relevant stages of the buyer’s journey</a> to make your funnel.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Top of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"awareness\" stage, where people looking for answers, resources, education, research data, opinions, and insight.</li> \n <li><strong>Middle of the Funnel:&nbsp;</strong>The \"evaluation\" stage, where people are doing heavy research on whether or not your product or service is a good fit for them.</li> \n <li><strong>Bottom of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"purchase\" stage, where people are figuring out exactly what it would take to become a customer.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Your funnel may look very different depending on factors like your industry, business model, product, pricing, and audience.&nbsp;Some B2C customers, for example, spend very little time in the middle of the funnel compared to B2B customers that require far more nurturing, engagement, and relationship development before a purchase is made. A $50 pair of sneakers, for instance, requires a lot less handholding when it comes to making purchase decisions than a $10,000 business software investment.</p> \n<h2>Content Ideas for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Because audiences can vary so widely based on industry and intent, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">persona research is of the utmost importance</a>. Only by understanding their unique process for awareness and evaluation will you be able to create a truly effective content marketing strategy, packed with custom content that best supports their journey toward making a purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg\" alt=\"content ideas for each stage of the buyer's journey: awareness, consideration, decision\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Blog Post&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A blog post is an ideal piece of content targeting the awareness stage. By targeting a pain, problem, or other topic your target audience wants to discover and then posting it to your website, you’re creating a brand asset that’s crawlable by Google and discoverable by search engine users. You can also promote your blog content across other channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg?width=600&amp;name=blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg\" alt=\"blog post example from ahrefs's blog that reads 'how long should blog posts be?'\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/blog-post-length/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Ahrefs is a great example of a brand that does blog content right. They include original data and informational advice to create long-form articles that serve their audience.</p> \n<h3>Social Media Post</h3> \n<p>Social media is a channel that can be used to promote your other content, and you can also create content specifically for the channel. According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/\">Pew Research</a>, 72% of the public uses some form of social media, so it’s likely that your audience is native to this channel. Unlike blog posts, social media posts are likely shorter form, and <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics\">video consumption is also on the rise</a>.</p> \n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6672147901583642624\" width=\"504\" height=\"653\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n<p>In the above example, HubSpot Agency Partner <a href=\"https://www.yokellocal.com/\">Yokel Local</a> shares attractive customer marketing tips on the LinkedIn platform. SlideShare formats are popular on LinkedIn, so the content is created to be snackable with short-form take-aways.</p> \n<h3>Whitepaper&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A whitepaper is an organization’s report or guide on a particular topic. Whitepapers are especially useful as downloadable offers when a reader wants to go more in-depth on a particular subject they’re reading about. For whitepapers, it’s important to provide information that can’t be found elsewhere so that your audience understands the value of the report and is compelled to get it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg?width=518&amp;name=whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg\" alt=\"whitepaper example from hubspot that reads: &quot;not another state of marketing report&quot;\" width=\"518\" style=\"width: 518px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Every year, HubSpot publishes a survey on the state of marketing to provide helpful guidance based on thought leadership to marketers, sales professionals, and business owners. Inside, readers find statistics from a broad survey as well as industry experts’ opinions on what the data means and where the industry is going.</p> \n<h3>Checklist&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>For tasks that are complicated and have a lot of moving parts, individuals may simply want a blueprint that spells out what they’re supposed to do to achieve their end goal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/checklist-example-opendoor.jpg?width=600&amp;name=checklist-example-opendoor.jpg\" alt=\"checklist example from opendoor that reads &quot;the essential checklist for first-time home buyers&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/checklist-for-first-time-home-buyers\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Buying a home is a perfect example of this, and Opendoor meets their audience’s need by providing a handy checklist (in infographic form!) for the reader that spells out all the steps that need to be taken. The graphic is aesthetically pleasing and even allows room for a few tips along the way.</p> \n<h3>How-To Video&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, the best way to solve a pain or problem is to learn a new skill. Sure, a purchase of some kind may be required along the way, but the audience may need to become more informed about the problem and how to solve it. That’s where instructional video content comes in.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 534px; max-height: 300px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.18%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyOqoV90v58?autoplay=0&amp;fs=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0&amp;origin=https://youtubeembedcode.com\" width=\"534\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Whiteboard Fridays is a popular video series by <a href=\"https://moz.com/\">Moz</a> where SEO principles are broken down to the audience in easy-to-understand language and visuals.

In some cases, they may require a little more utility or personalization. That’s why kits and tools are a great piece of content to create to help the reader along their path to purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg\" alt=\"tool example from nerdwallet that reads &quot;the 50/30/20 budget&quot; and is a budget calculator\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/nerdwallet-budget-calculator\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Nerdwallet creates content around several financial topics, budgeting being one of them. It can be difficult to create a budget, though, so they developed a calculator that allows the user to provide their own numbers in order to receive a customized recommendation.</p> \n<h3>Ebook or Tip Sheet&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Similar to whitepapers, ebooks and tip sheets are great options for downloadable content. In contrast, they tend to be shorter form and more actionable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg\" alt=\"tip sheet example from coschedule that reads &quot;180+ power words for writing emotional headlines&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>CoSchedule combines a few tactics by promoting their headline analyzer tool with a <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">blog post about writing great headlines that drive traffic</a>. On that blog post, they include a great <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">tip sheet of powerful words</a> to include in headlines if you want to catch a reader’s attention.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Educational Webinar&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A webinar is a web seminar where information is typically provided through video. A webinar can be prerecorded or streamed live, and this opens up tons of possibilities to disseminate information to an audience who wants more visual and auditory content.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/webinar-example-semrush.jpg?width=600&amp;name=webinar-example-semrush.jpg\" alt=\"semrush's webinar page on their website\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/webinars/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SEMrush makes webinars a key part of their content marketing strategy, often running a valuable topic multiple times to get more mileage out of the content.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Product Comparison Guides</h3> \n<p>In the consideration stage, the buyer persona is still considering solutions to their pain or problem. For this reason, product comparisons are a great way to help them make a decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg?width=600&amp;name=comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg\" alt=\"comparison example from verywell fit that reads &quot;pros and cons of hiit training&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/is-hiit-training-or-steady-state-cardio-better-4126506\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Verywell Fit provides such a comparison to help their readers choose between high-intensity workouts vs. steady-state cardio, providing the pros and cons and use cases for each.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Case Study</h3> \n<p>A case study can be used in both the consideration stage and the decision stage simultaneously by convincing the reader that the solution works by establishing that the provider achieves results for their clients by administering the solution. A good case study will appeal to the emotions and logic of the persona by providing detailed information and quantitative data on the final solution.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg?width=600&amp;name=case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg\" alt=\"case study example from bluleadz that reads &quot;lead generation strategy lands 77 new clients for credit counseling agency&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/case-studies/credit-canada-new-content-offer\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>HubSpot Partner Agency <a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/\">Blueleadz</a> does this by telling a story about their client and the problems they had while providing a detailed account of how they solved it.</p> \n<h3>Free Sample&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A free sample is another example of content or an offer that overlaps between buyer’s journey stages. Consider this: An individual wants to paint the inside of their home, but they don’t know what color.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As they consider which color (the solution), they pick up paint chip cards from their hardware store. These cards are created by a provider based on their individual solution. When the individual falls in love with a color, they already know who the provider is that makes it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg\" alt=\"free sample example from 4colorprint that depicts a pack of sample business cards\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4colorprint.com/sample-request.php\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SILKCARDS taps into this buying behavior by offering samples of their unique printing methods on the content that they create. They know that their business is tactile, and digital content alone is not enough to close a deal. Once their prospective customer holds the sample in their hands, other business cards are put to shame.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Free Trial or Live Demo</h3> \n<p>What better way to know if you want to purchase a product than take it for a spin? Car dealerships have been using the “test drive” tactic for years because it works. If the product itself checks all the boxes the buyer has, all the sales team has to do is handle their objections and make the close.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg\" alt=\"free trial example from hellosign that reads &quot;unlimited signature requests with no hidden fees&quot; and has four pricing tiers, one that's free and two that offer free trials\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://app.hellosign.com/info/pricing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Hellosign does this well. Though they have a free option with limitations, they know that the key to getting clients into their larger tiers is by offering a free trial upfront. Their pricing page sets the prospect’s expectations and points them to the free trial.</p> \n<h3>Consultation Offer&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A consultation is another example of providing just a little bit of service in exchange for the opportunity to close the sale. The best consultation offers reduce the anxiety of entering into a sales conversation by promising something concrete they can walk away with (a strategy or actionable advice) in exchange for their time.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg?width=600&amp;name=consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg\" alt=\"consultation offer from blkbld &amp; co that reads 'for our initial consultation, we will discuss what you are looking to do, your budget, my marketing plans you can execute &amp; lastly the next steps&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blkbld.lpages.co/free-consultation/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Blk Bld &amp; Co.’s consultation offer is a great example because it reduces the friction of scheduling a consultation. By removing friction, this organization increases the chances of conversion.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Coupon</h3> \n<p>A coupon appeals to a fear of missing out (FOMO) mindset. By reducing the price by a certain amount, a coupon is handing a price objection while convincing the prospect that they’re leaving money on the table if they don’t use the coupon. This inertia enough to win the prospect’s business.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg?width=500&amp;name=coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg\" alt=\"coupon example from fragrant jewels in a &quot;spin-to-win&quot; style popup format\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.fragrantjewels.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Fragrant Jewels does this well by gamifying their coupons. By spinning the wheel, the website visitors have the chance to get a coupon before checking out the products. They’ll likely be evaluating the products that are a good deal with the coupon they won.</p> \n<p>In addition to decision stage content, you should also create content to delight your existing customers. This may include FAQ and knowledge base content to make the customer experience easier, coupons for the opportunity to upsell, and additional educative content that deepens their understanding of a topic.</p> \n<h2>Mapping Content Across All Stages of the Funnel and Buying Cycle</h2> \n<p>Every business has a unique sales funnel, sculpted and designed around their buyer’s unique journey.&nbsp;It’s a recipe that can’t necessarily be replicated from one business to another.&nbsp;When creating your own buyer's journey, there are a number of factors specific&nbsp;to your business to take into consideration.</p> \n<p>That said, the general approach remains the same: Understand your audience, develop your funnel around your industry and audience intent, and create a documented content marketing strategy that maps custom content specifically to each phase of their journey through the funnel.</p> \n<p>Do it well, and this process will have the greatest possible impact on your customer relationships, as well as the greatest possible lift in your overall conversions.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2016 and has
