That's a question the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hopes to answer. It has started an engineering analysis after hundreds of customer complaints of bricked systems <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INOA-EA20003-5829.PDF\">resulted in a preliminary investigation in June</a>.</p>\n<p>NHTSA thinks it knows what the problem is: an 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory chip—an SD card in other words—with a finite number of write cycles, fitted to its Media Control Unit. The MCU regularly writes logs to this chip and, within three or four years, reaches the lifetime number of cycles. At this point the touchscreen dies, taking with it functions like the car's backup camera, the ability to defog the windows, and also the audible alerts and chimes for the driver aids and turn signals.</p>\n<p>After the regulator's Office of Defects Investigation received 537 complaints, it asked Tesla if it knew of any more problems with the Nvidia Tegra 3-based system, which is fitted to approximately 158,000 Models S (2012-2018) and X (2016-2018). <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INRL-PE20010-80992P.pdf\">Tesla did</a>, handing over 2,399 complaints and field reports, 7,777 warranty claims, and 4,746 non-warranty claims.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723701#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723701&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=upnPhGGb-AE:mqIERgDDZRE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=upnPhGGb-AE:mqIERgDDZRE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=upnPhGGb-AE:mqIERgDDZRE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=upnPhGGb-AE:mqIERgDDZRE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=upnPhGGb-AE:mqIERgDDZRE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=upnPhGGb-AE:mqIERgDDZRE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 13:12:07 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1263680666-800x411.jpg","linkMd5":"78f587b6aee5bfb404f36dc9295a8d2c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn28@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-30-55-599_bb995a8d7f75fe06.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":411,"sourceBytes":43161,"destBytes":16392,"author":"Jonathan M.

There's been no shortage of opinions about the current raw performance of each company's fastest processors, either. We thought it would be interesting to dive into archived performance benchmarks of the fastest desktop/enthusiast CPUs for each company to get a good overview of how each has really done over the years—and perhaps to even see if there are patterns to be gleaned or to make some bets about the future.</p>\n<p>Before we dive into charts, let's start out with some tables—that way, you can see which CPUs we're using as milestones for each year. While we're at it, there are a couple of irregularities in the data; we'll discuss those also and talk about the things that a simple chart won't show you.</p>\n<h2>Twenty years of enthusiast computing</h2>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Intel Model</strong></td>\n<td><strong>AMD Model</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Notes</strong></td>\n</tr><tr><td>2001</td>\n<td>Pentium 4 2.0GHz (1c/1t)</td>\n<td>Athlon XP 1900+ (1c/1t)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr><tr><td>2002</td>\n<td>Pentium 4 2.8GHz (1c/2t)</td>\n<td>Athlon XP 2800+ (1c/1t)</td>\n<td>Intel introduces hyperthreading</td>\n</tr><tr><td>2003</td>\n<td>Pentium 4 Extreme 3.2GHz (1c/2t)</td>\n<td>Athlon XP 3200+ (1c/1t)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr><tr><td>2004</td>\n<td>Pentium 4 3.4GHz (1c/2t)</td>\n<td>Athlon 64 FX-55 (1c/1t)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr><tr><td>2005</td>\n<td>Pentium 4 3.8GHz (1c/2t)</td>\n<td>Athlon 64 X2 4800+ (2c/2t)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr><tr><td>2006</td>\n<td>Pentium Extreme 965 (2c/4t)</td>\n<td>Athlon 64 X2 5000+ (2c/2t)</td>\n<td>Intel takes the undisputed performance lead here—and keeps it for a decade straight.</td>\n</tr><tr><td>2007</td>\n<td>Core 2 Extreme QX6800 (4c/4t)</td>\n<td>Phenom X4 9600 (4c/4t)</td>\n<td>Intel and AMD both launch the first true quad-core desktop CPUs</td>\n</tr><tr><td>2008</td>\n<td>Core 2 Extreme X9650 (4c/4t)</td>\n<td>Phenom X4 9950 (4c/4t)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr><tr><td>2009</td>\n<td>Core i7-960 (4c/8t)</td>\n<td>Phenom II X4 965 (4c/4t)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr><tr><td>2010</td>\n<td>Core i7-980X (6c/12t)</td>\n<td>Phenom II X6 1100T (6c/6t)</td>\n<td>Intel and AMD both introduce hex-core desktop CPUs</td>\n</tr><tr><td>2011</td>\n<td>Core i7-990X (6c/12t)</td>\n<td>FX-8150 (8c/8t)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr><tr><td>2012</td>\n<td>Core i7-3770K (4c/8t)</td>\n<td>FX-8350 (8c/8t)</td>\n<td>Intel abandons hex-core desktop CPUs—but few miss them, due to large single-threaded gains</td>\n</tr><tr><td>2013</td>\n<td>Core i7-4770K (4c/8t)</td>\n<td>FX-9590 (8c/8t)</td>\n<td>AMD's underwhelming FX-9590 launches—and it's Team Red's last enthusiast CPU for four long years</td>\n</tr><tr><td>2014</td>\n<td>Core i7-4790K (4c/8t)</td>\n<td>FX-9590 (8c/8t)</td>\n<td>Intel's 5th generation Core dies stillborn.

But the surging case numbers are causing many countries to put in place targeted lockdowns and other limits to try to get the pandemic back under control—a move that has sparked a backlash in a lot of places. So, it seems like it's worth asking what the optimal combination of restrictions might be. How do you get the most pandemic control for the least restrictive social environment?</p>\n<p>That's precisely what an international team of researchers attempted to find out, as described in a paper published today. And, while the researchers come up with some potential answers, their paper ends up with an additional message: this is a really hard question to answer. So, to an extent, many countries are going to have to act with imperfect information and hope for the best.</p>\n<h2>How do you answer that?</h2>\n<p>In an ideal world, we'd have some sense of the impact of each possible social restriction: closing restaurants, starting contact tracing, shutting schools, and so on. Given that information, we could look at the rate of infections and the virus's trajectory, then figure out the smallest possible set of restriction that could cause the infection rate to drop. But the real world is very far from this idealized situation at the moment, which is what motivated the researchers to try to provide a bit more certainty regarding the effectiveness of different restrictions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723633#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723633&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 11:45:32 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229639754-800x521.jpg","linkMd5":"8dcd494d56074056cb993fa6950608a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn3@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-30-122_22dec1f007600fef.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":521,"sourceBytes":135658,"destBytes":84976,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229639754-800x521.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn3@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-30-122_22dec1f007600fef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn59@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-31-320_0212a7866bb327ce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn65@2020_2/2020/11/17/16-31-31-520_cd4fc353e4f029ba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn4@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-31-350_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-31-319_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630653759},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:53","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:53","title":"Hands-on with the Apple M1—a seriously fast x86 competitor","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723564","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple_new-m1-chip_11102020-800x539.jpg\" alt=\"Apple's new octa-core ARM big/little CPU is putting its high performance x86 competition on notice.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple_new-m1-chip_11102020.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1320\" data-width=\"1960\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Apple's new octa-core ARM big/little CPU is putting its high performance x86 competition on notice.

And we've got traditional reviews of those devices and their <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/macos-11-0-big-sur-the-ars-technica-review/\">ecosystems</a>, for Apple fans and the Apple-curious. This is not one of those reviews—though reviews are coming imminently for some of the new Macs. Instead, we're going to take a closer look at the raw performance of the new M1 in comparison to more traditional x86 systems.</p>\n<p>The M1's CPU is a 5nm octa-core big/little design, with four performance cores and four efficiency cores. The idea is that user-focused foreground tasks, which demand low latency, will be run on the performance cores—but less latency-sensitive background tasks can run slower and lower on the four less-powerful but less power-consumptive efficiency cores.</p>\n<p>In addition to the eight CPU cores, the version of the M1 in the Mac mini has eight GPU cores, with a total of 128 Execution Units. Although it's extremely difficult to get accurate Apples-to-non-Apples benchmarks on this new architecture, I feel confident in saying that this truly is a world-leading design—you can get faster raw CPU performance, but only on power-is-no-object desktop or server CPUs. Similarly, you can beat the M1's GPU with high-end Nvidia or Radeon desktop cards—but only at a massive disparity in power, physical size, and heat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723564#p3\">Read 33 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723564&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=FjVilKUdxlo:vhMLZV1xtbI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=FjVilKUdxlo:vhMLZV1xtbI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=FjVilKUdxlo:vhMLZV1xtbI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=FjVilKUdxlo:vhMLZV1xtbI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=FjVilKUdxlo:vhMLZV1xtbI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=FjVilKUdxlo:vhMLZV1xtbI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:00:18 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple_new-m1-chip_11102020-800x539.jpg","linkMd5":"5988f9e278670641ef187d00b4d2b5c4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn5@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-10-616_3913492abd29866e.webp","destWidth":760,"destHeight":369,"sourceBytes":23162,"destBytes":11088,"author":"Jim Salter","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Apple_new-m1-chip_11102020-800x539.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn5@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-10-616_3913492abd29866e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=FjVilKUdxlo:vhMLZV1xtbI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn80@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-31-339_36c9e08cd99dfe73.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=FjVilKUdxlo:vhMLZV1xtbI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_1/2020/11/17/16-31-31-889_45b23764190fee7b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn4@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-31-350_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-31-319_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630653755},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:53","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:53","title":"After Trump tweets Defcon hacking video, voting security experts call BS","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723660","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/voting-machines-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"After Trump tweets Defcon hacking video, voting security experts call BS\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/voting-machines.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"667\" data-width=\"1000\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Getty Images)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>As President Trump continues to make unfounded claims of widespread election fraud, 59 of the world’s foremost experts on electronic voting are hitting back, saying that recent allegations of actual voting machine hacking “have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent.”</p>\n<p>Monday’s letter came after almost two weeks of baseless and unfounded claims from Trump and some of his supporters that this month’s presidential election had been “rigged” in favor of President-elect Joe Biden.

Doherty et al/Soft Matter)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Physicists at Leiden University in the Netherlands have created a 3D-printed microscopic version of the USS <em>Voyager</em> from the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise, according to <a href=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/sm/d0sm01320j#!divAbstract\">a recent paper</a> in the journal Soft Matter. These kinds of synthetic \"microswimmers\" are <a href=\"https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/leiden-physicists-use-3d-printed-microswimmers-to-study-water-bacteria-178394/\">of great interest</a> to scientists because they could one day lead to tiny swimming robots for autonomous drug delivery through the bloodstream, or for cleaning wastewater, among other potential applications. Such studies could also shed light on how natural \"microswimmers\" like sperm and bacteria travel through the human body.</p>\n<p>Because of their small size, microswimmers face unique challenges when they move through fluids. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/human-sperm-swim-more-like-otters-than-eels-study-finds/\">we've reported previously</a> in the context of different research, biological microorganisms live in environments with a low so-called <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstl.1883.0029\">Reynolds number</a>—a number that predicts how a fluid will behave based on the variables viscosity, length, and speed. <a href=\"https://aps.org/publications/apsnews/202003/history.cfm\">Named after</a> the 19th-century physicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Reynolds\">Osborne Reynolds</a>, the concept is especially useful for predicting when a fluid will transition to turbulent flow.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, it means that inertial forces (e.g., pushing against the water to propel yourself forward while swimming) are largely irrelevant at very low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces dominate instead. So because bacteria or sperm swim at low Reynolds numbers, they can barely coast any distance at all if you push them to set them in motion. It's akin to a human trying to swim in molasses.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723261#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723261&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 12:46:19 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ministarTOP-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"495f658a8294be67f19f4a6bc1bb83bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn11@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-30-54-256_acfdb05e2813511c.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":13527,"destBytes":7900,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ministarTOP-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn11@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-30-54-256_acfdb05e2813511c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn64@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-31-485_84cc814d2710f113.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-41-450_04a94be0f6242d9e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn4@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-31-350_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-31-319_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630653740},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:53","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:30:53","title":"“Staggering and Tragic”: COVID-19 cases spike in US children, top 1 million","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723747","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1211399560-800x502.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in protective gear leans over a toddler in a bed.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1211399560.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1633\" data-width=\"2600\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Boston Medical Center Child Life Specialist Karlie Bittrich sees to a baby while in a pediatrics tent set up outside of Boston Medical Center in Boston on April 29, 2020.
