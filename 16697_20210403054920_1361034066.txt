Here are a few ways to change things up, with a range of options that will fit nearly any budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Exterior Paint</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While it might seem out of reach, <a href=\"https://jewellcollision.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">auto painting</a> doesn&#8217;t have to cost an arm and a leg. You can create a totally new look for your car on a budget, while also preserving the metal in the frame and keeping it looking like new. At the same time, though it may be tempting to DIY something to save a few hundred dollars, car painting is quite the process and definitely best left to the pros. With multiple jaw-dropping layers of color and finishes, automotive painting is a surefire way to turn your plain car into quite the looker — as long as you let a trained person complete the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Interior Accessories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For a really inexpensive way to take things to the next level, pick up some sleek accessories that will change up the look for cheap. New seat covers, flashy steering wheel covers, or dashboard covers make for a great temporary change of pace. Some accessories are universal, while others may need to be tailored to your car, so be sure to choose ones that accommodate your vehicle&#8217;s unique needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Classy Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To really take your car over the edge, why not add something fun? Neon decals, underglow, shiny rims or even the classic fuzzy dice are a great way to add an element of fun on a range of budgets. What more could you want?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making your car look like the car of your dreams (even on a less than dreamy budget) can be a reality for you, as long as you have a little creativity. With these ideas, you can easily take your car from an eyesore to a beauty.</p>The post <a href=\"https://www.1bao.org/3-ways-to-spice-up-your-cars-look.html\">3 Ways To Spice Up Your Car’s Look</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.1bao.org\">Automotive News and Tips</a>.","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 03 Feb 2021 01:22:13 +0000","feedId":16697,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5893e55ba09fbb34afbfc548b3a922f9","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"admin","publishedOrCreatedDate":1617428960175}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 13:49:20","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 13:49:20","feedId":16697,"fetchDate":"Sat, 03 Apr 2021 05:49:20 +0000","fetchMs":70462,"handleMs":82531,"totalMs":154673,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"14a4a6ed01548690114ab4420d6e8c39","hostName":"us-002*","requestId":"c3732c1918eb49ecae9899702c68b1e8_16697","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:13:25","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 12:50:29","id":16697,"name":"Automotive News and Tips","url":"http://www.1bao.org/?feed=rss2","subscriber":200,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.1bao.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn75@2020_4/2021/04/03/05-49-18-250_bc5cf06d27966036.png","description":"Blog Focus on Automotive News and Tips","weekly":null,"link":"https://www.1bao.org"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1617428805505,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":72140,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":82531,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
