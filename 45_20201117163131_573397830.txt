But the surging case numbers are causing many countries to put in place targeted lockdowns and other limits to try to get the pandemic back under control—a move that has sparked a backlash in a lot of places. So, it seems like it's worth asking what the optimal combination of restrictions might be. How do you get the most pandemic control for the least restrictive social environment?</p>\n<p>That's precisely what an international team of researchers attempted to find out, as described in a paper published today. And, while the researchers come up with some potential answers, their paper ends up with an additional message: this is a really hard question to answer. So, to an extent, many countries are going to have to act with imperfect information and hope for the best.</p>\n<h2>How do you answer that?</h2>\n<p>In an ideal world, we'd have some sense of the impact of each possible social restriction: closing restaurants, starting contact tracing, shutting schools, and so on. Given that information, we could look at the rate of infections and the virus's trajectory, then figure out the smallest possible set of restriction that could cause the infection rate to drop. But the real world is very far from this idealized situation at the moment, which is what motivated the researchers to try to provide a bit more certainty regarding the effectiveness of different restrictions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723633#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723633&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 11:45:32 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229639754-800x521.jpg","linkMd5":"8dcd494d56074056cb993fa6950608a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-28-436_22dec1f007600fef.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":521,"sourceBytes":135658,"destBytes":84976,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229639754-800x521.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn99@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-28-436_22dec1f007600fef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn19@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-29-839_9506b5f9f7d2633a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=e9TVLmR40E8:W2nO91XP9aI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn38@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-29-830_a091c28026bc4d7a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn30@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-29-691_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn32@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-29-795_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630664691},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:04","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:04","title":"Tiny version of USS Voyager sheds light on physics of microswimmers","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723261","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ministarTOP-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"SEM image of a 3D-printed microscopic version of the USS &#60;em&#62;Voyager&#60;/em&#62;, a fictional Intrepid class starship from the Star Trek franchise.

Doherty et al/Soft Matter)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Physicists at Leiden University in the Netherlands have created a 3D-printed microscopic version of the USS <em>Voyager</em> from the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise, according to <a href=\"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/sm/d0sm01320j#!divAbstract\">a recent paper</a> in the journal Soft Matter. These kinds of synthetic \"microswimmers\" are <a href=\"https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/leiden-physicists-use-3d-printed-microswimmers-to-study-water-bacteria-178394/\">of great interest</a> to scientists because they could one day lead to tiny swimming robots for autonomous drug delivery through the bloodstream, or for cleaning wastewater, among other potential applications. Such studies could also shed light on how natural \"microswimmers\" like sperm and bacteria travel through the human body.</p>\n<p>Because of their small size, microswimmers face unique challenges when they move through fluids. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/human-sperm-swim-more-like-otters-than-eels-study-finds/\">we've reported previously</a> in the context of different research, biological microorganisms live in environments with a low so-called <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstl.1883.0029\">Reynolds number</a>—a number that predicts how a fluid will behave based on the variables viscosity, length, and speed. <a href=\"https://aps.org/publications/apsnews/202003/history.cfm\">Named after</a> the 19th-century physicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Reynolds\">Osborne Reynolds</a>, the concept is especially useful for predicting when a fluid will transition to turbulent flow.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, it means that inertial forces (e.g., pushing against the water to propel yourself forward while swimming) are largely irrelevant at very low Reynolds numbers, where viscous forces dominate instead. So because bacteria or sperm swim at low Reynolds numbers, they can barely coast any distance at all if you push them to set them in motion. It's akin to a human trying to swim in molasses.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723261#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723261&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 12:46:19 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ministarTOP-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"495f658a8294be67f19f4a6bc1bb83bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn4@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-13-451_acfdb05e2813511c.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":13527,"destBytes":7900,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ministarTOP-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn4@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-13-451_acfdb05e2813511c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-29-814_8d518667276c0f31.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LDeUSrl7YXk:O26ZNFelHug:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn22@2020_3/2020/11/17/16-31-29-738_1a3401eff944dde2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn30@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-29-691_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn32@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-29-795_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630664691},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:04","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:04","title":"“Staggering and Tragic”: COVID-19 cases spike in US children, top 1 million","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1723747","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1211399560-800x502.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in protective gear leans over a toddler in a bed.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1211399560.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1633\" data-width=\"2600\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Boston Medical Center Child Life Specialist Karlie Bittrich sees to a baby while in a pediatrics tent set up outside of Boston Medical Center in Boston on April 29, 2020.
