Leaks have exposed some of the agency&#8217;s most clandestine intelligence gathering operations. But the important role of the spy agency in securing the nation&#8217;s cybersecurity defenses can go overlooked.</p>\n<p>Neuberger took the helm at the NSA&#8217;s newly created Cybersecurity Directorate <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/Article/1977307/nsa-names-anne-neuberger-new-deputy-national-manager/\">a year ago</a> as part of the agency&#8217;s renewed effort disrupt foreign adversaries and help Americans to stay secure. She previously served as the NSA&#8217;s first chief risk officer.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>As much of the NSA works in secret by collecting intelligence on foreign adversaries and disrupting threats to the U.S. homeland, Neuberger&#8217;s division works on the defensive side. It&#8217;s there that the NSA has unique insights into some of the biggest threats that the public and private sector faces, and uses that information to help protect the nation&#8217;s most critical infrastructure and systems from disruption.</p>\n<p>In the past year since the directorate was launched, the NSA called out nation-state hackers, warned of new strains of disruptive malware, and advised on how to patch or mitigate major vulnerabilities. Or, in other words, getting unclassified but actionable information to the network defenders who need it.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll hear from Neuberger how the agency is balancing spycraft and intelligence gathering with defensive cybersecurity at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2020/tickets/?utm_medium=editpost&#38;utm_campaign=disruptsf2020&#38;utm_content=nsa&#38;utm_source=tc&#38;promo=nsapost&#38;display=TRUE\">Disrupt 2020</a> on September 14-18.

No surprise, really, given the massive revenue some top athletes are able to generate.<a href=\"https://teammstrd.com/\"> Mustard</a> is working to supplant — or at least augment — some of that pricey coaching with the launch of a new mobile app designed to analyze an athlete’s mechanics and offer corrective tips to help them improve.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The company was co-founded by Tom House, a former reliever whose coaching career has earned him the reputation as one the “father[s] of modern pitching mechanics.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Too many kids miss out on the power of play and the many physical and mental benefits of sports—studies show that 70% of kids stop playing sports by the age of 13 due to cost and lack of access to quality coaching. Mustard offers every kid access to the same coaching programs and extensive biomechanical analysis used by the best athletes in the world, and the same personalized training protocols that I use with the Hall of Famers I see in person,” House says in a release tied to the news. “We want to make elite personalized coaching accessible to all.”</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/csTuK3henxw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mustard announced this week that it has raised $1.7 million to improve its tool, led by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/shasta-ventures\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shasta-ventures\">Shasta Ventures <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Intersect VC, along with a number of angel investors, including David Novak and Mike Dixon, and all-star athletes Nolan Ryan and Drew Brees. Ryan, in fact, has become one of the main faces of the company, gracing its home page, along with a color scheme that appears inspired by his days with the Astros.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The name isn’t great. It’s a reference to the phrase “put some mustard on it” — which refers to the act of adding a bit of an edge to a throw.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The app is opening up for a limited, free public beta, focused solely on baseball to start. “The product will be entirely free at first,” CEO Rocky Collins tells TechCrunch. “Over time, we will add premium features for a low monthly subscription. Even when premium features are added, we plan to continue to offer a free version of the app that offers tremendous value to users.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The system relies on the smartphone’s camera and then uses proprietary AI algorithms to monitor the player’s motion and approximate human athletic coaching. For the baseball side of things, the company has employed engineers from Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM). Future sports will be added at some point down the road.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ySApXEEU4gE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 14:00:19 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"44c297b002708a539824a80f8b83b5bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn81@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-00-377_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn33@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-358_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn25@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-261_e1beabed7e9a200f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ySApXEEU4gE:zEitNL18jK8:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn26@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-38-00-971_eacf38a4f98f3f55.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-38-00-315_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ySApXEEU4gE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn85@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-38-00-311_23e7698a83ebd391.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237447356},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","title":"Teemyco creates virtual offices so you can grab a room and talk with colleagues","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2039730","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Meet <a href=\"https://teemyco.com\">Teemyco</a>, a Stockholm-based startup that wants to reproduce office interactions in a virtual environment. The company wants to foster spontaneous interactions and casual collaboration with a room-based interface. Each employee moves from one room to another just like in a physical office.</p>\n<p>If you’re no longer working from an office, chances are you rely heavily on email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet or a combination of all those tools. While those tools work perfectly fine for what they’re designed to achieve, many companies feel like important information is getting lost. It’s harder to bump into a colleague next to the coffee machine and ask a quick question.</p>\n<p>With Teemyco, each person is working in a virtual room. By default, you work in the lobby. You can consider it as an open space with multiple desks. When you want to get together for a planned or unplanned meeting, you can pull someone from the lobby and create another room.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In that room, you can start an audio call or a video call. You can see your colleagues in the corner of your screen and stay focused on a document at the same time, or you can put a video call in full screen. When someone is done, they can leave the room.</p>\n<p>Those interactions are less formal than what you get with video-conferencing services. You don’t have to send a link to a Zoom room, you don’t have to send a calendar invite. People hop in and hop out.</p>\n<p>If you’re working on something important, you can move to a focus room so that you don’t get interrupted every 15 minutes. Other people won’t be able to pull you from your virtual desk. If you have to run some errands, you can also put yourself in a room that says you’re not there — those rooms can act as a status.</p>\n<p>Teemyco also helps you work next to your favorite colleague. You can create a room and use a walkie-talkie feature for quick interactions throughout the day. And, of course, you can create a break room for non-work-related discussions.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IsYtBd-aUxc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>Teemyco is still a young company. The product is only available in beta. The company raised a $1 million seed round led by Luminar Ventures with Antler, Gazella and various business angels also participating.</p>\n<p>It’s also not going to work for all companies. I’m not sure it scales well for a company with hundreds of employees, for instance. Introverts might not be fans of real-time communication either.</p>\n<p>If you’re a remote-first company, you know that it’s important to have a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/how-a-culture-of-transparency-helps-you-manage-a-remote-team/\">culture of transparency</a>. And written information is always more transparent than video conferences.</p>\n<p>And yet, depending on your corporate culture, something like Teemyco can be useful. It can augment information stored in shared documents and internal communication tools.</p>\n<p>It’s an interesting product that proves that the inevitable debate between physical offices and remote teams is not a binary problem.

It isn&#8217;t open to the public, however; it&#8217;s a new fulfillment center.</p>\n<p>“Grocery delivery continues to be one of the fastest-growing businesses at Amazon,” the company said in a statement about the location, noting that it has hired hundreds of new employees to aid in its operations. “We’re thrilled to increase access to grocery delivery.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Americans sort of knew this was coming. Still, the pace at which buildings of all sizes are being either built or converted into e-commerce fulfillment centers &#8212; and closer to city centers &#8212; has become a bit breathtaking. According to the commercial real estate services firm CBRE, since 2017 at least 59 projects in the U.S. have centered on converting 14 million square feet of retail space into 15.5 million square feet of industrial space, and that trend is &#8220;absolutely going to continue,&#8221; says Matthew Walaszek, an associate director of industrial and logistics research at CBRE.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>It has played out fairly quietly to date, save for the occasional headline about, well, Amazon, typically. Last month, for example, The Wall Street Journal reported that the ever-expanding conglomerate is in talks with the largest mall owner in the U.S., Simon Property Group, about converting both former and current JCPenney and Sears stores into distribution hubs from which it can deliver its products more quickly.</p>\n<p>Amazon needs the space. Meanwhile, Simon needs a tenant that can pay its bills. That&#8217;s a tall order right now for many brick-and-mortar retailers that were already under pressure and watched foot traffic disappear entirely as the country largely shut down in March in response to the pandemic threat.</p>\n<p>In fact, despite that Simon recently partnered with another outfit to <a class=\"icon none\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/authentic-brands-simon-venture-to-buy-brooks-brothers-for-325-million-11597200554\">buy retailers </a>Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brand out of bankruptcy (Simon and fellow mall operator Brookfield are also reportedly <a class=\"icon none\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-c-penney-landlords-nearing-bankruptcy-deal-11597271496\">in advanced talks</a> to buy J.C. Penney), some view the moves as a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/simon-the-biggest-u-s-mall-owner-shows-two-sides-innovator-and-traditionalist-11597752001\">means to buy time</a> as it reconfigures its properties to accommodate one anchor tenant.</p>\n<p>That exact scenario has already played out at Randall Park Mall in a Northeast Ohio suburb (a mall, incidentally, that this editor occasionally frequented as a teenager growing up in Cleveland). Once filled with gaudy stores like Piercing Pagoda and Spencer&#8217;s Gifts, the mall &#8212; among the world&#8217;s largest enclosed shopping centers when it opened in 1976 &#8212; is now the site of an 855,000-square-foot facility filled with mobile robotic fulfillment systems.</p>\n<p>A local outlet reported its conveyor belts would <a href=\"https://fox8.com/news/see-inside-amazon-fulfillment-center-in-north-randall-for-first-time/\">stretch farther than 10 miles</a> if laid in a straight line.</p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t always Amazon that&#8217;s snapping up these properties, of course. There are a number of other large e-commerce players that are rapidly expanding their physical footprint right now, along with opportunistic developers betting the U.S. will also focus more on domestic manufacturing facilities in a post-COVID world.</p>\n<p>There are also other big grocery chains that, like Amazon&#8217;s Whole Foods, are increasingly focused on developing fulfillment centers &#8212; sometimes right inside a store that sees foot traffic. At an Albertson&#8217;s in South San Francisco, for example, customers blithely shop around an automated rack-and-tote system at the store&#8217;s center that preps orders for pickup and delivery.</p>\n<p>To a certain extent, this ongoing shift in use was inevitable. The U.S. has the strange distinction of featuring 24 square feet of retail space per capita. By comparison, Canada and Australia have 16.8 square feet and 11.2 square feet per capita, respectively. &#8220;We just have a lot of retail &#8212; we are over-retailed &#8212; so it&#8217;s not surprising that properties are struggling,&#8221; Walaszek says.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has only poured figurative fuel on fire. Forbes estimates that upwards of <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2020/07/06/9274-stores-are-closing-in-2020--its-the-pandemic-and-high-debt--more-will-close/#422f517c729f\">14,000</a> real-world retail stores will close in the U.S. this year. Meanwhile, during the first six months of the year, consumers spent $347.26 billion online with U.S. retailers, up <a href=\"https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2020/08/25/ecommerce-during-coronavirus-pandemic-in-charts/\">30.1%</a> from $266.84 billion for the same period in 2019, according to U.S. Department of Commerce data parsed by the news and research outfit Digital Commerce.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still a niche trend &#8212; retail properties being converted to industrial use. While 14 million square feet has been converted in recent years, it&#8217;s a drop in the bucket compared with the 14.5 billion square feet of industrial real estate in the U.S.</p>\n<p>That won&#8217;t change overnight, either. For one thing, retail-to-industrial conversions involve buy-in from local zoning officials whose constituents are often concerned about congestion, noise and pollution, among other things. Retail rents are also significantly higher than industrial rents &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.reit.com/data-research/research/nareit-research/estimating-size-commercial-real-estate-market-us\">more than double</a> in some markets &#8212; so it&#8217;s &#8220;a hard sell to a retail landlord to convert to industrial where revenues aren&#8217;t going to be as high,&#8221; notes Walaszek.</p>\n<p>Still, thanks to a confluence of events &#8212; from a battering of the broader retail industry to the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/07/06/amazon-stock-highest-price-company-worth/5384673002/\">runaway growth</a> of Amazon specifically &#8212; both big and small fulfillment centers are beginning to spring up and fast.</p>\n<p>As Amazon&#8217;s first &#8220;permanent online-only&#8221; Whole Foods in Brooklyn underscores, they may wind up in what seem like the unlikeliest of places, too.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/PJPgvy0EYqU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 05:09:55 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"ff70c1e8633ccc0461d43a8b2b0825b9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Connie Loizos","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn81@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-00-377_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn33@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-358_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-38-00-858_e88faae4ce8e199c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=PJPgvy0EYqU:n8EIw7E-1vQ:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn50@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-00-161_38006bc412b7fd16.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-38-00-315_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/PJPgvy0EYqU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn5@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-37-59-445_e504df197b7ed07c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237447381},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","title":"Nintendo is remaking the first portable gaming system it ever built","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2039920","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Quick, what was the first portable gaming system <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/nintendo\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"nintendo\">Nintendo <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> made?</p>\n<p>If you said &#8220;Game Boy&#8221;&#8230; solid guess, but not quite.

As we&#8217;ve noted that some tech shares have taken lumps when their growth has underwhelmed investors, perhaps we&#8217;re seeing the entire SaaS sector see their growth expectations slip?</p>\n<p>Bulls may say that the above declines are merely a few weeks&#8217; gains and that the accelerated digital transformation is still a key tailwind for SaaS. Bears may say that this is the start of a real correction in the value of tech shares that had become simply too expensive for their fundamentals. What we can say with confidence is that software shares are in a technical correction, and other equities cohorts that we care about are not far behind.</p>\n<p>Monday is an off day for stocks. Let&#8217;s see what happens Tuesday and if the bleeding stops or simply keeps on letting.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8aLcGz0aGqQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 15:30:22 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"125a79a265dcccfca4f6ded4ba92d4a4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn81@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-00-377_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn33@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-358_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn37@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-38-00-200_9a6dcdfe7303d96e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8aLcGz0aGqQ:LnB5o-v-dIQ:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn46@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-59-264_90400c068db6075d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-38-00-315_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8aLcGz0aGqQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn14@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-317_d1dbb6ae1eab482b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237447360},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","title":"Low-cost fitness bands see a resurgence in interest amid the pandemic","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2040137","description":"<p class=\"p1\">While wearable fitness devices saw an uptick in shipments in North America for Q2, the overall dollar amount of the market remained steady, according to new numbers <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-north-american-wearables-market-Q2-2020?ctid=1596-7cfff417af884cef4049d3c46eb72c6c\">out of Canalys</a>.

The workout tech company is planning both a cheaper, entry-level smart treadmill, and a higher-end version of its stationary exercise bike, with an announcement set to take place as early as sometime next week in time for its quarterly financial earnings.</p>\n<p>The new products would come alongside a price drop for its existing exercise bike, to a price point under $1,900 according to the report. While the new &#8216;Bike+&#8217; will retail for more than the current price of the existing model, the price drop will help Peloton stoke the high demand for its products resulting from the closure of gyms and social distancing measures instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>Peloton&#8217;s new &#8216;Tread&#8217; treadmill will retail for under $3,000, according to Bloomberg&#8217;s sources, which is a considerable discount vs. the $4,295 asking price for the existing model. That one will remain on sale as a premium offering, and the new version will reportedly more closely resemble a traditional home treadmill in terms of materials and construction, allowing for the cheaper asking price.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>The new, upscale Bike+ model will also reportedly feature a repositionable smart display, which will help it serve as the centerpiece of a more comprehensive home gym that includes strength training and other kinds of guided workouts. Peloton&#8217;s hardware products are what helped distinguish it in the exercise market, but it has built another strong business on subscription plans and app-guided workouts, which are available with or without its home gym equipment.</p>\n<p>The new treadmill will likely go to market before the upgraded smart bike, in terms of availability, according to the report. Peloton&#8217;s main blocker for customer base expansion is probably its relatively high point of entry, in terms of its in-house hardware, so that makes a lot of sense if the company is looking to capitalize on general consumer appetite for at-home fitness solutions during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/YAIxUxpu4jo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 12:11:53 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"0b87666bdfea8d18be99b76cc8147625","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn81@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-00-377_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn33@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-358_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn69@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-59-285_2fa1164c856c499c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=YAIxUxpu4jo:DpOFDidc6Gc:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn2@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-458_45be53113718f417.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-38-00-315_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/YAIxUxpu4jo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn41@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-00-307_129b3308c558b132.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237447362},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","title":"Edtech is the new SaaS","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2039647","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><iframe src=\"https://player.simplecast.com/2e046f84-6e17-49e0-820e-055d95fac68f?dark=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200px\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA\">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/equitypod\">now on Twitter!</a>), where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>\n<p>The whole crew was back, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmasc_\">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dannycrichton\">Danny Crichton</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alex\">myself</a> chattering, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cgates123\">Chris Gates</a> behind the scenes making it all work.

Palantir’s model is unique in allowing founders to have a commanding vote even if they were to sell their shares — in other words, voting power without underlying shareholder power, in direct contradiction to modern shareholder theory.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>That strange controlling provision has clearly caught the attention of the SEC and the NYSE. <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520239121/d904406ds1a.htm__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!UtBBEELH8SA292yH_6-3pddnI0eY9GWCGZfbQl_6Q0YuieR16cEJCHWVbFdOleQ$ \">In an amended S-1 filing with the SEC</a> submitted this afternoon, Palantir made changes to its documents that made clear that its corporate governance will be more opaque far after its public debut.</p>\n<p>First, Palantir has added a new risk factor to its original prospectus, which we will copy here in full because it really tells you a lot about where the company is headed on corporate governance:</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Although we currently are not considered to be a “controlled company” under the NYSE corporate governance rules, we may in the future become a controlled company due to the concentration of voting power among our Founders and their affiliates.</b></p>\n<p>Although we currently are not considered to be a “controlled company” under the NYSE corporate governance rules, we may in the future become a controlled company due to the concentration of voting power among our Founders and their affiliates resulting from the issuance of our Class F common stock. See “<i>—The multiple class structure of our common stock, together with the Founder Voting Trust Agreement and the Founder Voting Agreement, have the effect of concentrating voting power with certain stockholders, in particular, our Founders and their affiliates, which will effectively eliminate your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.</i>” above. A “controlled company” pursuant to the NYSE corporate governance rules is a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group, or another company. In the event that our Founders or other stockholders acquire more than 50% of the voting power of the Company, we may in the future be able to rely on the “controlled company” exemptions under the NYSE corporate governance rules due to this concentration of voting power and the ability of our Founders and their affiliates to act as a group. If we were a controlled company, we would be eligible to and could elect not to comply with certain of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Such standards include the requirement that a majority of directors on our board of directors are independent directors and the requirement that our compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee consist entirely of independent directors. In such a case, if the interests of our stockholders differ from the group of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power, our stockholders would not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance standards, and the ability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and corporate matters may be reduced.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, public shareholders in the company will likely legally have zero input into the governance of the company. The key line here is “If we were a controlled company, we would be eligible to and could elect not to comply with certain of the NYSE corporate governance standards.”</p>\n<p>Will Palantir be a controlled company? The answer is almost certainly yes, given another subtle change the company made in its amended filing today.</p>\n<p>In its original filing, the company wrote that the Class F stock given to Karp, Cohen and Thiel “will give these Founders the ability to control <i>up to</i> 49.999999% of the total voting power of our capital stock” (emphasis mine). Now in its restated filing, the company notes that the shares “will give these Founders the ability to control up to 49.999999% of the total voting power of our capital stock, <i>and the Founders may, in certain circumstances, have voting power that, in the aggregate, exceeds 49.999999%</i>” (emphasis again mine).</p>\n<p>The reason of course is that Karp, Cohen and Thiel own other classes of shares that when added to these special Class F “founder” shares, will give them a controlling stake in the company.</p>\n<p>According to the filing, these new Class F shares were approved by existing shareholders on August 24. In the company’s prospectus sent to existing shareholders (a leaked copy of which was obtained by TechCrunch), the company explained across more than a dozen pages the rationale and the timeline for why existing shareholders should approve not having any further say in their company’s governance.</p>\n<p>Given the diminished voting power of employee and investor shares, it is possible that these voting provisions will negatively impact the final price of those shares.</p>\n<p>The company in its amended filing noted that it has finally determined that Alexander Moore, Spencer Rascoff and Alexandra Schiff, who were recently hired as new independent directors of the company, are in fact independent.</p>\n<p>That said, Palantir also admitted that it doesn’t intend to have independent governance for a while at the company.

A logical sequel to Tetris 99, which applied a similar transformation to everyone&#8217;s favorite block-based puzzler, and potentially a lot of fun.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_YwN8uRQac?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>But when it came to bringing fan favorites from the N64 and GameCube to the Switch, the company left much to be desired.</p>\n<p>Nintendo&#8217;s approach to resurrecting its back catalog has been haphazard: Giving away NES and SNES games for free to Nintendo Online subscribers is a nice bonus in a way, but many players have already paid for those games on previous consoles, perhaps multiple times. Why, players have asked, can&#8217;t someone just bring their purchase of Kid Icarus over from the Wii&#8217;s Virtual Console to the Switch and play it without a subscription? Nintendo has never provided a good answer to this; in the SNES Mini it has provided an excellent alternative — though of course it means buying the game yet again.</p>\n<p>The question on countless players&#8217; minds was: Will Nintendo add N64 titles to the library of past-generation games for anyone to access, or gussy them up and sell them separately? With both Mario and Zelda&#8217;s 35th anniversaries approaching, this was a very material concern.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, Nintendo has somehow threaded the needle with a solution seemingly made to leave everyone wanting something more.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2039947\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2039947\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2039947\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg 1788w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg?resize=768,405 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg?resize=1536,810 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2039947\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ninendo</p></div></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://supermario3dallstars.nintendo.com/\">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection includes Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy, from the N64, GameCube and Wii respectively, and has a full-size $60 price tag. These are all great games, obviously. But being classics doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s no way to update them for modern audiences.</p>\n<p>Take Mario 64. Universally beloved and hugely influential, it is nevertheless a bit long in the tooth in some ways. But the Mario 64 in All-Stars is only brought up to the barest standard of playability on modern consoles: It works with current Switch controllers and runs at an updated resolution. They didn&#8217;t even bother changing the original 4:3 aspect ratio!</p>\n<p>Amazingly, Nintendo didn&#8217;t even include the substantial upgrades it made itself for the DS re-release of the game. As with the original All-Stars for SNES, which included re-drawn sprites and other improvements, this was an opportunity to show the quality of these games while also doing right by fans who have for years had to resort to emulators and mods to make the games suitable for 21st-century consumption.</p>\n<p>Instead Nintendo has opted to do the absolute minimum while charging the absolute maximum. What&#8217;s more, there seems to be some kind of limited availability that the company hasn&#8217;t quite made clear — what goes on sale in a couple weeks will only be available until March of next year. Then what? Nintendo hasn&#8217;t said. (I&#8217;ve asked for clarification and will update this article if I hear back.)</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2039948\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2039948\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2039948\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg 1993w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg?resize=768,407 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg?resize=1536,815 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2039948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>\n<p>Long-time customers will not be surprised by Nintendo&#8217;s oblique strategy and seeming lack of ambition here. The company has institutionalized a unique combination of extreme conservatism and eye-popping risk-taking. Overdeliver with one hand and underdeliver with the other is Nintendo&#8217;s approach, and it was hoped by many players that the former hand would be the one with the Mario anniversary content in it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s troubling not simply because there&#8217;s one game that doesn&#8217;t justify its price tag good value, but because it signals an underwhelming approach to the entire library of Nintendo classics. With the 35th anniversary of other beloved franchises on the horizon — Zelda and Metroid, for a start — it is a legitimate worry that Nintendo may likewise let down the fan base.</p>\n<p>Sure, it may sound a bit like the notorious entitlement expressed by gamers over things like microtransactions, exclusivity agreements and so on. But with Nintendo and these very important titles from its vault, expectations are justifiably different.</p>\n<p>With almost no releases on third-party platforms and an aggressive approach to shutting down what it views as IP offenses, Nintendo exercises an iron grip over its content, especially its crown jewels, Mario and Zelda. If we are ever to receive an improved version of Mario 64, or Sunshine, or for that matter Ocarina of Time, not to speak of dozens of other classics, Nintendo is the only one that can provide it.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TRgFDDO3Mf\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-remake-is-a-classic-well-worth-revisiting/\">&#8216;Link&#8217;s Awakening&#8217; remake is a classic well worth revisiting</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;&#8216;Link&#8217;s Awakening&#8217; remake is a classic well worth revisiting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-remake-is-a-classic-well-worth-revisiting/embed/#?secret=TRgFDDO3Mf\" data-secret=\"TRgFDDO3Mf\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Sometimes that means a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-remake-is-a-classic-well-worth-revisiting/\">beautiful total redo of a game like Link&#8217;s Awakening</a>. But at other times it means we must make do with scraps from the table, as with the arbitrary trickle of NES and SNES games coming to Nintendo Switch Online (itself a bundle of scraps compared with other console subscriptions, it must be said). Everyone right now is thinking that the inevitable Zelda collection will be equally bare bones (and expensive).</p>\n<p>The dream players have for decades cherished for example, a multiplayer Mario 64, will never emerge in the wilds of the internet because Nintendo will swoop in with a cease and desist in record time. So they must rely on the company to make those dreams come true, and it is remarkably inconsistent in doing so.</p>\n<p>The treasure chest of games Nintendo has just opened the lid on is potentially a source for years of content and will partly define the company&#8217;s overarching strategy going forward. But it makes gamers nervous to see Nintendo aiming at their wallets instead of their hearts. Usually it&#8217;s at least both.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/YmRMAmtVPOA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 22:45:18 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg","linkMd5":"b4389ea8e0d13856cf7b2401fa79c285","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn8@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-35-841_3126669a11b6ee67.webp","destWidth":1788,"destHeight":943,"sourceBytes":560347,"destBytes":173300,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn8@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-35-841_3126669a11b6ee67.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-64-switch.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn66@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-59-403_95fa73eb2200c118.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn81@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-00-377_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn33@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-358_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn13@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-37-59-301_ed0b7e966de6c102.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=YmRMAmtVPOA:p38O6PHfV80:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn73@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-59-316_af86219b31868e22.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-38-00-315_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/YmRMAmtVPOA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn34@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-00-187_82010a9c655f1e73.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237447383},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","title":"WhatsApp reveals six previously undisclosed vulnerabilities on new security site","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2039855","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Facebook-owned <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"whatsapp\">WhatsApp <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has revealed six previously undisclosed vulnerabilities, which the company has now fixed.

Hence Mountain View&#8217;s dialled-up attention to detail.</span></p>\n<p>The lion&#8217;s share of Google&#8217;s submission focuses on lobbying against the prospect of ex ante regulation for such platform giants &#8212; something the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-commission\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"european-commission\">European Commission <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has nonetheless signalled is front of mind as it looks at how to rein in platform power.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>This type of regulation intervention aims to identify competitive problems and shape responses &#8216;before the event&#8217; via the application of obligations on players who hold significant market power vs after the fact competition enforcement when market harm has been established.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A blanket approach to ex ante competition regulation could have unintended consequences on user experience as well as multiplying costs for European businesses,&#8221; it writes, urging lawmakers to take a long, hard look at existing regulation to see if it&#8217;s not able to do the job of ensuring markets are &#8220;working properly&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Where the evidence shows meaningful gaps, the next step ought to be to consider how one can modernise those existing rules and procedures to address the underlying concerns before turning to consideration of new and distinct regulatory frameworks,&#8221; it adds.</p>\n<p>If EU lawmakers must go ahead with ex ante regulation of platforms giants, Google &#8212; an adtech giant &#8212; is especially keen that they do <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">not single out any specific business models. So</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> it definitely wouldn&#8217;t be a fan of ex ante regs applied only to surveillance-fuelled ad-targeting platforms. Funny that. </span></p>\n<p>&#8220;The criteria for identifying ‘gatekeeper power’ should be independent of the particular business model that a platform uses, making no distinction as between platforms that operate business models based on advertising, subscriptions, sales commissions, or sales of hardware,&#8221; Google writes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Digital platforms often operate using different business and monetization strategies, across multiple markets, geographies, and sectors, with varying degrees of competitive strength in each. Regulators should not favor or discriminate against any business, business model, or technology from the outset,&#8221; it goes on.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In certain sectors, the platform may have market power; in others, it may be a new entrant or marginal player. The digital ecosystem is extremely diverse and evolving rapidly and it would be misguided for gatekeeper designations to be evaluated by reference to the position of an entire company or corporate group.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nor should lawmakers opt for what Google dubs &#8220;an overly simplistic&#8221; assessment of what constitutes a gatekeeper &#8212; giving the example of number of users as an inadequate way to determine whether a platform giant has significant market power in a given moment. (Relevant: Google market share of search in Europe exceeds 90%.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Recent competition enforcement demonstrates the range of platforms that have been found to have market power (e.g., Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple) and other platforms may be found to have market power in the future (borne out, for example, by the UK CMA’s investigation into online auction platform services),&#8221; it writes. &#8220;The gatekeeper assessment should therefore recognize that a range of platforms &#8212; operating a range of different business models (e.g., ad-funded, subscription-based, commission-based, hardware sales) &#8212; may hold ‘market power’ in different circumstances and vis-à-vis different platform participants.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The tech giant can also be seen pushing a familiar talking point when <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/\">its business is accused of profiting, parasitically, off of others&#8217; content</a> &#8212; by suggesting that when regulators are assessing whether a platform is a gatekeeper or not by considering the economic dependence of traditional businesses on a limited number of online platforms they should look favorably on those platforms &#8220;through which a materially significant proportion of business (e.g. in the form of highly valuable traffic) is channeled&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But of course it would say that clicks are just as good as all the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/big-tech-crushes-q2-earnings-expectations/\">ad dollars it&#8217;s making</a>.</p>\n<p>Google is also pushing for regular review of any gatekeeper designations to ensure any obligations keep pace with fast-moving markets and competition shifts (it points to the recent rise of TikTok by way of example).</p>\n<p>It also doesn&#8217;t want gatekeeper designations to apply universally across all markets &#8212; arguing instead they should only apply in the specific market where a platform is &#8220;found to have ‘gatekeeper’ power&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Large digital platforms tend to operate across multiple markets and sectors, with varying degrees of competitive strength in each,&#8221; Google argues, adding that: &#8220;Applying ex ante rules outside these markets would create a risk of deterring pro-competitive market entry through excessive regulation, thereby depriving SMEs and consumers of attractive new products.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That would stand in contrast to the EU&#8217;s <em>modus operandi</em> around competition law enforcement &#8212; where a business that&#8217;s been judged to be dominant in one market (like Google is in search) has what competition chief Margrethe Vestager likes to refer to as a &#8220;special responsibility&#8221; not to abuse its market power to leverage that advantage in any other market, not only the one it&#8217;s been found to hold most of the market power.</p>\n<p>At the same time as Google is lobbying for limits on any gatekeeper designations, the tech giant wants to see certain types of rules applied universally to all players. Here it gives the examples of privacy, transparency (such as for fees) and ranking decisions.</p>\n<p>Data portability is another area it&#8217;s urging rules to be applied industry-wide.</p>\n<p>It also wants to see any online ad rules applied universally, not just to gatekeeper platforms. But it&#8217;s also very keen for hard limits on any such rules.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will be important that any interventions seeking to achieve more transparency and accountability are carefully designed to avoid inadvertently hampering the ability of online advertising tools to deliver the value that publishers and advertisers have come to expect,&#8221; the adtech giant writes, lobbying to reduce the amount of transparency and accountability set down in law by invoking claims of privacy risks to user data; threats to commercial IP; and &#8216;bad actors&#8217; gaming the system if it&#8217;s not allowed to continue being (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f0d4b98-21c7-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\">an ad-fraud-tastic</a>) blackbox.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Consideration of these measures will therefore require the balancing of factors including protection of users’ personal data and partners’ commercially sensitive information, and potential harm to users and competition through disclosure of data signals that allow ‘bad actors’ to game the system, or rivals to copy innovations. We stand ready to engage with the Commission on these issues,&#8221; Google intones.</p>\n<p>On updating ecommerce rules and liability &#8212; which is a stated aim of the DSA plan &#8212; Google is cautiously supportive of regulatory changes to reflect what it describes as &#8220;the digital transformation of the last two decades&#8221;. While pushing to retain core elements of the current e-Commerce Directive regime, including the<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> country-of-origin principle and freedom to provide cross-border digital services. </span></p>\n<p>For example it wants to see more expansive definitions of digital services, to allow for more specific rules for certain types of businesses &#8212; <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">pushing for a move away from the &#8216;active&#8217; and &#8216;passive&#8217; hosts distinction for platforms, to enable them to respond more proactively in a content moderation context without inviting liability by doing so, but suggesting hosting services may be better served by retaining the current regime (Article 14 of the e-Commerce Directive).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">On liability for illegal content it is lobbying for see clear lines between illegal material and what&#8217;s &#8220;lawful-but-harmful&#8221;. </span></p>\n<p>&#8220;Where Member States believe a category of content is sufficiently harmful, their governments may make that content illegal directly, through democratic processes, in a clear and proportionate manner, rather than through back-door regulation of amorphously-defined harms,&#8221; it writes.</p>\n<p>It also wants the updated law to retain the general prohibition on content monitoring obligations &#8212; and downplays the potential of AI to offer any &#8216;third way&#8217; there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While breakthroughs in machine learning and other technology are impressive, the technology is far from perfect, and less accurate on more nuanced or context-dependent content. Their mandated use would be inappropriate, and could lead to restrictions on lawful content and on citizens’ fundamental rights,&#8221; Google warns. &#8220;The DSA can help prevent risks to fundamental rights by ensuring that companies are not forced to prioritise speed of removal over careful decision-making,&#8221; it adds, saying it encounters &#8220;many grey-area cases that require appropriate time to evaluate the law and context&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We remain concerned about recent laws that enable imposition of large penalties if short, fixed turn-around times are not met,&#8221; it goes on, pointing to a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-constitutional-authority-rejects-law-forcing-online-platforms-to-delete-hate-speech-content/\">recent ruling by the French Constitutional Council</a> which struck down an online hate speech law on freedom of expression grounds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Any new standard should safeguard fundamental rights by ensuring an appropriate balance between speed and accuracy of removal,&#8221; Google adds.</p>\n<p>You can read its full submission &#8212; including answers to the Commission&#8217;s questionnaire &#8212; <a href=\"https://blog.google/documents/89/Googles_submission_on_the_Digital_Services_Act_package_1.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The Commission&#8217;s<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/europe-asks-for-views-on-platform-governance-and-competition-tools/\"> DSA consultation</a> closes on September 8.

the publicly-traded Russian tech giant that started as a search engine but has expanded into a number of other, related areas (similar to US counterpart Google) &#8212; today <a href=\"https://yandex.com/company/press_center/press_releases/2020/2020-09-04\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announced</a> that it is spinning out its self-driving car unit from MLU BV &#8212; a ride-hailing and food delivery joint venture it operates in partnership with Uber.</p>\n<p>The move comes amid reports that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/yandex\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"yandex\">Yandex <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Uber were eyeing up an <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-28/yandex-uber-jv-in-talks-with-morgan-stanley-goldman-for-ipo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IPO for MLU</a> last year. At the time, the JV was estimated to be valued at around $7.7 billion. It&#8217;s not clear how those plans will have been impacted in recent months, with COVID-19 putting huge pressure on ride-hailing and food-delivery businesses globally, and IPOs generally down compared to a year ago.</p>\n<p>In that context, spinning out the unit could help improve the unit economics and cost base of the MLU unit, but Yandex says that it&#8217;s being done to double down on more focused investment in self-driving.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;<span class=\"il\">Yandex</span>’s motivation behind the spinoff is twofold,&#8221; said a spokesperson. &#8220;From the business standpoint, we are increasing our stake in a strategically important business with lots of potential for growth. From the technology standpoint, self-driving technology is quickly moving forward to become a viable business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She added that an IPO of the mobility unit &#8220;is not one of the company’s priorities right now. As of right now, we aren’t considering an IPO. We believe that Yandex.Taxi can get a lot more from its synergies with other Yandex businesses.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As part of the spin-out, Yandex is investing $150 million into the business. That will include $100 million in equity, plus $50 million in the form of a convertible loan, the company said. It added that it had invested some $65 million in the business up to now. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Yandex is buying out some of Uber&#8217;s shares in this process and will now have a 73% stake in the spun-out business, with Uber owning 19%, and the remaining 8% owned by Yandex self-driving group (SDG) </span>management<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> and </span>employees<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">. </span></p>\n<p>“We are excited to increase our stake in this strategically important part of our business,” said Arkady Volozh, CEO and co-founder of Yandex, in a statement. “In just a short period of time, we have achieved breakthrough results in autonomous driving. We firmly believe in the future of autonomous mobility as a safe and cost-effective form of transportation with a vast addressable market. The additional capital that we are investing in SDG will allow it to continue to pursue the R&#38;D and productization of autonomous mobility.”</p>\n<p>Dmitry Polishchuk, who has been running the unit, will be the CEO of new self-driving group.</p>\n<p>Yandex is not disclosing the valuation of the self-driving unit, nor of MLU, but when the spin-out <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/13/uber-yandex-combine-ridesharing-and-ubereats-in-russia-in-a-3-72b-jv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first occurred in 2017</a> as a part of a bigger <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/uber-global-exits-billions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strategy at Uber to divest</a> of some of its less profitable, ultra-competitive international operations ahead of its IPO, the larger MLU operation was valued at $3.72 billion. In other words, it&#8217;s more than doubled in valuation since then, according to at least some estimates.</p>\n<p>In the interim, MLU has made <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/yandex-uber-jv-mlu-acquires-regional-rival-vezet-for-shares-and-71-5m-in-cash/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">some acquisitions</a> to expand in specific regions, and it&#8217;s taken on a few other businesses from its biggest shareholding parent, such as its <a href=\"https://yandex.com/company/press_center/press_releases/2020/2020-04-09\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">car-sharing business</a> (not clear how and why this was not part of the MLU JV already to be honest). And separately, its self-driving car unit has made some significant headway.</p>\n<p>That has included building up a fleet of some 130 vehicles across Russia, Israel and the US for testing, with that fleet collectively clocking up 4 million autonomous miles across cities and different weather conditions &#8212; with driving being critical part of how self-driving car companies &#8220;teach&#8221; their AI algorithms to work. It also licenses tech to car makers, such as in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/yandex-inks-deal-with-hyundai-to-build-self-driving-car-tech-for-its-mobis-oem-division/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this deal with Hyundai</a>.</p>\n<p>Yandex also claims that its robotaxi service, launched in 2018, was the first to come to Europe. It has also built its own autonomous delivery robot, Yandex.Rover, which is also coming over to the self-driving unit with the deal.</p>\n<p>As with Google-parent Alphabet&#8217;s Waymo self-driving division, the logic behind Yandex&#8217;s self-driving car unit has been that it can keep costs down by tapping into IP built and developed by Yandex&#8217;s substantial engineering team.</p>\n<p>That deal, Yandex said, will remain in place after the spin-off with access to company infrastructure, resources and more;

The two are not alone in this matter. There are a number of other public tech companies that provide certain groups of pre-IPO shareholders more votes than others on a per-share basis, though perhaps to a smaller degree than what Facebook has managed.</p>\n<p>It feels like many startups (and former startups) have decided over time that having material shareholder input is a bad idea. That, in effect, they must run companies as not merely monarchies, but unquestioned ones to boot.</p>\n<p>I am not entirely convinced that this is the best way to create long-term shareholder wealth.</p>\n<p>If you are on the other side of this particular fence, I understand. After all, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> is a global juggernaut and Snap has finally managed to eke out stock-market gains to bring its value it back where it was around when it went public. (A three-year journey.)</p>\n<p>But those arguments are only so good. You could easily argue that the two companies could have done much more with less self-sabotage (Facebook) and a bit more spend discipline (Snap).<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bn9dclFpim0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 14:24:25 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300","linkMd5":"986bc7b8369e1d41099beea3a2c6796b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-37-28-194_9086aabfeefee685.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":32544,"destBytes":32544,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-37-28-194_9086aabfeefee685.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-27-593_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn81@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-00-377_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn33@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-358_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn90@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-38-00-278_dca912dbb1646784.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bn9dclFpim0:MxCVwbYdf_I:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn89@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-59-278_a55e1ce775df8703.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn10@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-38-00-315_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bn9dclFpim0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn77@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-59-225_1ffec2818fb0e903.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237447363},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:27","title":"Qualcomm-powered Chinese XR startup Nreal raises $40 million","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2040066","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Nreal, one of the most-watched mixed reality startups in China, just secured $40 million from a group of high-profile investors in a Series B round that could potentially bring more adoption to its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/chinas-nreal-raises-15m-to-shrink-augmented-headsets-to-size-of-sunglasses/\">portable augmented headsets</a>.</p>\n<p>Kuaishou, the archrival to TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version Douyin, led the round, marking yet another video platform to establish links with Nreal following existing investor iQiyi, China&#8217;s own Netflix.

In early 2019, Nreal brought onboard Xiaomi founder&#8217;s venture fund Shunwei Capital for its $15 million Series A funding. As I <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/chinas-nreal-raises-15m-to-shrink-augmented-headsets-to-size-of-sunglasses/\">wrote</a> at the time, AR, VR, MR, XR &#8212; whichever marketing coinage you prefer &#8212; will certainly be a key piece in Xiaomi&#8217;s Internet of Things empire. It&#8217;s not hard to see the phone titan sourcing smart glasses from Nreal down the road.</p>\n<p>The other key partner of Nreal, a three-year-old company, is Qualcomm. The chipmaker has played an active part in China&#8217;s 5G rollout, <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2019/04/22/qualcomm-china-unicom-and-chinese-oems-initiate-chinas-5g-rollout\">powering</a> major Chinese phone makers&#8217; next-gen handsets. It <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2019/04/22/qualcomm-china-unicom-and-chinese-oems-initiate-chinas-5g-rollout\">supplies</a> Nreal with its Snapdragon processors, allowing the startup&#8217;s lightweight mixed reality glasses to easily plug into an Android phone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Its closer partnership with Qualcomm will allow it to access Qualcomm&#8217;s network of customers including telecoms companies,&#8221; Seewan Toong, an industry consultant on AR and VR, told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the mixed reality developer has already signed a deal with Japanese telco <a href=\"https://news.kddi.com/kddi/corporate/english/newsrelease/2019/05/31/3843.html\">KDDI</a> and in Korean, it&#8217;s working with LG&#8217;s cellular carrier <a href=\"http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20191121000226\">LG Uplus Corp</a>.</p>\n<p>The latest round brings Nreal’s total raise to more than $70 million and will accelerate mass adoption of its mixed reality technology in the 5G era, the company said.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen how Nreal will live up to its promise, secure users at scale, and move beyond being a mere poster child for tech giants&#8217; mixed reality ambitions. So far its deals with big telcos are in a way reminiscent of that of Magic Leap, which has been in a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/us-court-rejects-magic-leap-claims-nreal-founder-stole-mixedreality-secrets-120537120.html\">legal spat with Nreal</a>, though the Chinese company appears to burn through less cash so far. The troubled American company is currently pivoting to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/magic-leap-announces-layoffs-amid-covid-19-slowdown/\">relying on enterprise customers</a> after failing to crack the consumer market.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nreal is patient and not in a rush to show they can start selling high volume.

The dating app announced today that its interactive video series will be available in Asia and other international markets starting on September 12, giving users another way to connect as they continue to stay at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As in the United States, where &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/tinders-interactive-series-swipe-night-could-bring-a-needed-boost-to-user-engagement/\">first launched last October</a>, the international version of &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; will be broadcast on on the weekend. For audiences outside the U.S., three consecutive episodes are planned, starting with the first one on Sept. 12 from 10am to midnight, and airing on consecutive Saturdays at the same time.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Similar to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/01/original-content-bandersnatch-bird-box/\">Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&#8221;</a> and other interactive entertainment, &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; presents viewers with a &#8220;choose-your-own-adventure&#8221; narrative, but each of its episodes is only seven-minutes-long and users’ choices are added to their profile, giving them another way to figure out if someone is a good match.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; is not the first in-app event that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tinder\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tinder\">Tinder <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has introduced over the past couple of years to increase user engagement as it competes with other dating apps for younger users. Other examples, held last year before the pandemic, included <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/tinder-launches-a-spring-break-mode/\">Spring Break mode</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/tinder-launches-festival-mode-to-connect-music-festival-goers-with-profile-badges/\">Festival Mode</a>, which helped members in the United States find other people who were headed to the same vacation destinations or events.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now that COVID-19 has made in-person meetups less safe, &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52743454\">become an important part of Tinder’s business strategy </a>as it, and its competitors, focus on organizing more virtual events and hangouts. In today’s announcement, Tinder said during stay-at-home orders and social distancing, 52% more messages have been sent through the app globally, peaking on April 5, and &#8220;swipe volume&#8221; by users under 25 (or &#8220;Gen Z&#8221;) increased by 34%.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a user engagement experiment, &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; proved successful enough in the U.S. to warrant a second season even before stay-at-home orders started there. When it launched last fall, Tinder&#8217;s monthly usage was climbing, but users were opening the app less on a daily basis. By the time <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/tinders-video-series-swipe-night-gets-a-second-season/\">Tinder announced the second season of &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; in February</a>, Tinder said millions of users had tuned into the series and matches and conversations had increased by 26% and 12%, respectively.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“When lockdowns began, we saw an immediate increase in our members’ engagement on Tinder, so we know we play an important role in their stay-at-home experience. While the global health crisis continues, we believe &#8216;Swipe Night&#8217; can bring a welcome change of pace to our members around the world,” said Tinder chief executive officer Jim Lanzone in today’s announcement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now Tinder will find out if audiences in the rest of the world, where its competes with a large roster of other dating apps, will respond to &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; with the same level of enthusiasm. Tinder doesn’t break down its member numbers by country, but its APAC head of communications Papri Dev told TechCrunch that more than 50% of its members worldwide are Gen Z, the main audience for &#8220;Swipe Night,&#8221; and storylines are designed to provoke conversations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Having a high stakes story such as an apocalyptic themed event, felt like a strong forcing mechanism to make your choices or decisions really count,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Our members who are stuck at home are hungry for content, and based on what we’ve seen take off on other platforms, people seem to be open to a wide range of tones and topics. So we wanted to make Swipe Night available to our members in Asia, and around the world, as soon as we felt it would be appropriate.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Content in Asian markets including Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia will have subtitles in local languages.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a
