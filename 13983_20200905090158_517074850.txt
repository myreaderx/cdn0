On Snapchat, an answer to that adage is built into the platform. The app's original promise was that anything you sent would disappear almost immediately after you sent it, lost to the internet aether.&#160;</p><p>With the added option for snaps not to have a timer and for conversations not to disappear, there's less of an atmosphere of secrecy on the app. That includes when you take screenshots. When you get a screenshot of a message or snap, it's standard policy for Snapchat to notify the person whose material you've captured immediately through the social platform.&#160;</p><p>While this helps protect user privacy, sometimes you may not want to notify a user of your screenshos. You might want to show someone who's not on the app something from a friend's story or even turn that perfect gif or meme response into your phone background.&#160;</p><p>In these cases, there's a way to take screenshots in Snapchat without notifying the person you're screenshotting. It will involve Airplane mode and clearing your app cache. Once you do the latter, Snapchat won't remember that you took the screenshot. Therefore, it won't be able to update the other user's profile to reflect that you took one.&#160;</p><p>Here's how to do it.&#160;</p><h2>How to take a screenshot on Snapchat without someone knowing</h2><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you open the snap, put your phone in Airplane Mode via Settings.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2d97ec2618b92db65e0ec4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to screenshot on Snapchat without them knowing 1\" height=\"1334\" width=\"750\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Put your phone in Airplane Mode.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melanie Weir/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>2.</strong> Open the snap and take your screenshot.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Before taking your phone out of Airplane Mode, tap your profile icon in the top left corner of the screen.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2d992e4dca680a7c1a552a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to screenshot on Snapchat without them knowing 2\" height=\"1334\" width=\"750\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tap your profile icon in the upper left of the screen.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Melanie Weir/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>4.</strong> In the top right corner of your profile menu, tap the Settings icon.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2d994928ea7105232c8b46?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to screenshot on Snapchat without them knowing 3\" height=\"1334\" width=\"750\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Settings icon appears like a gear.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tap your profile icon in the upper left of the screen.</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>5.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of the Settings menu.

She defeated 9-term incumbent John Culberson in 2018 by five percentage points, making her the first woman to represent the district and first Democrat to since 1967. Fletcher is endorsed by the Texas AFL-CIO, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the Human Rights Campaign, and was previously endorsed in 2018 by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</p><p>Also from Houston, Hunt is a U.S. Army veteran with previous deployments in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. During his time in Saudi Arabia, Hunt served as a liaison officer between the U.S. Government and the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Corps. Currently working in real estate, Hunt's <a href=\"https://wesleyfortexas.com/wesley-on-the-issues/\">campaign is centered on</a> defeating the Green New Deal, lowering taxes, and reducing healthcare costs.</p><h2>The district</h2><p>Texas' 7th Congressional District is located in Houston's western region. The district contains part of Harris County and the unincorporated cities of Bellaire, West University Place, Bunker Hill Village, Hedwig Village, Southside Place, Hunters Creek Village, and Piney Point Village. With a <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/mycd/?st=48&cd=07d=07\">median income of $73,000</a>, it is one of the wealthier districts in Texas.</p><p>The 7th District is one of the many upscale suburban districts that have trended away from Republicans in recent years as white, college-educated, and suburban voters sour on the GOP under President Donald Trump.&#160;</p><p>In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried the district easily by a margin of over 21 percentage points. But in 2016, the district voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 1.4 percentage points, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1whYBonfwlgTGnYl7U_IH31G0JNYQ9QBIjDfqkZHkW-0/edit#gid=0\">according to the Daily Kos.&#160;</a></p><p>In 2018, the same year that Fletcher was elected, Democratic US Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W_GTNylAZfboZkDeMsJPGlir3aQB64SzlVHjY9Xdnkk/edit#gid=562073942\">carried the district by seven points</a>, 53% to 46%, in his campaign against Sen. Ted Cruz.&#160;</p><h2>The money race</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=TX07TX07\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Fletcher has raised $4.3 million– about $1.2 million more than Hunt's $3.1 million raised. With $3.4 million in cash on hand, Fletcher also has over three times than Hunt, who has $1 million remaining.</p><h2>What some of the experts say</h2><p>The race between Fletcher and Hunt is rated as \"leans Democratic\" by <a href=\"https://insideelections.com/ratings/house\">Inside Elections</a>, <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\">The Cook Political Report</a>, and

The app will display a sleep analysis chart showing your sleeping pattern for the week, and leverages the Apple Watch's accelerometer to gather movement data that can be used to tell whether you're awake or asleep.&#160;</p><p>An <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-26/apple-is-said-to-plan-sleep-tracking-feature-for-future-watch\">early 2019 Bloomberg report</a> said that Apple could be rolling out sleep tracking features to its 2020 Apple Watch. It's unclear, however, if the new Sleep software is the extent of Apple's new sleep tracking functionality or if the company is planning to add new hardware to its future watch to further expand these capabilities.&#160;</p><p>Built-in sleep tracking has been the one major feature the Apple Watch was lacking, compared with rivals like Fitbit, which Google <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/googles-fitbit-deal-more-scrutiny-from-the-justice-department-2020-4\">agreed to acquire for $2.1 billion</a>, and Samsung. Previously, Apple Watch owners needed to download a third-party app to measure sleep.</p><p>Adding such a feature — and improving the Apple Watch's battery life to go along with it — could further establish Apple's stronghold on the smartwatch market.&#160;Apple was the top wearable device maker as of the first quarter of 2020, according to <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS46432620\">The International Data Corporation</a>, claiming 29.3% of the market, followed by Xiaomi, Samsung, Huawei, and Fitbit.&#160;</p><p>The launch would also come just after rival Fitbit launched a new smartwatch <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fitbit-sense-smartwatch-announced-stress-tracking-apple-watch-2020-8\">called the Sense</a> that it claims can measure the impact of stress on the body and a new version of its Versa watch.</p><p>Here's a look at everything we're expecting to see from Apple's next smartwatch.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tApple will probably call it the Apple Watch Series 6.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e34562862fa812fdc55259a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple Watch\" height=\"1992\" width=\"2656\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Justin Sullivan/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>If <a href=\"http://apple.sjv.io/c/196318/435031/7613?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_020320_apple-watch-series-6-rumors-release-date-specs-features&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple</a> sticks with the branding it's used since 2016, we can expect its next smartwatch to be called the Apple Watch Series 6.&#160;</p>\n\tThe watch will probably be released in September.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e34542d62fa812d2f45da45?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple iPhone event 2019\" height=\"691\" width=\"921\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">apple</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Apple typically debuts its new <a href=\"http://apple.sjv.io/c/196318/435031/7613?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_020320_apple-watch-series-6-rumors-release-date-specs-features&#38;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apple Watch</a> alongside its refreshed iPhones in September, so it seems plausible that the company may take a similar approach this year. In years past, Apple has revealed the new watch on stage during its fall keynote and launched the device in stores later in September, usually roughly 10 days after the launch event.&#160;</p>\n\tApple just launched a sleep tracking app for the Apple Watch, hinting that perhaps more sleep-oriented features are coming in the next model.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e3451a924306a1e116787c8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"sleeping in \" height=\"4347\" width=\"5796\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">People Images/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Apple is said to have been testing sleep tracking for the Apple Watch at its campus as of early 2019, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-26/apple-is-said-to-plan-sleep-tracking-feature-for-future-watch?sref=BWbpWjRm\">Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.</a> It's unclear if this means the next Apple Watch will have additional sleep tracking features based on new hardware that extend beyond what will be available in watchOS 7's new Sleep app.&#160;</p><p>One thing it will need to keep up with rivals, however, is better battery life. Fitbit devices last for multiple days without requiring a charge, making it easy to wear them overnight without worrying about them running out of juice the next day. The Apple Watch, comparatively, typically needs to be charged every night.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Along with showing how much you've slept in the past week and monitoring the time you've spent asleep in the new Sleep app, the watch will also remind you to charge it when the battery dips below 30% in watchOS 7.&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p>\n\tThe next Apple Watch may be able to monitor blood-oxygen levels, too.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e666936fee23d726c1ea7b6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"time smart tech apple watch series 5 cox 14\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Crystal Cox/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Apple's next-generation smartwatch may be able to measure blood-oxygen saturation, a feature that Fitbit rolled out to some of its devices earlier this year, as <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/08/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-saturation/\">9to5Mac reported</a> after finding references to the capability in Apple's code.&#160;</p><p>With this feature, the watch would be able to notify users when their blood-oxygen saturation falls below a certain level, and the alerts would look similar to the heart-rate notifications currently available on the Apple Watch.&#160;</p><p>It's unclear if this feature will only be available in the Series 6 or if it would be capable of working on older watches as well.&#160;</p>\n\tApple may launch two new watches this year for the first time.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e501785a9f40c0b5970e8f3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"time smart tech apple watch series 5 cox 3\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Crystal Cox/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>In addition to the Apple Watch Series 6, Apple is also expected to release a second <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-watch-series-6-rumors-cheaper-price-watch-launch-2020-9\">low-cost watch</a> to replace the Series 3, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/apple-targets-75-million-5g-iphones-for-fall-product-blitz?sref=BWbpWjRm\">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Doing so could give Apple more ammunition to compete with rivals like Fitbit, which sells fitness-focused smartwatches and wristbands that usually undercut the price of Apple's latest watch.&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p>\n\tIt will probably look very similar to the Apple Watch Series 5 and Series 4.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e50176dfee23d3666393c65?format=jpeg\" alt=\"time smart tech apple watch series 5 cox 9\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Apple Watch Series 5\n<p class=\"copyright\">Crystal Cox/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>It doesn't sound like Apple is planning any major design changes for its next iteration of the Apple Watch, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jon_prosser/status/1252769317185294336?s=19\">according to</a> gadget leaker and YouTube host Jon Prosser.&#160;</p><p>When asked on Twitter about what to expect from the next Apple Watch, Prosser, who correctly reported the iPhone SE's unveil date, said it will look the same as the Series 4.</p><p>Apple changed the design of its smartwatch in 2018 with the Series 4, which has a thinner case and a display that's 30% larger compared to the Series 3.

School usually gets up to 700 bookings by September ahead of Christmas season, but this year, it's only seen half that. Lovell&#160;says the British government has only made guidelines more confusing.</p><p>Movie theaters and museums are open in the UK, but fears of a second wave have left some hesitant to embrace a \"normal\" Christmas.&#160;</p><p>\"It's not that people have said no, it's just that they are hesitating about saying yes. There are a lot of mixed messages,\" Lovell said. \"People don't really know what they're supposed to be doing.\"</p><p>The director says families can rest assured that close contact with strangers can be easily avoided during a visit with Santa. And with all the coronavirus precautions and proper training in place, he's confident that Christmas won't be canceled this year.&#160;</p><p>\"You can't have Christmas without Santa. And so I'm hoping that after today, people will be reassured and we'll start booking them as they normally do,\" he said.</p><p>\"After everything that's happened this year, the magic of Father Christmas is more important than ever before, really. People need cheering up.

rel=\"noopener\">the novel coronavirus or its symptoms</a>, our desire to keep a steady supply of household essentials, perhaps to regain a sense of control in times of uncertainty, <a

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-walmart-may-cut-store-hours-and-limit-sales-2020-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walmart start limiting the number of high-demand items like toilet paper</a> at their physical locations, and more people are staying at home, shopping online is increasingly enticing. The only problem — and it's a big one — is that many popular online stores are also completely out of stock or offering overpriced products from third-party sellers.&#160;</p><p>We advise against <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-amazon-target-selling-out-of-toilet-paper-online-2020-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stockpiling toilet paper</a> beyond reason so everyone can get fair access to the supplies they need; see <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-water-toilet-paper-stockpile-not-necessary-2020-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">why two experts say that's more harmful than helpful here</a>. To protect yourself effectively against the coronavirus, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends</a> washing your hands often for at least 20 seconds each time, avoiding close contact with people who are sick or if you yourself are sick, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces daily.&#160;</p><p>We also caution against buying products at marked-up prices if you can avoid it. The increased prices are a result of hoarding and product shortages. Manufacturers have said <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/purell-hand-sanitizer-sells-out-amazon-coronavirus-fears-2020-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they'll work to address production shortages</a>, so we expect to see more availability and normal prices.</p><p>That said, in our frequent searches these past few months, there have been a few online retailers offering quality toilet paper. In our search, we looked at Amazon, Target, Boxed, FreshDirect, Walmart, Grove Collaborative, and Home Depot, among other retailers. It's unlikely you'll find your favorite brand at the usual suspects consistently (Amazon, Target), but other retailers you might not immediately think of (Rite Aid, Staples) may still have toilet paper in stock.</p><p>Prices and links are accurate as of publishing time and we'll do our best to keep this list updated with affordable in-stock purchase options.&#160;</p><h2>Here's where you can buy toilet paper online:&#160;</h2><p><em>Note: As of 9/3/20, the following options are in stock online or available in stores, though availability depends on your zip code so inventory can change. We will continue to monitor toilet paper stock and update this list when we can.</em></p><div id=\"ProductCard_5ebedaf33ad8610eed7fbd55\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width:

leading the country into a potentially disastrous New Year.</p><p>She said the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak risks being compounded by an abrupt exit from the EU's trading rules.</p><p>Reeves, the opposite number to Michael Gove, the UK minister responsible for preparing Britain for the end of the Brexit transition period, warned that \"business, consumers, and families have gone through a torrid year and can't afford anymore disruption.\"</p><p>The member of Parliament for Leeds West spoke to Business Insider after a week in which the scale of potential disruption facing Britain when it leaves the Brexit transition period at the end of the year became clearer.</p><p>Eleven logistics companies wrote to Gove, demanding an urgent meeting with him and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, amid growing concern within the logistics industry that Britain's borders will not be ready in time for January 1, <a

that Britain's food industry has warned Johnson's government that the deadline for producing new labels needed to legally sell food to the EU and Northern Ireland from next year has already passed.</p><p>On Friday, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Johnson sought to calm fears that the UK would not be ready to break away from its biggest trading partner.</p><p>\"We have been clear since we left the EU that after the end of the Brexit transition period there will be changes and things companies need to implement,\" they said. That's why we have been working with them throughout the transition period and will continue to do so.\"</p><p>However, Reeves accused Gove and the rest of the Conservative government of failing to prepare the country.</p><p>\"Michael Gove is a little bit like an ostrich with his head in the sand. He doesn't seem to be willing to accept the reality of what's around him,\" she told Business Insider.</p><p>\"It's faith-based policy based on the belief that Brexit will be a world of sunny uplands.</p><p>\"The lack of preparedness and 'everything will be alright' approach is ostrich-like. If he removed his head from the sand he'd hear what businesses, which have already got a lot on their plate at the moment, are saying.\"</p><p>She accused the ministers of a lack of transparency around work to prepare Britain for life outside of the UK, amid frustration among British business groups with the lack of government guidance with just four months to go until the end of the transition.</p><p>\"It is a bit of a running theme with this government that it thinks consultation and dialogue is a barrier to delivery, when actually it is essential,\" Reeves said.</p><p>\"Let's take <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/brexit-boris-johnson-uk-lorry-parks-chaos-checks-2020-9?r=US&IR=TIR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the lorry parks</a>: the government is rushing through these plans using a statutory instrument without any consultation with local authorities to build potentially 29 of them.</p><p>\"When I went to the one being built in Ashford in Kent, people were coming down and saying 'until the diggers were here, we had no idea what was happening.' It was totally out of the blue for them.\"</p><p>She warned that the government's furlough scheme for workers affected by COVID-19 is due to expire in the autumn and unemployment set to rise. \"Large parts of the economy are already on their knees and the last thing they need is another shock to the system\" caused by a chaotic exit from the EU.</p><p>UK and EU negotiators will hold the next round of formal talks over a free trade deal in London next week <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/johnson-sees-no-deal-as-better-than-surrender-t5sf30chw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">amid reports </a>that figures in Downing Street believe the chances of a deal before the autumn deadline are now less than 50%.</p><p>However, while a deal would potentially remove tariffs and other friction, with Britain leaving the EU's single market and customs union, there will be new checks and trade barriers, whatever the outcome of negotiations.</p><h2>Reeves puts pressure on Johnson to drop Tony Abbott</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f525e17e6ff30001d4e71e7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Gove\" height=\"600\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">David Nash/Barcroft Media via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>With an eye on new free trade agreements with non-EU countries, Johnson's government has appointed former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott as an advisor on UK trade policy.</p><p>However, the prospect of Abbott's appointment has prompted outrage across the political spectrum, with opposition MPs and even some in Johnson's Conservative party arguing that Abbott's history of allegedly sexist and homophobic remarks make him unsuitable for the job.

wire and high prison fences, a vast coffee roaster is helping reduce the rate of reoffending.</p><p>The 70-kilogram-capacity machine inside a training facility at The Mount prison near London provides inmates with the roasting and barista skills which, it's hoped, will find them employment after release.</p><p>The arabica beans prepared here make their way to wholesale customers and to the shops of the appropriately named <a href=\"https://www.redemptionroasters.com/\">Redemption Roasters</a>, which claims to be the world's first behind-bars coffee company.</p><p>Cutting the recidivism rate through coffee is the company's aspiration. And for ex-offender Darren Russen, it's working.</p><p>Russen received his four-week training with Redemption Roasters at Wormwood Scrubs prison in London. He started working as a barista at one of the company's six coffee shops after his release last year.</p><p>\"I've spent around 16 years in prison altogether,\" Russen told Business Insider Today. \"This is the first time in my life that I've seen something that's progressing people in prison and changing lives.\"</p><p>Russen said he was brought up into a life of crime, and served multiple prison sentences before he had the chance to learn about coffeemaking.</p><p>\"It's changed my whole outlook on life now, and it's progressing me,\" he said. \"It's the first time in my life I've been free basically, and that's through the support of the company and working. Just feeling a part and feeling happy. Getting up, waking up, and feeling a part of life.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f52a26e7ed0ee001e25da89?format=jpeg\" alt=\"darren prison coffee\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Darren Russen is one of 17 former inmates who gained barista skills through the Redemption Roasters program in the past year.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Robert Leslie/Business Insider Today</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Redemption Roasters cofounder Max Dubiel already ran a coffee company when he was approached by the UK's Ministry of Justice to come up with a behind-bars barista training program.</p><p>\"Ultimately it's the right thing, because it takes people out of this vicious cycle of reoffending, which costs the taxpayer a hell of a lot of money,\" Dubiel told Business Insider. \"Even worse, it makes communities less safe, and also creates victims. And I think we all need to do our bit to reduce it in this country.\"</p><p>The reality is that most offenders simply don't have this kind of opportunity, either before or after release.</p><p>Having a job to go to can often mean the difference between going straight and reoffending.</p><p>\"Less than a fifth of offenders leave prison with a job to go to, and yet those who do have a job to go to are nine percentage points less likely to reoffend,\" said Laura Sapwell, the former governor of Aylesbury, a young offenders prison where Redemption Roasters runs a training program.</p><p>The reoffending rate for England and Wales is <a href=\"https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-28/v1\">one of the highest in Europe</a>, according to a recent study. And almost half of all those released from prison commit another crime within a year, <a href=\"http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Bromley%20Briefings/Prison%20the%20facts%20Summer%202019.pdf\">according to the Prison Reform Trust</a>.</p><p>It cost around <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/750185/costs-per-place-costs-per-prisoner-2017-2018-summary.pdf\">40,000 pounds</a>, or $53,000, to provide each space in prison in the UK.</p><p>\"Having a stable home to go to and having a job does make a massive difference to the reoffending rate,\" Paul Crossey, deputy governor of The Mount prison, said.</p><p>\"When you've got a company that can offer jobs outside, they're already getting to know the men that they are working with in here. It breaks down a lot of barriers that maybe an employer who doesn't understand what prison is like would really know.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f52a2847ed0ee001e25da8a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"prison coffee\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Lowering the recidivism rate by giving inmates job skills is one of the goals of the company.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Robert Leslie/Business Insider Today</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The high-tech facility at The Mount can roast up to 70 kilograms of coffee at a time — that's 7,000 kilograms a week.</p><p>Trainees are also taught about the origins of coffee, tasting, and appreciation, as well as grinding, extraction, and milk technique.</p><p>So far, more than 400 prisoners have been through the training program here and at nine other prison sites in England and Wales. In the last year, 17 have been hired in the coffee industry after release.</p><p>But training is often not enough. The stigma of a criminal record and the fear of hiring an ex-offender can be huge obstacles to finding work on the outside — as can a lack of qualifications and low levels of literacy.</p><p>Dubiel, for one, sees only positives in hiring ex-offenders.</p><p>\"One does, by employing an ex-offender, hire an incredibly loyal workforce, hire somebody who's incredibly thankful and keen to develop their career with you,\" he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, prison walls have provided no shelter from the coronavirus pandemic. For months, those who were locked up were also locked down, with training behind-bars training schemes suspended.</p><p>But coffee shops are reopening.&#160;</p><p>For Russen, this is the first time in his life he's managed to see out his yearlong license, or probation period, after release from prison.</p><p>\"I've always broken my license. I've lasted a year or just over a year, or just over a year, then prison. That's been my cycle for years, but I've actually broken that cycle now. It's making me grow. It's making me feel stronger as well.\"</p><p>He added: \"It's the customers. It's just meeting people as well. The coffee is great, but it's building relationships — I'm really becoming part of society, and I'm feeling part of, for the first time in my life, of London, and part of society.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/redemption-roasters-coffee-prison-inmates-barista-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:QXVau8BzmBE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/j-WrXQ83tjk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 20:36:00 +0000","feedId":13983,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f52a2b47ed0ee001e25da8b?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"857160bdfcfc4d45c75918297debfb2f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn86@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-01-12-676_3291b2f5281f5876.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":45992,"destBytes":45992,"author":"insider@insider.com (Robert Leslie)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f52a218e6ff30001d4e73ed?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn5@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-01-16-260_293e907b8c562e13.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f52a26e7ed0ee001e25da89?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn73@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-01-16-042_ffd2f8c5fed52d8d.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f52a2847ed0ee001e25da8a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn15@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-01-15-430_889fbf4cf5634762.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn60@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-01-18-751_00f09200df8426be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn24@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-01-15-532_1a3ba3823308c452.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=j-WrXQ83tjk:NLU47YDck-M:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn13@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-01-19-304_001c60b57ae65f9e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn54@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-01-18-350_767e235117808cfa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn12@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-01-17-769_edf0fa9b5dde1c97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/j-WrXQ83tjk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-01-16-523_c7f1db0fa4c972e5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296467312},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:01:07","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:01:07","title":"First-term Rep.

It was formed in 2003 when the state added two new districts following the 2000 U.S. Census.</p><p>The 32nd District is one of many suburban Texas congressional districts that has become significantly more favorable to Democrats as suburban and college-educated voters turn away from the GOP under President Donald Trump.</p><p>While 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney easily carried the 32nd District by a margin of over 15 points, 57% to 42%, the district backed 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by a margin of two points four years ago, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1whYBonfwlgTGnYl7U_IH31G0JNYQ9QBIjDfqkZHkW-0/edit#gid=0\">according to the Daily Kos.&#160;</a></p><p>As Allred defeated incumbent Republican Pete Sessions by over six points in 2018, Democratic US Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W_GTNylAZfboZkDeMsJPGlir3aQB64SzlVHjY9Xdnkk/edit#gid=562073942\">carried the district by a margin of over 10 points</a> in his race against GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.&#160;</p><h2>The money race</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=TX32TX32\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Allred has raised $3.7 million for his campaign, or $1.1 million more than Collins' $2.6 million. Collins has $1.13 million in cash remaining, less than half than Allred with $2.98 million.</p><h2>What some of the experts say</h2><p>The race between Allred and Collins is rated as \"leans Democratic\" by <a href=\"https://insideelections.com/ratings/house\">Inside Elections</a> and \"likely Democratic\" by <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\">The Cook Political Report</a> and <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2020-house/\">Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics</a>.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-32nd-district-house-election-colin-allred-genevieve-collins-2020'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:cGdyc7Q-1BI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?a=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:QXVau8BzmBE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/NHSAPeTXlU0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 20:53:22 +0000","feedId":13983,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f3ee22a42f43f001ddfe2ee?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"ea319b6668bc0f6fcb5baa198667d59e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn5@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-01-12-706_3f55c31b3c13270c.webp","destWidth":2474,"destHeight":1856,"sourceBytes":284078,"destBytes":284078,"author":"mhall@businessinsider.com (Madison Hall,Grace Panetta)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f3ee23c89aff80028ab700c?format=jpeg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn60@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-01-18-751_00f09200df8426be.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn43@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-01-18-822_9009e4fb4b2ea29b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn100@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-01-14-689_335cca78f21042de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?i=NHSAPeTXlU0:GBRKjruoWiU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-01-16-632_a7336876bc8fa150.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn54@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-01-18-350_767e235117808cfa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/clusterstock?d=QXVau8BzmBE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn12@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-01-17-769_edf0fa9b5dde1c97.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clusterstock/~4/NHSAPeTXlU0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn15@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-01-16-270_b154aa6dfcecdac6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296467308},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:01:07","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:01:07","title":"Tour de France notebook: America's champ was eager to race in his stars and stripes this year.

If there are no races on, we'll just let the American public assume I'm the best.\"</p><p>Howes, who rides on the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ef-pro-cycling\">EF Pro Cycling</a> team, had to fly to Europe before travel restrictions took effect. He now finds himself away from friends and family and missing home, in a country that is again seeing a surge in its number of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/covid-19\">COVID-19</a> cases. \"They're left and right,\" he said.</p><p>He hasn't competed this year, except for a couple of small early-season races. He got a stomach virus at the end of July, which meant no <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a>, a race he's ridden twice.</p><p>Howes isn't just another roadie. He often heads off-road and participates in what some call \"alternative racing.\"</p><p>Last year he completed Leadville, the popular 100-mile mountain-bike race in his home state.</p><p>This spring he and a teammate flew to South Africa to race the gnarly Cape Epic, but it got canceled last minute because of the coronavirus.</p><p>Then, before he left the States for Europe, he and a friend <a href=\"https://www.efprocycling.com/due-east-for-miles-and-miles/\">rode their bikes for 14 hours</a>, from the Colorado mountains to the Kansas border. It was something to do while racing was paused.</p><p>Howes said he likes the alt racing because he can do it close to home, and it allows pros to meet everyday cyclists \"somewhere in the middle.\"</p><p>\"That's really important at the moment because there are more people riding bikes right now in America than ever before, which is just incredible,\" he said.</p><p>\"Not only do I want to encourage more people to ride, but I also want to get these people who pick the bike up somewhere during this quarantine business and help them become better and enjoy it more. We want to keep those good habits going anyway we can.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f52afc07ed0ee001e25dada?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Alex Howes EF Pro Cycling\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Howes racing last summer in Utah.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chris Graythen/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"Our goals showing up to these quote, unquote alternative events was never to pummel the competition. We're really there more to study and engage than to win. That's not to say that once the flag drops we're not racing. We try as hard as we can. But the result is kind of secondary to the overall experience and process.</p><p>\"That said, it would be nice, now that we've learned a little bit, to try and win one or two, but again, the COVID thing screwed that all up. So 2021, right?\"</p><p>Howes said he's been keeping in touch with his teammates and other riders racing in France. (He has about 100 Tour riders' numbers in his phone, he told me.) Among other things, they talk about rider safety and carrying out their jobs during the pandemic.</p><p>\"With COVID it's been interesting following and talking to various riders, with how they're training camps have gone and what sort of COVID-19 protocols and restrictions they have,\" he said. \"I'd say everybody's taking it pretty serious — certainly with the Tour.</p><p>\"But even with a heightened level of seriousness and caution, there's definitely some teams that are taking it a lot more serious than others, which can make it harder to perform.</p><p>\"And really not even physically. All that kind of stuff is mental. When you get locked in a bubble for a month and a half, I don't care who you are, you're either an astronaut, and you don't care, or you're a normal human, and it drives you insane.\"</p><p>To cut the boredom he's been watching the Tour on television, \"bits and pieces\" anyway.</p><p>Do the pros watch the greatest bicycle race through a special lens?</p><p>\"The biggest thing I find when I watch the Tour, I just watch it and I'm like, 'Man, bike racing is dangerous.' You don't really see it as much when you're in it, you know? It's a different perspective.</p><p>\"I think of it like when you have a teenager driving a car. They're like, 'I got this, it's fine.' And then you're the old lady watching it from the outside, and you're like, 'That guy's going 65 miles an hour in a 35-mile-an-hour speed limit. He doesn't got that.'\"</p><p>Because the US national championships were canceled, it appears as if by default that Howes will keep his \"<a href=\"https://www.efprocycling.com/our-stories/\">fancy shirt</a>\" for another season. He said he's not heard from the governing body, USA Cycling.</p><p>\"I don't think anyone's really working there at the office right now. I didn't get a medal in the mail or anything.</p><p>\"It was just sort of like on Twitter. They were like, yeah, he has the jersey and he can wear it again.\"</p><p>All along, he's been \"training the house down\" for next month's <a href=\"https://www.giroditalia.it/en/\">Giro d'Italia</a>, which he's planning on racing. If all goes well he'll show his American colors in October, a time he'd normally be roaming the woods outside Boulder.</p><p>After a nearly raceless season, starting the Italian tour cold should be interesting.</p><p>\"Oh yeah,\" he said, chuckling. \"I mean, luckily everybody else is kind of screwed, too. The awkwardness of COVID-19 is not unique to any one of us at this point.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The district is also home to nearly all of Oklahoma County and all of Pottawatomie and Seminole counties.&#160;</p><p>Oklahoma's 5th District is one of the most traditionally Republican to currently be held by a Democrat in Congress. In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney carried by the district by 18 points that year, and President Donald Trump carried the district by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/oklahoma-5th-district-congressional-primaries-live-results-2020-6\">13.4 percentage points</a> in the 2016 election, <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections\">according to the Daily Kos.&#160;</a></p><h2>The money race</h2><p>The long and drawn-out primary runoff between Bice and Neese allowed Horn to amass a considerable cash advantage over Bice. According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=OK05OK05\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Horn has raised $3.6 million and has $2.6 million in cash on hand compared to $1.45 million raised and less than $80,000 in cash on hand for Bice.&#160;</p><h2>What some of the experts say</h2><p>The race between Horn and Bice is rated as a \"toss-up\" by <a

Traditionally, the term's been applied to the weapons, alcohol, gambling, or tobacco sectors. But, with the growth of socially responsible investing and ethical investing, sin stocks now often encompass other companies and industries people find objectionable in some way.</p><p>Some investors shun sin stocks and try to own only investments they consider virtuous or ethical. Other investors favor sin stocks because they tend to perform well in both <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-bull-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bull</a> and bear stock markets, and no matter what <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-business-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">phase</a> the economy is in.&#160;</p><p>Let's fall more deeply into sin stocks.&#160;</p><h2>What is a sin stock?</h2><p>No single standard industry definition exists for sin stocks. But most of the categories could be said to tie into any of the seven deadly sins laid out centuries ago by Pope Gregory I:&#160;</p><ol><li>Pride</li><li>Greed</li><li>Lust</li><li>Envy</li><li>Gluttony</li><li>Wrath</li><li>Sloth</li></ol><p>It's easy enough to plug most of the sin stock categories into this ancient list: Gluttony could refer to alcohol and tobacco stocks, wrath could refer to weapons stocks, and greed could refer to gambling stocks. Adult entertainment companies can also fall under the umbrella of sin stocks, and they fit nicely into the lust category.</p><h2>Is sin in the eye of the beholder?</h2><p>Other stocks and sectors can be considered sinful too — depending on your religion, your politics, and your personal moral and ethical values.&#160;</p><p>For example, Islamic investors, following their faith's Shariah law, might shun conventional financial institutions because they charge interest. Shariah principles also prohibit investments in alcohol, tobacco, pork, gambling, media, and pornography and disallow short selling, speculation, and derivatives.</p><p>Environmentalists might classify oil and coal stocks as sin stocks, considering the companies behind them to be \"polluters.\" Vegans might consider shares of any company that raises animals, sells animal products, or tests on animals to be a sin stock. Some analysts even make a solid argument for Netflix as a sin stock: to binge-watch a show is to indulge in sloth.&#160;</p><p>And if alcohol is sinful, maybe marijuana is, too, if it's being used for recreational and not medicinal purposes. The stock of a company that produces opiates could be considered a sin stock because of all the people who have died or become addicted — though of course, these drugs have enormous benefits too.&#160;</p><p>Even the generally agreed-upon categories can be open to debate. What one person calls a weapons company (unethical) another person might deem a defense company (ethical). Such is the double-edged sword of trying to define what makes a stock sinful.</p><h2>Sin stock categories and companies</h2><p>A variety of corporations could be called sin players.&#160; The categories include the traditional Big Four of the sin stock sector, along with some newer but commonly cited fields.&#160;&#160;</p><ul><li><strong>Alcohol:</strong> Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), Molson Coors Brewing Company (MCBC), Boston Beer Company (SAM), Constellation Brands (STZ), Diageo (DGEAF), Brown-Forman (BF)</li><li><strong>Defense/Weapons:</strong> Boeing (BA), Northrup Gruman (NOC), Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD), Raytheon (RTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT), American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), Olin (OLN), Vista Outdoor (VSTO), Sturm, Ruger (RGR)</li><li><strong>Tobacco: </strong>Altria (MO), British American Tobacco (BTAFF), Philip Morris (PM)</li><li><strong>Gambling/Adult Entertainment:</strong> Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Penn National Gaming (PENN), Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Boyd Gaming (BYD), Scientific Games (SGMS), DraftKings (DKNG), RCI Hospitality Holdings (RICK)</li><li><strong>Marijuana/Cannabis: </strong>Cronos (CRON), Canopy Growth (CGC), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Aphria (APHA), Tilray (TLRY), GrowGeneration (GRWG)</li><li><strong>Corrections/Prisons:</strong> CoreCivic (CXW), The GEO Group (GEO)</li><li><strong>Payday Lenders:</strong> World Acceptance Corp. (WRLD), Enova International (ENVA)</li><li><strong>Energy:</strong> Energy Transfer LP (ETP), ExxonMobil (XOM), Kinder Morgan (KMI)</li><li><strong>Meat:</strong> Hormel Foods (HRL), Sanderson Farms (SAFM), Tyson Foods (TSN)</li><li><strong>Snacks/Junk Food:</strong> Coca-Cola (KO), Mondelez International (MDLZ), Hershey (HSY), PepsiCo (PEP), McDonald's (MCD)</li></ul><h2>What makes sin stocks enticing?</h2><p>You don't invest in sin stocks just for the thrill of being naughty. Owning them can be an attractive financial strategy.&#160;</p><h3>They're steady performers</h3><p>Sin stocks are considered \"defensive\" stocks, meaning they tend to perform well even during an economic downturn or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-recession\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recession</a>. People who regularly smoke, drink, or gamble don't stop doing these things when times are bad, whether because they're physically addicted or because they enjoy these activities as a way to escape and unwind, however un healthfully.&#160;</p><p>And of course, they might indulge even more when times are good.&#160;</p><h3>They're cash cows</h3><p>As a result, sin stocks are known for their stable earnings and income streams. Many companies in sin industries are well-established, have sound financials, and have consistently paid dividends for years.&#160;</p><h3>They've got little competition</h3><p>The goods and services that sinful companies produce tend to be highly subject to law. Potential competitors may be loath to enter such enterprises, creating more room for the existing players.</p><p>Even sin stocks' negative connotations can work to their advantage. Certain institutional investors — especially those handling funds for religious or academic groups — often shy away from notorious or controversial businesses. That can lead to a particular sin stock being undervalued and a good bargain.</p><h2>What are the downsides of sin stocks?</h2><p>Even if you have no moral or ethical qualms about investing in sin stocks, you should consider their potential financial drawbacks before adding them to your portfolio.</p><h3>There's high regulatory risk</h3><p>All companies' fortunes can be contingent on laws, but regulatory risk is a particular concern with sin stocks.&#160;</p><p>Marijuana might become legal at the federal level, but what happens if, instead, U.S. states reverse the legality of medical or recreational marijuana? Defense spending and gun control regulations can change depending on who rules a country, international relations, and terrorist activity.</p><h3>Taxes can be a problem</h3><p>All companies have to deal with taxation, but sin stocks often have a fiscal target on their backs. Regulators and voters could decide to increase taxes on the \"sinful\" items these companies produce; they're often the go-to source when states need money. Higher taxes could reduce demand, dampen profits, and push stock prices down.</p><h3>Consumer habits can change</h3><p>You'll also want to consider the effect of changing consumer tastes, like declining alcohol and tobacco consumption. Black swan events can force habits to change, such as a pandemic shutting down casinos and the sporting events people like to bet on.</p><p>Finally, devoting too much of your portfolio to a single industry or company is always risky, no matter whether that company produces organic vegetables or nuclear warheads.</p><h2>How to invest in sin stocks&#160;</h2><p>The unique consideration for sin stocks is whether you oppose the product or service a company manufactures or purveyors. Otherwise, whether you should invest in sin stocks boils down to the same questions you would ask yourself with any investment:&#160;</p><ul><li>What is the unique benefit of putting my money in this investment versus a different investment?&#160;</li><li>Is the potential reward high enough to choose this investment over the alternatives?</li><li>How does this investment fit into my portfolio and my overall investment strategy?</li><li>How much money do I stand to lose? Can I afford that loss?</li></ul><p>Of course, as with any investment, you'll have to do the research on any possible sin stock you're considering to make sure the conventional wisdom about it holds true.</p><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>In a sense, the decision to invest in stocks question touches on the general issue of socially responsible and ethical investing — and whether you feel that your principles should influence your principal.</p><p>Some investors' attitude toward sin stocks is that it's up to individuals to decide whether they want to smoke, drink, or gamble, despite the risks. Other investors think that the companies producing these products are at least partly to blame for individuals' consumption, especially when that consumption becomes addictive and products are engineered to be addictive.&#160;</p><p>It's up to you whether to base your investment decisions purely on financial considerations or whether to let the ethical questions inform your choices.&#160;</p><h2>Related Coverage in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Investing</a>:</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/why-invest-stock-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why invest in the stock market?

At this tier and higher, online recordings are supported along with a handful of additional features.&#160;</p><p><strong>Webex Meetings Plus:</strong> The main difference is that at this level — which costs $17.95 per host per month — up to 50 people can host meetings.&#160;</p><p><strong>Webex Meetings Business:</strong> For $26.95 per host a month, up to 100 people may host, and as many as 200 people may attend a meeting.&#160;</p><p><strong>Webex Meetings Enterprise:</strong> This level has customized pricing and allows for an unlimited number of hosts and meetings with up to 100,000 attendees.</p><p>You can find additional information about subscribing to Webex Meetings on the <a href=\"https://www.webex.com/pricing/index3.html\">Webex plans page</a>.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4961907ffa48002894cf67?format=jpeg\" alt=\"what is webex 1\" height=\"1062\" width=\"1887\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Webex web site has a handy tool for learning about the pricing based on how many hosts your organization needs.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Creating a Webex Meetings account</h2><p>When you're ready to get started with Webex, you need to decide if you ever plan to host meetings or only want to join meetings hosted by others.&#160;</p><p>To host, you will need to create an account. To join meetings, you can create an account, but you don't need to.&#160;</p><p>To create an account, go to the <a href=\"https://www.webex.com/pricing/index3.html\">Webex website</a> and click \"Start for Free\" at the screen's top right. Then follow the instructions to create an account.</p><h2>Downloading Webex</h2><p>Depending on how you plan to use Webex, you have a few options for launching the conferencing tool.&#160;</p><p>You can use the service on a computer by installing the desktop app, but that's not essential. Webex can run entirely within a web browser, so you can join meetings without installing anything at all. You can also install the mobile Webex app on your phone or tablet.</p><ul><li>To install the Webex desktop app on your Windows or Mac computer, go to the <a href=\"https://www.webex.com/pricing/index3.html\">Webex website</a>, create an account, and install it. If you've already opened an account but have not yet installed the app, go to the <a href=\"https://meetingsamer31.webex.com/webappng/sites/meetingsamer31/dashboard/download\">Downloads page</a> to install the Cisco Webex Meetings desktop app.&#160;</li><li>You can install the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cisco-webex-meetings/id298844386\">Webex mobile app for iOS</a> or the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cisco.webex.meetings&hl=en_USn_US\">Webex mobile app for Android</a>.&#160;</li></ul><h2>Getting started with Webex Meetings</h2><p>If you have any experience with other web conference tools, you will probably find Webex Meetings familiar and straightforward to use.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4961bc60bf1f00280794e6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"what is webex 2\" height=\"1539\" width=\"2736\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>If you have a Webex account, which you can get for free, you can start meetings from the website or an app.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li>If you are the host, you can <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-set-up-a-webex-meeting\">start a meeting using the web site, desktop app, or mobile app</a>.&#160;</li><li>If you host a lot of Webex meetings, you might want to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-add-webex-to-outlook\">install the Webex plugin for Outlook</a>, which lets you add Webex information to meeting invites in Outlook. If you schedule appointments in Outlook frequently, this is a lot more convenient than using the Webex app to schedule meetings.&#160;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-join-webex-meeting\">To join a Webex meeting</a>, you need the email invitation sent by the meeting host. If you don't have it, you may need to ask them to resend it. You can generally choose to join via the desktop or mobile app or within a browser window. If the host uses one of the paid plans, you can also dial in using your phone. Just follow the directions in the email to get started.&#160;</li><li>As the host or participant, you can <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-share-screen-on-webex\">easily \"take over\" the meeting by sharing your screen</a>. Webex lets you share your entire screen, just a selected app or browser window, or an interactive whiteboard.&#160;</li><li>If you are the host, or in the paid tiers of service an alternate host, you can <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-record-webex-meeting\">record a meeting for future reference</a> or to share with invitees who could not attend. After recording a meeting, it will be stored locally on your computer or in the cloud, where you can <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-download-webex-recording\">retrieve and download it for sharing</a>.&#160;</li></ul><p>&#160;</p><h2><strong>Related coverage from&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Tech Reference</a>:</strong></h2><ul><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-set-up-a-webex-meeting\">How to set up a Webex meeting on desktop or mobile and invite others to join</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-join-webex-meeting\">How to join a Webex meeting from your computer, the mobile app, or a phone call</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-record-webex-meeting\">How to record a Webex video meeting on any type of account</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-zoom-guide\">What is Zoom?

aboard its Electron rocket since 2018, but it has never put its own spacecraft into Earth's orbit before.</p><p>But the spacecraft it launched this week, the first demo of its own Photon satellite, is designed to carry other companies' and government agencies' technology into space. Eventually, it could carry missions to the moon, Venus, and Mars.</p><p>Monday's launch at first appeared routine, like the 13 missions Rocket Lab previously launched. The company's Electron rocket lifted off from its New Zealand launch complex on Monday, shedding its unneeded sections as it roared through the atmosphere. About an hour later, the remaining section of the rocket, called the kick stage, made a final push into an orbit high above Earth and deployed a microsatellite for the company Capella Space — a Rocket Lab customer.&#160;</p><p>But then something totally new happened: Instead of firing its boosters to push itself back into Earth's atmosphere, where it would disintegrate, the kick stage settled into its own orbit and entered satellite mode.</p><p>\"There was a real magical moment, sitting with the engineers, where we sent a command to the kick stage ... a command that turned the kick stage into our very first satellite,\" Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC8RxgL9tK4&feature=youtu.beu.be\">video</a> announcement on Thursday.</p><p>The company hopes that Photon will extend its launch service to include a spaceflight service — taking its customers' satellite missions not only past Earth's atmosphere but beyond to other planets. All the customer has to do is make its hardware fit onboard Photon.</p><p>If successful, the project could make Rocket Lab an end-to-end satellite flight company. That would give it a unique role in the new commercial era of space, where private companies launch, fly, and land spacecraft for government agencies like NASA.</p><p>With the help of companies like Rocket Lab, NASA plans to eventually establish <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-10-year-plan-lunar-base-saturn-moon-2019-7\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"45ba87a921c8d1de0d449b73070abc4b\">a permanent moon base, and then potentially spring-board missions from there to Mars</a>.</p><h2>Future Photons could travel to other planets — and one is booked for the moon</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f52777ce6ff30001d4e72e4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"rocket lab Photon satellite First Light launch\" height=\"1407\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A photo from Rocket Lab&#39;s first Photon Satellite, &#34;First Light,&#34; in Earth&#39;s orbit.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Rocket Lab</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Rocket Lab shared its plan to create the new satellite, called Photon, last year.

Jeff Van Drew</strong> squares off against Democrat <strong>Amy Kennedy</strong> in November to represent New Jersey's 2nd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><h2>The candidates</h2><p>Before his foray into national politics, Van Drew was a dentist for 30 years and served both in local elected office on the Cape May County Board of Chosen Freeholders and in the New Jersey state legislature, serving as a member of the General Assembly from 2002 to 2008 and in the State Senate from 2008 to 2018.</p><p>In 2018, Van Drew defeated Republican Seth Grossman by 7.7 percent. He switched his party ties from Democrat to Republican just one day after voting against the impeachment of President Donald Trump in December 2019.</p><p>\"This is who I am, it's who I always was, but there was more tolerance of moderate Democrats, of Blue Dog Democrats, of conservative Democrats,\" <a href=\"https://apnews.com/9c058c6123efdc75bc3919936309e6b5\">Van Drew said</a>, \"and I think that's going away.\"</p><p>Kennedy, Van Drew's challenger, is the current president of The Kennedy Forum, a behavioral and mental health non-profit. Kennedy is also a board member of Mental Health America. She is the wife of Patrick J. Kennedy, a nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy and former longtime Democratic congressman from Rhode Island. Her <a href=\"https://www.amykennedyforcongress.com/issues/\">campaign platform is centered on</a> strengthening the Affordable Care Act, affordable college educations, and protecting workers' rights.</p><h2>The district</h2><p>New Jersey's 2nd congressional district is the state's most <a href=\"https://cdn.ballotpedia.org/images/d/d1/New_Jersey_December_2011_Redistricting_Map.png\">southern and largest district</a>. It is home to all of Cumberland, Salem, Atlantic and Cape May counties as well as portions of Camden, Burlington, Ocean, and Gloucester counties.</p><p>The district flipped from backing former President Barack Obama by eight percentage points over GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 to voting for President Donald Trump by over four points, 50.6% to 45%, over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections\">according to the Daily Kos.&#160;</a></p><h2>The money race</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=NJ02&spec=Np;spec=N\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Van Drew has raised $2.5 million – $1 million more than Kennedy. Van Drew also has $1.2 million in cash on hand, also nearly a million more than Kennedy who has only $137,000 remaining.&#160;</p><p>Before switching political parties, Van Drew notably did not fundraise in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>\"I thought it was a tiny bit distasteful in the very first weeks and months of my election being in there, that the very first thing I was doing was raising money again,\" Van Drew said to the <a href=\"https://newjerseyglobe.com/congress/van-drew-says-he-didnt-fundraise-in-first-quarter/\">New Jersey Globe</a>. \"We were in the middle of a closure, a government shutdown. I had real issues with my Coast Guard and with the FAA.\"</p><h2>What experts say</h2><p>The race between Van Drew and Kennedy is rated as a \"toss-up\" by <a href=\"https://insideelections.com/ratings/house\">Inside Elections</a> and <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings\">The Cook Political Report</a>, and \"leans Republican\" by

Susie Lee</strong> looks to retain her seat against Republican challenger<strong> Dan Rodimer</strong> in Nevada's 3rd congressional district.</p><h2>The candidates</h2><p>Before her time in politics, Lee dedicated her career to assisting Nevada's educational systems and lowering dropout rates. She was the founding director of the After-School All-Stars, an after-school program for thousands of students. She also served as the <a href=\"https://www.cisnevada.org/cis-of-nevada-board-chair-susie-lee-awarded-2015-humanitarian-of-the-year/\">president of Communities In Schools of Nevada</a>, a dropout prevention organization.</p><p>In 2016, Lee ran in the Democratic primaries to represent the state's 4th Congressional District. She placed third behind now-Rep. Ruben Kihuen and Lucy Flores. In 2018, however, she succeeded in her bid to replace former Representative and now-Senator Jacky Rosen in the 3rd District.</p><p>Rodimer, Lee's Republican opponent, is a former professional wrestler and arena football player. He has received <a href=\"https://danrodimer.com/endorsements/\">endorsements from House Minority Leader</a> Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the National Rifle Association, the National Right to Life Committee, and television celebrity Rick Harrison from the show \"Pawn Stars.\" Rodimer's <a href=\"https://danrodimer.com/issues/\">campaign platform is centered on</a> supporting law enforcement, opening the healthcare marketplace, and securing the country's borders.</p><p>In 2018, Rodimer ran for Nevada's State Senate in the state's 8th district, but lost in the Republican primary to Valerie Weber.</p><h2>The district</h2><p>Nevada's 3rd congressional district is the state's southernmost district. The district is located directly south of Las Vegas and contains the cities of Henderson, Summerlin South, Boulder City, Searchlight, Laughlin and parts of unincorporated Clark County.</p><p>The district is one of thirty in the United States which voted for President Trump in 2016 but is currently represented by a Democrat. This district flipped from narrowly backing former President Baack Obama by a margin of less than one percentage point in 2012 to voting for Trump also by one point, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1whYBonfwlgTGnYl7U_IH31G0JNYQ9QBIjDfqkZHkW-0/edit#gid=0\">according to the Daily Kos.&#160;</a></p><p>As Lee won her race in 2018, Democratic Sen.

Dean Heller. Also that year, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak carried the district by four points in his gubernatorial campaign, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HXedC4gpOJn5U3ZpjJmBIX_D7qOIyyM1fXHpKBIT-sQ/edit#gid=1608183133\">according to the Daily Kos.&#160;</a></p><h2>The money race</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=NV03NV03\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Lee has significantly outraised Rodimer.

Instead of browsing profiles for hours and searching out potential dates, you can merely \"swipe right\" on the people you like, and \"swipe left\" on those you don't.&#160;</p><p>Swiping right makes it easier than ever to meet and connect with people, but there are still some drawbacks to it.&#160;</p><p>While most people you meet on Tinder are probably just like you — respectful and trying to find a genuine match — you can run into some people you'd rather not connect with. On Tinder, if you somehow come into contact with someone you no longer want to be connected to, you can't block them. But you can unmatch with them.&#160;</p><p>If you're unmatching with this person because they were harassing or stalking you, or doing something else that might mean they pose a danger to other people, you should also report them to Tinder to take action.</p><p>When you unmatch someone on Tinder, you are automatically removed from each others' matches list. Your conversations are also deleted, and they won't be able to interact with you on the app ever again. There is currently no way to undo this action, so make sure unmatching is what you want.&#160;</p><p>If so, here's how to do it.&#160;</p><h2>How to block someone on Tinder by

Ocasio-Cortez's name, image, and policies have been used in several competitive GOP primary races, in which candidates positioned themselves as the most pro-Trump and anti-left option.&#160;</p><p>\"AOC wants to plunge us into Communism — she is clueless about how capitalism even works,\" Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, a QAnon supporter who last month won the GOP primary runoff in a deep-red Georgia district, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oP99HiZ_iA\">said in a campaign ad</a>.&#160;</p><p>Greene has featured Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive freshman congresswomen, including Reps. Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley, in several social media posts. On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-deleted-gop-candidates-post-threatening-violence-against-aoc-2020-9\">Facebook removed an image Greene posted</a> of herself holding an assault rifle next to images of Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib. The social media giant said the image violated its policy on \"violence and incitement.\"&#160;</p><p>Lauren Boebert, a far-right Republican nominated for Congress in Colorado's third district, ran explicitly as <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/2020/07/01/lauren-boebert-ran-against-aoc-and-the-squad-and-beat-rep-scott-tipton-in-the-process/\">an anti-AOC candidate</a>, tying GOP incumbent Rep.

While Pelosi was mentioned in more than 130,000 House and Senate campaign ads during the 2018 cycle, she's been mentioned in just 44 ads during the 2020 cycle, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2020/09/04/why-republicans-arent-really-campaigning-against-pelosi-490256\">Politico reported Friday</a>. The GOP may have dropped their attacks on Pelosi in part because Democrats took back the House — flipped 41 seats — in 2018.</p><p>For her part, the 30-year-old democratic socialist has leveraged her massive social media following and influence on the left to endorse and campaign for fellow progressives.</p><p>Sen. Ed Markey leaned heavily on Ocasio-Cortez's support to win his competitive Massachusetts primary against Rep. Joe Kennedy on September 1. Markey ran as the more progressive Democrat in the race, touting his work with Ocasio-Cortez on the Green New Deal and positioning himself as a fighter for a younger, grassroots left.&#160;</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez cut <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk0M-qk--LY\">a 30-second ad</a> for Markey, while the senator featured her prominently in another ad that went viral.&#160;</p><p>But Democrats looking to win independent or right-leaning voters have stayed away from Ocasio-Cortez — and in at least one recent case, touted their opposition to her policies.&#160;</p><p>Democratic Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, who represents a rural purple New Mexico district, noted in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1301603952287416320\">a recent campaign ad</a> that she voted against \"AOC's fracking ban bill.\"&#160;</p><p>INSIDER conducted a SurveyMonkey Audience poll on a national sample August 7-8.

Ben McAdams</strong> will face Republican and former NFL football player <strong>Burgess Owens</strong> in Utah's 4th Congressional District.</p><h2>The candidates</h2><p>McAdams is the only Democratic member in Congress from Utah. He was formerly the mayor of Salt Lake County, a position he held for six years. McAdams is member of the <a href=\"https://bluedogcaucus-costa.house.gov/members\">Blue Dog Coalition</a> of fiscally conservative Democrats and sits on the Financial Services Committee and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.&#160;</p><p>In 2018, McAdams defeated Republican incumbent Rep. Mia Love by just <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Utah%27s_4th_Congressional_District\">697 votes</a> – a margin of 0.257 percentage points.</p><p>Owens is a former <a href=\"https://www.burgess4utah.com/resumebio\">safety in the National Football League</a> for the New York Jets and Oakland Raiders. Following his football career, Owens ran an electronics company with his brother which ultimately ended in Owens <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2020/07/06/meet-burgess-owens-utah/\">filing for bankruptcy</a>.</p><p>He later moved to Utah in 2012 and founded <a href=\"http://secondchance4youth.org/#about\">Second Chance 4 Youth</a>, a non-profit which supports incarcerated children. He frequently appears as a guest commentator on Fox News and spoke at the Republican National Convention.</p><p>On his campaign website, Owens cites some of the hardships he's faced in his life as motivating his fundamental belief in the power of hard work and the unique promise that America offers.&#160;</p><p>\"Seven years after my NFL retirement and business failure I experienced a long summer during which I worked a series of jobs necessary to support my family and start my journey out of poverty,\" <a href=\"https://www.burgess4utah.com/burgess-bio\">he wrote.</a> \"That included a day job as a chimney sweep followed by a midnight shift as a security guard. It was at the end of this long summer that I would begin a successful 25-year career in the corporate arena. \"</p><p>The liberal media watchdog organization Media Matters for America reported in late August <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-convention-speaker-and-candidate-burgess-owens-plagiarized-book-report-2020-8\">that Owens had plagiarized significant portions of his book</a> \"Why I Stand\" from Wikipedia, History.com, and several news publications.&#160;</p><h2>The district</h2><p>Utah's 4th Congressional District is located in the center of the state. It is home to much of Salt Lake County and parts of Utah, Juab, Sanpete counties, and a portion of Salt Lake City. The district was first included on the ballot in 2012 following new data from the release of the 2010 U.S. Census.</p><p>The central Utah district is <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2020-house/\">one of just thirty</a> in the United States which voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 but is currently represented by a Democrat.

Steve Chabot</strong> will face off against Democrat <strong>Kate Schroder</strong> in a hotly-contested race for Ohio's 1st Congressional District.</p><h2>The candidates</h2><p>Chabot was originally elected into the House in 1994, where he then represented Ohio's 1st Congressional district for 7 terms before being ousted in the 2008 election by Democrat Steve Driehaus. Chabot defeated Driehaus in 2010 and regained his seat, holding it for another 5 terms. Chabot's <a href=\"https://stevechabot.com/issues/\">campaign is centered upon</a> fiscally responsible government spending, protecting the country against cybersecurity threats, and revitalizing the U.S. economy.</p><p>Chabot previously served on the committees on Foreign Affairs and Judiciary. He is currently the Ranking Member of the <a href=\"https://smallbusiness.house.gov/about/membership.htm\">House Committee on Small Business</a>.</p><p>Schroder, a former healthcare researcher and consultant, was the vice president of the Clinton Health Access Initiative. In 2016, she was appointed to the Cincinnati Board of Health where she currently sits as a finance chair. A Hodgkin's Lymphoma cancer survivor, her <a href=\"https://kateforcongress.com/issues/\">campaign is focused on</a> improving access to affordable healthcare, reducing gun violence, adding new jobs, and improving federal and state infrastructure.&#160;</p><p>Two recent Democratic internal polls <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/house/ohio/\">point to a competitive race</a> between Chabot and Schroder. An internal poll conducted for the Schroder campaign from June 29 to July 2 <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/508362-internal-poll-shows-tight-race-brewing-in-key-ohio-house-race\">found Chabot ahead by two points</a>, 48% to 46.</p><p>Another internal poll conducted for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from July 13-15 found Schroeder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kirk_bado/status/1290637888716251136\">ahead by one point</a>, 47% to 46%, and Democratic nominee Biden leading President Donald Trump by three points, 48% to 45%.&#160;</p><h2>The district</h2><p>Ohio's 1st Congressional District is located in the southwestern region of the state and contains the western area of Cincinnati, the state's third-largest city. The district also includes Warren County and portions of Hamilton County as well.&#160;</p><p>This district voted for 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney by six percentage points and voted for Trump by 6.6 points in 2016, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1whYBonfwlgTGnYl7U_IH31G0JNYQ9QBIjDfqkZHkW-0/edit#gid=0\">according to the Daily Kos.</a></p><h2>The money race</h2><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&id=OH01&spec=Np;spec=N\">Center for Responsive Politics</a>, Chabot has raised $1.97 million, about $500,000 more than Schroder's $1.4 million. Schroder has $500,000 in cash on hand remaining compared to Chabot's $990,000.&#160;</p><h2>What some of the experts say</h2><p>The race between Chabot and Schroder is now rated as a \"toss-up\" by <a
