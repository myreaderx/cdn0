As our series comes to a close, there’s one final, yet critical, topic to examine: How to organize your core security intelligence team itself.</p>\n<p>Michael Jordan once said, “Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.” And he’s absolutely right. </p>\n<p>There’s no debate that machines process and categorize raw data exponentially faster than humans. On the flip side, humans are uniquely able to perform intuitive, big picture analysis that machines will never be able to achieve. That’s why <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-kit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the most effective security intelligence programs</a> combine the best of both worlds: a team of talented individuals with extensive experience and technical knowledge, bolstered by <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-automation-strategy/\">automated processes</a> that eliminate manual, time-consuming tasks and empower people to focus on rewarding, high-impact work. When people and machines are paired, each works smarter — <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/forrester-tei\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">saving time and money</a>, reducing human burnout, and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-definition/\">improving security overall</a>.</p>\n<p>So, how do you go about drafting your dream team of human security intelligence champions? Consider the upcoming Olympic Games as a model. Every country sends an elite team of athletes to compete in events. These teams of Olympians comprise a broader unit that represents their people and their country as one. This is the same way you should view your <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-kit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ultimate security intelligence program</a>. It’s not enough to just pick individuals for your all-star lineup. You have to consider how each individual will work together, play on each other’s strengths, and contribute to the collective outcome.</p>\n<p>As more and more organizations <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/cyber-threat-intelligence-survey-2020/\">embrace intelligence as a critical security function</a>, many are choosing to place a dedicated security intelligence team within the larger organizational structure of their security team. However, these specialized groups remain part of a larger coalition focused on a common goal: <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-program\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reducing risk and protecting the organization</a> from emerging attacks.</p>\n<p>In this final chapter, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we outline the processes, people, and technology that make up a dedicated security intelligence capability. We also explore how these teams use intelligence not just to judge risk, but also to <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/the-risk-business\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">drive business decisions</a>. Finally, we review ways to engage with intelligence communities for maximum impact.</p>\n<p>In previous chapters of “The Threat Intelligence Handbook,” we’ve looked at how to integrate threat intelligence capabilities within your already existing security processes. Having reached the final chapter, we now make a few suggestions about how to organize your core threat intelligence team itself.</p>\n<p>Now that we’re exploring how to create a team specifically committed to threat intelligence, it’s helpful to outline their differentiated responsibilities. Threat intelligence analysts will generally take on the following tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify current and future information security threats to the business’s strategic assets</li>\n<li>Answer the “who, how, and why” for any given attack</li>\n<li>Dissect attack <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/tactical-threat-intelligence/\">tactics, techniques, and procedures</a> (TTPs)</li>\n<li>Evaluate attacker TTP relevance and impact in the business context</li>\n<li>Identify opportunities to make high-level security architecture changes that will hinder an adversary’s specific TTPs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best threat intelligence programs involve strategic analysis centered around talented human resources who are supported by automated processes that take care of tedious tasks like processing data. This human-machine pairing is called the centaur model, which was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/how-combined-human-and-computer-intelligence-will-redefine-jobs/\" rel=\"noopener\" >originally theorized by chess legend Garry Kasparov</a>. He made this argument a few years ago: “Weak human plus machine plus better process was superior to a strong computer alone and, more remarkable, superior to a strong human plus machine plus inferior process.”</p>\n<p>One thing the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/machine-learning-cybersecurity-applications/\" rel=\"noopener\" >centaur model</a> highlights is how different groups working together and playing to their strengths will often succeed over individual groups that may be stronger pound for pound but can’t make a unified effort. This same lesson also extends to the question of where to place a threat intelligence team within the larger organizational structure of a security team — the right answer is often to be a specialized group, but one that remains part of a larger coalition.</p>\n<p>In this chapter from our new book, “<a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/book\" rel=\"noopener\" >The Threat Intelligence Handbook</a>,” which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we’ll explore in greater depth what that group should look like.</p>\n<h3>Dedicated, but Not Necessarily Separate</h3>\n<p>You can start your threat intelligence journey with people who continue to play other roles on different teams in the organization. At this point, two questions will arise:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Should there be a dedicated threat intelligence team?</li>\n<li>Should it be independent, or can it live inside another cybersecurity group?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answers are: yes, and it depends.</p>\n<h4>A Dedicated Team Is Best</h4>\n<p>As you develop a comprehensive threat intelligence program, you should build a team dedicated to collecting and analyzing threat data and turning it into intelligence. The sole focus of this team should be to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-relevance/\">provide relevant and actionable intelligence to key stakeholders</a>, including senior executives and members of the board.</p>\n<p>Dedication and a broad perspective are needed to ensure team members dedicate enough time to collecting, processing, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence that provides the greatest value to the enterprise as a whole, rather than yielding to the temptation to focus on the intelligence needs of one group or another.</p>\n<h4>Its Location Depends on Your Organization</h4>\n<p>Organizational independence, as shown in the image below, has its advantages, such as greater autonomy and prestige.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/core-threat-intelligence-team-1-1.png\" alt=\"Threat Intelligence Organization\" /></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Threat intelligence as an independent group in the cybersecurity organizational structure.</p>\n<p>However, these advantages can be completely offset by the jealousies and political issues caused by creating a team with a new high-level manager and its own budget that pulls budding threat intelligence analysts out of their existing groups. </p>\n<p>A dedicated threat intelligence team does not necessarily need to be a separate function reporting directly to a VP or the CISO. It can belong to a group that already works with threat intelligence. In many cases, this will be the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/incident-response-information/\">incident response</a> group. This savvy approach can avoid conflict with entrenched security teams.</p>\n<h3>Picking the People</h3>\n<p>If you take a gradual approach to building your core threat intelligence team, start with individuals who are already in the cybersecurity organization and are applying threat intelligence to their particular areas of security. They may not have the title “threat intelligence analyst” or see themselves that way at first, but they can form the backbone of your emerging threat intelligence capability. </p>\n<h3>Core Competencies</h3>\n<p>We have emphasized that the threat intelligence function exists to strengthen other teams in the cybersecurity organization so they can better protect a specific enterprise. It is therefore critical that the threat intelligence team include people who understand the core business, operational workflows, network infrastructure, risk profiles, and supply chain, as well as the technical infrastructure and software applications of the entire enterprise.</p>\n<p>As the threat intelligence team matures, you&#8217;ll want to add members with the following skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Correlating external data with internal telemetry</li>\n<li>Providing threat situational awareness and recommendations for security controls</li>\n<li>Proactively <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/cyber-threat-hunting/\">hunting internal threats</a>, including insider threats</li>\n<li>Educating employees and customers on cyber threats</li>\n<li>Engaging with the wider threat intelligence community</li>\n<li>Identifying and managing information sources</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Collecting and Enriching Threat Data</h3>\n<p>We talked a little about sources of threat data in <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-lifecycle-phases/\">Chapter 1</a>. Here, we explore how a threat intelligence team can work with a range of sources to ensure accuracy and relevance.</p>\n<h4>The Human Edge</h4>\n<p>Threat intelligence vendors can provide some types of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/strategic-threat-intelligence/\">strategic intelligence</a>, but you can also develop in-house capabilities to gather information about the topics and events most relevant to your enterprise.</p>\n<p>For example, you could develop an internal web crawler that analyzes the web page code of the top 5,000 web destinations visited by your employees. This analysis might provide insights into the potential for drive-by download attacks. You could share the insights with the security architecture team to help them propose controls that defend against those attacks. This kind of threat intelligence generates concrete data, which is much more useful than anecdotes, conjecture, and generic statistics about attacks. </p>\n<h4>Additional Sources</h4>\n<p>Proprietary sources that can strengthen your threat intelligence resources include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vendor or ISAC feeds</li>\n<li>Whitelists</li>\n<li>Blacklists</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/leading-threat-research/\">Threat intelligence team research</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Combining Sources</h4>\n<p>An automated threat intelligence solution enables the threat intelligence team to centralize, combine, and enrich data from multiple sources before the data is ingested by other security systems or viewed by human analysts on security operations teams.</p>\n<p>The image below shows the elements of an automated threat solution. In this process, information from a threat intelligence vendor is filtered to find data that is important to the enterprise and specific cybersecurity teams. Then, it is enriched by data from internal threat intelligence sources and output in formats appropriate for targets such as SIEMs and incident response systems. This automated translation of data into relevant insights is the very essence of threat intelligence.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/core-threat-intelligence-team-2-1.png\" alt=\"Threat Intelligence Platform\" /></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">A threat intelligence platform can centralize, combine, and enrich data, then format it for multiple target systems. (Source: Recorded Future)</p>\n<h4>The Role of Intelligent Machines</h4>\n<p>Advances in <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/machine-learning-threat-intelligence/\">machine learning</a> and natural language processing (NLP) can bring additional advantages to the threat intelligence team. With the right technology, references to threats from all sources can be rendered language-neutral, so it can be analyzed by humans and machines regardless of the original language used. We’ve reached the point where <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/artificial-intelligence-information-security/\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) components have successfully learned the language of threats and can accurately identify “malicious” terms.</p>\n<p>The combination of machine learning, NLP, and AI offers huge opportunities for organizations to leverage threat intelligence. Not only can these technologies remove language barriers, but they also can reduce analyst workloads by taking on many tasks related to data collection and correlation. When combined with the power to consider multiple data and information sources concurrently to produce genuine threat intelligence, these capabilities make it far easier to build a comprehensible map of the threat landscape.</p>\n<h3>Engaging With Threat Intelligence Communities</h3>\n<p>Threat intelligence cannot flourish in a vacuum. External relationships are the lifeblood of successful threat intelligence teams. No matter how advanced your team might be, no single group can be as smart individually as the threat intelligence world as a whole.</p>\n<p>Many threat intelligence communities allow individual enterprises to share relevant and timely attack data so they can protect themselves before they are victimized. Engaging with trusted communities such as ISACs is crucial for decreasing risk, not just for your individual enterprises, but also for the entire industry and the cybersecurity world at large. Participation requires time and resources — for example, to communicate with peers via email and to attend security conferences — but relationship building must be a priority in order for threat intelligence to be successful.</p>\n<h3>Get &#8216;The Threat Intelligence Handbook&#8217;</h3>\n<p>The full chapter of the book also details the four different types of threat intelligence — <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/strategic-threat-intelligence/\">strategic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/tactical-threat-intelligence/\">tactical</a>, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/operational-threat-intelligence/\">operational</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/technical-threat-intelligence/\">technical</a> — and provides scenarios for how you would use them.

Assessments provided in this report are based on content in the Recorded Future Platform® and data from social media sites, local and regional news sites, academic studies, information security reporting, and other open sources available between January 1, 2020 and August 25, 2020. We compared this to historical data to determine changes in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to reveal cyber threats, information operations (IO), and hybrid threats that incorporate aspects of both cyber and IO actions.</em></p>\n<h3>Executive Summary</h3>\n<p>The threat landscape of the upcoming election differs from 2016 and 2018; threat actors and activity groups who previously targeted elections have largely remained on the sidelines. Consistent with 2016 and 2018, however, is that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat to the 2020 U.S. presidential elections, based on past success in conducting phishing and cyberattack operations, a relentless persistence in directly targeting U.S. democratic institutions and organizations, and the conducting of information operations targeting the U.S. electorate via conventional and social media. </p>\n<p>Contemporary Russian-directed information operations against the United States have been ongoing since at least 2016, with activity becoming more distributed internationally. Additionally, Russian threat activity groups continue to expand infrastructure and develop malware and exploits, but have been less active in targeting elections-related entities. Despite the lack of observable Russian state-sponsored hack-and-leak operations since January 2020, we cannot rule out the possibility of a leak appearing before the November election, given how damaging such activities were in advance of the 2016 vote. Russian threat actors and activity groups likely will continue to conduct cyberattacks and pursue information operations against the U.S. electorate up to, and even after, election day. </p>\n<p>Unattributed threats to the election also remain a significant concern, the most salient of these being burgeoning conspiracy theories and their adherents in the form of the QAnon and Boogaloo movements. Additionally, non-attributable activity from cybercriminal or other elements possess capabilities to disrupt or harm the U.S. election and warrant constant vigilance on dark web and underground sources. </p>\n<div class=\"content-box-summary\">\n<h3>Key Judgments</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Russian advanced persistent threat groups likely pose the greatest threat to the 2020 U.S. presidential election, despite a lack of identified activity against these targets to date; this assessment is based on past efforts against the 2016 and 2018 U.S. elections as well as identified retooling, development, and ongoing activity by <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/13/2002476465/-1/-1/0/CSA_DROVORUB_RUSSIAN_GRU_MALWARE_AUG_2020.PDF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">U.K.</a> intelligence agencies.</li>\n<li>Information operations likely continue to play a major role in disrupting the U.S. domestic social and political environments ahead of the election; ongoing research initiatives from <a href=\"https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford Cyber Policy Center</a>, <a href=\"https://graphika.com/reports\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Graphika</a>, and others have described how these efforts have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/16/878169027/study-exposes-russia-disinformation-campaign-that-operated-in-the-shadows-for-6-\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">evolved</a> since 2016 and indicated how such operations continue to target elections <a href=\"https://fsi.stanford.edu/news/poland-ndp-disinformation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">internationally</a> to disseminate deceptive information.</li>\n<li>Although no election-related hack-and-leak operations linked to Russian threat actors have been identified to date, it remains likely that such content could appear in advance of the election; there is historical <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-macron-cyber-idUSKBN17Q200\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">precedent</a> for entities like APT28 to distribute such data in a delayed manner.</li>\n<li>Ransomware likely poses an additional threat to elections-related infrastructure; carefully timed ransomware attacks within key battleground states have the potential to cause some limitations but are deemed unlikely to fully disrupt the 2020 election.</li>\n<li>Non-state groups also likely pose an information operations, influence, or protest threat to the elections; although not directly linked to Russian threat actors, Russian overt and covert influence operations have taken an interest in these groups and are amplifying their content and could potentially hijack or leverage these groups to conduct disruptive activities.</li>\n<li>The U.S.’s <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-25/cybersecurity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">defensive posture</a> and response to real or perceived cyber operations can present challenges for any would-be attackers, but is unlikely to completely deter any determined threat group.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Russia-Sponsored Elections Interference Efforts: 2016 and 2018</h3>\n<p>In 2016 and in 2018, Russian state-sponsored threat actors conducted an unprecedented campaign against the United States presidential and midterm elections, targeting political parties, candidates, and infrastructure associated with the vote. A U.S. government investigation into the intrusions, information operations (IO), and other corresponding activities, conducted by Robert Mueller III, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> that the effort was primarily led by entities associated with the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU, also called the Main Directorate [GU]) with support from organizations like the Information Research Agency (IRA). The Russian Main Directorate/Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces is the primary military intelligence entity within the Russian Federation. This organization <a href=\"https://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Documents/News/Military%20Power%20Publications/Russia%20Military%20Power%20Report%202017.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">conducts</a> strategic and tactical foreign intelligence tasks for the Russian government. It is composed of subunits, several of which are engaged in cryptography, signals intelligence, disinformation, and intrusion activity. The IRA is a commercial media entity that has <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">specifically</a> been engaged in social media influence operations.</p>\n<h3>Threat Actors</h3>\n<p>Ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, three Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups were involved in targeted intrusion activity; some of these threat actors also acted as “hybrid threats,” due to their involvement in information operations as well as targeted intrusions. The primary threat actors were identified as APT28, APT29, and the Main Intelligence Directorate/Main Directorate (GRU/GU) Unit 74455, which is tracked as Sandworm.</p>\n<p><center><img style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/us-election-russia-threats-1-1.png\" alt=\"Organizational Chart of GRU/GU Units\" /></center></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Organizational chart of GRU/GU units involved in 2016 election interference (Source: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/from-bitly-to-x-agent-how-gru-hackers-targeted-the-2016-presidential-election/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ars Technica</a>)</p>\n<p>APT28 and APT29 were engaged in targeted intrusions against the DNC, DCCC and other elections-related individuals and organizations. Additionally, personnel from GRU/GU Unit 26165 were identified in a Department of Justice (DoJ) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">indictment</a> in association with both the APT28 activity, as well as engaging in separate, information operations efforts. Personnel from GRU/GU Unit 74455 — the organization associated with Sandworm activity — was also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">indicted</a> by the DoJ for their role in elections interference efforts (such as hack-and-leak operations); however, none of the custom malware attributed to Sandworm was identified on networks impacted by the intrusions. For that reason, efforts to interfere with the 2016 election conducted by this organization are identified by unit name (Unit 74455) as opposed to threat activity group designator (Sandworm).</p>\n<p>Several other Russian groups have been linked to election interference activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On January 25, 2018, the Dutch Intelligence Agency (AIVD) publicly <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180702070510/https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/dutch-agencies-provide-crucial-intel-about-russia-s-interference-in-us-elections~b4f8111b/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shared</a> information identifying APT29 operators engaged in intrusions against the Democratic National Convention (DNC) and connecting it to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Services (SVR). The <a href=\"https://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Documents/News/Military%20Power%20Publications/Russia%20Military%20Power%20Report%202017.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SVR</a> is responsible for foreign espionage, active measures, conducting electronic surveillance in foreign nations, and more.</li>\n<li>Also in 2018, Estonian Intelligence Services released <a href=\"https://www.xn--vlisluureamet-bfb.ee/pdf/raport-2018-ENG-web.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reporting</a> that APT29 operations were associated with both the SVR and the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).</li>\n<li>According to a Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">indictment</a>, two GRU/GU military units associated with APT28 and Sandworm — Unit 26165 and Unit 74455, respectively — used false front actors DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and AnPoland, as well as employed Wikileaks, to launder exfiltrated data and to claim responsibility for intrusions against targeted resources.</li>\n<li>Finally, Russian-based troll farms — most notably the Internet Research Agency (IRA) — conducted mass dissemination of disinformation or inflammatory material in order to destabilize the U.S. domestic social environment ahead of the election, working as a force multiplier for other operations conducted by APT28, Sandworm, and APT29.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2018, some of these same threat activity groups and influence operations targeted the U.S. midterm elections. APT28 conducted <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-19-microsoft-phishing-2018-election.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">spearphishing</a> operations aimed at three candidates running for legislative office. Although it is unclear if these efforts were successful, Microsoft released information identifying the likely targets of this activity as the U.S. Senate, a political think tank, and a political non-profit. The DoJ also brought a criminal <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-charged-interfering-us-political-system\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">complaint</a> against Russian influence operations entities for “&#8230;advertisements on social media platforms, registration of domain names, the purchase of proxy servers, and “promoting news postings on social networks,” among other things. The U.S. reportedly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cyber-command-operation-disrupted-internet-access-of-russian-troll-factory-on-day-of-2018-midterms/2019/02/26/1827fc9e-36d6-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">took action</a> to deter the latter by targeting the St. Petersburg-based IRA, taking them temporarily offline. Although some of their operations were purportedly disrupted, Russian efforts to target American democratic processes remained largely undeterred and, even at that time, it was apparent that the Russian state-sponsored threat actors were adapting their strategy. </p>\n<h4>Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)</h4>\n<p>Some of the main TTPs conducted by these threat groups in both the 2016 and 2018 elections can be broken down as follows: </p>\n<p><center><img style=\"width: 700px;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/us-election-russia-threats-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"Recorded Future Table\" /></center></p>\n<h4>Victimology</h4>\n<p>These groups targeted a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wide range</a> of U.S. democratic institutions. In the 2016 presidential election, threat actors targeted <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/russia-election-hacking-playbook/?intcid=inline_amp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">political parties</a>, <a href=\"https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-google-accounts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">candidates</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rsatter/tracing-fancy-bears-paw-prints-6f17e6b82fa4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">campaign staff</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/12/26/did-russia-really-hack-2016-election-088171\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">elections contractors (such as VR Systems)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/13/15791744/russia-election-39-states-hack-putin-trump-sessions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">states’ boards of elections</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/russian-hacking-elections.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">voter registration data</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vocativ.com/372088/bradley-foundation-hack-clinton-cammpaign-fake-files/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">charitable foundations</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.volexity.com/blog/2016/11/09/powerduke-post-election-spear-phishing-campaigns-targeting-think-tanks-and-ngos/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">think tanks</a>, and the American populace as a whole. In the 2018 midterm election, the scope of the targeting was largely narrowed to <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-hackers-new-target-a-vulnerable-democratic-senator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">candidates and campaign staff</a> and Americans on social media. A narrowing of the target scope may have been the result of limitations to threat actor operations due to increasing security around vulnerable elections infrastructure, a byproduct of the midterm elections being viewed as less consequential to the threat actor, or the result of a lack of necessity (i.e. it may not be necessary to conduct intrusions into infrastructure hosting voter registration data frequently as that information does not change drastically in short spans of time).</p>\n<h3>Threat Actor Activity Since January 2020</h3>\n<p>Since January 2020, several Russian APT groups have been active against U.S.-based entities not related to the elections, as well as international entities with a potential nexus to the election. Although Recorded Future has not identified any direct intrusion activity by threat activity groups against U.S. elections infrastructure, candidates, political parties, or voting efforts as of this writing in advance of the 2020 presidential election, that does not preclude such efforts from materializing. Recorded Future has found that, in this same time frame, Russian APT groups have been developing malware which could potentially be used to target elections-related entities. Furthermore, Recorded Future identified infrastructure development, evolving TTPs, and changes to malware during this same time frame. </p>\n<p>Although it is very likely that Russian threat actors have improved their operations, these threat groups have also continued to use some of the same approaches to intrusions that they have historically applied. Therefore, changes to operations and shifts in behavior are likely not indicative of a wholesale abandonment of previous tools, but rather an example of both flexibility in adapting operations when necessary and pragmatism in ensuring the mission is completed successfully. </p>\n<h4>Activity Targeting the Candidates and Political Parties</h4>\n<p>It is likely that threat actors maintain an ongoing interest in the candidates, their affiliates, and the U.S. political parties more broadly because of their role in the campaign or their relationships with those involved in the election. This assessment is based, in part, on a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/8dbf7c5f0f5eb02243683ea7ba7e64dd?\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> which indicates that the Russian government is attempting to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The reporting did not elaborate on what interference efforts would entail; however, Recorded Future searched for any Russian state-sponsored threat actor activity aimed at incumbent President Donald Trump, his family, or high-profile individuals associated with the campaign since January 2020, but found no references to any such efforts as of this writing. Open-source searches likewise did not yield any relevant content. We also searched for any activity attributed to Russian state-sponsored threat actors aimed at former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Kamala Harris, the Biden family, the Harris family, or other high-profile individuals associated with the campaign since January 2020. There were no indicators of intrusion activity against these individuals. </p>\n<p>Since January 2020, there have been no indications of Russian APTs targeting the Republican National Committee (RNC), National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), or the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC). Similar research into Russian APT groups’ targeting of the DNC or the Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC) identified a total of 20 instances — all to historical items; none were indicative of any present or imminent threat aimed at the DNC or DCCC. Although these searches do not appear to reveal any ongoing or imminent threat against the political parties, as of this writing, it also does not preclude such efforts from the list of potential threats either. These references may be summarized generally as follows: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two results were references in social media to historical reporting associated with the 2016 intrusion into the DNC.</li>\n<li>At least six of these references were found in forum posts focused on disputing the assessments and findings of the intelligence community and information security industry in attributing the 2016 U.S. presidential election interference operations to Russian APT groups.</li>\n<li>One local news website also disputed the intelligence community findings.</li>\n<li>10 references were to news websites or court documents associated with the reporting of Russian APT activity against the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</li>\n<li>One item that referenced this activity has since been removed from social media.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Threat Actors</h3>\n<h4>APT28</h4>\n<p>Since January 2020, APT28 has engaged in a number of activities, such as infrastructure development, attempted spearphishing, and malware development. Of these, only spearphishing has a potential nexus to the election, specifically an alleged <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/us/politics/russian-hackers-burisma-ukraine.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">phishing attack against Burisma Holdings</a>. </p>\n<h4>Attempted Spearphishing Activity</h4>\n<p>On January 13, 2020, cybersecurity firm Area 1 released a <a href=\"https://cdn.area1security.com/reports/Area-1-Security-PhishingBurismaHoldings.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> titled “Phishing Burisma Holdings,” which outlined spearphishing attempts they attribute to the GRU/GU against Burisma Holdings, an energy company in Kiev, Ukraine. According to the report, the campaign, active since at least November 2019, employed domains which mimicked those used by legitimate partners or subsidiaries linked to Burisma Holdings. Burisma Holdings is of particular interest, as Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden previously served on the board of Burisma Holdings. A simultaneous effort unrelated to the phishing attempt, as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/for-months-trump-allies-hunted-for-tapes-of-biden-in-ukraine-now-theyre-turning-up/2020/06/30/f3aeaba8-a67b-11ea-8681-7d471bf20207_story.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in the Washington Post, detailed multiple attempts by current U.S. administration affiliates to solicit information regarding audio recordings of Biden in relation to former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. This activity included the solicitation of information from Andriy Derkach, a Ukrainian parliament member with ties to Russian-sympathetic groups.</p>\n<p>One of the TTPs described in the Area 1 report includes the use of websites which mirror genuine login pages across multiple attack surfaces (for example, mimicking a Roundcube installation and Outlook 365 logins via Sharepoint) in an effort to obtain credentials for the targeted entities. This TTP aligns with previous methodologies <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/08/20/we-are-taking-new-steps-against-broadening-threats-to-democracy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">employed</a> by APT28 during the 2018 U.S. midterm election as well as the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In the course of the campaign, the threat actor leveraged various email-related authentication technologies to establish legitimacy. In particular, the threat actor used Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) (cryptographic hash), both of which are used by a recipient to verify the identity of a sender. In doing so, the threat actor registered their SPF with a yandex[.]net Mail Exchange (MX) record, suggesting this action was conducted by a Russian-based threat actor.</p>\n<p>APT28 has previously conducted “hack and leak” type operations, targeting entities to obtain sensitive information which is later dumped in an effort to harm either the targeted entity or affiliated organizations and individuals. These have included efforts against the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/microsoft-says-it-has-found-a-russian-operation-targeting-us-political-institutions/2018/08/20/52273e14-a4d2-11e8-97ce-cc9042272f07_story.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">campaign</a> of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in addition to <a href=\"https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-09/wada-confirms-attack-by-russian-cyber-espionage-group\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">organizations</a> associated with international sports during the 2016 Olympics. Given its involvement in these campaigns and the nexus between Burisma Holdings and the U.S. and Ukrainian political climates, chances are about even that this threat activity group is conducting this campaign in an effort to obtain information for later distribution as part of an information operation.</p>\n<p><center><img style=\"width: 700px;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/us-election-russia-threats-2-1.png\" alt=\"Recorded Future Timeline\" /></center></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Screenshot of Sharepoint, ADFS, OneDrive domain and certificate registrations (Source: <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Recorded Future</a>)</p>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<p>U.S. officials or organizations have a greater awareness of and are more prepared for the potential of foreign interference to the November 2020 elections. Russian threat actors or activity groups are likely sensitive to measures the U.S. has taken to defend the 2020 elections and factoring that into their calculus. Based on these changes, it is likely any threat activity that may emerge from Russia against the 2020 U.S. presidential election will manifest differently from past efforts.  </p>\n<p>Russian threat activity groups who had conducted intrusions and operations against political parties and candidates in 2016 and 2018 have largely refrained from acting as of this writing. Although there has been no identified activity from Russian threat activity groups against elections-related entities yet, there has been activity by these groups in relation to malware development and intrusions against other entities in the U.S. Additionally, there have been attempts to spearphish entities abroad that have a nexus to the election, due to their association with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. It is unclear at the time of writing if those efforts were successful. Recorded Future notes that, in a separate effort, some audio content has begun to be released that appears to relate to Biden, although this content has not been validated by third-parties as authentic or unaltered. Given that threat activity groups like APT28 have previously waited to release information they have obtained via targeted intrusions in order to maximize their impact, it is possible that a similar approach to delayed information release could occur in advance of the election.     </p>\n<p>Information operations are much more amenable to threat actor anonymity and very difficult to combat. Recorded Future observes that such operations remain an ongoing and real threat to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Recorded Future has identified how the presence of Russian domestic and foreign operations conducted by the One Africa, One Success WhatsApp group, EBLA, and troll farms in Nigeria and Ghana reveal a shift away from more centralized and controlled operations to distributed and resilient information operations networks. Although many such efforts have been identified and taken down, there are still likely more remaining, operating unseen. While the fragmentation of such operations could point to the success of a U.S. operation to disrupt IRA influence efforts during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, it is likely that they also reveal a degree of persistence and resilience of these operations, in the near term. </p>\n<p>Russian threat actors or activity groups actively <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sought</a> to use domestic American assets to bypass social media’s increasingly difficult advertising restrictions against foreign nationals, as well as to increase the difficulty in accurately detecting false personas or personas influenced by nefarious objectives. As social media platforms continue to limit the availability of advertisements and ability for foreign nationals to engage in U.S. political discourse, we continue to expect that engagement with Americans will remain a priority by Russian influence operations assets to bypass ad restrictions, establishing intelligence assets, and astroturf divisive content.</p>\n<p>The expansion of conspiracy groups like QAnon or anti-government groups like the Boogaloo movement pose an additional threat to the election. These leaderless groups have the potential to be infiltrated and co-opted by a foreign threat actor seeking to disrupt the election. Adherents to the QAnon conspiracy have already displayed a willingness to engage in “information warfare” and several of their followers have committed criminal acts. In a similar fashion, several adherents to the Boogaloo Movement have committed murder or attempted murder and attempted domestic terrorism in the hopes of acting on their anti-government creed, to bring about a second U.S. civil war. The group has had a visible presence in recent “reopen” and BLM protests, appearing in body armor and heavily armed. This group presents itself both as a physical threat to election security, should the group choose to target election-related assets or polling places, as well as an online threat to spreading disinformation, which could eventually skew towards election related topics in an anti-government narrative.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: This post was an excerpt of a full report.

The speed at which business is conducted today combined with the ever-evolving threat landscape requires organizations to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence/\">look at security holistically</a>. </p>\n<p>Every security use case benefits from tailored intelligence, collection, analysis, and workflow automation. Security intelligence delivers those outcomes and easily scales to additional functions and processes while enabling organizations to integrate their institutional knowledge, data, and insights from previous initiatives. That’s why security intelligence has the unprecedented ability to drive <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-program\">every security initiative and strategic decision</a>. </p>\n<p>Security intelligence from Recorded Future provides the following <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/clients/\">business benefits to organizations</a> ranging from small, private companies to the largest, most influential enterprises and governments in the world:</p>\n<h4>Business Benefits, Reduced Risk, and Stakeholder Alignment</h4>\n<p><center><img style=\"width: 700px;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/security-intelligence-business-benefits-1-1.gif\" alt=\"Business Animation\" /></center></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/the-risk-business\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">business value of security intelligence</a> is most clearly demonstrated in its ability to align data with operational outputs that are relevant to an organization. To truly add value to the organization, security teams need to apply three contextual lenses to their strategies: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>How is a threat linked or associated to the business?</li>\n<li>How severe is the threat, and how likely is it to present risk to the organization?</li>\n<li>How is a threat relevant to different functions and who are the stakeholders?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This involves making sure your intelligence is scoped and scaled to your organization — its people, processes, procedures, assets, threats, and risk tolerance. When these contextual lenses are applied, security teams are able to accurately <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/security-operations-response/\">assess and respond to risk</a>, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/closing-vulnerability-gaps/\">prioritize vulnerabilities efficiently</a>, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-automation/\">detect and block threats automatically</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-business-case/\">positively contribute to the organization’s bottom line</a>. </p>\n<h4>See the Future With Dynamic, 360-Degree Visibility</h4>\n<p><center><img style=\"width: 700px;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/security-intelligence-business-benefits-2-1.gif\" alt=\"Lighthouse Animation\" /></center></p>\n<p>Visibility is required to solve every security security challenge, because no one can defend against an invisible adversary. Security intelligence empowers security teams with a contextualized, real-time understanding of internal and external threat environments. This turns what were once dangerous blindspots into strategic advantages for defending your organization. </p>\n<p>With the threat landscape in constant motion, successful decision-making is dependent on the quality of insights a security team is able to generate. However, with <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/security-intelligence-graph-retrospective/\">predictive analytics</a>, security intelligence even takes visibility a step further than that. With <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/intelligence-cards/\">predictive risk scores</a>, defenders are able to anticipate their attackers’ next move instead of just reacting to already executed attacks.</p>\n<h4>Operational Efficiency, Integration, and Automation</h4>\n<p><center><img style=\"width: 700px;\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/assets/security-intelligence-business-benefits-3-1.gif\" alt=\"Computer Animation\" /></center></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/integrations/#integrations_list\">Integrating within your organization’s existing technology stack</a>, security intelligence reduces the manual, resource-intensive processes that exhaust security teams. Specifically, rather than researching individual security events and threats by scouring information spread across a variety of dashboards and platforms, <a
