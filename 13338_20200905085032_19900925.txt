Think of the Queen Elizabeth — the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there’s a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It’s a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it’s going right by you, that it’s left you altogether. But if you’re doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go. So I said, “Call me Trim Tab.”</p>\n<p>The truth is that you get the low pressure to do things, rather than getting on the other side and trying to push the bow of the ship around. And you build that low pressure by getting rid of a little nonsense, getting rid of things that don’t work and aren’t true until you start to get that trim-tab motion. It works every time. That’s the grand strategy you’re going for. So I’m positive that what you do with yourself, just the little things you do yourself, these are the things that count. To be a real trim tab, you’ve got to start with yourself, and soon you’ll feel that low pressure, and suddenly things begin to work in a beautiful way.”<br />\n — <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/21/buckminster-fuller-trim-tab/\">Buckminster Fuller</a></p></blockquote>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:29:47 +0000","feedId":13338,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1bf9b660722c23d1936027cfddf9deb7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"swissmiss","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295799520},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:49:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:49:59","title":"Walking in Heavy Thunderstorm at Night in NYC","link":"https://www.swiss-miss.com/?p=78635","description":"<p><iframe width=\"801\" height=\"451\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BOa0zQBRs_M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Sound on!</p>\n<p><em>(Via <a href=\"https://chrisglass.com\">Chris Glass</a>)</em></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 11:16:59 +0000","feedId":13338,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e6231bc0fee31ee976d9fee1e33b31bb","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"swissmiss","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295799521},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:49:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:49:59","title":"How Much Heart People Invest","link":"https://www.swiss-miss.com/?p=78569","description":"<blockquote><p>“The only calibration that counts is how much heart people invest, how much they ignore their fears of being hurt or caught out or humiliated.
