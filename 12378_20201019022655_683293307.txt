At the heart of the EBM\r\napproach is the assumption of a distribution of relaxation spectra tied to rock grain boundary and\r\ninterior granular mobility. Furthermore, the model incorporates an asymptotic long-term limiting\r\nbehavior that is Maxwellian. Here we use the extensively developed linear theory of viscoelasticity\r\nto isolate those parameters of EBM that apply to both post-seismic relaxation processes involving\r\nflow of olivine rich upper mantle material and to studies of tides, where periods of forcing range\r\nfrom 12 h to 18.6 years. The isolated EBM parameters should also apply to theoretical and geodetic\r\nstudi...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":12378,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a63ada8e3a3c2e5ea0f7a717caab5286","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"E R Ivins, L Caron, S Adhikari, E Larour and M Scheinert","publishedOrCreatedDate":1603074415067}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 10:26:55","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 10:26:55","feedId":12378,"fetchDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 02:26:55 +0000","fetchMs":42163,"handleMs":11355,"totalMs":53519,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"ece275485f4775949e63194d7e1d21ce","hostName":"us-016*","requestId":"d31abd4790444825b5923a77c3eb8bed_12378","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:37:35","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:22:18","id":12378,"name":"Reports on Progress in Physics - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/?rss=1","subscriber":250,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn11@2020_1/2020/10/19/02-26-54-176_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Reports on Progress in Physics","weekly":null,"link":"http://iopscience.iop.org"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603074361548,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":42164,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":11355,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
