The new pairing assistant guides you step by step through pairing Wear emulators with physical or virtual phones directly in Android Studio! You can start by going to <em>Device Dropdown &gt; Wear OS emulator pairing assistant</em>. Note that this will currently pair with the Wear OS 2 companion, and a Wear companion for the new release will be coming soon. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/creating#pairing-assistant\">Learn more</a>. <li><strong>Virtual Heart Rate Sensor</strong> - The emulator now has a virtual heart rate sensor, including support for the Heart Rate Sensor API, to help you create and test apps that respond differently to activity levels. <em>Make sure you are running at least Android Emulator v30.4.5 downloaded via the Android Studio SDK Manager.<br /></em> </li> </li></li> \n    </ul> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FjliXLO0Gw0/YKL2TF8TRqI/AAAAAAAAQhU/uTHckQkFgVIz_HIz-Ug5EWUwRbiYQZUFACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/heart_rate.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\" New Virtual Heart Rate Sensor in the Wear emulator allows the virtual heart rate to be adjusted with a slider bar \" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FjliXLO0Gw0/YKL2TF8TRqI/AAAAAAAAQhU/uTHckQkFgVIz_HIz-Ug5EWUwRbiYQZUFACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/heart_rate.gif\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n    </center> <p> We also announced a new watch face design tool built by Samsung.

And with Wear soon to feature a completely new consumer experience based on the latest from Material Design, we‚Äôve updated our design guidelines to cover the new design system, UI components, UX patterns, and styles. <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/design\">Learn more</a>. </p> <h2><strong>New Jetpack APIs</strong></h2> <p> From new Jetpack APIs tailored for small (round or square) screens and designed to optimize battery life to the Jetpack Tiles API, we‚Äôre adding a number of new features to help you build great Wear experiences, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Wear versions and devices: </p> \n    <ul> \n     <li><strong>Tiles</strong> - Tiles give users fast, predictable access to the information and actions they rely on most. We‚Äôve now opened up Tiles for developers, and we‚Äôve already been working with several early access partners to add Tiles to their apps. Here are a few coming soon: </li> \n    </ul> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W_s73Ka5ykA/YKPsBNo3H4I/AAAAAAAAQj8/oVgkYGSmAOA6zaMJsZmPH73k8ItpOk5QwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-18%2Bat%2B12.31.16%2BPM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"New tiles in development from Adidas, Sleep Cycle, Hole 19, Outdooractive, Calm, Flo, and Golfpad\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W_s73Ka5ykA/YKPsBNo3H4I/AAAAAAAAQj8/oVgkYGSmAOA6zaMJsZmPH73k8ItpOk5QwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-18%2Bat%2B12.31.16%2BPM.png\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n    </center> <p>The Tiles API is in alpha and supported on devices running Wear OS 2 and up, so you can create Tiles for all the devices in the Wear ecosystem.

This platform provides fitness and health data generated from sensors, contextually-aware algorithms, and all-day health monitoring. You can use the APIs to create high quality, powerful fitness and health experiences for wearables with a simpler development experience. The platform handles all the work to manage your hardware and sensors for you, removing one of the biggest challenges in managing it yourself - knowing when to stop work so the battery doesn't drain. The alpha of this Health Services platform is available today. <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/health-services\">Learn more</a>. <li><strong>Other new APIs</strong> - We‚Äôve released several other new APIs in Jetpack to make wearable app development easier, including support for curved text, input, watch faces, complications and remote interactions.

Google TV has generated a lot of excitement from consumers, developers, and industry partners alike, offering a content forward TV experience that helps the user discover more of the movies and shows they love. Google TV is available on streaming devices like the Chromecast with Google TV, smart TVs from Sony (and soon TCL!), and as an app on Android devices. Check out this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O3BhUSEu8gg\">presentation</a> on how to get your app ready for Google TV. </p> <p> Our goal is to always enable you to build better and more engaging experiences on Android TV OS. One example of this is the widely utilized Watch Next API which increases app re-engagement by ~30% in certain cases<sup>1</sup>. Well over 100 major media partners are already using WatchNext API and you can learn more about how to add your app <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/tv/discovery/watch-next-add-programs\">here</a>. </p> <p> We are also announcing several new tools and helpful features to make developing for Android TV OS easier and enable you to create engaging experiences for your users. Some are already available and some will be available soon: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li> <em>Cast Connect with Stream Transfer and Stream Expansion</em><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_tv_receiver/core_features\">: Cast Connect</a> allows users to cast from their phone/ tablet or Chrome browser onto your app on Android TV. Stream Transfer and Stream Expansion allow users to transfer media to other devices and/or play audio on multiple devices. </li> \n   <li> <em>Emulator updates:</em> To help you make your app work better on Google TV without requiring new hardware, we are now making our first Google TV Emulator available, running on Android 11. There will also be an Android 11 image with the traditional Android TV experience. You can now also use a remote that more closely mimics TV remotes directly within the Emulator. </li> \n   <li> <em>Firebase Test Lab:</em> Firebase Test Lab runs millions of tests every week on behalf of developers. Following requests from developers, we are excited to share that Firebase Test Lab is adding Android TV support. Firebase Test Lab Virtual Devices run your app in the cloud on Android TV emulators and allow you to scale your test across hundreds or thousands of virtual devices.

For developers, we‚Äôre giving you more tools to build delightful experiences for people on phones, laptops, tablets, wearables, TVs, and cars. </p> <p> There‚Äôs a lot to explore in Beta 1, starting with the most significant UI update to Android yet, created with a design language that we call <a href=\"https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you\">Material You</a>. There are new privacy features to try too, like approximate location, and a new standard called Performance Class that lets apps and users identify high-performing devices. </p> <p> Try Android 12 Beta today on Pixel devices by <a href=\"https://www.google.com/android/beta\">enrolling here</a>. Thanks to our device-maker partners who are working to accelerate updates, you can now get the Beta on other devices as well, including select devices from ASUS, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, TCL, Transsion, Vivo, Xiaomi, and ZTE, with others on the way.

We rethought the entire experience, from the colors to the shapes, light and motion, making Android 12 more expressive, dynamic, and personal. This work is being done in deep collaboration between our software, hardware and Material Design teams, and we‚Äôre unifying our software and hardware ecosystems under a single design language called <a href=\"https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you\">Material You</a>. </p> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/hGLAJopHf04/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SbNslCeckd8/YKMMSibcdXI/AAAAAAAAQh0/AHE9ssE2i0sx_CZOJY5Nf-07tYH4kxA2wCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled.jpeg \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"Android 12 UI\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SbNslCeckd8/YKMMSibcdXI/AAAAAAAAQh0/AHE9ssE2i0sx_CZOJY5Nf-07tYH4kxA2wCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled.jpeg \" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n    </center> <p> We‚Äôve extended the new design language across the platform and UI components, so your apps will get these upgrades automatically. </p> <p> <strong>Redesigned widgets</strong> - Along with the design changes in Android 12 we‚Äôve refreshed app widgets to make them more useful, beautiful, and discoverable. We added <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/widgets#new-compound-buttons\">new interactive controls</a> like checkboxes, switches, and radio buttons and made <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/widgets#apply-configuration-options\">personalizing widgets easier</a>. Android 12 widgets look great with our system UI and themes, with rounded corners and padding automatically adapted to every launcher and home screen. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/widgets#provide-responsive-layouts\">Responsive layouts</a> let you adapt widgets to phones, tablets, foldables, and other screens. We also added <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/hGLAJopHf04/ https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/widgets#dynamic-colors\">dynamic color APIs</a> so your widgets can use system colors to create a personalized but consistent look. And we‚Äôre making widgets easier to discover through an improved widget picker and an integration with the Assistant.

The stretch effect provides a natural vertical and horizontal scroll-stop indicator that‚Äôs common across all apps, and it‚Äôs enabled by default for scrolling containers across the platform and AndroidX. The new stretch overscroll replaces the glow overscroll supported in previous versions. Make sure to test your apps and content with the new scrolling behavior, and if needed you can opt out. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/overscroll\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Smoother audio transitions </strong>- UI isn't just about the visuals. We've also improved the way that audio focus is handled. When an app loses audio focus, its audio is automatically faded out, providing a smoother transition between apps which play audio, and preventing apps from playing over each other. This is particularly relevant in foldable and multi-screen Android environments. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/audio-focus-improvements\">More here.</a> </p> <h2><strong>Performance</strong></h2> <p> With Android 12, we‚Äôve made significant and deep investments in performance - from foundational performance that makes the system and apps faster and smoother, to a new standard for high-performing devices that helps developers deliver richer experiences on those devices. </p> <p> <strong>Faster, more efficient system performance</strong> - We reduced the CPU time needed for core system services by 22%, so devices will be faster and more responsive. We also improved Android's power efficiency by reducing the use of big cores by the system server by 15% to help devices run longer before needing to charge. </p> \n     <center> \n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3InI7FNnLWE/YKMNQZlgzVI/AAAAAAAAQiE/wLmymP8zKvYJsXWV5D-0PGa8qDpXtrhaQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2021-05-13%2B15-09-28.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"Sampled rate , omn big core\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3InI7FNnLWE/YKMNQZlgzVI/AAAAAAAAQiE/wLmymP8zKvYJsXWV5D-0PGa8qDpXtrhaQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2021-05-13%2B15-09-28.png\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n     </center> <p> We improved transitions and app startup times by reducing lock contention and latency variability, and we optimized I/O for faster app loading. In PackageManager, a read-only snapshot reduced lock contention by as much as 92%. In Binder, lightweight caching radically improved latencies up to 47x in targeted calls. In I/O, we accelerated dex/odex/vdex files to improve app load times, especially on low-memory phones. Our restriction on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#notification-trampolines\">notification trampolines</a> also helps reduce latency for apps started from a notification. For example, the Google Photos app now launches 34% faster after moving away from notification trampolines. </p> <p> To improve database query performance we‚Äôve optimized CursorWindow by inlining results in Binder transactions. For small windows, CursorWindow is 36% faster, and for windows over 1000 rows the improvements are as high as 49x. </p> <p> <strong>Performance class</strong> - Starting with Android 12 and working together with our ecosystem partners, we‚Äôre introducing a common standard for high-performing Android devices. </p> <p> This standard, called <em>performance class</em>, defines a set of capabilities that go beyond Android's baseline requirements. Devices that meet the performance class requirements can support more demanding use-cases and deliver higher quality content. Developers can <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION.html#MEDIA_PERFORMANCE_CLASS\">check for performance class at runtime</a> and then reliably deliver enhanced experiences that take full advantage of the device‚Äôs performance. </p> <p> Initially, we‚Äôre focusing performance class capabilities on media use-cases, with requirements including camera startup latency, codec availability and encoding quality, as well as minimum memory size, screen resolution and read/write performance. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/performance-class\">More here.</a> </p> <h2><strong>Private by design</strong></h2> <p> Privacy is at the heart of everything we do, and in Android 12 we‚Äôre continuing to give people more transparency and control while keeping their devices and data secure. Today we announced several new privacy features that will be coming in Beta 2 - Privacy Dashboard, microphone and camera indicators, and microphone and camera toggles. Stay tuned for more on these features. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new in Beta 1. </p> <p> <strong>App hibernation</strong> - Last year we launched <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/permissions#auto-reset\">permissions auto-reset</a>, and over the last two weeks, Android has reset permissions for over 8.5 million apps that weren‚Äôt being used - so apps that people have forgotten about can‚Äôt still access their data. In Android 12 we‚Äôre building on permissions auto-reset by intelligently hibernating apps that have gone unused for an extended period - optimizing for device storage, performance and safety. Hibernation not only revokes permissions granted previously by the user, but it also force-stops the app and reclaims memory, storage and other temporary resources. In this state the system also prevents apps from running jobs in the background or receiving push notifications, helping to keep users safe. Hibernation should be transparent for most apps, but if needed, direct users to Settings to turn off this feature for your app. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#app-hibernation\">More here</a>. </p> \n     <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"> \n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t2u1XR8xvbI/YKMN1bW8sQI/AAAAAAAAQiM/DkHHleEwSjguvbYnZQ5camGJYLnnxq1MQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Location_Accuracy_Android12.gif\" style=\"display: block; padding: -10em; text-align: center; \"><img style=\"width:260px\" id=\"floatRight\" alt=\"Android 12 device location\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"784\" data-original-width=\"784\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t2u1XR8xvbI/YKMN1bW8sQI/AAAAAAAAQiM/DkHHleEwSjguvbYnZQ5camGJYLnnxq1MQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Location_Accuracy_Android12.gif \" /></a> \n     </div> <p> <strong>Nearby device permissions</strong> - Previously, Bluetooth scanning required apps to have the location permission, which was a challenge for apps that needed to pair with nearby devices but didn‚Äôt actually need the device location. We‚Äôre now allowing apps to scan for nearby devices without needing location permission. Apps targeting Android 12 can scan using the new <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#BLUETOOTH_SCAN\">BLUETOOTH_SCAN</a></code> permission with the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#usesPermissionFlags\">usesPermissionFlags=\"neverForLocation\"</a> </code>attribute. After pairing with a device, use the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#BLUETOOTH_CONNECT\">BLUETOOTH_CONNECT</a></code> permission to interact with it. These permissions promote privacy-friendly app design while reducing friction for apps. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/bluetooth-permissions\">More here</a>. <p> <strong>Approximate location</strong> - Recently we‚Äôve given people better ways to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/location/permissions\">manage access to location</a>, such as through separate permissions for foreground and background access and an ‚Äúonly this time‚Äù option. Now for apps targeting Android 12, we‚Äôre offering even more control with a new ‚Äúapproximate location‚Äù option. When apps request precise location data, users can now choose to grant either precise or approximate location. Users can also change an app‚Äôs location precision at any time from Settings. If your app requests precise location data (<code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\">ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</a></code>), keep these changes in mind and make sure your app functions properly with approximate location only. For almost all general uses of location, we recommend asking for approximate location (<code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\">ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</a></code>) only. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#approximate-location\">More here</a>. <h2><strong>App compatibility</strong></h2> <p> If you haven‚Äôt tested your app for compatibility with Android 12 yet, now is the time to do it! With Android 12 in Beta, we‚Äôre opening up access to early-adopter users as well as developers, on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices\">Pixel and other devices</a>. This means that in the weeks ahead, expect many more users to be trying your app on Android 12 and raising any issues that they find. </p> <p> To test for compatibility, install your published app from Google Play or other source on a device or emulator running Android 12 Beta and work through all of the app‚Äôs flows. Review the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all\">behavior changes</a> to focus your testing. After you‚Äôve resolved any issues, publish an update as soon as possible. </p> <p> With Beta we‚Äôre getting closer to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/overview#platform_stability\">Platform Stability</a> in August 2021. Starting then, app-facing system behaviors, SDK/NDK APIs, and non-SDK lists will be finalized. At that time, finish up your final compatibility testing and release a fully compatible version of your app, SDK, or library.

When folded, you can fit a tablet-sized screen in your pocket ‚Äî unlocking utility that was previously unavailable on a portable device. Thinking about our app ecosystem, we‚Äôre excited because this is a hardware shift that is driving new expectations around what you can do from a handheld device. We see the demand for larger screens extending to tablets too, which have greatly increased in popularity, given the similar app experience. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EljZ5-h_wV4/YKLyZOhq4vI/AAAAAAAAAHk/AK8Rj3zjIbUA_ESW8cgF8hEXE1fKZ6YowCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image10.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"Technological breakthroughs and our understanding of ergonomics have played a role in device form factors.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"231\" data-original-width=\"600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EljZ5-h_wV4/YKLyZOhq4vI/AAAAAAAAAHk/AK8Rj3zjIbUA_ESW8cgF8hEXE1fKZ6YowCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image10.gif\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" id=\"imgCaption\"><em>Technological breakthroughs and our understanding of ergonomics have played a role in device form factors.</em></p> <p> In this blog post, we'll explain what you should do to prepare your apps for large screens, and how recent updates have made developing your app easier. But first, let‚Äôs talk about what we're seeing with large screens ‚Äî and why you should optimize your app. </p> <h1>Why large screens</h1> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oR_4ZO51FIk/YKLy8VBLvCI/AAAAAAAAAHs/HtwHri_0f7oyLCDk7Wli_qDKaDgkAKFmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image9.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"There are many ways to use foldable devices, including a number of postures\n  illustrated here.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"198\" data-original-width=\"871\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oR_4ZO51FIk/YKLy8VBLvCI/AAAAAAAAAHs/HtwHri_0f7oyLCDk7Wli_qDKaDgkAKFmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image9.png\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" id=\"imgCaption\"><em>There are many ways to use foldable devices, including a number of postures illustrated here.</em></p> <p> Over the past year, we‚Äôve seen device makers release exciting new foldable and tablet devices. Demand has increased as users are doing more than ever from these devices. Altogether, developers can reach more than 250 million active foldables, tablets, and Chromebooks by building for Android large screen devices today. Sales of tablet devices grew 16% in 2020 with analysts expecting more than 400 million Android tablets by 2023, and foldables are redefining what‚Äôs possible on premium devices. Android apps can also run on ChromeOS, which is now the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56116573\">second most popular</a> desktop OS. </p> <h1>Large screen ready</h1> <p> Larger screens are changing how users interact with their device. These devices allow you to edit slide decks while looking at notes, look up restaurant recommendations while planning a night out, or watch a video while chatting with friends. Let‚Äôs talk about base-level support ‚Äî features an app must support to be ‚Äúlarge screen ready‚Äù. There are three main areas of focus when it comes to large screen readiness: </p> \n    <ol> \n     <li>Designing for large screens</li> \n     <li>Multitasking</li> \n     <li>Input modes</li> \n    </ol> <p> They‚Äôre summarized below, but make sure to check out our <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screens-app-quality\">large screen app quality guidelines</a> for the full details. </p> <h2>Design for large screens</h2> <p> The first step is to ensure that your app is designed for large screens. To make this easier, we‚Äôve defined specific window size breakpoints and device classes for you to optimize for. Add tablet layouts for displays where the shortest dimension is &gt;600dp, and ensure your apps <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/gestures/edge-to-edge\">go edge-to-edge</a>. Developers should also plan for their app to be used in both portrait and landscape modes, since larger screens are more likely to be used in landscape. We‚Äôve got material adaptive components that we‚Äôll be talking about to help developers make better use of the increased space. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lZoOir9Kkkc/YKLzqnG85II/AAAAAAAAAH0/Szu0jmG3rjIQWVSDpLEEPRKpRCd_GVMhgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image4.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"Since foldable and large screen devices have a variable window size, adaptive\n  layouts work better than splitting experiences based on screen size.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"223\" data-original-width=\"927\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lZoOir9Kkkc/YKLzqnG85II/AAAAAAAAAH0/Szu0jmG3rjIQWVSDpLEEPRKpRCd_GVMhgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image4.png\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" id=\"imgCaption\"><em>Since foldable and large screen devices have a variable window size, adaptive layouts work better than splitting experiences based on screen size.</em></p> <h2>Multitasking</h2> <p> Going into split screen (or multi-window mode) and gestures like drag and drop are starting to become natural interactions that users expect to work seamlessly in their large screen devices. Your apps should handle multitasking seamlessly by being resizable. Handling folding and unfolding events and planning for your app to be in multi-window mode prevents your app from becoming letterboxed. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EAjPyCQ3pdM/YKLz_P6FaWI/AAAAAAAAAH8/9v-B5fdxapM9g9BPP2Z00nSRM17S5TGbgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image12.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"Drag and drop can be a natural interaction in large screen layouts, even within the same\n  app.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1500\" data-original-width=\"1500\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EAjPyCQ3pdM/YKLz_P6FaWI/AAAAAAAAAH8/9v-B5fdxapM9g9BPP2Z00nSRM17S5TGbgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image12.png\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" id=\"imgCaption\"><em><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/drag-drop\">Drag and drop</a> can be a natural interaction in large screen layouts, even within the same app.</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m0AupDyjhf8/YKL0xrkwqWI/AAAAAAAAAIE/aZgAUPMWf24sq09gz180YPsQpkytnZnwgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image6.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"By enabling multiple instance support, users can run multiple copies of your\n  app side-by-side.

For example, a messaging app that lists messages on one side with the message detail on the other. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zU_VLtkAWrk/YKL12ZwrkaI/AAAAAAAAAIU/K2RQzY7bkmE66SD2SqGYvg9dVQvr7gTEgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"SlidingPaneLayout automatically adapts to configuration changes to provide a good user experience across different layout sizes.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"308\" data-original-width=\"542\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zU_VLtkAWrk/YKL12ZwrkaI/AAAAAAAAAIU/K2RQzY7bkmE66SD2SqGYvg9dVQvr7gTEgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image3.png\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" id=\"imgCaption\"><em> SlidingPaneLayout automatically adapts to configuration changes to provide a good user experience across different layout sizes.</em></p> <p> UIs that would be one top of each other on a smaller screen can now easily lay out side-by-side. For this, you can use the updated version of the <code> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/slidingpanelayout\">SlidingPaneLayout</a> </code> library ‚Äî updated to support a two-pane style layout, <code> SlidingPaneLayout </code> uses the width of the two panes to determine how to lay out the UI. It does that by automatically determining if it can lay out side-by-side based on the content width and available space. For example, if the list pane is measured to have a minimum width of 200dp and the detail pane needs 400dp, then the <code> SlidingPaneLayout </code> automatically shows the two panes side by side if it has at least 600dp of width available. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jVqvDC29TXk/YKL2wyK_85I/AAAAAAAAAIc/aKeNhMyUnu8dnMjFk4ACmkx76_eAYf1qQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"SlidingPaneLayout is used in our sample application IOSched.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1164\" data-original-width=\"1999\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jVqvDC29TXk/YKL2wyK_85I/AAAAAAAAAIc/aKeNhMyUnu8dnMjFk4ACmkx76_eAYf1qQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image1.png\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" id=\"imgCaption\"><em>SlidingPaneLayout is used in our sample application <a href=\"https://github.com/google/iosched\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IOSched</a>.</em></p> <p> We have updated the library to recognize and adapt to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/window/FoldingFeature\"> folds and hinges </a>. For example, if you are on a device with hinges that blocks part of the screen, it will automatically place your content on either side. </p> <p> We have also introduced <strong>lock modes</strong>,which allow control over the swipe behavior when panes overlap (programmatically switching is also supported). For example, to prevent users from swiping to an empty pane you may want them to have to click on a list item to load information about that pane, but allow them to swipe back to the list. On a foldable device or tablet that has room to show both views side by side, the lock modes are ignored. </p> <h2>NavRail</h2> <p> A <a href=\"https://material.io/components/navigation-rail\">vertical Navigation Rail</a> is functionally equivalent to Bottom navigation, and provides a more ergonomic navigation experience on larger screens. As you scale your UI, NavRail supports better reachability, since larger screens tend to be held by the side, whereas on the phone users are probably holding the device from the bottom. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RluQ9tduxbs/YKL3uOXZ2aI/AAAAAAAAAIk/3Y1vDPsVuzkEuGu5umggpgLn5zoYCZi-gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image11.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"NavRail automatically changes the location of the navigation menu depending\n\ton configuration changes.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"249\" data-original-width=\"281\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RluQ9tduxbs/YKL3uOXZ2aI/AAAAAAAAAIk/3Y1vDPsVuzkEuGu5umggpgLn5zoYCZi-gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image11.png\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" id=\"imgCaption\"><em>NavRail automatically changes the location of the navigation menu depending on configuration changes.</em></p> <p> For example, NavRail can help if vertical scrolling is key to your app. In those cases, a bottom navigation bar decreases the amount of content that‚Äôs visible, especially when tablet devices are being used in landscape orientation. </p> <h2>Other Components</h2> <p> We've also made updates across multiple other components. One of the biggest pitfalls when apps move to a larger screen is when UIs are stretched edge-to-edge across the whole screen. To help prevent this, we‚Äôve added default Max Width values to certain Material Components where this commonly happens, for example: </p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Buttons</li> \n     <li>TextFields</li> \n     <li>Sheets</li> \n    </ul> <p> We will add more components to this list in the future. These changes provide opinionated defaults to help your apps adapt and look better out of the box on large screen devices. Find more information about using size constraints with components in <a href=\"https://material.io/design/layout/component-behavior.html\">the Material Design guidelines</a>. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bMkfE5YJw9Q/YKL4MlVjJHI/AAAAAAAAAIs/AQCX18Hs2VUjzd2CMtz4i5-uQrK7Af4lQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image7.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:500px\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"Most foreground UI elements should have a maximum width value.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1000\" data-original-width=\"871\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bMkfE5YJw9Q/YKL4MlVjJHI/AAAAAAAAAIs/AQCX18Hs2VUjzd2CMtz4i5-uQrK7Af4lQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image7.gif\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" id=\"imgCaption\"><em>Most foreground UI elements should have a maximum width value.</em></p> <h2>WindowManager Jetpack library</h2> <p> Beyond component updates to help you scale your UI, we also have the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window\">WindowManager Jetpack library</a> to help you build better experiences on these devices. This library is now available in alpha and it provides a common API surface for supporting different device types, starting with foldables and tablets. </p> <p> You can use WindowManager to detect display features such as folds or hinges. It also gives information about how the display feature affects your app, so you can create an optimal experience. For example, reacting to the foldable device state changes when the device is folded into tabletop mode while the user is watching a video. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D2rVNrNhv4Q/YKL4nYihv2I/AAAAAAAAAI0/d6qRP4ye1FgpZfZ4gatV3FKVBDT0nSHAwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image5.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"Applications should seamlessly adapt to a growing number of device configurations.\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"441\" data-original-width=\"963\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D2rVNrNhv4Q/YKL4nYihv2I/AAAAAAAAAI0/d6qRP4ye1FgpZfZ4gatV3FKVBDT0nSHAwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image5.png\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\" id=\"imgCaption\"><em>Applications should seamlessly adapt to a growing number of device configurations.</em></p> <p> WindowManager also provides a couple of convenience methods to retrieve the current and maximum <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/window/WindowMetrics\">WindowMetrics</a> information in a backward compatible way, starting from API level 14. </p> <h1>Platform changes</h1> <h2>Display API deprecations</h2> <p> Your app needs to determine the screen or display size in order to render content appropriately for each device. With the introduction of the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowMetrics\">WindowMetrics API</a>, a number of methods related to display size have been deprecated. For a backwards-compatible replacement, you should use the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window\">Window Manager Jetpack library</a>. </p> <h2>Exclusive resources</h2> <p> Android 10 introduced the possibility to have multiple resumed apps running at the same time, with a single ‚Äútop resumed‚Äù application. Most applications benefit from this change without the need of updates. The most notable exception is if your application uses an exclusive resource like the microphone or the camera. See <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/android-at-large-how-to-bring-optimized-experiences-to-the-big-screen-a50a6784e59d\">our previous blog post</a> for more details. </p> <h1>Case studies</h1> <p> Optimizing your app for large screens can improve the experience for your users, as well as deliver on business results. We‚Äôre seeing an increased number of apps take advantage of the opportunities with large screens on Google Play. As an example, <a href=\"http://d.android.com/stories/apps/google-duo\">Google Duo</a> implemented tablet and foldable support to enhance their user experience, and saw an increase in app ratings and user engagement. </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a

Earlier this year, we <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/boosting-dev-success.html\">announced</a> an additional service fee tier to help boost developer success on Google Play. Starting July 1st, the service fee will be 15% instead of 30% for your first $1M (USD) of earnings each year. You‚Äôll be able to enroll for the new rate in Play Console the week of June 7th, so we‚Äôre <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10632485\">sharing details</a> about the process now to give you time to get ready. </p> <p> <h2>New tools for managing policy compliance</h2> </p> <p> 2. We‚Äôve built a new, dedicated Policy and Programs section in Play Console to provide you with a centralized place to see any policy compliance concerns, guidance on how to fix policy issues, and information about upcoming policy changes. </p> <p> <h2>More SDK guidance</h2> </p> <p> 3. The new Google Play SDK Console lets providers report issues with their SDK versions so we can give you better guidance and recommendations. We‚Äôve started with several large SDK providers and will continue to add more. </p> <p> 4. Later this year, we‚Äôre launching a new, public website with important insights about popular SDKs to help you choose the right SDK for your app. Learn more about how we‚Äôre helping you build safer and more stable apps in the I/O session below. \n     <center> \n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/apHcQXxMUIs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n     </center> <p> <h2>Helping more users discover your apps and games</h2> </p> <p> 5.

One million apps are in production using the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle\">Android App Bundle</a>, with 15% size savings on average vs a universal APK. The app bundle is the future of publishing on Google Play and, <strong>starting August 1, 2021, they‚Äôll be required for all new apps</strong>. </p> <p> 8. Based on developer feedback, we'll soon be launching an optional code transparency feature to offer additional cryptographic assurance that your app‚Äôs code on device has not been modified from its original version. </p> <p> <h2>Identify growth opportunities with our new competitive insights</h2> </p> <p> 9.

Your global reach just got even larger: In 2020, we added 34 new local forms of payment across 30 markets around the world. </p> <p> 12. We lowered the <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/sub-dollar-pricing-expansion-in-20.html\">minimum prices</a> developers can set for paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions in 20 new markets across Latin America, EMEA, and APAC. </p> <p> 13. This year, we‚Äôll be launching multi-quantity purchases, which will allow your users to buy more than one item at a time from the cart. </p> <p> 14. We‚Äôll also be launching multi-line subscriptions, which will allow you to sell multiple products as part of a single subscription. </p> <p> 15. And finally, we‚Äôll be launching prepaid plans, which will let you offer users access to content for a fixed amount of time. (Don‚Äôt worry, users can easily extend at any time.) </p> <p> 16. Want to take advantage of these new features? Many will be available when you integrate <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/48_y649MH8A/goo.gle/play-commerce\">Play Billing Library version 4.0</a>, and more will be rolling out later this year. As a reminder, <strong>new apps are required to integrate version 3.0 by August 2, 2021 or by November 1, 2021 for updates to existing apps</strong>. </p> <p> <h2>Program enhancements to engage and retain users</h2> </p> <p> 17. This year, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/console/about/googleplaypass/\">Google Play Pass</a> expanded to over 40 markets, with more than 800 games and apps.

As shared in the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTUt9mwfPS8\">What‚Äôs new in Android Privacy</a>‚Äù session, Android 12 continues to expand on this existing foundation by making the platform even more private. </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTUt9mwfPS8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> <p> This release will give users more transparency around the data being accessed by apps while providing simple controls to make informed choices. Android is also investing in reducing the scope of permissions so that apps only have access to the data they need for the features they provide. Let‚Äôs look at some of these important changes we‚Äôve made in Android 12 to protect user privacy. </p> <p> <strong>Privacy dashboard: </strong>Users often tell us that they want to understand what data apps use. With the new Privacy Dashboard, users will have a simple and clear timeline view of the last 24 hour accesses to location, microphone and camera. You can also share more context about your app‚Äôs data usage with a new permission intent API in Android 12. The Privacy dashboard will be available to try in Beta 2. </p> <p> We encourage all developers to review your code and understand data access needs, including those in third-party SDKs, and make sure all accesses have justifiable use cases. To help with that, in Android 11 we added <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/audit-access\">Data access auditing APIs</a> to make it easy for you to audit your current data access. Use the APIs to untangle mapping of your code by tracking which part of your code accesses private data. The Privacy dashboard will be available to try in Beta 2. </p> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/Ulzl5Vg5bWA/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--U1ovcwneck/YKMTTeJGHeI/AAAAAAAAQi0/tESBgovjzdMAfupStekIArK5PNGQN_zhwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled.gif \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"Privacy dashboard and location access timeline\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--U1ovcwneck/YKMTTeJGHeI/AAAAAAAAQi0/tESBgovjzdMAfupStekIArK5PNGQN_zhwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled.gif\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n     <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Figure 1. Privacy dashboard and location access timeline in the past 24 hours. </p> \n    </center> <p> <strong>Microphone and camera indicators: </strong>In Android 12 we‚Äôre adding transparency to microphone and camera access. Going forward, users will know in real time when an app accesses their microphone or camera feeds. By simply going into Quick Settings, users can view the apps accessing their data. If the access is unwarranted, users can quickly navigate to the app permission page to revoke permissions. </p> <p> Developers should review their use of microphone and camera and proactively remove unexpected access. For example, you should ensure that your app does not access these sensors before the user clicks on a feature that needs access. The Microphone and camera indicators will be available to try in Beta 2. </p> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HuzH3M099T8/YKMT_0J0YfI/AAAAAAAAQi8/bDBojBs97A0_xAzIgUWh0jzXKEUDa2cuACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25281%2529.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\" Microphone and camera indicators and toggles\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HuzH3M099T8/YKMT_0J0YfI/AAAAAAAAQi8/bDBojBs97A0_xAzIgUWh0jzXKEUDa2cuACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25281%2529.gif\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n     <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Figure 2. Microphone and camera indicators and toggles. </p> \n    </center> <p> <strong>Microphone and camera toggles: </strong>You may have seen people placing stickers on cameras or plugging audio blockers into their phones. In Android 12, we‚Äôre introducing two new controls that allow users to quickly and easily cut off apps‚Äô access to the microphone and camera on the device. To ensure user safety, emergency calls will be exempted. </p> <p> If an app with permissions attempts to access the microphone or camera but the user has the sensors turned off, the system will display a message to inform the user that they must turn the sensors back on in order to use the app‚Äôs features. If your app follows <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/usage-notes\">permissions best practices</a>, then you don‚Äôt need to do anything different to incorporate the toggle state. The Microphone and camera toggles will be available to try in Beta 2. </p> <p> <strong>Approximate location:</strong> Over the last two releases, we‚Äôve made location permission fine grained. First, we separated background and foreground access. Then, we added an ‚Äúonly this time‚Äù option to further restrict access to background location. We‚Äôre seeing users respond positively to these controls and are choosing them more often. When given the option, users elect to share less through foreground location access about 80% of the time. </p> <p> In Android 12, we will give users more control over their location data. Users will have a clear choice regarding the precision of location provided to the app by selecting approximate location. </p> <p> We encourage you to review your use case for location and request <code> ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION </code> if your features don‚Äôt need the user‚Äôs precise location. You should also be prepared for users to reduce location precision. Please make sure your app still works when users select approximate. Approximate location will be available to try in Beta 1. </p> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/Ulzl5Vg5bWA/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-98jX3g1mzEo/YKMUgriePUI/AAAAAAAAQjE/mzlpynZb4V8LMPqywuph3rbjyvfVxQTvQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25282%2529.gif \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"Location permission request dialog with approximate and precise selection\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-98jX3g1mzEo/YKMUgriePUI/AAAAAAAAQjE/mzlpynZb4V8LMPqywuph3rbjyvfVxQTvQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25282%2529.gif \" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n    </center> <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Figure 3.

The recommended best practice is to only access the clipboard when the user understands why the access occured. Clipboard read notification will be available to try in Beta 2. </p> <p> <strong>Nearby device permissions: </strong>Android 12 minimizes data access by adding a new runtime permission for nearby experiences that do not use location. Up until now, apps such as watch and headphone companion apps required the location permission to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices for pairing. We heard from users and developers that this was confusing and led to granting the permission to access location data when it wasn‚Äôt needed. For apps targeting Android 12, you‚Äôll have the option to decouple nearby device discovery from the fine location permission for use cases like pairing devices by using the new <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#BLUETOOTH_SCAN\"> BLUETOOTH_SCAN</a> </code> permission and by declaring <code> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#usesPermissionFlags\">usesPermissionFlags=neverForLocation</a> </code>. Once the device is paired, apps can use the new <code> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#BLUETOOTH_CONNECT\">BLUETOOTH_CONNECT</a> </code> permission to interact with it. Apps that use Bluetooth scanning for location must still have the location permission. Nearby device permissions will be available to try in Beta 1. </p> <p> <strong>App hibernation: </strong>Last year we launched <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/permissions#auto-reset\">permissions auto-reset</a>. If an app isn‚Äôt used for an extended period of time, Android automatically revokes permissions for the app. In the last 14 days permissions were reset for 8.5M apps. This year we‚Äôre building on permissions auto-reset by intelligently hibernating apps that have gone unused for an extended period - optimizing for device storage, performance and safety. The system not only revokes permissions granted previously by the user, but it also force-stops the app and reclaims memory, storage and other temporary resources. Users can bring apps out of hibernation simply by launching the app. App hibernation will be available to try in Beta 1. </p> <p> Android 12 is our most ambitious privacy release to date. Along the way, we have engaged closely with our developer community to build a platform that puts privacy at the forefront while taking into consideration the impact on developers. We thank you for your continued feedback and support in making our platform private and safe for everyone.

The company was founded in 2013 in Japan, and it now is the largest smartphone-focused C2C marketplace in Japan. Mercari‚Äôs Client Architect Team started using <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose\">Jetpack Compose</a> in 2020 with the goal of using modern solutions and technologies that can scale for the long term to build their tech stack for new applications. </p> <h2>What they did</h2> <p> The Mercari team needed to implement a design system with complex state management and styling on Android Views ‚Äî a very complex task. Using Jetpack Compose, they were not only able to implement this complex system, it helped them spend less time developing each screen. </p> <p> Jetpack Compose also helped the team write UI code for their new app utilizing the design system, making their UI code concise and easy to understand. As a result, the team can spend more time writing screens and business logic, such as practical support for the dark theme. </p> <p> In addition, the Mercari team wrote a proof-of-concept tool for integrating Figma with the design system, which automatically generates UI code from the component designs. The team said that developing this tool was easier with Compose due to its declarative nature. </p> <p> <em>‚ÄúOnce Android developers get used to writing Jetpack Compose code, they wouldn‚Äôt wish to go back.‚Äù - Anthony Allan Conda, Android Tech Lead at Mercari </em> </p> <h2>Results</h2> <p> Between Jetpack Compose and their new design system, Mercari was able to use far less code to write screens. On screens with infinitely-scrollable content ‚Äî a common use case ‚Äî they actually reduced their code by about 56%. As a result, they were able to write more screens in the same amount of time, giving them more time to write business logic and other parts of the code. </p> <p> Also, they were able to do more with the UI itself, such as incorporating animations and using intuitive APIs such as <em>AnimatedVisibility</em>, <em>Crossfade</em>, and <em>Animatable</em>. </p> <p> Mercari is planning to continue using Jetpack Compose in their new application until its release. Their design system, with the Android SDK written in Jetpack Compose, is also designed to work with multiple applications within Mercari. </p> <h2>Get started</h2> <p> Learn more about <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose\">Jetpack Compose</a>. </p>\n    <div class=\"feedflare\"> \n     <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=tt9_NWj8E4o:UFYZSbrfLFM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n     <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=tt9_NWj8E4o:UFYZSbrfLFM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=tt9_NWj8E4o:UFYZSbrfLFM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n    </div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/tt9_NWj8E4o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p></p></img>\n</meta>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 21:01:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YGhph7EgqT8/YKMbWIAO4UI/AAAAAAAAQjM/nOffYqFRx-8n6Sc7uUk1fpmqpFEHUf9egCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/BlogHeader_Android.jpg ","linkMd5":"d5b606f7cb5497f1781dfa1f71143cbc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn5@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-11-841_fb6a71494301e74b.webp","destWidth":1,"destHeight":1,"sourceBytes":43,"destBytes":72,"author":"Google Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YGhph7EgqT8/YKMbWIAO4UI/AAAAAAAAQjM/nOffYqFRx-8n6Sc7uUk1fpmqpFEHUf9egCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/BlogHeader_Android.jpg ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn5@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-11-841_fb6a71494301e74b.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YGhph7EgqT8/YKMbWIAO4UI/AAAAAAAAQjM/nOffYqFRx-8n6Sc7uUk1fpmqpFEHUf9egCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/BlogHeader_Android.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn88@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-45-110_c656a4ce5697bba4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn17@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-44-600_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=tt9_NWj8E4o:UFYZSbrfLFM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn46@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-44-613_95ffd155b9044c66.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/tt9_NWj8E4o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-44-594_c96a26f4e13e6e9d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143700},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"What's new for Android developers at Google I/O","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/7BP9yIf-HTc/whats-new-for-android-developers-at.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b1_n6tOHvWU/YKMssWEjo-I/AAAAAAAAQjk/vIJQsAPUpRQKxR44GoCbm3CtRgr8tVBKACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Android_NewForDevelopers_1024x512_updated.png\"> \n <img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b1_n6tOHvWU/YKMssWEjo-I/AAAAAAAAQjk/vIJQsAPUpRQKxR44GoCbm3CtRgr8tVBKACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Android_NewForDevelopers_1024x512_updated.png\"> <p><em>Posted by Karen Ng, Director, Product Management &amp; Jacob Lehrbaum, Director of Developer Relations, Android &amp; Play </em><p> <p> As Android developers, we are all driven by building experiences that delight people around the world.

And here at Google, we love it too: 70+ Google apps like Drive, Home, Maps and Play use Kotlin. And with a brand-new native solution to annotation processing for Kotlin built from the ground up, Kotlin Symbol Processing is available today, a powerful and yet simple API for parsing Kotlin code directly, showing speeds up to 2x faster with libraries like Room. </p> <p> <h2>Android Jetpack: write features, not boilerplate </h2> </p> <p> With <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack\">Android Jetpack</a>, we built a suite of libraries to help reduce boilerplate code so you can focus on the code you care about. Over 84% of the top 10,000 apps are now using a Jetpack library. And today, we‚Äôre unpacking some new releases for Jetpack, including Jetpack Macrobenchmark (Alpha) to capture large interactions that affect your app startup and jank before your app is released, as well as a new Kotlin Coroutines API for persisting data more efficiently via Jetpack DataStore (Beta). You can <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/whats-new-in-jetpack.html\">read about all the updates in Android Jetpack here</a>. </p> <h2>Now is the time: a big step for Wear </h2> <p> The best thing about modern Android development is that these tools have been purpose built to help make it easy for you to build for the next era of Android, which is all about enabling devices connected to your phone‚ÄìTVs, cars, watches, tablets‚Äìto work better together. </p> <p> Starting today, we take <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/wear\">a huge step forward with wearables</a>. First, we introduced a unified platform built jointly with Samsung, combining the best of Wear and Tizen. Second, we shared a new consumer experience with revamped Google apps. And third, a world-class health and fitness service from Fitbit is coming to the platform. As an Android developer, it means you‚Äôll have more reach, and you‚Äôll be able to use all of your existing skills, tools, and APIs that make your mobile apps great, to build for a single wearables platform used by people all over the world. </p> <p> Whether it‚Äôs new Jetpack APIs for Wear tailored for small screens and designed to optimize battery life, to the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/wear-tiles\">Jetpack Tiles API</a>, so you can create a custom Tile for all the devices in the Wear ecosystem, there are a number of new features to help you build on Wear. And with a <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/health-services\">new set of APIs for Health and Fitness</a>, created in collaboration with Samsung, data collection from sensors and metrics computation is streamlined, consistent, and accurate‚Äìlike heart rate to calories to daily distance‚Äìfrom one trusted source. All this comes together in new tooling, with the release of Android Studio Arctic Fox Beta, like easier pairing to test apps, and even a virtual heart rate sensor in the emulator. And when your app is ready, users will have a much easier time discovering the world of Wear apps on Google Play, with some big updates to discoverability. You can <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/wear-os-at-io.html  \">read more about all of the Wear updates here</a>. </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/URx8_ZRR7ls\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> <p> <h2>Tapping the momentum of larger screens, like tablets, Chrome OS and foldables</h2> </p> <p> When it comes to larger screens -- tablets, foldables, and Chrome OS laptops-- there is huge momentum. People are increasingly relying on large screen devices to stay connected with family and friends, go to school, or work remotely. In fact, there are over 250 million active large screen Android devices. Last year, Chrome OS grew +92% year over year‚Äì5 times the rate of the PC market, making Chrome OS the fastest growing and the second-most popular desktop OS. To help you take advantage of this momentum, we‚Äôre giving you APIs and tools to make optimizing that experience easier: like having your content resize automatically to more space by using <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/slidingpanelayout#1.2.0-alpha02\">SlidingpaneLayout 1.2.0 </a>and a new vertical navigation rail component, Max widths on components to avoid stretched UIs, as well as updates to the platform, Chrome OS, and Jetpack windowmanager, so apps work better by default. <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/whats-new-in-foldables-tablets-and.html\">You can learn more here</a>. </p> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/7BP9yIf-HTc/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lCV9hv82PwI/YKMr5noyVpI/AAAAAAAAQjc/mKzieJLkumwJPwVp-psyuSnzGlTASlTXwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/unnamed%2B%25281%2529.png \" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"Google Duo's optimized experience for foldable devices\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lCV9hv82PwI/YKMr5noyVpI/AAAAAAAAQjc/mKzieJLkumwJPwVp-psyuSnzGlTASlTXwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/unnamed%2B%25281%2529.png \" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n     <p id=\"imgCaption\"> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/google-duo?hl=en\">Google Duo's</a> optimized experience for foldable devices </p> \n    </center> <p> This is just a taste of some of the new ways we‚Äôre making it easier for you to build high quality Android apps.

Today, 84% of the top 1000 apps on Google Play rely on Jetpack. </p> <p> Here‚Äôs a round-up of the latest updates in Jetpack - an extended version of our <em>What‚Äôs new in Jetpack</em> talk! </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xeQ9faYJktM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> <h2>New in Stable</h2> <strong>CameraX</strong> <p> The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/camerax\">CameraX</a> library provides a unified API surface for accessing camera functionality across OS versions, including device-specific compatibility fixes and workarounds. Some of the latest improvements to the library address common feature requests, including support for adjusting exposure compensation and access to more detailed information about camera state and features. Additionally, camera settings like FPS range can now be changed via <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/camera/camera2/interop/Camera2Interop\">Camera2Interop</a></code> while the camera is running. The library also brings support for the latest device and OS features, including high-dynamic-range preview, zoom ratio controls, and support for Android‚Äôs Do Not Disturb mode. Perhaps most importantly, though, the library has continued to address performance, resulting in faster image capture and faster initialization, especially on older devices. </p> <strong>Hilt</strong> <p> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android?hl=en\">Hilt</a> is Jetpack‚Äôs recommended dependency injection solution built on top of Dagger. As part of the transition to stable, Hilt‚Äôs <code>ViewModel</code> support has moved up into the core Hilt Android APIs and <code>SavedStateHandle</code> has been added as a default dependency available in the <code>ViewModelComponent</code>. Also, Hilt is now integrated with Navigation and Compose: you can obtain an annotated Hilt ViewModel that is scoped to a destination or the navigation graph itself. Developers have already started using Hilt in their apps. Read about their experience in <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/hilt-is-stable-easier-dependency-injection-on-android-53aca3f38b9c\">this blog post</a>. </p> <strong>Paging 3.0</strong> <p> The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview?hl=en\">Paging</a> library allows you to load and display small chunks of data to improve </p> <p> network and system resource consumption. This release features a complete rewrite in Kotlin with first-class support for coroutines and Flow, asynchronous loading with RxJava and Guava primitives, and overall improvements to the repository and presentation layers. </p> <p> The 3.0 release is a substantial improvement in usability over Paging 2, and the rewrite was planned with partial and staged migrations in mind so that developers can transition on their own schedules. Check out the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview\">Paging 3.0 documentation</a> and the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-paging#0\">Paging 3.0 codelab</a> for details and hands-on experience. </p> <strong>ConstraintLayout and MotionLayout</strong> <p> <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout?hl=en\">ConstraintLayout</a></code>, Jetpack‚Äôs flexible system for designing layouts, and <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/motionlayout?hl=en\">MotionLayout</a></code>, an API aimed at managing motion and widget animation, are now stable. <code>MotionLayout</code> now includes support for foldable devices, image filters, and motion effects. To find out more about what‚Äôs new in design tools, check out <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/t5nL9K4vNFg/ https://youtu.be/B1u7JZ1rLyE\">this Google I/O talk</a>. </p> <strong>Security Crypto</strong> <p> The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/security/data\">Security Crypto</a> library allows you to safely and easily encrypt files and <code>SharedPreferences</code>. To encrypt <code>SharedPreferences</code>, create an <code>EncryptedSharedPreferences</code> object with the appropriate key and scheme and then use it like a standard SharedPreferences object. </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">val prefs: SharedPreferences = EncryptedSharedPreferences.create(\n        context,\n        \"prefs_file_name\",\n        mainKey,\n        prefKeyEncryptionScheme = AES256_SIV,\n        prefValueEncryptionScheme = AES256_GCM,\n)\n// Use the resulting SharedPreferences object as usual.\nprefs.edit()\n    .putBoolean(\"show_completed\", true)\n    .apply()</pre> <strong>Fragment</strong> <p> Over the past year, the Fragment library has undergone a major effort to clean up its internal implementation and reduce undocumented behavior, making it easier for developers to follow best practices in their apps and write reliable tests. This lays the groundwork for future improvements to the library, like supporting multiple back stacks in Navigation, and it may require some work to accommodate strict enforcement of API contracts. In practice, you should pay careful attention to your tests after updating the library. Check out the Fragment <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/fragment\">release notes</a> to see specific cases to watch out for. </p> <p> Recent releases have also introduced <code>ActivityResult</code> integration, making it possible to register for <code>Activity</code> results from a fragment. Fragment has also added a new <code>FragmentOnAttachListener</code> interface to replace the less-flexible <code>onAttachFragment</code> method. Existing code that overrides this method in <code>Fragment</code> or <code>FragmentActivity</code> will still work, but we‚Äôve deprecated <code>onAttachFragment</code> to help prevent new code from accidentally adopting a less-flexible approach. </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// Obtain the fragment manager. May be a childFragmentManager,\n// if in a fragment, to observe child attachment.\nval fm = supportFragmentManager\n\nval listener = FragmentOnAttachListener {\n    fragmentManager, fragment -&gt;\n  // Respond to the fragment being attached.\n}\n\nfm.addFragmentOnAttachListener(listener)</pre> <h2>New in Beta</h2> <p> Once a library is feature complete it moves to Beta for stabilization. At this moment, the APIs change only in response to <strong>critical</strong> issues or community feedback. </p> <strong>DataStore</strong> <p> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore\">DataStore</a> provides a robust data storage solution that addresses the shortcomings of SharedPreferences while maintaining a simple, highly usable API surface. DataStore brings support for best practices like Kotlin coroutines with Flow and RxJava. DataStore allows you to store key-value pairs, via Preference DataStore or typed objects backed by protocol buffers, via Proto DataStore. You can also <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/using-datastore-with-kotlin-serialization-6552502c5345\">plug in</a> your own serialization solution, like Kotlin Serialization. </p> <p> </p> <h2>New in Alpha</h2> <p> Alpha libraries are libraries under active development‚ÄîAPIs may be added, changed, or removed, but what‚Äôs in the library is tested and should be highly functional. </p> <strong>AppSearch</strong> <p> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/search/appsearch\">AppSearch</a> is a new on-device search library which provides high performance and feature-rich full-text search functionality. Compared to SQLite, AppSearch supports multiple world languages, simplifies ranking query results, and offers lower latency for indexing and searching over large datasets. </p> <p> AppSearch 1.0.0-alpha01 is released with LocalStorage support, which allows your application to manage structured data, called ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù, and then query over it. Your application defines what the structure looks like using ‚Äúschema types‚Äù. For instance, you can model a Message as a schema type with data such as subject, body, and sender. </p> <p> Use builders to create documents of a schema type and then add them to storage. Querying for ‚Äúbody:fruit‚Äù will retrieve all documents with the term ‚Äúfruit‚Äù in the body of the Message. </p> <p> In Android S, AppSearch will also offer PlatformStorage so you can share your application‚Äôs data with other applications securely, and reduce your application‚Äôs binary size by not having to link additional native libraries. This is currently not available in Jetpack because the library doesn‚Äôt target the Android S SDK yet. </p> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RQrn4St_wGk/YKLrxCTi9yI/AAAAAAAAQg8/v3Sgr9aE9pw9UuvyWaDdHMxOaQ_CwUChwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-04-21%2Bat%2B10.39.07.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:400px\" alt=\"Centralized storage on Android S+ for integrating into device-wide search\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RQrn4St_wGk/YKLrxCTi9yI/AAAAAAAAQg8/v3Sgr9aE9pw9UuvyWaDdHMxOaQ_CwUChwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-04-21%2Bat%2B10.39.07.png\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n     <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Centralized storage on Android S+ for integrating into device-wide search </p> \n    </center> <strong>Room</strong> <p> Room is the recommended data persistence layer, providing increased usability and safety over the platform. </p> <p> Room 2.4.0-alpha brings support for <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/room-auto-migrations-d5370b0ca6eb\">auto-migrations</a>. When your database schema changes, you now declare an <code>@AutoMigration</code> and indicate from which version to which version you want to migrate, and Room generates the migrations for you. For more complex migrations, you can still use the <code>Migration</code> class: </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">@Database(\n-   version = 1,\n+   version = 2,\n    entities = { Doggos.class },\n+   autoMigrations = {\n+         @AutoMigration (from = 1, to = 2)\n+     }\n  )\npublic abstract class DoggosDatabase extends RoomDatabase { }</pre> <p> Room 2.3.0 stable version brings experimental support for <a href=\"https://github.com/google/ksp\">Kotlin Symbol Processing</a> which, in our benchmarks of Kotlin code showed a 2x speed improvement over KAPT, as well as built-in support for enums and RxJava3. </p> <p> Room has also introduced a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/room/RoomDatabase.QueryCallback\">QueryCallback</a></code> class‚Äîwhich provides a callback when SQLite statements are executed, to simplify tasks like logging‚Äîas well as the new <code>@ProvidedTypeConverter</code> annotation, which allows more flexibility when creating type converters. </p> <strong>WorkManager</strong> <p> The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager\">WorkManager</a> library‚ÄîAndroid‚Äôs recommended way to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that run even if the app exits or the device restarts‚Äîhas made improvements to reliability with task reconciliation, ensuring all tasks are executed, and a variety of workarounds for specific Android OS versions. </p> <p> The latest versions of WorkManager feature improved support for <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/workmanager-2-5-0-stable-released-701b668cd064\">multi-process apps</a>, including performance benefits from unifying work request scheduling to a single process and limiting database growth when scheduling many requests. </p> <p> Version 2.7‚Äînow in alpha, which is targeted to the Android S SDK‚Äîprovides additional support for the platform‚Äôs new foreground restrictions.

The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/emoji-compat\">EmojiCompat</a> library, which supports modern emoji on API 19 and higher, has moved to a new artifact <code>:emoji2:emoji2</code>, which replaces the previous <code>:emoji:emoji</code> artifact. The new <code>emoji2</code> library adds ü™Ñ automatic configuration using the AppStartup library (you don't have to add any code üë©üèø‚Äçüíª to display üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è)! </p> <p> AppCompat adds emoji2 starting with AppCompat 1.4. If your app uses AppCompat, users will see modern emoji ‚≠ê without any further configuration. Apps that aren't using AppCompat can add <code>:emoji2:emoji2-views</code>. For custom <code>TextViews</code>, you can support modern emoji by using the helpers in <code>:emoji2:emoji2-views-helpers</code> or by subclassing AppCompat views. </p> <h2>Jetpack Compose</h2> <p> <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/t5nL9K4vNFg/d.android.com/jetpack/compose\">Jetpack Compose</a> is Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Jetpack Compose is currently in beta, and planned to go <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/android-12-beta-1.html\">stable in July</a>. Many of the libraries listed here, as well as others that you might already be using, have introduced features specifically for integration with Jetpack Compose. Ranging from Activity to ViewModel, Navigation, or Hilt, all of these libraries can make adopting Compose in your app smoother. Find out more about about how to use them from this Google I/O talk: </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0z_dwBGQQWQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> <h2>Form factors</h2> <p> Jetpack makes it easier to work with different form factors, including foldables, large screen devices, and Wear devices. We've introduced new guidelines for large screen development along with improvements to Jetpack libraries such as <code>WindowManager</code> and <code>SlidingPaneLayout</code>. Read all the details in this <a href=\"http://goo.gle/foldables-tablets-large-screens\">blog post</a>. </p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p> This was a (relatively) quick overview of what‚Äôs new in Jetpack.

We'll be using code names in alphabetical order; the first is Arctic Fox, now in beta, and the next is Bumblebee, now in canary.</em></p> \n<p> Today, we are excited to unveil Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) Beta ‚ùÑÔ∏èü¶ä: the latest release of the official Android IDE focuses on Design, Devices, and Developer Productivity. It is available for <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/studio/preview\">download</a> now on the beta channel for you to try out all the new features launched this week during Google I/O 2021! </p> \n<p>Inspired by developer communities around the world, who despite having to adjust to challenges this past year still continue to create amazing and innovative apps, we have delivered and updated the suite of tools to empower three major themes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <strong>Rapid UI design</strong> - with <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose\">Jetpack Compose</a>, it's never been easier to create modern UIs, and we have tools to help complete that journey: you can create previews in different configurations and navigate your code with Compose Preview, test it in isolation with Deploy Preview to Device, and inspect the full app with Layout inspector. Throughout iterations, you can quickly edit strings and numbers and see immediate updates. Moreover, with the Accessibility Scanner in Layout Editor, your View based layouts are audited for accessibility problems. </li> \n <li> <strong>New devices, both large and small</strong> - reimagine and extend your app beyond phones--whether it's for Wear OS, Google TV, or Android Auto, we have prepared new emulators and system images, and even authentic simulations for different testing scenarios: pair your watch and phone emulators with Wear OS Pairing, take a virtual run with Wear OS heart rate sensors, switch channels with GoogleTV Remote Control, and drive with Automotive OS Sensor Replay. </li> \n <li> <strong>Developer productivity boost</strong> - we want to ensure your workspace and environment are ready for the latest systems and optimized for speed and quality. Now you can enjoy a whole slew of new features and improvements that come with a major update to Intellij 2020.3, test your app with what Android 12 has to offer, improve your app performance with the updated UI for Memory Profiler, understand background task relationships with WorkManager Inspector, and use Non-Transitive R classes IDE Refactoring to increase build speed. </li> \n</ul> \n<p> In short, this is an upgrade you do not want to miss! ‚ú® There are many more features and improvements surrounding these themes you can find in this Beta version, so read or watch below for further highlights. Or, skip the reading, download Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) Beta in the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/studio/preview\">beta channel</a> and try out the latest features yourselves today!

By using the @Preview annotation, Compose previews can be made to visualize multiple components at once in different configurations (i.e themes, device) as well as create a mental mapping for you to navigate your code.</li>\n </ul> \n <center>\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HgsTXpXs61Y/YKHKhzQylkI/AAAAAAAAAA0/sNoH9D1VQ_YJ740Ng0F6lrbKmmVw500UQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2174/compose-preview-0.gif\"><img alt=\"Compose Preview\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1036\" data-original-width=\"2174\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HgsTXpXs61Y/YKHKhzQylkI/AAAAAAAAAA0/sNoH9D1VQ_YJ740Ng0F6lrbKmmVw500UQCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/compose-preview-0.gif\" style=\"width:100%;\" /></a> \n  <p id=\"imgCaption\"><em>Compose Preview</em></p> \n </center> \n <ul> \n  <li> <strong>Layout Inspector for Compose </strong>- You can now inspect layouts written in Compose with Layout Inspector. Whether your app uses layouts fully written in Compose or layouts that use a hybrid of Compose and Views, the Layout Inspector helps you understand how your layouts are rendered on your running device or emulator, obtain rich details (such as parameters and modifiers passed to each composable), and debug issues that might arise. As you interact with the app, you now also have the option to either enable <strong>Live Updates</strong> to constantly stream data from your device, or reduce performance impact on your device by disabling live updates and clicking the <strong>Refresh</strong> action as needed. </li>\n </ul> \n <center>\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ik2-s2dWtX0/YKHbcYazGRI/AAAAAAAAAA8/o3-3mficEnskhDNZ0-Zxr2cUElaAajYzACLcBGAsYHQ/s2188/compose-layout-inspector.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"Compose Layout Inspector\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"983\" data-original-width=\"2188\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ik2-s2dWtX0/YKHbcYazGRI/AAAAAAAAAA8/o3-3mficEnskhDNZ0-Zxr2cUElaAajYzACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/compose-layout-inspector.gif\" /></a> \n  <p id=\"imgCaption\"> <em>Compose Layout Inspector</em> </p> \n </center> \n <ul> \n  <li> <strong>Deploy Preview to Device </strong>- Use this feature to deploy a snippet of your UI to a device or emulator. This will help to test small parts of your code in the device without having to start the full application. Your preview will benefit the same context (permissions, resources) as your application. You can click the Deploy to device icon on the top of any Compose preview or next to the @Preview annotation in the code editor gutter and Android Studio will deploy that @Preview to your connected device or emulator. </li> \n </ul> \n <center>\n  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HasZFqzsNjk/YKHf6osAzhI/AAAAAAAAABE/K3bcgcJ3j9M0_6fJOEWKDBLroBGDyMMAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/deploy-to-device.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" alt=\"Using Deploy to device from preview and gutter icon\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1038\" data-original-width=\"2048\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HasZFqzsNjk/YKHf6osAzhI/AAAAAAAAABE/K3bcgcJ3j9M0_6fJOEWKDBLroBGDyMMAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/deploy-to-device.gif\" /></a> \n  <p id=\"imgCaption\"> <em>Using Deploy to device from preview and gutter icon</em></p> \n </center> \n <ul> \n  <li> <strong>Live Edit of literals </strong>- Live Editing of literals allows developers using Compose to quickly edit literals (strings, numbers, booleans) in their code and see the results immediately without needing to wait for compilation.
