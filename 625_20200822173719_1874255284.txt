So today, we’re introducing <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/10028011\">bass boost</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/9917740\">sharing detection</a> to give you more options to use Pixel Buds in a way that’s unique to you. You can enhance your bass directly in the Pixel Buds settings, and if you decide to share one of your earbuds with someone, you no longer have to sacrifice your volume preferences thanks to sharing detection. When on, sharing detection automatically detects when you're sharing an earbud with someone and you can both individually swipe on your respective earbud to control your own volume. So whether you’re listening to music or watching a movie with a friend, you can seamlessly share your Pixel Buds.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"US_1800x2400_AttentionAlerts_BassBoost_BlogPhoto.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/US_1800x2400_AttentionAlerts_BassBoost_Blo.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Translate, transcribe and transform your conversations</h3>\n  <p>Building on the helpfulness of Pixel Buds’ <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/7573100#conversation\">conversation mode</a> translate feature, which helps when you’re talking back and forth with another person, the new <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/7573100#transcribe\">transcribe mode</a> lets you follow along by reading the translated speech directly into your ear, helping you understand the gist of what’s being said during longer listening experiences. Launching initially for French, German, Italian and Spanish speakers to translate English speech, transcribe mode can help you stay present in the moment and focus on the person speaking.

The American Red Cross and their <a href=\"https://www.preparecenter.org/\">Global Disaster Preparedness Center</a> developed an open sourced platform for developers called the <a href=\"https://whatnow.preparecenter.org/#learnMore\">WhatNow Service</a>—a data feed of global safety tips for over 20 different disaster types.

The blend of practical experience with scientific and social research has yielded simple and actionable safety messages that people can trust in the event of an emergency like an earthquake, wildfire, hurricane or flash flood. Sometimes these are simple actions like listening for more information from local authorities or following evacuation orders. Other messages are practical things like moving valuables to safety if you’re near an area that may flood or preparing an emergency kit to keep nearby.</p>\n  <b><br /></b>\n  <p><b>How do you ensure these safety tips are relevant for people across multiple countries?</b></p>\n  <p>We work with a network of 192 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the globe—each one operates in its own language, and understands unique local challenges and needs. We gave each partner a set of standard, evidence-based messages for 20 different hazards across 6 different time scales (mitigation, seasonal forecast, watch, warning, immediate, and recovery). This localization process included consultation with their government partners to finalize the messages that we’re sharing with the public.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>How, if at all, have these recommendations changed with the impact of COVID-19?</b></p>\n  <p>As one example, safety tips now advise having additional items in emergency kits—such as hand sanitizer and cloth face coverings. It will be important to have these on hand so that people can continue being safe, and keeping their neighbors safe, in case they need to evacuate their homes and stay in close proximity to others.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>What are some of the top challenges in communicating disaster safety information to the public?</b></p>\n  <p>Trust and consistency are two of the biggest challenges. Every person accesses information through&nbsp; many different channels. There’s a high volume of content to navigate, which can leave people confused or even unaware of what to do when there is an emergency. With the Red Cross safety messages that can be delivered through Google SOS alerts and by an API to other channels, we’re offering consistent, evidence-based safety messages prepared by a trusted source.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Now that we’re in hurricane and wildfire seasons, what’s the number one piece of advice you can give to readers to stay safe?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>The most important thing is to have a plan and make sure you and your loved ones know what to do when there’s an emergency. This includes identifying a trusted source of information, knowing and practicing the steps you will take in an emergency and identifying the items and must-haves you may need for your recovery.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":625,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Kansas_flood_collapsed_-_in_device4X.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"0d50f8f1f518f847da633bd244437d19","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_3/2020/08/22/17-34-58-543_7cbc32f027ec088a.webp","destWidth":471,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":203690,"destBytes":49570,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Kansas_flood_collapsed_-_in_device4X.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_3/2020/08/22/17-34-58-543_7cbc32f027ec088a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/MKuf/~4/LzaPkqZxukA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn90@2020_1/2020/08/22/17-35-15-628_8c969ecae41a313f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598117697707},{"createdTime":"2020-08-23 01:34:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-23 01:34:57","title":"Mapping wildfires with the power of satellite data","link":"https://blog.google/products/search/mapping-wildfires-with-satellite-data/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Ten years ago, I was inside the Google office in Haifa, Israel when the devastating Carmel Mountain fire started blazing not far from us.

For many this led to a heightened period of dread and anxiety, but also creativity and heroism. During lockdown artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tomcroftartist/?hl=en\">Tom Croft</a> created #portraitsforNHSheroes to galvanize artists across the country to celebrate workers on the frontline. Tom collaborated with the charity <a href=\"https://www.paintingsinhospitals.org.uk/\">Paintings in Hospitals</a> to give the collection a more permanent home, as it closely aligns with the values and ethos of their mission to improve health through art. As a result of the collaboration, Google Arts &amp; Culture created an<a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/preview/project/healthcare-heroes\"></a><a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/project/healthcare-heroes\">online exhibition</a> of over 700 contemporary portraits that were submitted as part of Tom’s #portraitsforNHSheroes initiative.</i><br /></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><i>Sandra Bruce-Gordon, director of Paintings in Hospitals spoke to artist Tom Croft about the exhibition and their collaboration.</i></p>\n  <p><b>Sandra: We know that art can help meet challenges in health and social care around ageing, loneliness and mental health. What will be the main benefit of the exhibition for our audiences?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>Tom: I hope it gives the frontline workers a sense of how valued they are and how indebted we feel toward them. I wanted to raise their status through portraiture as this crisis has really highlighted and reminded everyone of their critical work. If the exhibition can help artists, healthcare workers or the audience process this appalling time, then that will be a good thing.</p>\n  <p><b>Sandra: You must be really proud of what you and the other artists have achieved. How do you think this exhibition will be received?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>Tom: Firstly, I am so grateful to Paintings in Hospitals and Google Arts &amp; Culture for creating this space and a permanent record for these amazing NHS portraits. I hope everyone will take the time to view this virtual exhibition, which at the moment is the best way to get the widest and most inclusive audience for an exhibition. I am super excited for it to launch and proud of what everyone has achieved. &nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>Sandra: For me, the portraits get behind the anxiety and stress that the frontline workers must have been feeling. I hope the exhibition will help improve communication between patients and carers. What were the relationships between artists and frontline workers like?</b></p>\n  <p>Tom: Since we couldn’t meet up with our subjects, we based the portraits on images sent over social media. Some artists worked from video call sittings, so we all had to be flexible in our practices. I asked <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/2QUhsxm3Xtvq-g\">my subject Harriet</a> lots of very direct questions about her <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/FwWxn9IjY-1QmA\">experience on the frontline.</a> She was so generous to share her thoughts and feelings with me and we got to know each other well pretty quickly. I know from hearing from other artists that the bond between artist and sitter, forged in this unusual and very emotional set of circumstances, was really strong. Tears were shed on both sides when the portraits were revealed.<br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\">\n    <ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\">\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Harriet_Durkin_-_Tom_Croft.max-1800x1800.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Harriet Durkin -

The goal of this project is to create something that gives readers more context and journalistic perspective on news stories as well as helps publishers’ distinct editorial voices shine through. Today, we wanted to update you on how we're working alongside our publisher partners to achieve this.</p>\n  <p>This licensing program and upcoming product both build on our broader commitment to support the news industry in its drive towards a more sustainable future. And as we expand licensing to more publishers in more countries, we’re also working closely with 10 different news outlets from Germany and Brazil on an early access program, &nbsp;testing features and gathering feedback to shape the product direction ahead of full launch later this year. Publishers taking part in this early access program including international brands as well as local household staples like <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de\">ZEIT ONLINE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/\">Der Spiegel,</a> <a href=\"https://www.tagesspiegel.de/\">Tagesspiegel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.faz.net/aktuell/\">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ippen-digital.de/\">Ippen Media Group</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://rp-online.de/\">Rheinische Post</a> in Germany and <a href=\"https://em.com.br/\">Estado de Minas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.agazeta.com.br/brasil\">&nbsp;A Gazeta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/\">Correio Braziliense</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uol.com.br/\">UOL</a> in Brazil. These partners are helping us test features and gather feedback ahead of a full launch later this year.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>At Google, we know the best products are built when a diversity of knowledge, insight and expertise are brought into the mix, and this early access program is a major phase in our progress. Participating publishers are testing publisher tools, evaluating technical integrations and ensuring different templates enhance the ways they bring stories to their readers.&nbsp; We’re also discussing paywall integrations, where Google would pay for free access to allow readers to read articles on a publisher’s site. This will help paywalled publishers grow their audience and deepen their relationship with readers.</p>\n  <p>But the success of this product will rest on how good the experience is for readers, so bringing in experts from the news industry to understand their insights and hear their feedback is critical. That’s particularly appealing for Sebastian Horn, Deputy Editor of <a href=\"https://www.zeit.de\">ZEIT ONLINE</a>, one of Germany’s leading publishers and one of our partners. \"Collaborating with Google on this new project allows us to bring the best of ZEIT ONLINE’s journalism to new audiences across Google's products and to do what our readers trust us to do best–provide them with the most relevant news and the best in-depth analysis on current topics.“&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>We also want to make sure readers know who is behind the news and find publications they respect. That’s why we’re making sure this&nbsp; product strongly reflects the publishers’ brand, while still creating a cohesive news experience.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>“This new collaboration opportunity adds further value to the essence of our mission, which is to forge a very close bond with our community through quality journalism and a first rate product experience,” says Aglisson Lopes, the Performance Editor for<a href=\"https://www.agazeta.com.br/brasil\">A Gazeta</a>, one of Brazil's leading local and regional publications. “We are a regional publisher that strives to be at the leading edge of digital trends and our continuing work with Google leads the way in getting us closer to this goal.\"</p>\n  <p>Google has long been invested in supporting news businesses and we believe the work we do through the <a href=\"https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/\">Google News Initiative</a> alongside the traffic from News and Search–24 billion visits a month–are hugely valuable. Our licensing program also plays a major role, and we will be announcing new partners in additional countries in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>As we get closer to a public launch, we’re especially grateful to these initial partners for working together to build a product that enables people to become more informed and provides additional financial support for news publishers.&nbsp;</p>\n
