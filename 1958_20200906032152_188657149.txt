There’s also a lot of useful information on the page for everyone who plans to visit our conference or our website. As of today, there are three documents up there:</p> \n<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br> We make a real effort to protect whatever pieces of your identity pass into our hands, and we want you to have an understanding of what we can and can’t do to keep that data secure.</br></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<p><strong>Transparency Report</strong><br> It’s reasonable to wonder if sites you visit frequently have been served with a court order demanding logs and information. The transparency report is how you’ll know if it happens to DEF CON.</br></p> \n<p><strong>Black Badge Policy</strong><br> Wonder if that Black Badge on eBay will render you ‘uber’ at the next DEF CON? There are rules, and we wrote them down for you.</br></p> \n<p>As other policies are finalized, we’ll update the policy page. If you need another reason to check it out, consider this: every time someone reads a privacy policy all the way through, a lawyer gets their wings. Or a lawyer does 1d4 of smoke damage.

Cash payment at the door. There will be a grand prize given to the first competitor to get the flag (root). This is a boot to root challenge. Seating is limited. NOTE: This CTF does not include multiple attack nodes; this game is designed for beginners and those that wish to sharpen their CTF skills. An OVA file containing the game within a VM will be provided, upon payment, the day of the competition.

You can even watch the presentation live on CSPAN 2 - The Dark Tangent is headlining the event!<br><br> During the weekend of DEF CON 25, every single device in the Voting Village was compromised. The report we’re releasing today gives a glimpse into how much we were able to discover in only a few days. Any committed threat actor would devote vastly more time and resources, and we believe that democratic governments must treat the security of election systems with the same rigor and investment as they do their borders.<br><br> We entered into this experiment as a non-partisan public service, believing that discussion about solutions has to start with a realistic assessment of what needs fixing. The DEF CON community has a lot of talent in that kind of work, and we saw a way we could contribute.<br><br> We would like to thank everyone who joined us in the Voting Village to test the machines, everyone who collaborated on the report, the Atlantic Council for helping us share the results and the Library of Congress for granting an easement of the DMCA provisions that would have blocked this research. This project is a great example of government making room for independent researchers to bring their talents to an issue that matters to all of us. Here’s hoping there will be more success stories like this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:31:19 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/voting-machine.jpg","linkMd5":"f22cb4bc2447af030e96705e42ccddbe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_2/2020/09/06/03-21-05-431_d5c53b96c2678fc4.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":225,"sourceBytes":24194,"destBytes":16240,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/voting-machine.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_2/2020/09/06/03-21-05-431_d5c53b96c2678fc4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459792},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"Update: DEF CON 101 has Moved!","link":"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-news.html#dc23101moved","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/101moved.jpg\" alt=\"101 sign at Gold image\"> <p>In order to ease some of yesterday's congestion, DC101 track is now located in the Gold Room in Bally’s.

DND tag on the door too long triggers a security visit.<br> 2. That security visit is supposed to be by hotel security staff who are clearly identifiable as hotel security staff.<br> 3. That visit should be comprised of a visual survey of the main segments of the hotel room, with no fiddling about in personal belongings.<br><br> This means that entering rooms and taking a quick look around does not violate the hotel’s policies.<br><br> But it also means that reports of opening closed bags, confiscation of personal effects, and reluctance to self-identify and/or allow guests to verify the legitimacy of the security officers all fall well outside of the policy.<br><br> Please know we are not letting this go. We are sympathetic to the new terrain major hotels find themselves in, but our main commitment is to our community.

Meetings are being met, plans are being planned, and the theme is ready for its unveiling.<br><br> DEF CON 26 was about the inflection point between disorder and dystopia - the moment before point of no return. This year's theme, in a way, responds to '1983' with new questions. What does it look like when we make the better choice? What kind of world do we hack together in the sunniest timeline? How does our real best-case scenario compare to the future we've been dreaming of for generations?<br><br> So, we offer you 'Technology's Promise'. It's a break from the dystopian imagery into a major-key, blue-sky thoughtscape, full of color and light. It's a future where we have tamed some of the more intractable problems that plague us in the present, where technology supports and inspires instead of controlling and surveilling.<br><br> To get you in the proper mindset, here's some media to sample:<br><br> Star Trek TOS - because the series is based on a future Earth that has learned to manage itself, make working alliances with neighbors and turn its attention to the disciplined exploration of the broader universe. Also LCARS is still cool.<br><br> Asimov's Robot series - a future where humankind has built AI android tech that supports rather than supplants humanity, and (usually) behaves itself admirably.<br><br> BioShock - a genuinely thought-provoking game about the promises and limits of tech-based utopia.<br><br> Kraftwerk, Com Truise, Tangerine Dream - the beautiful sounds of our neon future, rendered in the gorgeously synthesized tones that can only come from the fruitful marriage of human and machine.<br><br> We'll be posting more of this as DC27 approaches. Lots more. This is going to be fun.<br><br> Join us, won't you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:12:27 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/post-images/theme.png","linkMd5":"cbf94a830479c721462cf86f9c953ab7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn21@2020_1/2020/09/06/03-21-10-141_4c9f9a237ef161ce.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":409,"sourceBytes":73361,"destBytes":45242,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/post-images/theme.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn21@2020_1/2020/09/06/03-21-10-141_4c9f9a237ef161ce.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459786},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"Be the Match returning to DEF CON 22!","link":"https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-news.html#dc22bethematch","description":"<figure>\n <img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/btm.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Be the Match sign-up form\" />\n</figure> \n<p>For the 4th year, 'Be the Match' is returning to DEF CON.

We hope you’ll take some time to read it in full.</p> In the Voting Village’s second year, the selection of devices was expanded to more than 30 machines, all but one of which are still in use across the USA right now. We also made a very successful effort to attract election officials to observe, participate and even get training from cybersecurity experts.<br><br> The many vulnerabilities discovered are listed in some detail. For example:<br><br> \"A voting machine that is currently used in 26 states is vulnerable to be remotely hacked via anetwork attack. Because the device in question is a high-speed unit designed to process a high volume of ballots for an entire counties, hacking just one of these machines could enable an attacker to flip the Electoral College and determine the outcome of a presidential election.<br><br> A second critical vulnerability in the same machine was disclosed to the vendor a decade ago, yet that machine, which was used into 2016, still contains the flaw.<br><br> Another machine used in 18 states was able to be hacked in only two minutes, while it takes the average voter six minutes to vote.”<br><br> While these results are cause for concern, the DEF CON Voting Village also provided Election Day Crisis Communications Protocols with the aim of suggesting clear best practices to mitigate the exploitation of the election infrastructure.<br><br> Please share this report widely. The only curative measure for misleading headlines is accurate information, and the security of our democratic process requires that we understand the problem clearly. If you are concerned about the vote tech in your area, get in touch with your local representatives. If they’re not aware of our project, share it with them.<br><br> We want to thank the organizers of the Voting Village, the election officials from around the nation who came to learn from our research and the hackers at DEF CON who brought their talent and ingenuity to the task of securing our voting process.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 18:27:54 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/villages/voting.jpg","linkMd5":"e140b03be4d27f0c4489b2a54fb6550e","destWidth":300,"destHeight":296,"sourceBytes":16185,"destBytes":8500,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/villages/voting.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459787},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"DC22 Artwork Contest: Only Two Weeks Left!","link":"https://defcon.org/html/defcon-22/dc-22-artwork-contest.html","description":"<figure>\n <img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-main/ac-montage.jpg\" alt=\"montage of past art contest winners\" />\n</figure> \n<p>We know that art takes time.

So that's our theme. <br><br> To translate that feeling into the physical space of DEF CON 2020, we offer these bits of inspiration.<br><br> The color palette is derived from internet publications of the early 1990s. It was the breakthrough moment of The Web. As people raced to define the new frontier, magazines like Mondo2000 and Wired tried to convey the excitement with loud colors and edgy layouts.<br><br> The style we took from 90s 'zine culture - an amazing, boundlessly creative and wildly unprofessional DIY movement that, just like the internet, invited everyone to stop consuming culture and start creating and sharing it. Ideas over production value, attitude over polish, getting your ideas out over getting them perfect.<br><br> We hope you'll take that anarchic DIY spirit with you when you're working on whatever you're bringing to DEF CON.

We've accepted a record number of villages and are growing the number of workshops from last year. To hold all this goodness we are growing to include the Flamingo hotel.<br><br> <strong>TL/DR</strong><br><br> - DEF CON has has accepted more villages than ever before and needs to grow.<br> - DEF CON is spreading to two hotels, Caesars Palace and the Flamingo.<br> - This lets us do more stuff + evening pool parties.<br><br> <strong>The PLAN:</strong><br> For DEF CON 26 we will try something we have never done - Split the con between two hotels! No, not like Paris + Ballys, they are connected. I'm talking Caesars Palace and the Flamingo across the street.<br><br> \"That's Crazy!\" you say. \"Why do we need that much space?\" you say. Check this out: The number of villages will almost double from last year to about 25. Parties should increase. More contests are under development. DEF CON needs space to support all the awesome projects from the community and I'd really like to throw some pool parties. That is all now possible.<br><br> In the next month you will hear more specifics but I want to answer some questions here:<br><br> - How will the space be split? The Flamingo will hold some of the \"destination\" events to relieve pressure off of Caesars Palace. Current planning includes Workshops, DEF CON 101 track, some villages and contests, a chill out space, pool parties, and more once we finish planning.<br><br> - Will there be DC TV at the Flamingo? Yes DC TV will be in the Flamingo and as many other hotels as we can wire. A more definitive list soon, but we are building on what we did last year.<br><br> - If you ran a village or contest last year you should count on the same or more space you got last year. If you are running a first time event we will work to meet all of your needs. If you want even more space or a dedicated spot at the Flamingo we can work on making that happen.<br><br> <strong>Background:</strong> <br> With the move to Caesars Palace last year we got more space and a different floor plan that helped with some flow, but the broken escalators stole some of those gains. For DEF CON 26 the escalators are fixed and we have a better understanding of how to use the space. With that understanding and the growth of interest in Village and Contests we realized that we are out of space and need to span to a new property. This growth will allow us to accept more contests and villages and try some new stuff while giving existing events some room to breathe. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>  \n<p> </p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 21:10:54 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/flamingoannounce.png","linkMd5":"60aeefbc556e508e3f897ddd7f335e94","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn58@2020_5/2020/09/06/03-21-13-486_097670ad0584a39a.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":61603,"destBytes":33300,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/flamingoannounce.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn58@2020_5/2020/09/06/03-21-13-486_097670ad0584a39a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459790},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"Stay up to Speed with the DEF CON Calendar!","link":"https://forum.defcon.org/calendar","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-28/post-images/calendar.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON Forums Calendar image\"> <br /> <p>The <a href=\"https://forum.defcon.org/calendar\">DEF CON calendar</a> on the DEF CON Forums is pretty handy.

In case it's new to you, the X-Hour Film Contest is a guerilla-style moviemaking challenge where the participants have to write, shoot and edit a short film during DEF CON.</p> <p>To make it even tougher, the crews don't get the requirements until they're on site.

It also features a bunch of stellar performances and some crazy precision camera work (keep your eyes peeled for the long, unbroken takes).<br><br> 'Children of Men' fits our theme in other ways, too - the set design could hardly be more in line with our DC26 style guide.

It’s happening all around you, all the time. There are hundreds of DEF CON Groups all over the world that have regular meetings, put on talks and collaborate on projects of all kinds. You can be part of the one in your area, and if there isn’t one you can start one - it’s free and the information is available at <a href=\"https://www.defcon.org/https://defcongroups.org\">https://www.defcon.org/https://defcongroups.org</a>.</p> <p>This week we’re sharing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUY8aQqCSRU\">a talk on 3D printing given at DC719</a>, the DEF CON Group for the Colorado Springs area. Dana G. Neilson presents on the history and uses of 3D printing and shows how they made a pretty cool DEF CON ring as a handy example. More importantly he shows that what ever sector you work in or what ever you want to make, if you can visualize it, draw it and either CAD (Computer Aided Drafting) it or have someone else CAD it, then your ideas can become physical object. There are endless possibilities with this growing technology, become part of its growth and then share what you know.</p> <p>If you’re in the Colorado Springs area and want to learn more about DC719, they’re online at <a href=\"http://www.dc719.net\">dc719.net</a>.

There have been multiple instances of DIYBio overcoming conventional science. We want to celebrate the biohacker movement with a compendium of talks, demonstrations, and a medical device hackathon.</p> <p>The 2017 BioHacking Village theme is Medical Industry Disrupt. The Medical Industry is one of the last to be touched by technology.

The version given to all the DEF CON Goons is the same as below but also includes confidential reporting phone numbers.</p> <h4>ATTENDEE REPORTED INCIDENT POLICY</h4> <p>DEF CON does not tolerate harassment of any kind, be it racial, sexual, physical, political, intellectual, or emotional. Every Goon shall take each report by an attendee seriously, and not dismiss any of them. Never turn an attendee away. It is not a Goon’s duty to judge anything that an attendee says, regardless of opinions of the attendee, the person they’re reporting, or the reported issue itself.<br><br> <strong>Reported/Observed Harassment or Assault</strong><br> When an attendee reports harassment or assault to any Goon follow this procedure:<br><br> 1. Get a second Goon to be with you to listen to the report.<br> 2. Have one goon contact a SOC goon via the SOC Contact Procedures<br> 3. Make a warm hand off with the attendee to the SOC Department.<br> 4. Let the SOC conduct their investigation and handle the incident from there.<br> 5. Be available to answer any questions from the SOC or venue security.<br><br> <strong>Interaction with Social and Traditional Media</strong><br> DO NOT SHARE photos or videos. Please let the responding SOC GOONS know if you have any video or pictures, they may end up being evidence, but out of context could cause problems.<br><br> During or after an incident, you may be asked to comment on the situation. DO NOT make any comments to reporters, and do not post about the incident on social media. As a Goon, the media will treat anything you say as an official statement from DEF CON. Commenting prematurely before we understand the situation could cause more confusion or reveal identities that should remain confidential so please refrain from speculating and work with SOC / PRESS to help them understand what happened.<br><br> Refer all media inquiries to the DEF CON Press Department (press@defcon.org or send them to the press room) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Aug 2018 22:59:32 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/goon.png","linkMd5":"6a79b8355b1ebb6b3fc745825f64a5e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_2/2020/09/06/03-21-15-520_3f0249acef7cddca.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":420,"sourceBytes":67236,"destBytes":44370,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/goon.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn6@2020_2/2020/09/06/03-21-15-520_3f0249acef7cddca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459788},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"Bank error in your favor!","link":"https://www.defcon.org/index.html#rioroomrate","description":"<p>When we announced the discount room rates for the Rio last month, there was some kind of glitch in the Matrix.

A world where adventurous digital misfits are building a new world out of the pixels and info the Powers that Be leave behind. <br /> <img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-city.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON 25 theme image\"> <br /> <br />We've come a long way together, from the obscurity of BBS life to Runner-Up for Time's Person of the Year. From 20 people at the CON to 20,000. From media scapegoat to – well, it's a work in progress. <br /> <p>Join us at Caesars Palace to look back at how we got here, and to imagine together where we go next.</p></img></img></img></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 24 Dec 2016 00:10:56 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-logo.jpg","linkMd5":"573f3a8f5f65f8a32c17e5ab230241e7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn32@2020_2/2020/09/06/03-21-05-352_e08025e2506f866a.webp","destWidth":650,"destHeight":290,"sourceBytes":32172,"destBytes":13452,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-logo.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn32@2020_2/2020/09/06/03-21-05-352_e08025e2506f866a.webp","https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-arcade.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn84@2020_5/2020/09/06/03-21-47-425_695ee4365a911275.webp","https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-community.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn14@2020_3/2020/09/06/03-21-47-327_356fe7e21344fe0f.webp","https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/dc-25-city.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn72@2020_5/2020/09/06/03-21-47-346_7a8e91b3d3e40eab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459797},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"Happy Halloween!","link":"https://defcon.org/index.html#halloween19","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/halloween-19.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON halloween 2019 image\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 19:22:37 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/halloween-19.jpg","linkMd5":"641331af7274e67938049024a14ee874","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn42@2020_1/2020/09/06/03-21-12-563_2b2164579756b597.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":329,"sourceBytes":43963,"destBytes":20114,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-main/post-images/halloween-19.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn42@2020_1/2020/09/06/03-21-12-563_2b2164579756b597.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459783},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"Better Know a Contest - Film Contest Edition!","link":"http://xhourfilmcontest.com","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/tdfrancis.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON td francis image\"> <br /> The TD Francis X-Hour Film Contest is back!

Make it simple to understand, express in broad strokes what kind of behavior is not acceptable, and don't be too specific.<br><br> I wanted it to act as a template for other conferences, if they chose to do so. It was legally reviewed by our outside law firm and a specialist. In 2018, it's looking like it may get seriously crash tested.<br><br> The Code of Conduct assumes people are acting in good faith and not creating intentionally elaborate, dishonest or disingenuous claims of harm. \"Ah ha! This is where the bad actors will attack the CoC\" you may be thinking.<br><br> As a conference of hackers, our CoC is intentionally flexible: like a spoon in the matrix. We describe generally what is not acceptable as opposed to trying to enumerate 42 different bad behaviors.<br><br> Besides the CoC, DEF CON has several structural factors that are to our advantage when dealing with people intent on disruption. This is not our first conference, and as such we have a department dedicated to dealing with this problem. We have also had time to plan with hotel and casino security should we need their involvement. We take this issue very seriously and choose to err on the side of removing people, rather than allow them to spoil the conference for those who just want to contribute in a positive way.<br><br> Finally, I have always said that DEF CON is what you make of it. I want to make sure our community has all the tools necessary to identify and report unacceptable behavior. Together, we will have all the pieces in place to act quickly and professionally, no matter what the issue is.<br><br> The Dark Tangent</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 29 Jul 2018 15:43:24 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/coc-post.jpg","linkMd5":"a889dc873c63280d8cba9fd0e4cb13c4","destWidth":300,"destHeight":264,"sourceBytes":30056,"destBytes":13968,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/coc-post.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459788},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"Recon Village Talks Live on YouTube!","link":"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkpP6XOD4uCQB6NpGrbujo","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/villages/recon.png\" alt=\"DEF CON 27 Recon village logo\"> <br /> <p>More DEF CON Village talks for your perusal - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9fPq3eQfaaCkpP6XOD4uCQB6NpGrbujo\">17 mind-embiggening presentations from @ReconVillage!</a><br><br> Dig in and spread the word.</br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 22:49:04 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/villages/recon.png","linkMd5":"9cad232662ccabe32d61d5a28a597759","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn18@2020_3/2020/09/06/03-21-13-782_e2869e007982087b.webp","destWidth":300,"destHeight":262,"sourceBytes":11482,"destBytes":6664,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-27/villages/recon.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn18@2020_3/2020/09/06/03-21-13-782_e2869e007982087b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459783},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"The DEF CON 25 Soundtrack Raises Funds for the EFF!","link":"https://defconcommunications.bandcamp.com/album/def-con-25-the-official-soundtrack","description":"<img src=\"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-25/post-images/soundtrack.jpg\" alt=\"DEF CON 25 Soundtrack image\"> <br /> <p>In case you didn't know, the <a href=\"https://defconcommunications.bandcamp.com/album/def-con-25-the-official-soundtrack\">DEF CON 25 Soundtrack is available on Bandcamp as a 'pay-what-you-want' item</a>.

The DEF CON community has a rich history. It is a history is filled with colorful adventures, half-truths and angry hotel managers. This contest will brush the dust off some of the most celebrated, obscure and redacted moments in Hacker History through the interpretation of a group of pre-selected contestants with the help of C2H6O. Each contestant will be \"prepared\" for their participation by our contest staff before being brought in front of a panel of judges. A topic will be randomly selected pointing to a moment of hacker history and the contestant will have 5-7 minutes to provide their account. Points will be given for accuracy, level of \"focus\", and other areas just made up on the fly by the judges, and in the end the contestant with the most points will be crowned the \"Drunk Hacker History\" champion for 2015. Note: This is not a Black Badge contest (yet).</p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2015 00:23:52 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/dhh.png","linkMd5":"79c18449093ea42f4377d29b21fce93c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn36@2020_3/2020/09/06/03-21-05-960_b68a715f2125d1fa.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":26159,"destBytes":42450,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/dhh.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn36@2020_3/2020/09/06/03-21-05-960_b68a715f2125d1fa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459822},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"Final Round of DEF CON 101 Speakers!","link":"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-news.html#dc23101speakersfinal","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-23/post-images/speakersfinal.jpg\" alt=\"Final round speakers image\"> <p>As promised, here's the final additions to the lineup for DEF CON 101.

From the abstract:<br><br> <em>\"This talk presents the findings and methodology from a team of investigative journalists, hackers and data scientists who delved into the parallel universe of fraudulent pseudo-academic conferences and journals; Fake science factories, twilight companies whose sole purpose is to give studies an air of scientific credibility while cashing in on millions of dollars in the process. Until recently, these fake science factories have remained relatively under the radar, with few outside of academia aware of their presence; but the highly profitable industry is growing significantly and with it, so are the implications. To the public, fake science is indistinguishable from legitimate science, which is facing similar accusations itself. Our findings highlight the prevalence of the pseudo-academic conferences, journals and publications and the damage they can and are doing to society.\"</em><br><br> Enjoy, and pass it along.</br></br></br></br></p></img>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Sep 2018 20:29:06 +0000","feedId":1958,"bgimg":"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/dc-26-fake-science.jpg","linkMd5":"bf1958364a7db7e304eaad48875dd998","destWidth":300,"destHeight":211,"sourceBytes":28289,"destBytes":12186,"author":"feedback@defcon.org (DEF CON Announcements)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/post-images/dc-26-fake-science.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599362459787},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 11:20:59","title":"DEF CON Link Roundup: IoT edition","link":"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-news.html#dc24linkroundup","description":"<img src=\"https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-main/roundup.png\" alt=\"DEF CON link roundup image\"> <br /> <p>As part of our annual process of compiling press accounts of DEF CON, we offer some link roundups sorted by topic.

We grew the workshops. We pumped up demo labs and contests, and we even learned how to set up the crazy lightshow required by the mighty Juno Reactor - which you will get to see shortly, since they let us record their set. (Yay Juno Reactor!) Also, we did that thing in Beijing that went so nice we're doing it twice.<br><br> We're gonna take everything we learned from this year's crazy expansions, fine-tune things and bring all that new wisdom to DEF CON 27.

It’s compiled by the redoubtable Russ Kick of the legendary first version of disinfo.com, and it’s a sage, provocative collection of bite-size think pieces from all over the cognitive map.
