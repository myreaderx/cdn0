But kids are natural explorers and when they have access to great content, it can be a magical experience--they can read up on their favorite dinosaur, watch videos on how to bake a treat or discover new hobbies.</p><p><a href=\"https://families.google.com/familylink/\">Family Link</a> was created and built into our core products to give parents the tools they need to stay involved and help manage their child’s online experiences, from setting screen time limits to content safety filters, privacy controls and more. But we’ve heard that parents want more than just parental controls; with so much content out there, they also need help finding things that are enriching and engaging for their kids. To help meet this request, we took a first step with the launch of a new <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/google-play/teacher-approved-apps/\">kids tab</a> in Google Play that helps parents easily find and pick “teacher-approved” apps for their kids.</p><p>Today, we’re continuing to build upon these efforts with <a href=\"https://families.google.com/intl/ALL_us/kidsspace/\">Google Kids Space</a>, a new kids mode on select Android tablets that features apps, books and videos for your kids to explore, learn and have fun.* Kids Space will be available globally on certain <a href=\"https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-makes-learning-and-entertaining-at-home-easier-than-ever/\">Lenovo™ tablets</a> first, including the new Lenovo Smart Tab M10 HD Gen 2, and will be coming to more Android tablets soon.<sup>†</sup></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Designed for nurturing your kid’s curiosity and creativity</h3><p>Kids Space is designed with your kid at the center of the experience and made for them to become explorers of the things they love.

We worked with top publishers to make popular children’s books free of charge, and have over 400 free books available in the U.S. alone. In the Watch and Make tabs, your kids can view creative and fun videos from YouTube Kids that are engaging and encourage off-screen activities.

Sometimes, bringing your ideas to life requires finding an image you can use—like when you’re looking to communicate a message, decorate a space or do something creative on the web. But with a seemingly infinite number of images online, finding the right image to use, and knowing how to use that image responsibly, isn’t always a simple task. </p><br/><p>After collaborating closely with image creators, stock image providers and digital content associations, we’re launching several new features on Google Images to address this need. These features will make finding the right image to use, as well as guidelines for how to license an image for your business or personal project, much easier than before.</p><br/><p>First, we’re making it easier to find licensable images. For results where the publisher or image creator provided licensing information, we will display a “licensable” badge over the image. When you select a badged image to view, we will show a link to the license details of the image, and if provided by the publisher, you’ll also find a link to where you can purchase or license the image. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Final_1800sq_Licensable_SRP_and_Viewer_shadow.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Final_1800sq_Licensable_SRP_and_Viewer_sha.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>You can also filter results to only return those images that include licensing information.

For any of the license types, you can learn how to acquire a license for the image by clicking on the license details link provided.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Usage Rights Screenshot Desktop.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Usage_Rights_Screenshot_Desktop.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>These updates are part of changes we have made on Google Images in recent years to make it more clear who the creator or copyright holder of the image is.

select an image to view on Google Images and it’s made available by the publisher.</p><br/>Image creators, licensors and publishers can learn more about these features, including implementation steps
