We wanted to make sure whether you're streaming content while working out or sitting in a noisy room talking on a conference call, you have the best possible audio experience. Today, <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds\">Pixel Buds</a> are available for $179 in Clearly White in the U.S. </p><br/><p>We sat down with some of the team behind Pixel Buds to learn more about what’s new, and also to hear how they’ve been using them. </p><br/><h2>Get started easily with Fast Pair</h2><p>“I always used to use wired headphones because I had concerns about the reliability of Bluetooth® connectivity, as lots of other earbuds have pairing problems, including the original Pixel Buds. With the new Pixel Buds, we focused on improving Fast Pair to eliminate these pain points and easily connect to your phone.”</p><p><i>- Ethan Grabau, Product Manager</i></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Presto_Tap4_full.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Presto_Tap4_full.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>Clear calls with special mics and sensor</h2><p>“To give you clear calls, even in noisy and windy environments, Pixel Buds combine signals from beamforming mics and a special sensor that detects when your jaw is moving. This helps so you don't have to look for a quiet place to take a call. It’s come in particularly handy these past few weeks for me working from home with two young daughters.”</p><p><i>- Jae Lee, Audio Systems Engineer</i></p><br/><h2>Adaptive Sound for better audio  </h2><p>“Adaptive Sound is perfect for those moments like when you’re steaming milk for a latte, or when you're washing your hands or the dishes. Those noises can eclipse your audio experience for a bit, until the latte, or your dishes are done.” </p><p><i>- Basheer Tome, Senior Hardware Interface Designer</i><br/></p><br/><p>“To help, Adaptive Sound temporarily and subtly adjusts your volume to accommodate for the new noise in your environment, and goes back to normal after it’s dissipated. It works kind of like auto-brightness on your phone screen: It momentarily adjusts to the world around you to make the experience of using your device a little simpler.”  </p><i>- Frank Li, UX Engineer  <br/></i><br/><h2>Hands-free help with Google Assistant</h2><p>\"When I’m working in the yard and wearing gloves, I can use  ’Hey, Google’ on my Pixel Buds and easily control my music. I can also hear my notifications, and reply to a text message with just my voice and Google Assistant. </p><br/><p>And when I'm taking my dog on our daily walk and using my Pixel Buds, I use Google Assistant to navigate and check my fitness progress hands-free while juggling a leash and bag of dog treats. The Pixel Buds are slim enough they fit snag-free under a hat or hoodie, too.\" </p><p><i>- Max Ohlendorf, Technology Manager </i></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"HeyGoogle.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/HeyGoogle.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>Real-time translations with conversation mode </h2><p>“We set out to see how we could use Google Translate on Pixel Buds to reduce language barriers. Making the conversation as natural as possible even with the use of the phone was important, so we decided to create the split screen UI to show exactly what was being said, and translating it in real time on the screen with conversation mode. Any exposure to a different language is also an opportunity to learn, so we wanted to make the feature is not only as helpful as possible for things like being in a different country, but also as simple as being able to help bilingual households across generations connect through language.” </p><p><i>- Tricia Fu, Product Manager</i></p><br/><h2>Peace of mind with Find My Device</h2><p>“The fear of losing expensive wireless earbuds is real, and in many cases a reason why people are afraid of trying them. We tried to reduce that fear a bit with Find My Device. If an earbud falls out when you’re walking or running, you know right away. But you may be less aware when you return home and absentmindedly put them down somewhere. So we built the ability to let you ring your earbuds from your phone. We also wanted to make sure we were thoughtful in what that experience is like. You can ring one earbud at a time, to focus on finding either the left or right earbud. The moment your hands touch the lost earbud, the ringing will stop. We hope people won’t need to use this feature often, but if they do, they can find misplaced earbuds more easily.”</p><p><i>- Alex Yee, Interaction Designer</i></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"RingEarbuds.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RingEarbuds.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Like Pixel phones and other Google devices, Pixel Buds will get better over time with new features, including an update to Find My Device which will show the last known location of your earbuds. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/?hl=en#topic=7544331\">Check out</a> more cool features on Pixel Buds and see which features will work with your device.</p><p>Pixel Buds are available through the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds\">Google Store</a> and retailers including AT&amp;T, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-buds-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-clearly-white/6411707.p?skuId=6411707\">Best Buy</a>, Target (coming early May), <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/accessory/google-pixel-buds-with-wireless-charging-case?sku=193575003337\">T-Mobile</a>, <a href=\"https://www.uscellular.com/accessories/google-pixel-buds-white\">U.S. Cellular</a>, <a href=\"https://www.verizonwireless.com/products/google-pixel-buds-with-wireless-charging-case/?sku=sku3830729\">Verizon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Pixel-Buds-Clearly-White/661564183\">Walmart</a>.

Send an anatomical heart when the love is so real, so raw. Or perhaps you’ll identify with one of the new animals, like a super cute bison, an eager beaver or a polar bear that just needs a little love. There are also new food emoji, like a tamale (nom nom), a boba tea sure to make you thirsty (\"black milk tea, boba, 30 percent sugar please\") and even a teapot for those who felt the “hot beverage” emoji (☕) was simply not “tea time” enough.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"New-Emoji.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/New-Emoji.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Additional characters across nature, activities and beyond will launch later this year, including a stump of wood (sure, OK), a magic wand (ta-da), and a woolly mammoth (better late than never, I guess).

Right now, those of us who no longer commute and are staying close to home may be able to sleep in, but how well and how much we’re sleeping can still be a struggle. In fact, there’s been a rise in sleep-related searches like “<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=insomnia\">insomnia</a>” and “<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=can%27t%20sleep\">can’t sleep</a>,” which reached all-time highs in April and May. At Google, we believe that technology should improve life, not distract from it–including your sleep. Today we’re sharing a few tips and new bedtime tools to help you get better and more restful sleep.</p><br/><h3>Turn on Bedtime mode to limit interruptions</h3><p>A dark, quiet environment can help with falling and staying asleep. With Bedtime mode, formerly known as Wind Down in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing\">Digital Wellbeing</a> settings, your Android phone can stay dark and quiet while you sleep. While Bedtime mode is on, it uses Do Not Disturb to silence calls, texts and other notifications that might disturb your sleep. Grayscale fades the colors on your phone to black and white to reduce the draw from enticing colors that keep you up.</p><br/><p>We’ve now made it easier to customize how and when you turn on Bedtime mode. Based on your bedtime schedule, you can choose to have it turn on automatically or after your phone is plugged in to charge. You can also add Bedtime mode to your phone's Quick Settings panel to instantly turn it on or off with a single tap.

It’s helpful to start with a wake-up time and work backwards when you set your bedtime schedule. In Clock, you’ll see a preview of tomorrow’s calendar and a tally of the total hours of sleep you’d get, and you can adjust your bedtime if needed. </p><br/><p>To help you get to bed and fall asleep, you’ll receive a reminder before bedtime and an option to play calming sounds from Calm, Spotify, YouTube Music and more. For those with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing\">Digital Wellbeing</a> installed, you can pair with Bedtime mode to limit interruptions while you sleep. And if you happen to stay on your phone later than planned, you can see how much time you’re spending and which apps you’ve used after your set bedtime. </p><br/><p>Being woken up by an alarm can be jarring. To avoid interrupting deep sleep and wake up more gently, the Sunrise Alarm gives a visual cue that your wake up time is approaching, 15 minutes prior to your audio alarm. Make it an even more pleasant experience by adding your favorite song or sounds.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"3 sunrise alarm.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/3_sunrise_alarm_xh3LKLH.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>The Sunrise Alarm gradually brightens your screen to help you wake up gently.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>The new bedtime experience is rolling out to Pixel devices <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/pixel/new-pixel-features-drop\">starting today</a> and will be available in the Clock app on other Android devices later this summer. </p><br/><h3>Set a bedtime reminder in YouTube</h3>We also made it easier to manage how much time you spend watching on YouTube on your phone after bedtime.You can now <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/48055830?hl=en\">get a reminder</a> that it’s time for bed in the YouTube app. You can choose to see the reminder at bedtime or after your video completes.

Google Meet is now <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/meet/google-meet-is-here-to-host-everyones-video-meetings-for-free/\">available to everyone</a> and can support larger meetings, and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/duo/family-mode\">family mode for Duo</a> lets you doodle on calls and add masks and effects, helping you express yourself in new and fun ways. </p><br/><p>To make communication easier and simpler on your phone, Android 11 will move all of your conversations across multiple messaging apps to a dedicated space in the notification section. This makes it easy to see, respond to and manage your conversations all in one place. You can mark a conversation as priority to give it preference so you never miss an important message. These key conversations show up on your always-on display and can even “break through” a Do Not Disturb setting. </p><br/><p>Android 11 also introduces Bubbles, a new feature to help you respond and engage with important conversations without switching back and forth between your current task and the messaging app. You can open a bubble for your conversation right from the notification and multitask without missing a thing.   </p><br/><p>In addition, when you type using Gboard in Android 11, you’ll get relevant and automatic suggestions for emoji and text. This is possible because of secure on-device intelligence that takes advantage of <a href=\"https://federated.withgoogle.com/\">Federated Learning</a>, and it works without Google ever seeing anything you type.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>New ways to control your connected devices and media</h2></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \"><img alt=\"Device Controls (with house).gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Device_Controls_with_house.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption h-c-page\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Caption: Android 11 makes it faster and easier to access and control your connected devices</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>As the world around us becomes more connected with ambient computing, Android 11 is helping you better manage all of your connected devices. </p><br/><p>You can now quickly access and control your smart devices in one place by long pressing on the power button.
