The company is designed to manage furniture returns and resale for online merchants. So far, companies like <a href=\"https://floydhome.com/\">Floyd Home</a>, <a href=\"https://insideweather.com/\">Inside Weather</a>, <a href=\"https://liveouter.com/\">Outer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.livefeather.com/\">Feather</a> (the furniture rental company) are using FloorFound&#8217;s services.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a very large pipeline and we&#8217;ve been operating since April first,&#8221; said Richter. &#8220;We can pick up in any major metro locally and inspect it locally. We have a platform layer where we can run inspections against those items.&#8221;</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>As consumers look to reduce their environmental footprint, an easy place to start is by buying used items, Richter said, and he expects that most brands will start to incorporate used and new products in their virtual and real showrooms. &#8220;Every brand will commingle new items with resale items,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are trying to put retailers in the resale business with their own return inventory.&#8221; To prove his point, Richter pointed to companies like REI and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/the-gap\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"the-gap\">The Gap, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/gap-latest-retailer-to-partner-with-thredup/572721/\">which have partnered with ThredUp to sell used clothes</a>.</p>\n<p>To complement its returns business and give online sellers a way to work more seamlessly with local vendors, the company has logistics partnerships with providers including Pilot Freight Services, Metropolitan Warehouse and Delivery and J.B.

Lau took an additional role of SVP at Oppo. BBK Group owns OnePlus, Realme, Oppo and Vivo. OnePlus has always avoided questions about its ownership structure.</p>\n<p>“I am eternally grateful to Pete for taking a chance in this kid without a college degree, with nothing to his name but a dream.

traffic that jams surrounding roads day and night. To help absorb at least some of the congestion, the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) last year planned a people-mover to serve an expanded campus. The LVCC wanted transit that could move up to 4,400 attendees every hour between exhibition halls and parking lots.</p>\n<p>It considered traditional light rail that could shuttle hundreds of attendees per train, but <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/06/elon-musk-boring-company-vegas-tunnel/\">settled on an underground system from Elon Musk’s The Boring Company</a> (TBC) instead &#8212; largely because Musk’s bid was tens of millions of dollars cheaper. The LVCC Loop would transport attendees through two 0.8-mile underground tunnels in Tesla vehicles, four or five at a time.</p>\n<p>But planning files reviewed by TechCrunch seem to show that the Loop system will not be able to move anywhere near the number of people LVCC wants, and that TBC agreed to.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Fire regulations peg the occupant capacity in the load and unload zones of one of the Loop’s three stations at just 800 passengers an hour. If the other stations have similar limitations, the system might only be able to transport 1,200 people an hour &#8212; around a quarter of its promised capacity.</p>\n<p>If TBC misses its performance target by such a margin, Musk’s company will not receive more than $13 million of its construction budget &#8212; and will face millions more in penalty charges once the system becomes operational.</p>\n<p>Neither TBC nor LVCVA responded to multiple requests for comment.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2061531\" style=\"width: 1002px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2061531\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2061531 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA-plan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"992\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA-plan.jpg 992w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA-plan.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA-plan.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA-plan.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA-plan.jpg?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA-plan.jpg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2061531\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fire regulations limit the load/unload zone near the cars to 800 people per hour.

Although Musk <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/28/heres-our-first-look-at-elon-musks-boring-co-la-tunnel/\">built a short demonstration tunnel near Los Angeles</a>, this would be the first public system with real customers and service requirements. An analysis by Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman in May 2019 concluded that TBC’s unproven system presented a high risk for the LVCC’s parent body, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitor’s Authority (LVCVA).</p>\n<p>So when the LCVCA wrote its contract with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/the-boring-company\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"the-boring-company\">The Boring Company, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> it did its best to incentivize Musk to deliver on his promises. The contract would be for a fixed price, and TBC would have to hit specific milestones to receive all of its payments. When the bare tunnels are completed, which could happen any day now, TBC will have earned just over 30% of the total. The next big milestone is the completion of the entire working system, which would result in a pay-out of over $10 million.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"60oB2WPXcu\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/its-fight-night-in-las-vegas-elon-musks-loop-vs-the-monorail/\">It’s fight night in Las Vegas: Elon Musk’s Loop vs the Monorail</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;It’s fight night in Las Vegas: Elon Musk’s Loop vs the Monorail&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/its-fight-night-in-las-vegas-elon-musks-loop-vs-the-monorail/embed/#?secret=60oB2WPXcu\" data-secret=\"60oB2WPXcu\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>That was scheduled to have happened by October 1, so that the system would be ready for the next CES show in January. Although CES 2021 has now gone virtual and there is less time pressure on Musk to deliver, he presumably still wants to get paid.</p>\n<p>In a tweet this week, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/person/elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"elon-musk\">Elon Musk <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> wrote that the system would be open in <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__twitter.com_elonmusk_status_1316301283234648064&#38;d=DwMFaQ&#38;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&#38;r=Bknt9owDQMbaeP0_bjaZeS2BjAU10Z9umfuqNXOTLSs&#38;m=cJRQNyQYkevEIsPyjsn6jp1T36acyN0uX5Q4nJ3o0jI&#38;s=EQ19lF6_0KLbduMQiu-vknGZ8q1Eth67lX_dpRLtoH4&#38;e=\">“maybe a month or so. Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations.”</a></p>\n<p>After another milestone for the completion of a test period and safety report, the system’s final three milestones relate to how many passengers it can carry. If the Loop can demonstrate moving 2,200 passengers an hour, TBC will get $4.4 million, then the same payment again for hitting 3,300, and the same again for 4,400 passengers an hour. Together, these capacity payments represent 30% of the fixed price contract.</p>\n<p>Even if TBC achieved those numbers during testing, the LVCVA was worried that it might not be able to maintain them once the system was operational, so it inserted yet another requirement: “[TBC] acknowledges liquidated damages are applicable for [TBC’s] failure to provide System Capacity for Full Facility Trade Show Events.”</p>\n<p>For each large trade show that TBC fails to transport an average capacity of 3,960 passengers per hour for 13 hours, it will have to pay LVCVA $300,000 in damages. If TBC keeps falling short, it keeps paying, up to a maximum of $4.5 million.</p>\n<p>So what is stopping TBC from transporting as many people as both it and the LVCC wants? There are national fire safety rules for underground transit systems that specify alarms, sprinklers, emergency exits and a maximum occupant load, to avoid overcrowding in the event of a fire.</p>\n<p>Building plans submitted by The Boring Company include a fire code analysis for one of the Loop’s above-ground stations:</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2061532\" style=\"width: 960px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2061532\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2061532 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"663\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA.jpg 950w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA.jpg?resize=768,536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA.jpg?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TBC-Vegas-NFPA.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2061532\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image source</strong>: The Boring Company/Clark County NV</p></div></p>\n<p>The above screenshot from the plans notes that the area where passengers get into and out of the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tesla-motors\">Tesla <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> cars has a peak occupancy load of 100 people every 7.5 minutes, equivalent to 800 passengers an hour. Even if the other stations had higher limits, this would limit the system’s hourly capacity to about 1,200 people.</p>\n<p>“That sounds correct,” says Glenn Corbett, a professor of security, fire and emergency management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. “But if that&#8217;s the bottleneck, the question from a safety standpoint is, what controls that [800 per hour]? Is it just pure honesty and people following the rules, or is there a mechanical thing that keeps them out?”</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plans do not show any turnstiles or barriers to limit entry.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even without the safety restrictions, the Loop may struggle to hit its capacity goals. Each of the 10 bays at the Loop’s stations must handle hundreds of passengers an hour, corresponding to perhaps 100 or more arrivals and departures, depending on how many people each car is carrying. That leaves little time to load and unload people and luggage, let alone make the 0.8-mile journey and occasionally recharge. </span></p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2061530,2061529,2061685,2061528\"]</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although TBC’s </span><a href=\"https://www.lvloop.com/lvccloop\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loop website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says that the system will use autonomous vehicles, a TBC executive told a planning committee last year that the cars would have human drivers “for additional safety.” TBC had proposed developing a larger capacity autonomous shuttle for the Loop, capable of carrying up to 16 people. The latest plans all show traditional sedans, however, and another Musk tweet this week admitted: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1316258179689443328\">“We simplified this a lot. It’s basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point.”</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most recent documents filed by TBC also show changes to the Loop’s original design. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gone are striking curved roofs, with both aboveground stations now having flat photovoltaic canopies to help charge the Tesla vehicles. These terminal stations each have a single Supercharger station, and a “showpiece sculpture” consisting of a concrete segment similar to those used in the tunnels below. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The central, subterranean station has a large, open platform, and also houses the electrical, fire safety and IT equipment. Each station will have bays for 10 Tesla vehicles to load and unload passengers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even before the first Loop is operating, TBC is planning two more Loop tunnels nearby, connecting the LVCC to the Wynn Encore and Resorts World casinos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tunnel to the Encore is long enough that safety regulations require an emergency exit about halfway along. Plans indicate an emergency egress shaft and a small hatch, but it is unclear whether passengers escaping a fire or breakdown would be expected to climb stairs or even a ladder.</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2061523\" style=\"width: 1431px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2061523\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2061523 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Loop-extension-egress.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1421\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Loop-extension-egress.jpg 1421w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Loop-extension-egress.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Loop-extension-egress.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Loop-extension-egress.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Loop-extension-egress.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Loop-extension-egress.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1421px) 100vw, 1421px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2061523\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Loop extension egress. <strong>Image source:</strong> The Boring Company/Clark County NV</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TBC last year suggested an emergency ladder for its proposed Loop between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., a system that Corbett called “</span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/review-of-elon-musks-dc-to-baltimore-loop-system-reveals-safety-concerns/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the definition of insanity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” as it did not account for passengers with limited mobility.

He said that the strategies for growing both companies are “almost identical” — the products are different, but “it’s really the same segment, running the same playbook, only with additional

We need universal digital ad transparency now!</p>\n<p>The negative social impacts of discriminatory ad targeting and delivery are well-known, as are the social costs of disinformation and exploitative ad content. The prevalence of these harms has been demonstrated repeatedly by our research. At the same time, the vast majority of digital advertisers are responsible actors who are only seeking to connect with their customers and grow their businesses.</p>\n<p>Many advertising platforms acknowledge the seriousness of the problems with digital ads, but they have taken different approaches to confronting those problems. While we believe that platforms need to continue to strengthen their vetting procedures for advertisers and ads, it is clear that this is not a problem advertising platforms can solve by themselves, as they themselves acknowledge. The vetting being done by the platforms alone is not working; public transparency of all ads, including ad spend and targeting information, is needed so that advertisers can be held accountable when they mislead or manipulate users.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Our research has shown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advertising platform system design allows advertisers to discriminate against users based on their gender, race and other sensitive attributes.</li>\n<li>Platform ad delivery optimization can be discriminatory, regardless of whether advertisers attempt to set inclusive ad audience preferences.</li>\n<li>Ad delivery algorithms may be causing polarization and make it difficult for political campaigns to reach voters with diverse political views.</li>\n<li>Sponsors spent more than $1.3 billion dollars on digital political ads, yet disclosure is vastly inadequate. Current voluntary archives do not prevent intentional or accidental deception of users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it doesn’t take the place of strong policies and rigorous enforcement, we believe transparency of ad content, targeting and delivery can effectively mitigate many of the potential harms of digital ads. Many of the largest advertising platforms agree; <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> Google, Twitter and Snapchat all have some form of an ad archive. The problem is that many of these archives are incomplete, poorly implemented, hard to access by researchers and have very different formats and modes of access. We propose a new standard for universal ad disclosure that should be met by every platform that publishes digital ads. If all platforms commit to the universal ad transparency standard we propose, it will mean a level playing field for platforms and advertisers, data for researchers and a safer internet for everyone.</p>\n<p>The public deserves full transparency of all digital advertising. We want to acknowledge that what we propose will be a major undertaking for platforms and advertisers. However, we believe that the social harms currently being borne by users everywhere vastly outweigh the burden universal ad transparency would place on ad platforms and advertisers.

Vista is back in the news lately for several reasons, some stemming from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-equity-s-smith-reaches-settlement-with-doj-in-tax-probe-11602713545\">executive shenanigans</a> &#8212; read: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-15/billionaire-robert-smith-admits-he-cheated-on-taxes-for-15-years?sref=gni836kR\">tax evasion and huge penalties</a> &#8212; but at least what&#8217;s coming from Datto&#8217;s camp is good tidings.</p>\n<p>How so? Vista bought Datto for <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/datto-confidentially-files-to-launch-ipo-bloomberg\">around $1.5 billion</a>, and is set to make billions on its exit, based on the company&#8217;s expected IPO pricing.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Per the data firm&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1724570/000119312520268957/d36878ds1a.htm\">latest S-1 filing</a>, Datto is targeting a $24 to $27 per share price range. Here&#8217;s the math:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total shares outstanding after IPO, sans underwriters&#8217; allotment: 157,548,740 shares</li>\n<li>Total shares outstanding after IPO, with underwriters&#8217; allotment: 160,848,740</li>\n<li>Max valuation at current prices, sans underwriters&#8217; allotment: $4.25 billion</li>\n<li>Max valuation at current prices, with underwriters&#8217; allotment: $4.34 billion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those two final numbers are dramatically bigger than the $1.5 billion that Vista is said to have paid for Datto.</p>\n<p>How has Datto managed to generate so much value in the last few years? In financial terms, the company grew to a run rate of around $500 million, based on its Q1 and Q2 2020 revenue results. That gives the company a revenue multiple of less than 10x at its current IPO price maximum.</p>\n<p>And that price makes sense. Datto is not growing very quickly, just 16% from H1 2019 to H1 2020, for example. The company did recently become profitable, however, which helps its valuation case. But more importantly, between 2017 and 2020 we have seen revenue multiples for software companies expand. That, plus Datto&#8217;s growth since 2017, have repriced it far above its sale price.</p>\n<p>For Vista, it&#8217;s good news. Provided that they don&#8217;t get into tax issues over this particular set of returns.

Coinbase, crypto-hack projects at university, KPMG, Merrill Lynch. But where’s the art?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Believe it or not, I used to have dreams of being a rapper,” laughs Goens. “There’s a SoundcCloud out there somewhere.

I would excitedly ask industry friends about the advance and 360 deal models only to realize they were completely broken.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, while many may be well-intentioned, these deal structures often exploit artistry. In many cases taking the majority of an artist&#8217;s ownership. &#8220;I grew curious why artists were unable to resource themselves from their community in an impactful way &#8212; but instead, were forced to seek out potentially predatory relationships. To me, this was bullshit.&#8221;</span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Horne says that he’d always wanted to create a fashion brand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I always thought a fashion brand would be something I’d do after crypto,” he tells me. “I love crypto but it felt overly focused on just finance and felt like it was missing something. Then I started to play with the idea of combining these two passions and starting Saint Fame.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While at Coinbase, Horne hacked on </span><a href=\"https://www.saintfame.com/fame\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saint Fame</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a side project that leveraged some of the ideas on display in Zora. It was a marketplace that allowed people to sell and trade items with cryptocurrency, buying intermediate variable-value tokens redeemable for future goods. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I realized that culture itself was shaped and built upon an old financial system that is systemically skewed against artists and communities,” says Horne. “The operating system of ownership was built in the 1600s with the Dutch East India Trading Company and early Nation States. Like what the fuck is up with that?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have the internet now, we can literally create and share information to billions of people all at once, and the ownership system is the same as when people had to get on a boat for six months to send a letter. It’s time for an upgrade. Any community on the internet should be able to come together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture they’re creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities taking on societal endeavors.”</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6ZKlB2LDOQ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/the-cryptocurrency-moment/\">The cryptocurrency moment</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;The cryptocurrency moment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/the-cryptocurrency-moment/embed/#?secret=6ZKlB2LDOQ\" data-secret=\"6ZKlB2LDOQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer that they’re working on is called <a href=\"https://ourzora.com/\">Zora</a>.

That’s great, but thereafter, every ounce of work that the artist puts into future work, into building a name and a brand and a community for themselves puts additional value into that piece.

I have a little background in this as I used to exhibit and was involved in running a gallery and my father is a fine artist. If he sells a painting today for $300, gets a lot better, more popular and more valued over time, the owner of that painting may re-sell it for hundreds or thousands more. He will never see a dime of that. And God forbid that an artist like him gets too locked into the gallery system, which slices off enormous chunks of the value of a piece for a square of wall space and the marketing cachet of a curator or storefront. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same story can be told across the recording industry, fashion, sports and even social media. Lots of middle-people and lots of vigs to pay. And, unsurprisingly, the same creators of color that drive so much of The Culture are the biggest losers, hands down. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary Zora product is a market that allows creators or artists to launch products and then continue to participate in their second market value. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s how the Zora team explains it:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Zora, creators have the ability to set two prices: start price and max price. As community members buy and sell a token, it moves the price up or down. This makes the price dynamic as it opens price discovery on the items by the market. When people buy the token it moves the price closer to its maximum. When they sell, it moves closer to its minimum. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For an excited community like Jeff [Staple’s], this new dynamic price can cause a quick increase in the value of his sneakers. As a creator, they capture the value from selling on a price curve as well as getting a take on trading fees from the market which they now own. What used to trade on StockX is now about to trade on a creator owned market.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There have been some early successes. Designer and marketer Jeff Staple launched a run of 30 </span><a href=\"https://ourzora.com/reverse-land/reverse?variant=95\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coca-Cola x Staple SB Dunk customs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Reverseland and their value is trending up around 234% since release. A Benji Taylor x Kevin Doan </span><a href=\"https://ourzora.com/benjixkevin/toy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vinyl figure is up 210%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have seen some other stabs at this. When he was still at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/stockx/\">StockX</a>, founder Josh Luber launched their </span><a href=\"https://stockx.com/news/new-balance-no-vacancy-inn-ipo-recap/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initial Product Offerings</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Blind Dutch Auction system that allowed the market to set a price for an item, with some of the cut of pricing above market going back to the manufacturer or brand making the offering. The focus there was brands versus individual creators (though they did launch with a Ben Baller slide). Allowing brands to tap into second market value for limited goods is a lot less of a revolution play, but the thesis is similar. I thought that was a good idea then, and I like it even better when it’s being used to democratize rather than maximize returns. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Side note: I love that this team is messing around with interesting ideas like dogfooding their own marketplace with the value of being in their own TestFlight group. I’m sort of like, </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF1qQxPhybE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is that allowed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but at the same time it’s dope and I’ve never seen anything like it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zora was founded in May of 2020 (right in the middle of this current panny-palooza). The team is Goens (Creators and Community), Horne (Product), Slava Kim (Design), Dai Hovey (Engineering), Ethan Daya (Engineering) and Tyson Battistella (Engineering). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zora has raised a $2 million seed round led by Kindred Ventures, with participation from Trevor McFedries of Brud, Alice Lloyd George, Jeff Staple, Coinbase Ventures and others.</span></p>\n<h2>Tokenized community</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this idea that physical goods or even digitally packaged works have to exist as finite containers of value is not a given either. Goens and Horne are pushing to challenge that too with the first big new product for Zora: community tokens. Built on Ethereum, </span><a href=\"https://blog.ourzora.com/introducing-rac\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the $RAC token</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the first of its kind from Zora. André Allen Anjos, stage name RAC, is a Portuguese-American musician and producer who makes remixes that stream on the web, original music and has had commercial work featured in major brand ads. </span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"sBbViTBeE4\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/crypto-startup-school-how-to-build-companies-by-building-communities/\">Crypto Startup School: How to build companies by building communities    </a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Crypto Startup School: How to build companies by building communities    &#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/crypto-startup-school-how-to-build-companies-by-building-communities/embed/#?secret=sBbViTBeE4\" data-secret=\"sBbViTBeE4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though he is popular and has a following in the tens of thousands, RAC is not a social media superpower. The token distribution and subsequent activity in trades and sales is purely driven by the buy-in that his fans feel. This is a key learning for a lot of players in this new economy: raw numbers are the social media equivalent of a billboard that people drive by. It may get you eyeballs, but it doesn’t guarantee action. The modern creator is living in a house with their fans, offering them access and interacting via Discord and Snap and comments. </span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2061697\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2061697\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2061697 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"777\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png 2284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png?resize=300,227 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png?resize=768,582 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png?resize=680,516 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png?resize=1536,1165 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png?resize=2048,1553 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2061697\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Credits: Zora</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But those houses are all other people’s houses, which leads into the reason that Zora is launching a token.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The token drop serves multiple purposes: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>It unites fans across multiple silos. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether they’re on Intsa, TikTok, Spotify or Snapchat, they can all earn tokens. That token serves as a unifying community unit of value that they all understand and pivot around. It’s a way to own a finite binary “atom” of an artist’s digital being.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>It creates a pool of value that an artist can own and distribute themselves.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Currently you cannot buy $RAC directly. You can only earn it. Some of that is retroactive for loyal supporters. If, for instance, you followed RAC on Bandcamp dating back to 2009, you’ll get some of a pool of 25,000 RAC. Bought a bit of RAC merch? You get some credit in tokens too. Future RAC distributions will be given to Patron supporters, merch purchasers, etc.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>The value stays in the artist&#8217;s universe, rather than being spun out into currency.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It serves as a way for the artist to incentivize, reward and energize their followers. RAC fans who buy his mixtape get tokens, and they can redeem them for purchases of further merch. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>It allows more flexibility for creators whose work doesn’t fall so neatly into package-able categories.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Performance art, activism, bite-sized entertainment. These are not easy to &#8220;drop&#8221; for money. But if you have a circulating token that grows in value as you grow your audience, there is definitely something there. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The future of Zora most immediately involves spinning up a self-service version of the marketplace, allowing creators and entrepreneurs to launch their products without a direct partnership and onboarding. There are many, many uncertainties here and the team has a lot of challenges ahead on the traction and messaging front. But as mentioned, some early releases have shown promise, and the philosophy is sound and much needed. As the creator universe/passion economy/whatever you call it depends on how old you are/fandom merchant wave rises, there is definitely an opportunity to rethink how the value of their contributions are assigned and whether there is a way to turn the long-term labor of building a community into long-term value. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last traded price of RAC’s tape, BOY, by the way? </span><a href=\"https://ourzora.com/rac/tape\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$3,713</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, up 18,465%. </span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/0mb0sptbb-4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 15:18:55 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.27.23-PM.png","linkMd5":"178e7b5016003462f6382e2b2def5137","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-29-56-877_e4f0c549f3ea7f9c.webp","destWidth":2276,"destHeight":2276,"sourceBytes":915953,"destBytes":131028,"author":"Matthew Panzarino","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.27.23-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn59@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-29-56-877_e4f0c549f3ea7f9c.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-15-at-3.30.49-PM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-03-928_184105736ad67ff1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn67@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-56-919_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-04-663_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-03-551_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn84@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-03-750_ecba49938b8d623f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=0mb0sptbb-4:ZKcr2wqtCJQ:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn75@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-03-540_7e024e58b8e6c2de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-05-019_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/0mb0sptbb-4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-04-342_d8eeb6ad5b63b0f5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901789464},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","title":"Daily Crunch: Twitter walks back New York Post decision","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2062129","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A New York Post story forces social platforms to make (and in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitter\">Twitter&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> case, reverse) some difficult choices, Sony announces a new 3D display and fitness startup Future raises $24 million.

other data supposedly originating on a laptop belonging to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden&#8217;s son, Hunter.</p>\n<p>The story, which alleged that Hunter Biden had set up a meeting between a Ukrainian energy firm and his father back when Biden was vice president, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/suspect-provenance-of-hunter-biden-data-cache-prompts-skepticism-and-social-media-bans/\">looked shaky from the start</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/man-who-reportedly-gave-hunters-laptop-to-rudy-speaks-out-in-bizarre-interview\">more</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spdustin/status/1316621229751762945\">holes</a> have emerged over time. Both Facebook and Twitter took action to slow its spread — but Twitter seemed to take the more aggressive stance, not just limiting reach but actually blocking links.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"1KyArFDChH\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/twitter-changes-its-hacked-materials-policy-in-wake-of-new-york-post-controversy/\">Twitter changes its hacked materials policy in wake of New York Post controversy</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Twitter changes its hacked materials policy in wake of New York Post controversy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/twitter-changes-its-hacked-materials-policy-in-wake-of-new-york-post-controversy/embed/#?secret=1KyArFDChH\" data-secret=\"1KyArFDChH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>These moves have drawn a range of criticism. There have been predictable cries of censorship from Republican politicians and pundits, but there have also been suggestions that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516729/facebook-twitter-new-york-post-hunter-biden-emails-laptop-story-social-media-moderation-problems\">Facebook and Twitter inadvertently drew more attention to the story</a>. And even Twitter&#8217;s CEO Jack Dorsey suggested that it was &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; to block links in DMs without an explanation.</p>\n<p>Casey Newton, on the other hand, argued that the platforms had <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/p/youtube-comes-for-q\">successfully slowed the story&#8217;s spread</a>: &#8220;The truth had time to put its shoes on before Rudy Giuliani’s shaggy-dog story about a laptop of dubious origin made it all the way around the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Twitter initially justified its approach by citing its hacked materials policy, then later said it was blocking the Post article for including &#8220;personal and private information — like email addresses and phone numbers — which violate our rules.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The controversy did prompt Twitter to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/twitter-changes-its-hacked-materials-policy-in-wake-of-new-york-post-controversy/\">revise its hacked materials policy</a>, so that content and links obtained through dubious means will now come with a label, rather than being removed entirely, unless it&#8217;s being shared directly by hackers or those &#8220;acting in concert with them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And now, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/technology/twitter-new-york-post.html\">first reported by The New York Times</a>, Twitter is also allowing users to share links to the Post story itself (something I&#8217;ve confirmed through my own Twitter account).</p>\n<p>Why the reversal? Again, the official justification for blocking the link was to prevent the spread of private information, so the company said that the story has now spread so widely, online and in the press, that the information can no longer be considered private.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nff0PGMiHT\"><p><a

href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oracle\">Oracle <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> in the mid-1980s and have since been around the proverbial block, particularly in Silicon Valley working for and with companies ranging from the Fortune 50 to global consulting companies to leading a number of startups, including <a href=\"https://astrella.com/\">the SaaS company I presently lead</a>. Throughout my career, I’ve carved out a niche not only working with technology companies, but focused on designing and implementing global compensation programs.</p>\n<p>In short, if there’s two things I know like the back of my hand, it’s tech and how people are paid.</p>\n<p>The compensation evolution I’ve witnessed over these past 35+ years has been dramatic. Among other things, there has been a fundamentally seismic shift in how women are perceived and paid, principally for the better. Some of it, in truth, has been window dressing. It’s good PR to say you’re a company with a strong culture focused on diversity, as it helps attract top talent. But the rubber meets the road once hires get past the recruiter. When companies don’t do what they say, we see mass exoduses and even lawsuits, as has recently been the case at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/\">Pinterest</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/do-option-grants-create-gender-and-racial-inequity/\">Carta</a>.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>So with the likes of Intel, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"salesforce\">Salesforce <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> and Apple publicly committed to gender pay equity, there’s nothing left to see here, right? Actually, we’re not even close. Yes, the glass ceiling is cracking. But significant, largely unaddressed gaps remain relative to the broader scope of long-tail compensation for women, especially at startups, where essential measures of economic reward such as stock options in companies are often not even part of the conversation around pay parity.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"O0W1okFS9u\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/\">Former COO sues Pinterest, accusing it of gender discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Former COO sues Pinterest, accusing it of gender discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/embed/#?secret=O0W1okFS9u\" data-secret=\"O0W1okFS9u\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>As a baseline, while progress is evident, gender pay is an unfinished product to say the least. Recently the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found</a> white women earn 83.3% as much as their white male counterparts, while African-American women earn 93.7% compared to men of their same race. Asian women made 77.1% and Hispanic women earned 85.1% as much respectively.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap\">According to Payscale</a>, the ratio of the median earnings of women to men has decreased by just $0.07 since 2015, and in 2020, women make $0.81 for every dollar a man makes. Long term, in calculating presumptive raises given over a 40-year career, women could lose as much as $900,000 over the duration of a career.</p>\n<p>But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Even if we solely left the gender pay gap to just a cash salary disparity, there <em>is</em> something further to see here. However, to quote a famous pitchman, “But wait, there’s more!” And the <em>more</em> — at least in my mind — is far more troubling.</p>\n<p>As innovative startups from Silicon Valley to New York’s Silicon Alley and beyond continue to reshape the business landscape, guess how most of them are able to lure bright, entrepreneurial minds? It’s certainly not salary, as when a company has nothing beyond a great idea and maybe a lead to a VC on Sand Hill Road, there’s no fat paycheck or benefits package to offer. Instead, they dangle the proverbial carrot of stock/equity compensation.</p>\n<p>“Look, we know you can get $180,000 a year from <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> but we’ll give you $48,000 a year plus 1,000 shares presently valuated at $62 per share. Our board — which is packed with studs from the Bay Area — is expecting that to soar within two years! Wait ‘til we go public!”</p>\n<p>This is the pitch, at least if you’re a promising <em>male</em>. But <em>women</em>, historically, have tended to get left out of this lucrative reward package for varying reasons.</p>\n<p>How has this happened? Beyond just a furtherance of business culture, while there have been legislative steps taken to address inequities in public company compensation and stock dispersal, there are no regulations as to how private companies distribute or manage the appreciation of stock. And, as we all know, the appreciation can be potentially massive.</p>\n<p>It makes sense. Many companies and even naïve job-seekers consider equity as the “third pillar” of compensation beyond titles/compensation (which come hand-in-hand) and benefits. Shares of startups are just not top-of-mind — often ignored or misunderstood — by many who look at gender pay inequities, although that could not be more misguided.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2020-51967-001\">A recent study </a>published in the &#8220;Journal of Applied Psychology&#8221; found a gender gap for equity-based awards ranging from 15%-30% — even beyond accounting for typical reasons women historically earn less than men, including differences in occupation and length of service at a company. Keep in mind many of these companies will go on to massive valuations, and for some, lucrative IPOs or acquisitions.</p>\n<p>It’s a problem I recognized long ago, and it is largely why I agreed to lead our Bay Area startup on behalf of our New York-based parent company <a href=\"http://astfinancial.com\">AST</a>. I found a commitment to a genuinely equitable culture instilled by a shared moral compass, a belief that companies who care about gender equity perform better and provide better returns, and a conviction that diversity brings unique perspectives, drives talent retention, builds a stronger culture and aids client satisfaction.</p>\n<p>In speaking with industry colleagues, I know it’s something CEOs, both men and women, are dedicated to addressing. I believe creating a broader picture of compensation is essential for startups, global conglomerates and every company in between. If you are in a position of leadership and recognize this is a challenge in need of addressing at your company, here are some steps I recommend you implement:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Look at the data: </strong>Do the analysis. See if this is truly an issue at your company, and if it is, commit to creating a level playing field. There are plenty of experienced consultants who can help you work through remediation strategies.</li>\n<li><strong>Remove subjectivity:</strong> Hire an independent arbiter to analyze your data, as it removes the politics and emotion, as well as bias from the work product.</li>\n<li><strong>Create compensation bands:</strong> Much like the government’s GS system, create a salary grade system that contains bands of compensation for specific roles. Prior to hiring a person, decide which band the job responsibilities should be assigned.</li>\n<li><strong>Empower a champion:</strong> Identify and empower an internal champion to truly own parity — someone whose performance is judged based upon creating equity company-wide. Instead of assigning it to your human resources chief, create a chief diversity officer role to own it. After all, this is bigger than just pay or medical benefits. This is the culture and thus foundation of your company.</li>\n<li><strong>Get your board on board:</strong> Educate your board as to why this matters. If your board doesn’t value this, it ultimately won’t matter. Companies have audit committee chairs or nominations chairs. Identify a &#8220;culture chair.&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the first reports we created is <a href=\"https://astrella.com/product/\">a Pay Comparison Report</a> so there are tools anyone in management can easily use to review stock grants made to all employees and ensure equity between people of different ethnicities or gender.

A venerable player in the single sign-on market, its product was <a href=\"https://www.okta.com/resources/idaas-leader-gartner-magic-quadrant/TechGenix/\">not a market leader</a>, and after 14 years and $128 million in venture capital, it needed to find a new path.</p>\n<p>While the company had<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/13/ping-identity-opens-up-about-its-financials-as-it-eyes-2017-ipo/\"> once discussed an IPO</a>, by 2016 it began putting out feelers for buyers. Vista Equity Partners <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/12/ping-shapes-new-identity-after-600-million-acquisition/\">made a $600 million offer</a> and promised to keep building the company, something that corporate buyers wouldn&#8217;t guarantee. Ping CEO and co-founder Andre Durand accepted Vista&#8217;s offer, seeing it as a way to pay off his investors and employees and exit the right way.

consent for targeting with behavioral ads &#8212; which is designed by ad industry body, the IAB Europe &#8212; fails to meet the required legal standards of data protection, according to findings by its EU data supervisor.</p>\n<p>The Belgian DPA&#8217;s investigation follows complaints against the use of personal data in the real-time bidding (RTB) component of programmatic advertising which contend that a system of high velocity personal data trading is inherently incompatible with data security requirements baked into EU law.</p>\n<p>The IAB Europe&#8217;s Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) can be seen popping up all over the regional web, asking users to accept (or reject) ad trackers &#8212; with the stated aim of helping publishers comply with the EU&#8217;s data protection rules.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>It was the ad industry standard&#8217;s body&#8217;s response to a major update to the bloc&#8217;s data protection rules, after the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into application in May 2018 &#8212; tightening standards around consent to process personal data and introducing supersized penalties for non-compliance &#8212; thereby cranking up the legal risk for the ad tracking industry.</p>\n<p>The IAB Europe introduced the TCF in <a href=\"https://iabeurope.eu/knowledgehub/policy/introducing-for-public-comment-transparency-and-consent-framework-tcf-version-2-0/#:~:text=IAB%20Europe%20launched%20its%20Transparency,the%20GDPR%20and%20ePrivacy%20Directive.\">April 2018</a>, saying at the time that it would &#8220;help the digital advertising ecosystem comply with obligations under the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The framework has been widely adopted, including by adtech giant, Google &#8212; which integrated it this August.</p>\n<p>Beyond Europe, the IAB has also recently been pushing for a version of the same tool to be used for &#8216;compliance&#8217; with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-officially-takes-effect-today/\">California&#8217;s Consumer Privacy Act</a>.</p>\n<p>However the findings by the investigatory division of the Belgian data protection agency cast doubt on all that adoption &#8212; suggesting the framework is not fit for purpose.</p>\n<p>The inspection service of the Belgium DPA makes a number of findings in a report reviewed by TechCrunch &#8212; including that the TCF fails to comply with GDPR principles of transparency, fairness and accountability, and also the lawfulness of processing.</p>\n<p>It also finds that the TCF does not provide adequate rules for the processing of special category data (e.g. health information, political affiliation, sexual orientation etc) &#8212; yet <em>does</em> process that data.</p>\n<p>There are further highly embarrassing findings for the IAB Europe, which the inspectorate found not to have appointed a Data Protection Officer, nor to have a register of its own internal data processing activities.</p>\n<p>Its own <a href=\"https://iabeurope.eu/privacy-policy/\">privacy policy</a> was also found wanting.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the IAB Europe for comment on the inspectorate&#8217;s findings. <strong>Update: </strong>See the base of this article for a first response. <strong>Update 2:</strong> The ad standards body has now published a statement <a href=\"https://iabeurope.eu/news-blog/iab-europe-comments-on-belgian-dpa-report/\">here</a> in which it describes the TCF as a &#8220;voluntary standard&#8221; that contains &#8220;a minimal set of best practices&#8221;. It also says it &#8220;respectfully disagree[s] with the [Belgian DPA]’s apparent interpretation of the law, pursuant to which IAB Europe is a data controller in the context of publishers’ implementation of the TCF&#8221;, adding: &#8220;If upheld, the [Belgian DPA]’s interpretation would have a chilling effect on the development of open-source compliance standards that serve to support industry players and protect consumers.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe/\">A series of complaints against RTB have been filed across Europe</a> over the past two years, starting in the UK and Ireland.</p>\n<p>Dr Johnny Ryan, who filed the original RTB complaints &#8212; and is now a senior fellow at the <a href=\"https://www.iccl.ie/news/gdpr-watchdogs-investigation-finds-that-tracking-and-consent-pop-ups-used-by-google-and-other-major-websites-and-apps-are-unlawful/\">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a> &#8212; told TechCrunch: &#8220;The TCF was an attempt by the tracking industry to put a veneer or quasi-legality over the massive data breach at the heart of the behavioral advertising and tracking industry and the Belgian DPA is now peeling that veneer off and exposing the illegality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ryan has previously described the RTB issues as “the greatest data breach ever recorded”.</p>\n<p>Last month he published another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/\">hair-raising dossier of evidence</a> on how extensively and troublingly RTB leaks personal data &#8212; with findings including that a data broker used RTB to profile people with the aim of influencing the 2019 Polish Parliamentary Election by targeting LGBTQ+ people. Another data broker was found to be profiling and targeting Internet users in Ireland under categories including “Substance abuse”, “Diabetes,” “Chronic Pain” and “Sleep Disorders”.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Ravi Naik, the solicitor who worked on the original RTB complaints, had this to say on the Belgian inspectorate&#8217;s findings: “These findings are damning and overdue. As the standard setters, the IAB is responsible for breaches of the GDPR. Their supervisory authority has rightly found that the IAB &#8216;neglects&#8217; the risks to data subjects. The IAB’s responsibility now is to stop these breaches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Following the filing of RTB complaints, the UK&#8217;s data watchdog, the ICO, issued a warning about behavioural advertising in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/\">June 2019</a> &#8212; urging the industry to take note of the need to comply with data protection standards.</p>\n<p>However the regulator has failed to follow up with any enforcement action &#8212; unless you count multiple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/\">mildly worded blog posts</a>. Most recently it <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/adtech-scores-a-pandemic-pause-from-uk-privacy-oversight/\">paused its (still ongoing) investigation into the issue</a> because of the pandemic.</p>\n<p>In another development last year, Ireland&#8217;s DPC <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/\">opened an investigation</a> into Google&#8217;s online Ad Exchange &#8212; looking into the lawful basis for its processing of personal data. But that investigation is one of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/\">scores that remain open on its desk</a>. And the Irish regulator continues to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxschrems/status/1317137890330202112\">face criticism</a> over the length of time it&#8217;s taking to issue decisions on major cross-border GDPR cases pertaining to big tech.</p>\n<p>Jef Ausloos, a postdoc researcher in data privacy at the University of Amsterdam &#8212; and one of the complainants in the Belgian case &#8212; told TechCrunch the move by the DPA puts pressure on other EU regulators to act, calling out what he described as &#8220;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/\">their complete, deer-in-the-headlights inaction</a>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll see more of this in the coming months/year, i.e. other DPAs sick and tired, taking matters into their own hands &#8212; instead of waiting on the Irish,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>“We are happy to finally see a data protection authority having the resolved to take on the online advertisement industry at its roots. This may be the first important step in taking down surveillance capitalism,&#8221; Ausloos also said in a statement.</p>\n<p>There are still several steps to go before the Belgian DPA takes (any) action on the substance of its inspectorate&#8217;s report &#8212; with a number of steps outstanding in the regulatory process. We&#8217;ve reached out to the Belgian DPA for comment. <strong>Update</strong>: See below.</p>\n<p>But, per the complainants, the inspectorate&#8217;s findings have been forwarded to the Litigation Chamber, and action is expected in early 2021.

Let&#8217;s examine the data in light of what we learned last week concerning capital available for female founders and see what we can find out.</p>\n<h2>Depressing declines</h2>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ytFJzoJhnuk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 14:37:34 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"19f688268e2a4f8058165deddbcdd4d4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn67@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-56-919_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn67@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-56-919_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-04-663_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-03-551_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn80@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-03-674_60e69fd405ac92bb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ytFJzoJhnuk:Z5w0Sa-eWSg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn39@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-03-512_1bf747918258a984.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-05-019_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ytFJzoJhnuk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-17-713_ab9517602cac92a2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901789462},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","title":"PearPop lets TikTok celebrities monetize by sharing shout-outs and screen time with fans","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2061973","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://pearpop.com/\">PearPop</a> a new Los Angeles-based company, is on its way to racking up nearly 25,000 users in less than a month, and has already landed seed funding from the firm <a href=\"https://rocketonecapital.com/\">Rocket One Capital</a>.</p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s premise is simple.

An Android and iOS version of the service is expected to launch in November, according to Mason</p>\n<p>The journey to founding PearPop began on the floor of an apartment in New York City. Mason was an aspiring model and serial entrepreneur who sold homemade wooden crosses door-to-door as a child and graduated to selling gloves for gamers in high school. Mason had moved to New York when he was signed to Ford Models.</p>\n<p>After sleeping on the floor of a friend&#8217;s apartment on St. Marks Place in Manhattan&#8217;s East Village, Mason tried to land modeling gigs but found more success as a promoter and manager of model apartments (places where young, pretty people can stay for free in exchange for making appearances at a few clubs around New York).</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hated it,&#8221; Mason said. &#8220;I always wanted to get into stuff in tech.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p>Mason took the cash from his promotion work and turned his attention to the tech industry soon after. As a struggling model who was building a network of friends in social media, he realized that the problem with the platform was breaking through.</p>\n<p>His initial solution was to build a platform called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gramenvy/\">GramEnvy</a>, which tried to find a way to growth hack Instagram.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The only way to grow your own Instagram was to have people post with you or about you and leverage their huge following.&#8221; Mason said. It was something easier said than done, and it was made harder by algorithmic changes that ultimately forced GramEnvy to close.</p>\n<p>But Mason was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, and was inspired by the growing success of <a href=\"https://www.cameo.com/\">Cameo</a> to come up with another way that would enable popular minor celebrities on social media platforms (who were working a tier below the A-listers with tens of millions of followers) to monetize their performance on various platforms.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"xmum6SGu27\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/\">Cameo raises $50M to deliver personalized messages from celebrities &#038; influencers</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Cameo raises $50M to deliver personalized messages from celebrities &#038; influencers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/embed/#?secret=xmum6SGu27\" data-secret=\"xmum6SGu27\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while Cameo is a way for celebrities to monetize their following, it doesn&#8217;t create the exposure that would-be social media stars are looking for. That&#8217;s the problem that Mason thinks he&#8217;s solved with PearPop. </span></p>\n<p>Other entrepreneurs, like Spencer Markel, the chairman of the Los Angeles-based children&#8217;s clothing and entertainment brand, CubCoats, thinks so too.</p>\n<p>Markel was introduced to Mason by a mutual friend from New York and has come on as an adviser to the company since Mason began working on it roughly 10 months ago. For Markel, the potential to actually share screens via TikTok&#8217;s platform makes PearPop a potentially more lucrative option for celebrities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a lot of different ways that this is going to address a gap in the market,&#8221; said Markel. He believes that the service should be a strong monetization opportunity for the TikTok stars who find themselves one level down from their higher-wattage peers with tens of millions of fans. </span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"rBrb3IFX6I\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/you-can-set-up-a-zoom-call-with-tony-hawk-or-sinbad-using-cameos-latest-feature/\">You can set up a Zoom call with Tony Hawk or Sinbad using Cameo’s latest feature</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;You can set up a Zoom call with Tony Hawk or Sinbad using Cameo’s latest feature&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/you-can-set-up-a-zoom-call-with-tony-hawk-or-sinbad-using-cameos-latest-feature/embed/#?secret=rBrb3IFX6I\" data-secret=\"rBrb3IFX6I\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/6X15KXGveyI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 18:16:58 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_9860.jpeg","linkMd5":"f3e009f11ea35068a16543e10c3e82e1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn63@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-29-50-088_5540458694fe9e03.webp","destWidth":1242,"destHeight":2688,"sourceBytes":254522,"destBytes":85022,"author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_9860.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn63@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-29-50-088_5540458694fe9e03.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn67@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-56-919_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-04-663_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-03-551_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn13@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-03-480_fbc59aefc3d9c905.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=6X15KXGveyI:FKJ0OTuPmRY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn43@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-13-526_8b19525c3c4905e3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-05-019_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/6X15KXGveyI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn51@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-30-04-401_8ee8708594cf0851.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901789465},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","title":"Analogue takes on the TurboGrafx-16 with its Duo retro console","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2061962","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/analogue\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"analogue\">Analogue&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> beautiful, functional retro gaming consoles provide a sort of &#8220;archival quality&#8221; alternative to the cheap mini-consoles proliferating these days.

Analogue says limited quantities are available, and will be shipping in 2021.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KVy7RE4xJr\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/pre-orders-for-the-analogue-pocket-retro-portable-game-console-start-august-3-ships-may-2021/\">Pre-orders for the Analogue Pocket retro portable game console start August 3, ships May 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Pre-orders for the Analogue Pocket retro portable game console start August 3, ships May 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/pre-orders-for-the-analogue-pocket-retro-portable-game-console-start-august-3-ships-may-2021/embed/#?secret=KVy7RE4xJr\" data-secret=\"KVy7RE4xJr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/anvQfG8UIGQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 17:04:15 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/turbografx-16-colors.jpg","linkMd5":"4d40e149d4decb95fbf7358e4db39bc4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn55@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-49-927_db943d59222f875c.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1548,"sourceBytes":224701,"destBytes":35246,"author":"Devin Coldewey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/turbografx-16-colors.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn55@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-49-927_db943d59222f875c.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/turbografx-16-back.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn16@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-03-634_5c765ae1376566fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn67@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-56-919_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-04-663_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-03-551_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn63@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-05-666_0f3f983761ed357f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=anvQfG8UIGQ:qQkG-0nEwOc:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn67@2020_3/2020/10/17/02-30-04-460_0fca254034b1ca1b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-05-019_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/anvQfG8UIGQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn69@2020_3/2020/10/17/02-30-03-597_1333494ad60cbf36.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901789449},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","title":"Marshall Major IV wireless headphones offer great sound, plus 80+ hours of battery life and wireless charging","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2061830","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Marshall&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://www.marshallheadphones.com/us/en/major-iv.html\">Major IV headphones ($149.99)</a> combine lightweight comfort with wireless charging, and up to 80 hours of playback for an iconic headset that&#8217;s affordable and flexible. At home or on the go, these are a great option with unique features that you won&#8217;t find anywhere else in the headphone market.</p>\n<h2>Basics</h2>\n<p>This is the fourth iteration of Marshall&#8217;s Major on-ear wireless headphones, and they offer a number of improvements new to the lineup, including a new folding clip design that makes them even more compact when packed for travel &#8212; and that allows them to rest comfortably on a charging pad to enable another new feature: wireless charging using the Qi standard.</p>\n<p>Marshall has also greatly improved battery life, advertising an insane 80 hours of usage time on these, way up from the 30+ promised in the last generation. They still feature square earcups with that iconic Marshall look, but the detail on each is flat instead of pebbled faux leather (that remains on the headband). The multi-directional control knob is also carried over from past Major designs, and there&#8217;s a 3.5mm socket for wired sound, and for sharing your audio connection out to another headset.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In the box, there&#8217;s a coiled 3.5mm cable for that vintage Marshall amp feel, as well as a USB-C cable for wired charging, which will provide a full 80+ hours of use from three hours &#8212; or 15 hours from just 15 minutes with a new quick-charge feature.</p>\n<h2>Design and performance</h2>\n<p>The design of the Major IV is classic Marshall aesthetic &#8212; which is great news. They look fantastic, with the iconic logo in script on both earcups. As mentioned, the earcup face is now smooth and matte, which looks great, and there&#8217;s a silicone edge on each, which helps keep the right earcup in place when placed on a wireless charger.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2061868\" style=\"width: 949px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2061868\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2061868\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/04-usp03-major-iv-desktop@1.41x.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"939\" height=\"639\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/04-usp03-major-iv-desktop@1.41x.jpg 939w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/04-usp03-major-iv-desktop@1.41x.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/04-usp03-major-iv-desktop@1.41x.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/04-usp03-major-iv-desktop@1.41x.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/04-usp03-major-iv-desktop@1.41x.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/04-usp03-major-iv-desktop@1.41x.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2061868\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Marshall</p></div></p>\n<p>These are compact, over-ear headsets that rest comfortably, and that comfort is helped by the lightweight materials used in their construction. Despite feeling very light, they feel like they&#8217;re made of quality materials thoughtfully constructed, and should last a long time in terms of durability.</p>\n<p>Marshall&#8217;s multi-directional controller is both an attractive cosmetic detail in gold, and a smart control interface that offers intuitive manipulation of audio playback and volume.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9uO3NH1qO0\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/shures-aonic-50-wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones-offer-best-in-class-audio-quality/\">Shure&#8217;s Aonic 50 wireless noise-cancelling headphones offer best-in-class audio quality</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Shure&#8217;s Aonic 50 wireless noise-cancelling headphones offer best-in-class audio quality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/shures-aonic-50-wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones-offer-best-in-class-audio-quality/embed/#?secret=9uO3NH1qO0\" data-secret=\"9uO3NH1qO0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>Sound-wise, the Major IV provides great audio quality for a headset in this price range. The bass is rich, and the highs are clear. There&#8217;s no noise cancelling at work here, so you will get a decent amount of audio bleed-in from your surroundings, but they do a decent job of sound isolation for an over-hear set. And the sound quality is made all the better because of the class-leading battery life Marshall has managed to pack into the Major IV. Indeed, 80+ hours is just astounding, and it means you&#8217;ll likely be able to go at least a week or two without even thinking about a charger while using these actively.</p>\n<h2>Bottom line</h2>\n<p>Marshall has really delivered an amazing value with the new Major IV. Combining style, performance and quality into a headset that also has amazing battery life and unique wireless charging capabilities is a true achievement &#8212; and perks like 3.5mm wired audio sharing just round out the package. These are a great everyday headset that you won&#8217;t want to go anywhere without.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/work-from-home-gear\"><img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/work-from-home-gear-banner.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3iFwgjO-zQw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 14:34:23 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/04-usp03-major-iv-desktop@1.41x.jpg","linkMd5":"c4f2e4068745f82276f32c91c7df246a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn72@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-29-49-649_26beff2e4c31c0d4.webp","destWidth":939,"destHeight":639,"sourceBytes":100312,"destBytes":19518,"author":"Darrell Etherington","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/04-usp03-major-iv-desktop@1.41x.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn72@2020_1/2020/10/17/02-29-49-649_26beff2e4c31c0d4.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/work-from-home-gear-banner.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn31@2020_3/2020/10/17/02-30-04-388_5122a31fc18b5d93.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn67@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-29-56-919_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-04-663_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_6/2020/10/17/02-30-03-551_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn60@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-05-429_3dd698697319248a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3iFwgjO-zQw:mZXnVoz6VYA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn79@2020_5/2020/10/17/02-30-13-677_5f8af8ec7168a5a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_4/2020/10/17/02-30-05-019_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3iFwgjO-zQw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn48@2020_2/2020/10/17/02-30-12-634_d2bcd339642a5cee.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602901789464},{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 10:29:49","title":"Future raises $24M Series B for its $150/mo workout coaching app amid at-home fitness boom","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2061587","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">With thousands of gyms across the country forced to close during the pandemic, there&#8217;s been an unprecedented opportunity for fitness companies pitching an at-home solution.

It seems to be more squarely aimed at users who could be a candidate for getting a personal trainer but might not be ready to make the investment or don&#8217;t need the guided instruction so much as they need general guidelines and some accountability.</p>\n<p>As the startup closes on more funding, the team has big goals to expand its network. Mandal aims to have 1,000 coaches on the Future platform by this time next year. Reaching new scales could give the service a chance to tackle new challenges. Mandal sees opportunities for Future to expand its coaching services beyond fitness as it grows, &#8220;There&#8217;s a real opportunity to help people with all aspects of their
