Fans who want to check out the Spider-Man sequel sooner instead of later from the comfort of their own homes will soon be able to do so, while still supporting the film industry and not breaking the law. </p><p>\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" will now <a href=\"https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/1214477-spider-man-no-way-home-digital-release-date-leak\">release digitally</a> on March 15, 2022 -- aka, Tuesday! -- <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/729349/heres-when-you-can-watch-spider-man-no-way-home-at-home/\">moving up</a> a week from its original March 22 release date. Spider-fans will be able to purchase the film digitally on that day through Vudu, Apple, Google Play, and anywhere digital films are sold. Fans who want a physical copy to hang onto will have to wait a little longer, as the 4k, Blu-ray, and DVD release won't happen until April 12, 2022. Unlike most of the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" will not be available on Disney+ since the distribution rights are with Sony rather than Disney.</p><h2>Some Spidey-Features Worth The Wait</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/spider-man-no-way-home-to-get-early-digital-release-on-tuesday/some-spidey-features-worth-the-wait-1647219614.jpg\" /><p>While waiting two extra weeks to watch \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" from the comfort of your couch might seem impossible, the home video releases look pretty darn nice. The Best Buy <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/718946/spider-man-no-way-home-steelbook-art-lets-the-bad-guys-shine/\">exclusive steelbook</a> is <em>gorgeous</em>, and it comes with a 4K Ultra HD copy of the film along with a Blu-Ray and digital copy, giving buyers the most bang for their buck. After all, when you pack this much Spidey goodness into one film, a digital copy alone doesn't seem like quite enough. Three generations of Spider-bros and their villains definitely deserve a place on your shelf. </p><p>For folks who just can't wait to get the film in the eyeballs as soon as possible, the digital version hits stores on March 15. To celebrate the monumental coming together of the Spider-Men, the film can be purchased alone for $19.99, as part of the Disney \"Spider-Man\" three-film collection for $34.99, or as part of the \"Spider-Man\" eight-film bundle for city-crawling completionists for $59.99.</p><p>\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" stars Tom Holland, Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Marisa Tomei, J.K. Simmons, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church, Rhys Ifans, and a couple of other big names from \"Spider-Man\" history. The film was a massive success at the box office domestically and internationally, and was beloved by <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/712129/spider-man-no-way-home-spoiler-review-with-great-power-comes-great-redemption/\">critics</a> and audiences alike. Now you, too, can own your own little piece of <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/752109/no-way-home-box-office-has-cemented-spider-man-as-a-cultural-phenomenon-for-the-ages/\">\"Spider-Man\" history</a>. </p><blockquote>For the first time in the cinematic history of Spider-Man, our friendly neighborhood hero's identity is revealed, bringing his Super Hero responsibilities into conflict with his normal life and putting those he cares about most at risk. When he enlists Doctor Strange's help to restore his secret, the spell tears a hole in their world, releasing the most powerful villains who've ever fought a Spider-Man in any universe. Now, Peter will have to overcome his greatest challenge yet, which will not only forever alter his own future but the future of the Multiverse.</blockquote><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/585948/spider-man-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/\">Spider-Man Movies Ranked From Worst To Best</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/797658/spider-man-no-way-home-to-get-early-digital-release-on-tuesday/\">Spider-Man: No Way Home To Get Early Digital Release — On Tuesday!</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Dy5oAAEGv5Q:BSOPVTRQX_U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Dy5oAAEGv5Q:BSOPVTRQX_U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Dy5oAAEGv5Q:BSOPVTRQX_U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Dy5oAAEGv5Q:BSOPVTRQX_U:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Dy5oAAEGv5Q:BSOPVTRQX_U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Dy5oAAEGv5Q:BSOPVTRQX_U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 01:03:11 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/spider-man-no-way-home-to-get-early-digital-release-on-tuesday/intro-1647219614.jpg","linkMd5":"5bedbb879e7522c0cfbade00d8712d97","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn18@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-32-533_71ad3756ea874232.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":91627,"destBytes":38890,"author":"Danielle Ryan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/spider-man-no-way-home-to-get-early-digital-release-on-tuesday/intro-1647219614.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn18@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-32-533_71ad3756ea874232.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/spider-man-no-way-home-to-get-early-digital-release-on-tuesday/some-spidey-features-worth-the-wait-1647219614.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn52@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-05-022_b3e6069c5ab59b9e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn32@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-04-955_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Dy5oAAEGv5Q:BSOPVTRQX_U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn69@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-05-147_a4fbe22f7f6ebb04.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-05-790_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Dy5oAAEGv5Q:BSOPVTRQX_U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-04-927_794b3bc8267ffe1e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245672214},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","title":"Zoë Kravitz Gets A Cat And Sends Up Princess And The Frog In A Hit Or Miss Saturday Night Live","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/797607/zoe-kravitz-gets-a-cat-and-sends-up-princess-and-the-frog-in-a-hit-or-miss-saturday-night-live/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/zoe-kravitz-gets-a-cat-and-sends-up-princess-and-the-frog-in-a-hit-or-miss-saturday-night-live/intro-1647213027.jpg\" /><p>Since Robert Pattinson was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/761301/robert-pattinson-wants-you-to-know-that-batman-is-a-sad-weirdo/\">too busy wincing at the sun</a> and putting on black eye make-up so he can become vengeance, \"The Batman\" co-star Zoë Kravitz headed to Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza this weekend to make her hosting debut on \"Saturday Night Live.\" </p><p>For the most part, Zoë Kravitz is known as a pretty serious actress, with key roles in \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" and the \"Divergent\" franchise, and the titular role in Steven Soderbergh's most recent film \"Kimi,\" <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/761820/kimi-review-zoe-kravitz-finds-herself-in-a-digital-rear-window-situation-in-this-steven-soderbergh-thriller/\">now on HBO Max</a>. But Kravitz has been known to have some fun here and there as well, appearing in the R-rated comedy \"Rough Night\" with Scarlett Johansson, and making her (voice) debut as Catwoman in \"The LEGO Batman Movie.\" However, we've never seen her cut loose as she did on \"SNL,\" where she had no trouble bringing enthusiasm and energy to the night's sketches, even matching the ball of fire that is Bowen Yang. </p><p>So let's dig into the best and worst sketches from the Zoë Kravitz-hosted \"Saturday Night Live.\"</p><h2>The Best</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gJyTNrnpoGc\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Old Home Movies</strong> - There's a reason Kenan Thompson is the longest-running cast member on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and it's not just because he hasn't popped on the big screen as a leading man. It's because after all these years, he can still deliver sketch comedy gold like this. Here, we have Thompson delivering a secret message to his kids (Zoë Kravitz and Chris Redd) on a tape that was intended to be viewed after his death. It's full of things he doesn't want their mother (Ego Nwodim) to know about, with the exception of the plot to his crime thriller pitch, \"Dallas City Bouncers,\" which he wants everyone to know about. From the penis pump with the googly eyes to the financial losses on JB Smoove's sports betting app, this tape just gets better and better, and Thompson knocked it out of the park.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/pUc0942mJOU\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Don't Stop Believin' (Marching Band)</strong> - There's no denying that Bowen Yang often plays variations on the same character, typically a gay man with varying levels of flamboyancy. But if it ain't broke, don't fix it, and within the different shades of gay, Yang often delivers plenty of laughs. This sketch is no exception; the sheer excitement and boundless energy that Yang exhibits as he gushes about the Ohio State University marching band's rendition of Journey's hit \"Don't Stop Believin'\" is off-the-charts fantastic, and the random references to Rainbow Road on \"Mario Kart 8\" only make it better. Zoë Kravitz perfectly matches Yang's spark, and it's a gift to us all.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/kb60HrggbeQ\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Please Don't Destroy: We Got Her a Cat</strong> - Take the madcap energy of Please Don't Destroy and throw a cute cat into the equation, and I'm completely sold. Yes, getting Zoë Kravitz a cat is a bad idea, especially when it's so easily lost. With the cat concept alone, this sketch cracked me up, but it reached a whole new level when Paul Dano crept out from under the couch for some self-deprecating humor from the Please Don't Destroy boys. </p><h2>The Average</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/PVHWmmWAQno\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Maid of Honor</strong> - Zoë Kravitz kicked off the night with a fantastic turn in this funny but not raucously hilarious sketch. We've seen this formula before, and it almost always works. A character rattles off a list of surprising and increasingly worse facts about someone else in the room while another character has an uneasy realization that they don't really know this person at all. Kyle Mooney delivers the best unsettled reactions, Cecily Strong's enthusiasm about the worst parts of her personality are just right, and Kravitz's endless positivity keeps the sketch going strong. My only wish is that it veered into potentially more absurd territory.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zS9U3Gc832Y\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Amazon Go</strong> - This might be a simple premise, and it certainly isn't timely, but the execution still made it funny. Black people aren't about to be tricked by Amazon Go's seemingly easy checkout process, which involves simply walking out of the store without stopping at a cashier to pay. But Chris Redd, Kenan Thompson, Ego Nwodim, Punkie Johnson, and Zoë Kravitz know that's a damn trap. Watching everyone skeptically glance around like they're on the worst prank show is simple, but it's also effective.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3Wvhet4Yl-Y\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Word Crunch</strong> - Hey, it's a game show sketch! \"SNL\" hasn't been relying on these as much lately, so it was actually nice to see them dust one off. In this case, Andrew Dismukes has the right demeanor to be a game show host, but he's so young that it doesn't quite feel right, even if what he's saying and how he's saying it is funny. Though I like the premise of this sketch, I'm not sure \"momhole\" was the best option to go with for a joke that's meant to be repeated so much. But I must say that I enjoyed Kravitz rattling off all those other inappropriate words before ending with \"time.\" Good but not great.</p><h2>The Worst</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/fUM4eZySsMY\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Princess and the Frog</strong> - How can you waste such a great premise like the lesser celebrated Disney movies being in a Disney Minus section of Disney+ like this? This send-up of \"The Princess and the Frog,\" just feels too basic, opting for a joke about a frog not having a penis. But for me, this premise doesn't really work, because the story doesn't find Tiana marrying the frog form of Prince Naveen. Sometimes the lack of logic in these sketches is supremely frustrating, but that's also just the cinephile in me knowing how this movie is supposed to work. Even if we allow that leap in logic, this sketch was a mess technically, and the penis joke wasn't enough to sustain an entire sketch. But hey, Kenan Thompson as Dr. Facilier is still great.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_xOFEXVj4xs\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Porch Scene</strong> - We've seen Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant as these two awkward boys before, and I felt pretty much the same about it back then as I do now: I wasn't all that amused. McKinnon and Bryant aren't bad as these characters, but the way the sketch unfolds feels way too long, and the awkward comedy isn't good enough to justify the sketch's slow pace. In fact, the last time these characters <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/580444/carey-mulligan-hosted-saturday-night-live-season-46-best-and-worst-sketches/\">appeared with host Carey Mulligan</a>, I wrote, \"This sketch isn't terrible, but it just goes on for far too long while staying at the same level of comedy.\" Yeah, sounds about right. It's just not for me, but thankfully, there are plenty of other pairings of McKinnon and Bryant that are far better.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/D1J8t97gPW4\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>White House TikTok Meeting (Cold Open)</strong> - Good lord, another political cold open that calls in TikTok for an assist? Is this how desperate the topical satire of \"SNL\" has become? Do they really need to rely on spoofing familiar TikTok personalities to make a mockery of the current political climate? Can we just avoid political cold opens like this until there's actually something worth parodying? This sketch is bad, bad, bad, and not even James Austin Johnson's solid Joe Biden or a late appearance by Kenan Thompson can make it work. </p><h2>Weekend Update</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YK-f_zhe-gM\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>Colin Jost and Michael Che had another great round of Weekend Update jokes, though not quite as good as the past couple weeks. Jost's Starbucks jokes deserved more laughs, and I loved the reaction Che gave after Jost offered to sign him up for war. Plus, I love that Jost has pivoted to introducing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by mislabeling the pictures they use for his headlines, just as he typically does with Mitch McConnell. Meanwhile, Che took a great jab at Colin Jost's general whiteness, and he delivered one of his traditional groaners that is intended to ruffle some feathers. I loved it.</p><p>Watch the second part of Weekend Update <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBOjQykBB3U\">right here</a>.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/6_YxSGgl93E\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Film Critic Terry Fink on 2022's Oscars Predictions</strong> - Oh, it's been too long since we've gotten Terry Fink's LSD-fueled, fever dream recaps of movies. This is a great bit by Alex Moffat, and his on-air critic voice delivering the strangest twists and turns sounds as cheesy as any film critic you'd find on a local news affiliate in the 1990s. I just love this character. </p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/vkfJO_tP7P4\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><strong>Dan Bulldozer on the Impact of Social Media</strong> - It's a real bummer when a Kyle Mooney character doesn't work at the Weekend Update desk, but this one just didn't have the goods. It's too similar to a human version of Baby Yoda, and the sadness at the character's core is already better with Bruce Chandling. Sure, the voice manipulation is funny, but there were too many technical hiccups on that front too. No thanks!</p><h2>The Host</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Q49mfWHwgPw\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>Zoë Kravitz didn't quite soar in the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/789513/oscar-isaac-takes-down-paw-patrol-and-becomes-a-meatball-in-an-amusing-saturday-night-live/\">same way that Oscar Isaac did</a>, but clearly she had no problem getting bubbly, weird, and awkward throughout the evening. But much like Oscar Isaac, Kravitz's turn on \"SNL\" did make me want to see her tackle more material that wasn't so deadly serious. She's clearly got some brighter energy that works well for comedy, but I think she's getting a lot more drama, action, and thriller offers for the big screen. That may also be because studios aren't taking many chances on big comedies lately, but it would be great to see her jump into the indie circuit. Anyway, Kravitz's career is really taking off in a big direction, so hopefully we'll see her back at \"SNL\" sometime in the future.</p><h2>The MVP</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/zoe-kravitz-gets-a-cat-and-sends-up-princess-and-the-frog-in-a-hit-or-miss-saturday-night-live/the-mvp-1647213027.jpg\" /><p><strong>Kenan Thompson</strong> - First of all, let me say that this almost went to Bowen Yang for the \"Don't Stop Believin'\" sketch alone, but Thompson was funnier throughout the rest of the evening, so that's why he takes the MVP title this week. Not only was the \"Old Home Movies\" sketch a riot, but he was great in the \"Amazon Go\" sketch, and he helped improve two of the worst sketches of the night, even though it wasn't enough to save them. As the years go on, we'll look back and think about what a treasure Kenan Thompson was on \"SNL,\" and he will undoubtedly deserve to be praised as one of the best cast members of all time. </p><h2>The Final Word</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/zoe-kravitz-gets-a-cat-and-sends-up-princess-and-the-frog-in-a-hit-or-miss-saturday-night-live/the-final-word-1647213027.jpg\" /><p>As the third in a three-episode run, this episode came out on the lower end of quality, but it wasn't a bad episode either. Though the worst of the night were pretty terrible, the highs were pretty impressive, and even the average sketches were admirable. As of now, we're not sure when we'll be back for another episode of \"SNL.\" It's likely that the show will take a couple weeks off before returning with another round of back-to-back episodes in April, but no hosts or dates have been announced for the spring yet. Either way, we're coming up on the end of season 47, so hopefully some big name hosts are on the horizon as blockbuster summer begins to loom.

According to Deadline, Hurt's son Will shared that the actor \"died peacefully, among family, of natural causes\" just one week before his 72nd birthday. Though no official cause of death has been revealed at this time, Hurt was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer that had spread to the bone in May 2018.</p><p>After studying theology at Tufts University, Hurt turned to acting in 1972 and joined the Juilliard School, where his classmates included Christopher Reeve and Robin Williams. He made his feature film debut in the 1980 Ken Russell body horror \"Altered States,\" which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for New Star of the Year. From there, he became known for his Academy Award-nominated performances in \"Kiss of the Spider-Woman,\" \"Children of a Lesser God,\" \"Broadcast News,\" and \"A History of Violence,\" the first of which earned him the Oscar.</p><p>While Hurt is also fondly remembered for his roles in \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence,\" <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/582677/the-daily-stream-the-village/\">\"The Village,\"</a> and \"Into the Wild,\" Hurt also remained active on the stage throughout his career. He appeared in several Off-Broadway productions, such as \"Henry V,\" \"Richard II,\" and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" and earned his first Tony nomination for his performance in the 1985 Broadway production of \"Hurlyburly.\"</p><p>However, Hurt is probably most recognizable to younger audiences as General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starting with <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/565228/the-incredible-hulk-revisited-road-to-endgame/\">\"The Incredible Hulk\"</a> in 2008, he appeared as the stubborn father of Betty Ross and future secretary of state. He reprised the role in four later movies -- <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/718723/the-iron-man-scene-in-captain-america-civil-war-you-didnt-realize-was-improvised/\">\"Captain America: Civil War,\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/565818/avengers-infinity-war-revisited-road-to-endgame/\">\"Avengers: Infinity War,\"</a> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/771629/avengers-endgame-was-the-final-avengers-movie-according-to-kevin-feige/\">\"Avengers: Endgame,\"</a> and <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/569456/william-hurt-in-black-widow/\">\"Black Widow\"</a> -- serving as a grounding presence amid all the high-flying spectacle of the superhero franchise. With appearances spanning 13 years, Hurt had one of the longest tenures in the MCU so far.</p><h2>Remembering William Hurt</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/william-hurt-star-of-broadcast-news-and-the-mcus-thaddeus-ross-has-died-at-71/remembering-william-hurt-1647215484.jpg\" /><p>When news broke of Hurt's passing, an outpouring of love came from all corners of the internet to celebrate his life and career. His \"Mr. Brooks\" co-star <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaneCook/status/1503122834662387715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1503122834662387715%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2022%2F03%2Fwilliam-hurt-dead-reactions-to-death-by-peers-1234977332%2F\">Dane Cook</a> said, \"He was delightfully sinister in this role & a lovely guy when the cameras stopped. What a career. What a remarkable body of work.\" </p><p>Hurt's \"Broadcast News\" co-star <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlbertBrooks/status/1503124217499369479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1503124217499369479%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2022%2F03%2Fwilliam-hurt-dead-reactions-to-death-by-peers-1234977332%2F\">Albert Brooks</a> shared similar sentiments by saying, \"So sad to hear this news.

Great actor. Great mind.\" And filmmaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MNightShyamalan/status/1503141274773344262\">M. Night Shyamalan</a> shared his experience with Hurt on \"The Village\" by saying \"he was a master of his acting craft. Every take was new and revealing.\"</p><p>William Hurt's character in \"The Village,\" Edward Walker, at one point observes that \"the world moves for love. It kneels before it in awe.\" Hurt himself put great care and love into his craft, and both the accolades he earned in his lifetime and the outpouring of grief at the news of his passing are a testament to that. Survived by his four children and with a legion of fans around the world, the great William Hurt will be greatly missed.

Season 6 of \"<a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/726406/outlander-season-6-release-date-cast-and-more/\">Outlander</a>\" explores that question in its second episode, both in terms of the connections among those who live at Fraser's Ridge and also among the others who live in the lands surrounding the settlement.</p><p>There is also a birth, a death, and some sexy times, of course. And there's also a scene that I have dubbed to be the most fantastical moment of the show to date! Read on for /Film's spoiler-filled discussion about the 71 minutes of \"Allegiance,\" the second episode of Season 6 of \"Outlander.\"</p><h2>Being An Indian Agent Isn't All It's Cracked Up To Be</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/outlanders-latest-episode-tests-allegiances-and-tees-up-some-witchery/being-an-indian-agent-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be-1647030721.jpg\" /><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/787975/outlander-season-6-premiere-sets-the-stakes-for-a-tumultuous-new-season/\">season's first episode</a>, we saw Jamie (Sam Heughan) take on the position of Indian Agent for the Crown, mainly because he didn't want Richard Brown (Chris Larkin) in the role instead. We start \"Allegiance\" with Jamie fulfilling his Indian Agent responsibilities by traveling with Ian (John Bell) to meet with the Cherokee. </p><p>The Cherokee understandably want guns from the Crown and a promise that their land won't get taken from them by the new settlers. Jamie, however, is conflicted in whether he will convey their request — he knows there's a revolution coming and that he'll be fighting against the Redcoats when it does. If he conveys the Cherokee's desires to his local Redcoat liaison Major Macdonald, the Cherokee may fight against the revolutionaries down the road, something that Jamie wants to prevent.</p><p>When Jamie and Ian come back from their trip (after a humorous scene when a bashful Jamie politely refuses the advances of two Cherokee women), Jamie decides not convey the request to Major MacDonald. Ian is upset with the choice — he wants to give the Cherokee all the help they can, especially when Brianna (Sophie Skelton) breaks the news that things don't turn out so great for the Indians. We also find out at the end of the episode that Ian had a child when he was with the Mohawk. This revelation makes Jamie realize that Ian's family (or allegiance, if you will) is to both the Frasers and the country's indigenous people. Since Ian is Jamie's family, this makes the Indians his family by extension. And so he changes his mind about relaying the Cherokee's request for guns to the Crown. Is Jamie changing history by doing so? We don't know yet, although the momentous music that plays when Jamie seals the letter to the Crown suggests he may be. </p><h2>Requisite Sexy Times</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/outlanders-latest-episode-tests-allegiances-and-tees-up-some-witchery/requisite-sexy-times-1647030721.jpg\" /><p>Jamie and Claire (Caitriona Balfe) have their requisite sexy moment in \"Allegiance\" when Jamie comes back from the Cherokee all randy after his run-in with the Cherokee women. Jamie might be \"old\" (he's supposed to be in his early 50s this season), but he's still got it! The show doesn't want you to forget he's old, though, and has him admit to Claire afterward that he needs time to recharge before going at it again.</p><p>The episode's other \"sexy time\" moment is also the most unbelievable scene in all of \"Outlander\" to date, a show whose premise is based on people traveling through time via magical rocks. And no, I'm not talking about the scene in this episode where the old woman comes \"back to life\" at her own funeral, which wasn't sexy at all (thankfully!) and more humorous than anything. (It also sets up that Claire's going to get in trouble for being a \"witch,\" which I'll get to in a bit.)</p><p>The moment I'm talking about is when Marsali and Fergus start boning when Marsali is in labor. Nope! As a person who has given birth, I can't remotely imagine something like this happening, much less Marsali enjoying it, which the show suggests she does! I get we're supposed to see this as a sexy time scene with Fergus and Marsali once again connecting with each other (before Fergus becomes a deadbeat again), but I spent the whole time yelling, \"Nope, no, no thank you!\" at my television. </p><h2>Fergus Sucks In More Ways Than One</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/outlanders-latest-episode-tests-allegiances-and-tees-up-some-witchery/fergus-sucks-in-more-ways-than-one-1647030721.jpg\" /><p>Why do so many of the men in \"Outlander\" just completely suck (except for Jamie, of course)? I've been angry and disappointed with most of them — Roger, for one, especially back in season 4 when he waffled about coming back to Brianna because he wasn't sure he wanted to be with her after she was brutally raped and with child.</p><p>And now Fergus is added to that list — he's a drunk and rough with Marsali and simply not there for her and their kids. And why isn't he there? Because, as Marsali tells Claire, he's ashamed that he wasn't there when the Browns hurt them both.</p><p>Stop making Marsali and Claire getting attacked by the Browns about you, Fergus! I thought at one point he might get over himself this episode when he finally comes to Marsali and does his boob-sucking sexy time with her while she's in labor, but no! When he discovers that their new baby is a dwarf, he bails again. Be better, Fergus!</p><h2>But Mr. Christie Is Worse ... Way Worse</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/outlanders-latest-episode-tests-allegiances-and-tees-up-some-witchery/but-mr-christie-is-worse-way-worse-1647030721.jpg\" /><p>\"Allegiance\" also gave us some additional lovely moments with Thomas Christie (Mark Lewis Jones) that just make it wildly clear that he is a complete monster. We start out with him using the Bible to tell Claire to shut the f*** up when she's <em>helping</em> him with his hand wound. And while he first refuses Claire's offer to fix his other hand, he changes his mind when his ailment makes him unable to randomly beat his daughter Malva (Jessica Reynolds) when he's feeling bad about himself. What a swell guy! </p><p>Christie is also almost done with construction on what he hopes will be his church, which Jamie is none too happy about either. \"A church in Tom Christie's hand can become a weapon of war,\" Jamie says at one point, and I'm pretty sure he's right. Jamie visits Christie and politely tells Christie to remember his Free Mason allegiance (there's that word again) and have the building be a meeting house where all are welcome, including Claire, who some of his congregation have already started calling a witch based on one of their members \"coming back from the dead\" while she was in attendance. </p><p>Speaking of witches, it's clear that both Claire and Brianna are going to be accused of witchcraft and devilry, most likely with Christie leading the charge, at some point this season. Brianna got folded into the mess by inventing matches, something that her family doesn't seem impressed with but a young boy from Christie's group sees and thinks is magic. The premise fills me with dread, but I have a perhaps naïve hope that the tables will turn on Christie and he'll be the one pilloried in Fraser's Ridge in the near future. </p><h2>Other Thoughts</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/outlanders-latest-episode-tests-allegiances-and-tees-up-some-witchery/other-thoughts-1647030721.jpg\" /><ul><li>I forgot that Jaime's Cherokee name was Bear Killer. This is another data point supporting that Jaime is, in fact, very badass.</li><li>Jamie is more than just a badass, however — he is also a tender soul.

More often than not, these stories tend to feel a bit too clean and planned out, making sure every part of the story makes sense while sometimes losing a human element to it. Likewise, in the pursuit of epic action, battle scenes tend to focus on flashy characters capable of killing tons of enemies singlehandedly without the need to stop or rest.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That, of course, is not the case with tabletop RPGs. Whether it's \"Dungeons & Dragons\" or \"Pathfinder\" or any other game, things seldom go according to plan, and chaos often reigns. Likewise, a player doesn't need to be able to slay three goblins with a single sword stroke to be heroic; sometimes you can be as much of a hero just by providing support. It is here, in the intersection between creative chaos and teamwork, that \"The Legend of Vox Machina\" shines.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Based on \"Critical Role,\" a popular series of \"Dungeons and Dragons\" livestream campaigns, the show follows the misadventures of a group of adventurers known as Vox Machina. <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/743398/legend-of-vox-machina-review-high-fantasy-goes-low-brow-in-an-entertaining-dungeons-dragons-epic/\">The show does many things well</a>, from action to humor, but the show stands out among other fantasy adaptations and \"D&D\" movies and shows by capturing the very human element of tabletop RPG sessions.</p><h2>You Can't Kill A Dragon Without Help From Friends</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-legend-of-vox-machina-captures-the-creative-chaos-of-the-best-rpg-sessions/you-cant-kill-a-dragon-without-help-from-friends-1647210511.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Where many fantasy properties focus on making individual characters appear invincible and superpowered, \"The Legend of Vox Machina\" puts a focus on teamwork and making each character feel essential. Despite the titular Vox Machina being a mismatched group of misfits, it is a team where everyone already has a role. They rely on each other to be strong, they have banter in the middle of a fight, and they help each other out.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The best example of this is in the second episode, where Vox Machina faces off against a dragon, and everyone uses their unique class skills to get the job done. First, Scanlan, the bard, conjures up an illusion of the team fighting amongst themselves as a distraction. Before the dragon can act, Keyleth (a druid) and Percival de Rolo (a gunslinger fighter) stop the dragon in his tracks by shooting some cavern rocks on top of the dragon, and conjuring vines to trap him. While successfully dodging falling rocks like he was rolling on an athletics check, the team's rogue, Vax, gets help from a magic hand conjured by Scanlan, lands on top of the dragon, and proceeds to expose a weak point by slashing his throat open. Not to be left behind, Vax's sister, the ranger Vex, shoots a fateful arrow that is blessed by the team's cleric Pike to provide extra damage. To finish things up, the raging barbarian Grog enters rage and delivers a killing blow to the dragon.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is a fantastic scene, and just one of many scenes featuring Vox Machina working as a team, which isn't new to the fantasy genre, of course. What makes the show novel, and a great portrayal of RPGs, is the way it doesn't just show the rogue or the barbarian as apt heroes, but proves that each class can contribute in unique ways and also be badasses. Grog, the strongest of the group, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nerdist/status/1488237646350458893\">often relies on the blessings</a> of Pike, and when she leaves for half the season, her absence impacts how he approaches battles. Likewise, the lack of her healing abilities severely impacts the group's choices in battle. The show makes it a point to showcase the tank/support dynamic which is key to RPGs, and make it clear why it works so well and why it is important. Grog is strong, sure, but he is at his most effective when working together with Pike or Scanlan.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, \"The Legend of Vox Machina\" portrays specific mechanics that make its world feel real and grounded in its characters being vulnerable. Everything from concentration being needed to cast spells, to the usefulness of buff spells, to the need for short spells and the danger of running out of spell slots make it so you believe Vox Machina could lose and someone can die at any point. Splitting the party becomes terrifying, because the characters are even more vulnerable. Of course, this is still a fun show with moments of levity, which means these mechanics not only make it harder for the team to succeed without effort, but also open the door for hilarious moments of improvisation that are surprisingly well portrayed in the show.</p><h2>The Dice Of Fate</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-legend-of-vox-machina-captures-the-creative-chaos-of-the-best-rpg-sessions/the-dice-of-fate-1647210511.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Ask anyone who has ever played a tabletop RPG and they'll tell you that 95% of plans are doomed to fail, but also that failure can be just as exciting (if not more) than success. Sure, it's cool when you lay out a plan and it works perfectly, but it can be immensely more satisfying to see a complete failure of a plan give way to an improvised, desperate idea that actually works. The beauty of games like \"D&D\" is embracing the chaos and coming up with strange solutions to problems, and \"The Legend of Vox Machina\" definitely understands this.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Capturing improvisation in a scripted medium is tough, but \"Vox Machina\" finds ways to work around it, with situations that — even with a script — are so ridiculous you cannot help but imagine the behind-the-scenes dice rolling and laughs involved. No scene is better at this than Scanlan's solo adventure in episode 7, aptly titled \"Scanboo.\" In the episode, Scanlan gets separated from the group when he decides to provide a distraction to a group of guards. Rather than run away and save his skin, Scanlan somehow decides to fight back, and the animated show proves not only that Scanlan (and Sam Riegel, who voices him) is awesome, but that bards rule. Adapting episode 31 of \"Critical Role,\" we see Scanlan desperately grab whatever is in his bag that can be used for a fight, and he finds a scroll of polymorph, which he uses to turn into a freaking triceratops.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Fending off against a group of guards and a scary duke, the scene shows not only the power of Scanlan (and Sam Riegel, who plays Scanlan), but even the power of bards to be awesome. Adapting episode 31 of Critical Role, Scanlan grabs whatever is in his bag that can be used for a fight, drinking potions without knowing what they are, and getting incredibly lucky when one of the potions ends up being for fire breathing which he uses to dispose of most guards after having used a polymorph spell to become a triceratops and stampede through the place. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the original stream, Riegel spends a significant amount of time debating whether he should just use the triceratops to break a hole in a wall and run away, before deciding that being a triceratops is too fun an opportunity to pass up. \"The Legend of Vox Machina,\" even without the meta of seeing the characters say what they're thinking out loud, manages to capture that indecision, as well as Scanlan's \"oh well, we'll find out what happens\" attitude as he decides to fight back. It is a fantastic example of the kind of chaotic fun that only comes up when playing tabletop RPGs, the kind of desperate plan that cannot be pre-written, with Scanlan succeeding at every point, burping fireballs, and just killing everyone with sheer luck of the dice.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But just like we get moments of incredible serendipity, the dice can also work against you. Indeed, \"The Legend of Vox Machina\" knows the dice can turn a big enemy into a weak little pebble on the road, but it can also turn something very dumb into the most powerful foe. \"Critical Role\" fans know that Vox Machina often come into trouble with doors, and the animated show captures this perfectly during a scene where, no matter how much they try, the group simply <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tb676aO6SXs\">cannot get a stupid door open</a> — Scanlan literally gets hurt by trying. It's a little moment that otherwise would go unnoticed, but it shows the kind of unpredictability that comes with RPGs, and also with life.</p><p>\"The Legend of Vox Machina\" <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/773618/the-legend-of-vox-machina-spoiler-review/\">may not be perfect</a>, but it does more to capture the fun of playing tabletop RPGs than most shows and movies out there. Any show can be \"epic,\" but it takes a truly special show to be utterly chaotic and ridiculous too.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/597205/fantasy-films-that-never-got-sequels/\">13 Fantasy Films That Never Got Sequels</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/797585/the-legend-of-vox-machina-captures-the-creative-chaos-of-the-best-rpg-sessions/\">The Legend of Vox Machina Captures the Creative Chaos of the Best RPG Sessions</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5sGgxv9ZOGs:XIo9l62KnZU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5sGgxv9ZOGs:XIo9l62KnZU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5sGgxv9ZOGs:XIo9l62KnZU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5sGgxv9ZOGs:XIo9l62KnZU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=5sGgxv9ZOGs:XIo9l62KnZU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5sGgxv9ZOGs:XIo9l62KnZU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 22:39:17 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-legend-of-vox-machina-captures-the-creative-chaos-of-the-best-rpg-sessions/intro-1647210511.jpg","linkMd5":"122f651ef4a8faf7a2eba45047ec2b05","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-01-079_50eb77b2e9382ad5.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":95902,"destBytes":43932,"author":"Rafael Motamayor","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-legend-of-vox-machina-captures-the-creative-chaos-of-the-best-rpg-sessions/intro-1647210511.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-01-079_50eb77b2e9382ad5.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-legend-of-vox-machina-captures-the-creative-chaos-of-the-best-rpg-sessions/you-cant-kill-a-dragon-without-help-from-friends-1647210511.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn92@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-05-241_02bd4e390b96ec2e.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-legend-of-vox-machina-captures-the-creative-chaos-of-the-best-rpg-sessions/the-dice-of-fate-1647210511.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn95@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-04-805_6a57d65af8bfcdc4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn32@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-04-955_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5sGgxv9ZOGs:XIo9l62KnZU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn7@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-062_0946521da7e2382c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-05-790_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=5sGgxv9ZOGs:XIo9l62KnZU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn57@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-04-769_a76a6930a596b63c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245672230},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","title":"The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent Review: Nicolas Cage Is Nicolas Cage [SXSW]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/797661/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-review-nicolas-cage-is-nicolas-cage-sxsw/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-review-nicolas-cage-is-nicolas-cage-sxsw/intro-1647219901.jpg\" /><p>Nicolas Cage. Actor. Movie star. Meme. And generally, all three at once as part of a career that defies logical explanation. A weirdo character actor and an Oscar winner and an action hero and a seemingly fallen star stuck in a tragic loop of C-list nonsense to pay off a never-vanishing tax bill — Cage is such a character in the eyes of the public that it was only a matter of time before he became a movie character himself.</p><p>\"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent\" is a movie that feels like it was pitched alongside a giant pile of Nicolas Cage memes, but its success is due to its strangely nuanced tone, where its star plays alongside the joke instead of playing into it. Cage, cast as himself, is often nuanced, generally restrained, and painfully, awkwardly human ... but he's playing a performer who doesn't let the boundaries of traditional acting restrain him. The film walks a high-wire. This is not a movie about the weirdo from the YouTube compilation of his strangest moments in \"The Wicker Man,\" but rather a movie about the man who <em>plays</em> that weirdo.</p><p>And while Cage is a lot of fun here, it's a bit startling to watch his co-star, the ever-rising Pedro Pascal, grab the movie and walk away with it. That's the Nicolas Cage curse, one supposes. Always one step behind the comeback that will make everything right.</p><h2>Despite All My Range...</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-review-nicolas-cage-is-nicolas-cage-sxsw/despite-all-my-range-1647219901.jpg\" /><p>Pascal (\"Game of Thrones\" and \"The Mandalorian\") plays Javi Gutierrez, an obscenely wealthy movie fan who invites a down-on-his-luck Nicolas Cage to attend his birthday party for the un-turn-down-able price of $1 million. Cage's life and finances are a mess — his daughter hates him, he can't secure decent acting work, and he's literally haunted by himself, a figment of his imagination that dials his every meme'd impulse up to 11. These scenes are the ones you'll find ripped to YouTube the fastest, as restrained Cage plays alongside unhinged Cage, the wild young man who wants to know how it got burned, declares that he's a vampire before eating a live cockroach, and who once headlined a David Lynch movie. Yes, these moments are funny as hell. For many, they will be worth the price of admission.</p><p>But the real joy comes when Cage and Pascal share the screen, and Javi, the shy kajillionaire, slowly lets his Cage fan flag fly. He credits Cage's work with keeping him upright in his darkest hours, maintaining a small museum of Cage artifacts that movie fans will surely want to examine and re-examine for Easter eggs. Major blockbusters like \"Con Air\" and \"Face Off\" are referenced, alongside more niche titles like \"Mandy\" (a masterpiece, one character rightly declares) and \"Guarding Tess\" (the unlikely subject of a major plot point).</p><p>But this artist/fanboy relationship blossoms into a bonafide bromance, as Javi and Nicolas Cage learn that they're made for each other. Instant buddies. Platonic life partners. BFFs. They even watch \"Paddington 2\" together, a delightful moment in a film chock-full of them. Pascal and Cage share an easygoing chemistry, and the scenes of them hanging out, driving around the Spanish coast, getting high on LSD, and trying to fix each other's lives are a delight. And while Cage is very fun here, it's easy to see why Pascal is currently being cast in every TV show and movie in existence — he's hilarious, sweet, disarming, and seemingly unafraid to be completely silly in service of character or plot. One could argue that Pascal, the complete package of actor, movie star, and weirdo, is being a better Nicolas Cage right now than Nicolas Cage is.</p><h2>I'm Still Just A Rat In A (Nicolas) Cage</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-review-nicolas-cage-is-nicolas-cage-sxsw/im-still-just-a-rat-in-a-nicolas-cage-1647219901.jpg\" /><p>Unfortunately, the movie has to find time for the other side of the plot. You see, Javi is so rich because he's a dangerous man, the leader of a weapons cartel who has seemingly abducted a politician's daughter and plans to execute her. Cage, already roped in for the birthday party, is recruited by the CIA to spy on his new buddy and report the details. These scenes are like a hat on top of a hat, or another scoop of ice cream on top of the sundae. It sounds great, and it sounds silly, and it sounds wild enough to work, but these scenes never gel. Director Tom Gormican is clearly more comfortable with the Linklater and Apatow-esque scenes of Javi and Nic just being dudes than he is with the espionage stuff, which ends up feeling dull in comparison to Cage and Pacal's lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry. As Cage's CIA handlers, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz feel a bit lost, scrambling to find the comedy in their infinite reams of exposition.</p><p>This plotline takes over the movie entirely in its third act, leading to a conclusion that is a bit too much like the lousy B-movies Cage has been making in recent years to live up to the uproarious joys of the first hour and change. Not even a number of meta-references about how so many adult dramas about real people, man, need action beats to get made can soften it.</p><p>But when \"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent\" is good, it's really good, and the kind of gonzo project that has no right to exist. Maybe the CIA plotline was needed to get the movie off the ground (as the script itself slyly suggests), and Gormican and company just chose to have as much fun as humanly possible with the central bromance and hoped for the best with the rest. Two hours of Javi and Nic talking about German expressionist filmmaking and swapping story notes, while nirvana for some folks, wouldn't look as good in trailers as Nicolas Cage screaming with a gun in his hand. It can't help but feel like a compromise.</p><p>Still, this is a hard film to dislike. Cage brings what you'd expect, Pascal brings even more, and their awkward, adorable, genuine kinship represents how so many of us feel about Cage these days.

It's not about keeping you guessing. It's about keeping you completely in the dark before flipping on the lights and yelling, \"GOTCHA!\" There are ways to make such an approach work, but \"The Cow\" hasn't found them. Instead, Eli Horowitz's mumblecore-ish thriller keeps jumping back and forth in time, cluing us in on what's happening via randomly placed flashbacks that seem to be from no one's perspective. </p><p>Kath (Winona Ryder) is coming around to the fact that her youth is behind her. Gone are her wild, youthful nights, replaced by rather low-key dinner parties and quiet afternoons. However, she's not entirely ready to let her younger days go, and is dating Max (John Gallagher Jr.), who is younger than her, both literally and emotionally. In fact, Max acts even younger than he actually is; rocking out and partying seems to be the only thing on his mind at all times. Kath and Max have been together for about a year, and yet when we first meet them, they seem like they're on a first date. The pair are on a road trip to a weekend getaway at a remote cabin, and their conversation is stilted and awkward. The awkwardness only increases when the duo finally arrives at the cabin and finds it already occupied.</p><p>A younger couple, the hostile Al (Owen Teague) and the friendlier Greta (Brianne Tju), have already unpacked and claim <em>they</em> rented the cabin for the weekend. Al wants Kath and Max to get back in their car and turn right around, and Kath seems inclined to agree. Max, however, asks if they can at least stay for the night, and Greta is more than open to the idea. As the night wears on, the quartet plays a board game geared at couples — the type of fictional board game that seems to only exist to provide character development. As the game goes on it becomes clear that Max and Kath's relationship is, for lack of a better phrase, painfully boring. And then the night gives way to morning, and things start to get <em>really</em> weird. </p><h2>A Murky Slog</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-cow-review-winona-ryder-goes-through-a-bad-breakup-in-this-unfocused-thriller-sxsw/a-murky-slog-1646420879.jpg\" /><p>After this initial setup, I assumed \"The Cow\" was going to spend almost its entire runtime at the cabin. That we were in for a one-location film where four characters have to bounce off each other in a confined space. But to the film's credit, it surprised me. The cabin sequence is just a set-up for things to come. After that initial night, Kath wakes up to find Al distraught and Greta and Max gone. Al says that Max and Greta, who were mightily flirty during the playing of the board game, have run off together. While that's a plausible enough scenario, what follows is not. Kath seemingly immediately accepts this scenario even though she's known Max for a year and only known Al for about a few hours. With no proof to go on, and no word from Max himself, Kath simply believes that her boyfriend ran away without a word, and so she heads back home.</p><p>But it gnaws on her. It's not that she doesn't believe that Max ran off. In fact, a part of her knows that a breakup with Max is a <em>good</em> thing. But she's still bothered by the whole scenario and wants to figure out why Max chose now, of all times, to cut and run. Through a series of implausible events, Kath teams up with Barlow (Dermot Mulroney), the ruggedly handsome owner of the cabin, to try to get to the bottom of things. </p><p>There are hints that all is not well from the get-go. On the ride up to the cabin, Kath asks Max where he heard about the place. \"Some people were talking about it,\" Max vaguely replies. \"What people?\" asks Kath. \"You know, people,\" Max says and changes the subject. Suspicious! Little by little, \"The Cow\" shows us bits and pieces of what's happening here and asks us to take some rather huge logic leaps along the way. If there's one thing anchoring all of this, it's Ryder, who brings the right amount of weariness and confusion to her role. She plays Kath as someone who seems very tired of it all; someone who just wants peace and quiet. And yet, she can't let this mystery involving Max go, although it certainly helps that her new pal Barlow, with his salt-and-pepper beard, is a fox. </p><p>In fact, Ryder is honestly the only shining light here. Mulroney downplays his character to the extreme, while Teague and Tju, as the young couple, go for big, loud, almost cartoonish performances that begin to get real old, real quick. \"The Cow\" deserves points for eventually laying all its cards on the table without blinking, and there's a certain satisfaction to be had from how twisted things become. But getting there is a chore and a half, and \"The Cow\" lacks anything resembling momentum. The random flashbacks feel like they were added quickly in post, as if Horowitz and co-writer Matthew Derby realized at the last minute that nothing here was adding up. I'm always happy to see Ryder get work, and she always brings something fresh to her roles. But she deserves better than the murky slog that is \"The Cow.\" </p><p><strong>/Film Review: 4 out of 10</strong></p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/733143/the-horror-movies-we-cant-wait-to-see-in-2022/\">The Horror Movies We Can't Wait To See In 2022</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/788347/the-cow-review-winona-ryder-goes-through-a-bad-breakup-in-this-unfocused-thriller-sxsw/\">The Cow Review: Winona Ryder Goes Through a Bad Breakup in This Unfocused Thriller [SXSW]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=G86anCM5XUg:5PBo2rY9vWs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=G86anCM5XUg:5PBo2rY9vWs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=G86anCM5XUg:5PBo2rY9vWs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=G86anCM5XUg:5PBo2rY9vWs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=G86anCM5XUg:5PBo2rY9vWs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=G86anCM5XUg:5PBo2rY9vWs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 05:00:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-cow-review-winona-ryder-goes-through-a-bad-breakup-in-this-unfocused-thriller-sxsw/intro-1646420879.jpg","linkMd5":"3b251369c86669a81a506de8a3a5e7fe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn14@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-32-475_b32ae79f6e7f9c3f.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":80403,"destBytes":23706,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-cow-review-winona-ryder-goes-through-a-bad-breakup-in-this-unfocused-thriller-sxsw/intro-1646420879.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn14@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-32-475_b32ae79f6e7f9c3f.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-cow-review-winona-ryder-goes-through-a-bad-breakup-in-this-unfocused-thriller-sxsw/a-murky-slog-1646420879.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn19@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-076_abbbd235e75be3bd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn32@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-04-955_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=G86anCM5XUg:5PBo2rY9vWs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn44@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-05-224_b5ec3c24a5e54269.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-05-790_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=G86anCM5XUg:5PBo2rY9vWs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn44@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-05-305_64aed15d81faa601.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245672243},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","title":"The Daily Stream: Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory Is Delightful Nightmare Fuel","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/797645/the-daily-stream-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-daily-stream-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory/intro-1647218399.jpg\" /><p><em>(Welcome to <strong>The Daily Stream</strong>, an ongoing series in which the /Film team shares what they've been watching, why it's worth checking out, and where you can stream it.)</em></p><p><strong>The Movie:</strong> \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\"</p><p><strong>Where You Can Stream It:</strong> Netflix</p><p><strong>The Pitch:</strong> I have a weird love/lasting fear of \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" from my childhood. I wasn't around when it came out, but it did play on television. It did two things to me. First, it made me question advertising, since the Everlasting Gobstoppers they sell are <em>not</em> everlasting like they are in the film. Second, it gave me nightmares that I still have to this day. </p><p>It's the story of Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum), a very poor kid who discovers a golden ticket in his Wonka-brand chocolate bar, meaning he gets to go with a few other kids and their guardians to tour Willy Wonka's famous chocolate factory with none other than the reclusive and extremely weird Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) himself. One by one, the kids do stupid things and get removed from the tour is delightfully awful ways. </p><p>One caveat; there are some very problematic things in here (like the Oompa-Loompas). I am therefore recommending this as a stream if you're an adult, and if you're old enough to understand what those problematic things are or explain them to your kid. </p><h2>Why It's Essential Viewing</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-daily-stream-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory/why-its-essential-viewing-1647218399.jpg\" /><p>It sounds like I'm telling you to avoid \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,\" but I'm not. This 1971 film features one of the best performances from the legendary Gene Wilder. That man had the uncanny ability to look haunted and sweet and menacing at the same time. It's perfect for Willy Wonka, who doesn't seem to have a problem messing up children, but is still somehow loveable.</p><p>I guess in a way that's part of the appeal and <em>wait</em>, I didn't mean to sound psychotic. Children are great! I just love the fact that there are consequences to the choices they make. Augustus Gloop (Michael Böllner) drinks out of the chocolate river, making my inner germaphobe shudder, and he gets punished for it. Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole) thinks she should get anything she wants, and ends up being put down a shoot reserved for \"bad eggs.\" Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson) won't stop chewing her gum and turns into a giant blueberry that has to be squeezed out.</p><h2>It's Scrumdiddlyumptious!</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-daily-stream-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory/its-scrumdiddlyumptious-1647218399.jpg\" /><p>\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" is the very definition of poetic justice. No one is really a good guy other than Charlie. Wonka would be up on child endangerment charges today. Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) is a complete jerk, letting Charlie's mom cook and clean as he sits in bed for years, and only gets up at the prospect of free chocolate and a factory tour. I like the not-so-perfect versions of kids and the wildly irresponsible adults. I like consequences.</p><p>What I also like -- now -- is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB401RfGMlM\">sequence</a> as Wonka takes the kids on a boat through a tunnel and scares the crap out of them. There are horrifying pictures on the wall, and Wonka sort of sing/speaks a macabre poem. It's just absurd and creepy, and the delight Wonka takes in messing with everyone appeals to my darker side. I do still have nightmares, but I just watched it again and found myself laughing at how weird the studio allowed this children's film to be. I mean, you could not do this now. We keep trying, of course, but Johnny Depp's version is just uncomfortable to watch.</p><p>When you get to the end and the \"surviving\" child is left, you know that kid <em>earned</em> that place. It's not through the power of love and friendship like rewards usually are in kid films and animated shows these days. It's that he was less awful than the rest of them. It's sort of refreshing.</p><p>I apologize in advance for your non-stop humming of \"The Candy Man.\"</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/797251/the-daily-stream-doctor-sleep-is-the-best-of-both-stephen-king-and-stanley-kubrick/\">The Daily Stream: Doctor Sleep Is The Best Of Both Stephen King And Stanley Kubrick</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/797645/the-daily-stream-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory/\">The Daily Stream: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory Is Delightful Nightmare Fuel</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=C4LAOuxXBg8:GK69LAfsC5s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=C4LAOuxXBg8:GK69LAfsC5s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=C4LAOuxXBg8:GK69LAfsC5s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=C4LAOuxXBg8:GK69LAfsC5s:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=C4LAOuxXBg8:GK69LAfsC5s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=C4LAOuxXBg8:GK69LAfsC5s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 01:15:46 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-daily-stream-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory/intro-1647218399.jpg","linkMd5":"66753a0e07c5842c5d6d54d413a754aa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn5@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-35-060_dcc6086e1fa42bdb.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":133682,"destBytes":48230,"author":"Jenna Busch","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-daily-stream-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory/intro-1647218399.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn5@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-35-060_dcc6086e1fa42bdb.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-daily-stream-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory/why-its-essential-viewing-1647218399.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn51@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-28-362_986ff70aaf301ca1.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-daily-stream-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory/its-scrumdiddlyumptious-1647218399.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn45@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-055_39eab85dadf46732.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn32@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-04-955_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=C4LAOuxXBg8:GK69LAfsC5s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn63@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-05-192_e2d186e64e85ec26.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-05-790_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=C4LAOuxXBg8:GK69LAfsC5s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn81@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-04-981_f902bfc288ed8340.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245672242},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","title":"DMZ Review: A Well-Crafted Tale About Hope In The Face Of Hopelessness","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/796313/dmz-review-a-well-crafted-tale-about-hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dmz-is-a-well-crafted-tale-about-hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness-review/intro-1647026255.jpg\" /><p>Dystopian fiction has been pretty popular on television for a while now, thanks to shows like \"The Walking Dead,\" \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" and \"Snowpiercer.\" As our own world feels increasingly unfriendly, many turn to dystopian dramas to feel less alone in their fears, or get some type of survivalist wish-fulfillment. Most dystopian shows are incredibly heavy, dealing with the darkest parts of humanity in blunt and brutal ways. In the end, they all walk a careful balance between inspiring hope and fear, reminding us that we're always one step away from being survivors ourselves. </p><p>\"DMZ\" is based on the comic book series of the same name by Brian Wood and Riccardo Burchielli, though it makes some big changes right out of the gate. You won't see the comic's protagonist, Matty Roth, anywhere. Instead, we follow Alma Ortega (Rosario Dawson), who later takes on the moniker of \"Zee,\" and is based on the medical student character from the comics. \"DMZ\" is set in an alternate near-future, in a timeline where the United States has fractured due to a second American Civil War. Manhattan becomes a demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the United States of America and the Free States of America. The two nations have come to a ceasefire, but the DMZ is a tinder box waiting to ignite and possibly bring the war back to an active conflict. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/582414/ava-duvernay-dmz-series-cast/\">The series</a> starts with Zee, a doctor, breaking into the DMZ one night with 24 hours to get back across the border. She wants to look for her son, Christian (Freddy Miyares), whom she lost during the evacuation of Manhattan. It's been six years since she was forced to flee, and she's spent that time searching for Christian in both the USA and the FSA. The only place he could possibly be is in the DMZ, leading Zee to hire someone to sneak her in. The first episode follows her as a fish out of water, trying to reconcile her memories of the place she once lived with what it has become. Memory plays a heavy role in \"DMZ,\" as various characters cling to their memories as a means of survival. Zee is fearless in the face of just about everything and anything because she has so desperately latched onto the memory of her son. Dawson is absolutely incredible as a fierce mama bear — and she's not some flawless flattened heroine, but a character that's both challenging and challenged. She makes mistakes. She's overly cocky, sometimes to a point of being fatally foolhardy. But she's also deeply empathetic and kind, with a strong sense of morality that she refuses to let slip.</p><p>Zee soon becomes caught up in an ongoing battle for the streets between two rival gangs, each led by men from her former life. Parco Delgado (Benjamin Bratt) is her ex-husband, a gangster even before a war that took over the Latin Kings inside of the DMZ. He controls about half of the city, while Wilson (Hoon Lee) runs Chinatown and his own gang. Wilson and Zee worked together at a medical clinic before the war, and they remember one another fondly. She seeks out the two men, hoping one of them knows something about Christian, and that's when she's forced to deal with this new reality. </p><h2>The Sacrifices Of Survival</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dmz-is-a-well-crafted-tale-about-hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness-review/the-sacrifices-of-survival-1647026255.jpg\" /><p>\"DMZ\" starts like one thing and becomes another after its first episode, so sharing too much more of the plot would be a disservice. What begins as a \"The Walking Dead\"-style scenario with a grim, all-too-real aesthetic soon turns into a story about the power of community, true democracy, and standing up for what you believe in. There are moments where the series could lean into its tragedy, but thankfully these moments are brief. Zee is on a mission, after all, and taking time to process her trauma as it happens isn't exactly on the table. Instead, \"DMZ\" shows us how each of these survivors, from the gang lords to the street kids, manages to get by because of sacrifice. </p><p>Parco and Wilson sacrifice their humanity, growing their power with the blood of others. Zee sacrifices her time, energy, and safety. Odi (Jordan Preston Carter), a young boy who befriends Zee early on and serves as her guide to the DMZ, sacrifices his childhood. The parts of themselves these survivors choose to give determines not only their survival but what kind of person they will eventually become, as forged by their trauma. </p><p>As Zee gets more involved in the gang wars of the DMZ and an upcoming election for governor that pits Parco against Wilson, she starts to question her own sacrifices. More importantly, she questions her purpose and sets out to not only save her son from the DMZ, but to save the DMZ from itself. The back half of the limited series is a heart-pumping criminal political thriller that digs deep into communal identities and tribalism. Zee is a total outsider, and her perspective shakes up the DMZ enough to maybe change it forever. </p><p>The world-building in \"DMZ\" is phenomenal, and a huge part of what makes the series sing. Even the most tertiary characters are given traits to make them memorable, and they each get their own tiny arcs. Just as the series tries to teach us, everyone matters in a true democracy, from the folks at the top all the way to the city's most impoverished. Care was given to every single character, and similar attention has been paid to the various settings. The DMZ feels appropriately lived-in, with its own subcultures, styles, and slang. The score from Kris Bowers (\"Space Jam: A New Legacy\") is excellent, mixing rap, trip-hop, salsa, and more to create a sound that's perfect for a neo-Manhattan. A cover of Massive Attack's \"Angel\" is one of the only needle drops, and it takes place during a key sequence that is sure to give some viewers chills. The cinematography from Matthew J. Lloyd (\"Colin in Black & White\") is stellar, ditching the faded grungy filters of most dystopian TV in favor of lots of colored lighting and high contrast. The series looks appropriately comic book-inspired with its color pallet and occasional Dutch angles, but it never goes as far as pastiche.</p><h2>Keep Moving</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dmz-is-a-well-crafted-tale-about-hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness-review/keep-moving-1647026504.jpg\" /><p>There are tiny moments throughout the series that tell the viewer everything they need to know about the world without a single line of dialogue. One such scene features Odi's young friend Nico (Venus Ariel) as she discovers the body of a dead gangster. She immediately starts rifling through his jacket, completely unfazed by the horror in front of her. When she discovers a gold-plated pistol, she's thrilled and holds her prize like a girl her age in our world might hold the latest iPhone. She's been so hardened by her time in the DMZ that she has become almost feral, and she's a perfect example of how repeated trauma forges people into something different.</p><p>Thankfully, the series points out that trauma can also make us better, as long as we acknowledge it and do something to break the cycles of violence that caused it in the first place. There are lessons here about not only the way big events like war and violence impact us, but also the ways we can traumatize one another without even knowing it. Sometimes the bonds of family and identity can be a curse, and only some kind of sacrifice can set you free. There are many kinds of survival represented in \"DMZ,\" and it forces us to question the human desire for <a href=\"https://wp.looper.com/The%20thing%20is,%20a%20beautiful,%20chaotic,%20messy%20grappling%20with%20gender%20and%20who%20can%20do%20what,%20and%20what%20power%20looks%20like,%20and%20who%20really%20has%20the%20power.%20%20Read%20More:%20https://www.slashfilm.com/635851/dmz-image-breakdown-whos-who-in-the-second-american-civil-war/?utm_campaign=clip\">power</a>, and why some seize it all for themselves. It also questions the very nature of power, and how sometimes the most powerful are simply those who give a voice to the people.</p><p>Fans of \"Sons of Anarchy\" are bound to enjoy the series, as showrunner Roberto Patino wrote a number of episodes for that series, and his understanding of gangland \"law and order\" is on full display. Ava DuVernay directed the pilot, which is tonally rather different from the three other episodes directed by Ernest R. Dickerson. Dickerson has directing credits on a number of apocalyptic and dystopian shows like \"Under the Dome,\" \"The Walking Dead,\" \"The Man in the High Castle,\" and \"The Purge,\" and his steady hand helps keep the show on the rails and focused on its deeper themes without ever getting too lost in the weeds.</p><p>No one ever thinks that their home could turn into a war zone, but it's always a possibility. While some viewers might find the series a little <em>too</em> relevant and topical, its message of hope in the face of hopelessness sets it apart from many of its dystopian contemporaries. There's violence, pain, and suffering, but it never feels exploitative or intended for shock value, and the disturbing moments often pass quickly, providing tiny reminders of the stakes without ever becoming maudlin. In the end, \"DMZ\" seems meant to inspire us and remind us of our own power, even when the road ahead seems impossible. Zee has a phrase she used to tell her son when things got tough: \"eyes forward, love.\" The trick is to keep moving and never look back, without forgetting what you learn along the way.</p><p><strong>/Film Rating: 8 out of 10</strong></p><p><em>\"DMZ\" premieres March 17, 2022, on HBO Max.</em></p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/738014/films-top-10-movies-of-2021/\">/Film's Top 10 Movies Of 2021</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/796313/dmz-review-a-well-crafted-tale-about-hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness/\">DMZ Review: A Well-Crafted Tale About Hope in the Face of Hopelessness</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zVFwonnGJLc:gCysVsbjE0A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zVFwonnGJLc:gCysVsbjE0A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zVFwonnGJLc:gCysVsbjE0A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zVFwonnGJLc:gCysVsbjE0A:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=zVFwonnGJLc:gCysVsbjE0A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zVFwonnGJLc:gCysVsbjE0A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 00:00:12 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dmz-is-a-well-crafted-tale-about-hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness-review/intro-1647026255.jpg","linkMd5":"b90a6a77a0c18ee24871315d23a13e15","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-32-473_fbf2ed3972898da4.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":115488,"destBytes":32668,"author":"Danielle Ryan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dmz-is-a-well-crafted-tale-about-hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness-review/intro-1647026255.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-32-473_fbf2ed3972898da4.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dmz-is-a-well-crafted-tale-about-hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness-review/the-sacrifices-of-survival-1647026255.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn73@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-04-771_4ccba183f6bc4b64.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/dmz-is-a-well-crafted-tale-about-hope-in-the-face-of-hopelessness-review/keep-moving-1647026504.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn65@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-04-889_8fd24527c290fd39.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn32@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-04-955_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zVFwonnGJLc:gCysVsbjE0A:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn87@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-05-118_6017286e231953fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-05-790_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=zVFwonnGJLc:gCysVsbjE0A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn23@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-04-860_6fc3b22ffeed411f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245672242},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","title":"Titans Star Joseph Morgan Says Season 4 Will Be Brother Blood's Origin Story","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/797609/titans-star-joseph-morgan-says-season-4-will-be-brother-bloods-origin-story/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/titans-star-joseph-morgan-says-season-4-will-be-brother-bloods-origin-story/intro-1647213718.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Does anyone else feel like superhero stories are entering their horror phase? Between the vampire-led \"Morbius,\" the serial killer-centric \"The Batman,\" and horror-tinged upcoming projects like Marvel's Halloween special, it seems like it's spooky season for the caped crusaders -- and I for one couldn't be happier about it. HBO Max's \"Titans\" seems to be on board with the trend, as its fourth season is set to explore the origins of another vampire-like villain, Brother Blood (Joseph Morgan).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/753960/titans-season-4-adds-a-bunch-of-villains-to-the-mix-mother-mayhem-brother-blood-and-jinx/\">Brother Blood</a> is a DC villain who first appeared in \"The New Teen Titans\" in the '80s, as the latest in a long line of cursed, power-hungry priests. Throughout his comic run, Brother Blood has started a cult, visited hell, performed a dark ritual or two, and attempted to find his Bride of Blood (aw!). This is fertile ground for \"Titans\" to explore, but according to Morgan (\"The Vampire Diaries\"), the show will start simple, with the villain's origin story.</p><h2>Meet Brother Blood Before The Blood</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/titans-star-joseph-morgan-says-season-4-will-be-brother-bloods-origin-story/meet-brother-blood-before-the-blood-1647214138.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">In an Instagram story (<a href=\"https://comicbook.com/dc/news/titans-season-4-brother-blood-star-teases-origin-story/\">via Comicbook.com</a>), Morgan revealed that he's started shooting the first two episodes of \"Titans\" season 4. \"What's been hugely enjoyable for me -- in fact, this is the reason I wanted to do this part in the first place,\" Morgan says, \"is that as you know, I'm playing a character called Brother Blood, but that's not where he starts off.\" The actor then explains that the character begins as Sebastian Sangue before acquiring his supervillain persona.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Morgan seems excited to tackle what he calls \"an origin story of a villain.\" Though <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/783068/titans-season-4-has-begun-production/\">production just began</a> at the end of February, Morgan already seems to have a high point. \"What's been incredibly rewarding for me -- and will continue to be, I think -- is exploring how he gets from being Sebastian to becoming Brother Blood,\" the actor teased.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While we won't know what's in store for this Brother Blood until we get some footage from \"Titans\" season 4, we can speculate about the characterization based on previous Brother Bloods that have been seen on screen. The villain has appeared most often in animation: first in the 2003 \"Teen Titans\" series, then in \"Teen Titans Go!\" and finally in a direct-to-video film called \"Teen Titans: The Judas Contract.\" A reimagining of the character also appeared in \"Arrow,\" played by Kevin Alejandro.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While the animated versions mostly show an older, established version of Blood and the Arrow-verse Blood strays from comic lore, Morgan's take on Brother Blood has the capacity to share a fresh angle on the villain as he grows into his evil.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Titans\" season 4 will debut on HBO Max, likely in 2022.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/588311/superman-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best/\">Superman Movies Ranked From Worst To Best</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/797609/titans-star-joseph-morgan-says-season-4-will-be-brother-bloods-origin-story/\">Titans Star Joseph Morgan Says Season 4 Will Be Brother Blood's Origin Story</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XkXk55ESxkM:9EAxLswS1zY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XkXk55ESxkM:9EAxLswS1zY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XkXk55ESxkM:9EAxLswS1zY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XkXk55ESxkM:9EAxLswS1zY:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=XkXk55ESxkM:9EAxLswS1zY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XkXk55ESxkM:9EAxLswS1zY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 13 Mar 2022 23:30:31 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/titans-star-joseph-morgan-says-season-4-will-be-brother-bloods-origin-story/intro-1647213718.jpg","linkMd5":"2edb7f12d8d77ae66a57170779daf053","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn40@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-53-114_3f7dba644bf0bf3d.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":71716,"destBytes":23412,"author":"Valerie Ettenhofer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/titans-star-joseph-morgan-says-season-4-will-be-brother-bloods-origin-story/intro-1647213718.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn40@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-14-53-114_3f7dba644bf0bf3d.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/titans-star-joseph-morgan-says-season-4-will-be-brother-bloods-origin-story/meet-brother-blood-before-the-blood-1647214138.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn98@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-04-996_8728e46abd1010ee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn32@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-04-955_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XkXk55ESxkM:9EAxLswS1zY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn67@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-04-931_d79f44d67682680f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-05-790_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=XkXk55ESxkM:9EAxLswS1zY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn40@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-261_2d1e0fe9057fb787.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245672215}],"record":{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:32","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 08:14:32 +0000","fetchMs":44,"handleMs":928,"totalMs":63298,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af0629e1ae74a27744b4cbd27b40a78e","hostName":"us-001*","requestId":"a113ceb314ee4514a3b584484d4b5a10_21","contentType":"text/xml;
