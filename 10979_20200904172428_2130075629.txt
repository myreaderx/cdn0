Originally built by Pippin Williamson in 2012, RCP was early to the membership space and kept its promise of simplicity and stability throughout its tenure to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of years ago, the <a href=\"https://sandhillsdev.com/\">Sandhills Development</a> team put new energy into RCP, and <a href=\"https://sandhillsdev.com/2020/01/2019-year-in-review/\">in 2019</a> the product made nearly $500,000 in revenue. 2020 is set to outpace those numbers. While the sale price is not disclosed, it is a seven-figure deal, likely somewhere between two and four times annual revenue. No members of the Sandhills team are moving over to iThemes and <a href=\"https://www.liquidweb.com/\">Liquid Web</a> (the iThemes parent company), but there is a multi-month transition plan in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In our interview, we talked a lot about the process of the deal, the transition expectations, the past and future of the product, and the emotions surrounding the sale ��� particularly for Pippin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategically, selling RCP enables Sandhills to better focus on their other products and free up several team members' energy. RCP was profitable and fun for them to work on, but they knew it was the right fit with iThemes and were excited to be able to better share the workload on Easy Digital Downloads, AffiliateWP, and their other products. Pippin compared it to hiring multiple full time team members, by simply transitioning what they are working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the sale enabled them to put some cash in the bank, a comforting thing for a relatively small company in an extraordinarily uncertain time. Sandhills is very much an employee-first company, and this safety net lets them approach the future with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For iThemes, Matt tells me that the acquisition excites them in part because it gets them on the front-facing part of websites once again. For years now they have focused on the utility side through backups, security, etc. Now they can offer more than peace of mind to their customers by helping them make money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restrict Content Pro makes a lot of strategic sense for both Liquid Web and iThemes. Sandhills has always had a great audience, but it is most popular among developers and tinkerers ��� people ready to get their hands dirty a bit. iThemes opens up a much more user-centric audience, and it expands the base of potential customers through cross-marketing. Liquid Web has put a lot of energy into optimizing for eCommerce, and RCP offers a much more niche eCommerce product for their eCommerce audience that is not selling physical goods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All around, this deal just makes sense. Thanks to recent energy reviving the product, website, and RCP community, Pippin and his team were able to receive a compelling offer for Restrict Content Pro. Thanks to a well-established marketing plan, and a well-established roadmap for furthering the product's success, iThemes should be able to nicely capitalize on the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I'm glad to see a win-win and the opportunity for two companies I admire to take a new step in their respective journeys.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 17:06:47 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d7ec15923d795a38d026472211b4dcd4","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brian Krogsgard","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240444},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WPTavern: Elementor 3.0 Allows Users to Create a Personalized Design System","link":"https://wptavern.com/?p=103574","description":"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Elementor version 3.0 was <a href=\"https://elementor.com/blog/elementor-3-new-professional-features/\">launched on Tuesday</a>. This release is the first major update to the plugin in over two years and is one of the largest upgrades in its history. The new version focuses on a design system, a new theme builder, and performance improvements. The driving motivation behind this release was to create global design tools, which is a shift from the plugin&rsquo;s roots as a mere page builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my biggest complaints about <em>builder</em> plugins is that they have often approached design on the individual page level first. However, web design is not about how you can fancy up a page. It is about taking a holistic approach to the overall design of the site. When building single pages, users of such plugins far too often create more work for themselves, much of it better handled on a global scale. One of the cornerstones of development is to not repeat work you have already done. Builder plugins can too easily push those who use them toward such bad habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design should handle the foundational, global features first. Then, drill down to the atomic level when necessary. Builder plugins have almost exclusively gotten this backward in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor 3.0 seeks to solve this problem by introducing its design system and a new theme builder. The latter is part of its pro offering. The design system is essentially a global style creator and is available in both the free and pro versions. This is a welcome addition to the plugin and should create a solution for those foundational elements that the plugin has been missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Creating a site with a design system in mind (i.e. style guide, colors, and typography) is how professionals approach building websites,&rdquo; said Ariel Klikstein, the co-founder and CTO of Elementor. &ldquo;For many creators, this is an integral part of building the site as it helps them, their teams, and their clients to align and communicate around a consistent vision.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elementor team is coming to terms with the principles that have long guided web designers. The goal is to apply these principles to a user interface, breaking outside the confines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Design system capabilities are among the pillars of building professional websites, as they give the ability to view and control the site elements from a centralized hub and apply sitewide changes to overall colors, typography, and layout,&rdquo; said Klikstein.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elementor&rsquo;s Design System</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Editing global colors with Elementor&rsquo;s design system.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Elementor is pitching its new design system as revolutionary. However, such design systems have long existed in the WordPress ecosystem. Theme developers have created similar systems for well over a decade, and they have since capitalized on WordPress&rsquo;s built-in customizer to do it in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is whether this new system ups the ante, creating a new baseline in which others must compete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That will be for users to decide. However, it does offer a plethora of options under its Site Settings menu. It allows end-users to customize colors, typography, and several other elements across the site. Current plugin users will have tools in their hands to do some more amazing things with Elementor, and they will be able to do them in a much more streamlined manner. Ultimately, it should save time and make it possible to update the site over the long term without re-editing old work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not particularly revolutionary, but it is something that should be standard for any sort of visual design system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s true that applying global styles was always possible using custom CSS code and themes, in Elementor V3.0 we made these options truly global,&rdquo; said Klikstein. &ldquo;Today they are independent of a theme, plugin, or widget as part of the element-based web design paradigm. The design system features are integrated into the editor workflow, without the need to use a single line of code. This will let the user implement global colors and fonts across any site element &mdash; be it a button, heading, or background. Then, if the user decides to change the color or a font style, he or she can change it once and apply it wherever it was previously placed in the global setting.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To not mislead readers, note that most themes that have implemented such systems have also not required custom CSS or other code.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the bigger question is whether this new design system will be better than the upcoming <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/focuses/global-styles/\">global styles</a> feature in Gutenberg and core WordPress. The aims of the two are similar, but WordPress will undoubtedly launch its feature with a much more limited set of options. WordPress will also need buy-in from theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Klikstein did not directly respond to the question of how WordPress&rsquo;s global styles feature impacted any decision that went into Elementor&rsquo;s design system feature. However, when cutting through the marketing cruft, he did say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see that Gutenberg/WordPress is also moving in this direction because we believe this is the best way to create consistent and maintainable websites.&rdquo;  He also said this feature was on the roadmap since the plugin&rsquo;s earlier theme builder concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg may not be much of a consideration for Elementor&rsquo;s development team. They are clearly carving their own path to success and outpacing others in the race to building websites through a visual interface.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 20:35:46 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4f1bb8753e7ac4befef7021aa789bc5a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Justin Tadlock","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240445},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WPTavern: Gutenberg 8.9 Brings Block-Based Widgets Out of the Experimental Stage","link":"https://wptavern.com/?p=104238","description":"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Wednesday, September 2, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/09/03/whats-new-in-gutenberg-2-september/\">Gutenberg 8.9 launched</a> with a set of new features, enhancements, and several bug fixes. The development team took the block-based widgets system out of its experimental stage, making it the default experience for all plugin users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based widgets have taken months upon months of work. The team has surpassed some of my expectations by essentially sticking a square peg into a square hole, granting the power of blocks to the sidebars/widgets system. On the whole, the system works. However, the team still has a lot of work to mold this feature into the shape it needs to be in for the upcoming WordPress 5.6 release in December. It is important that the community at large test, provide feedback, and contribute where possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg plugin users who have not yet enabled block-based widgets via the experiments screen in past versions will be in for a surprise. The new system will have some of the familiarity of the block editor. However, it is a much different experience than traditional widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big questions we must answer is whether the feature is currently usable and whether it can be ready for WordPress 5.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Widgets Screen</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Block-based widgets screen.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg completely replaces the old Appearance &gt; Widgets screen in the WordPress admin. The plugin no longer has an option for end-users to disable it, which was expected. The goal is to begin getting users accustomed to building their sidebars with blocks rather than traditional widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, the new widgets screen handles block-based widgets without issue from a usability perspective. Adding blocks is little different from working with the post-editing screen. It should feel relatively natural for users who are accustomed to the block editor. If anything, the experience seems scaled down in comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike widgets in the past, blocks cannot be collapsed (the sidebars themselves can be). As a long-time WordPress user, this feels uncomfortable. However, it is the sort of uncomfortableness that will simply take some adjustment time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core legacy widgets worked well. However, I could not get legacy widgets to work from several third-party plugins. Sometimes, they disappeared from the editor. Then, they would later appear, seemingly at random. Eventually, during testing, I completely broke the page to the point where it did not display anything. Fortunately, I was able to fix it by clearing out a few widget-related rows from the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a developer, I want to simply wipe the slate clean and leave the old widgets system in the dust of history. However, doing so may very well alienate many end-users. For this feature to be successful, we need to carry them along and allow them to easily transition from their current tools to the new system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Widget Blocks in the Customizer</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Widget blocks section in the customizer.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">While the primary widget blocks screen was generally solid, that was not the case with widget blocks in the customizer. At best, it was sub-par.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may finally be at that point where I agree with all those earlier complaints of the customizer control panel being too narrow. The most obvious issue was that the block toolbar was too wide for the control panel, hiding pieces of it off-screen. For some blocks, there are buttons that users cannot access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is not the end of the issues. Block options are unavailable, so users cannot even add something as basic as an image alt attribute. The core legacy widget blocks are not editable. The &ldquo;more options&rdquo; button popup has a transparent background, making the text unreadable and, for all intents and purposes, not worth attempting a use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand that WordPress is still far from launching widget blocks in the customizer, but the feature was practically unusable. It is still very much in an experimental state and probably should have remained optional for another plugin update or two or three. I cannot recommend using this within any sort of production environment. Stick with the widgets screen in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Widgets/Blocks Styling Issues for Theme Authors</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />No structured grouping of &ldquo;widget&rdquo; HTML.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the largest changes that theme authors need to be aware of is that blocks in sidebars do not have the typical widget HTML wrappers. This could present some issues with styling widgets in the traditional fashion. For example, themes usually register a widget wrapper element and a wrapper for the widget title. This allows theme authors to build consistent styles for each widget. With blocks, this becomes much tougher because the theme author loses that control &mdash; this control is passed to the end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great part of this system is that users can do some really interesting things and have the flexibility to style their sidebars in any way they want. The bad part is that if a theme author has any sort of intricate styles, such as a boxed widget design, there is no easy way for the end-user to simply drop <em>widgets</em> into place and have them all use that boxed design. There is no standard class name for the theme author to target with CSS, which is what is required for consistently-styled widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not necessarily a good or bad thing in and of itself. It is simply different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, I would have much preferred the Gutenberg development team created a new and separate system from the old sidebars/widgets system. Leave that in place, then build and promote &ldquo;block areas&rdquo; as a new system for theme authors to take advantage of. In the long run, it would allow theme authors to make the transition and even potentially support both systems in their themes. Theme authors are down in the trenches, working with their users on a day-to-day basis. They are in a much better position to handle the transition from old to new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors who are not prepared to go <em>all in</em> with block-based widgets in WordPress 5.6 can add the following line of PHP to their theme&rsquo;s setup code to disable the widgets block editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>remove_theme_support( 'widgets-block-editor' );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, theme authors will want to fully transition to the new system. However, this will provide additional time for them to make any adjustments that may be needed with how widgets are handled.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 17:05:15 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1c01ef07e0f160af13597d57d36fca81","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Justin Tadlock","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240445},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WPTavern: Sunlit 3.0 for iOS Released, Featuring New Post Editor and Improved Discovery Interface","link":"https://wptavern.com/?p=103996","description":"<p><a href=\"https://sunlit.io/\">Sunlit</a> 3.0 was released this week and is now <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunlit/id1334727769\">available in the App Store</a>. The free photoblogging app is a companion app to the <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> indie microblogging platform. Sunlit has some similarities to Instagram minus the deadweight of ads and algorithms. Users can follow each other, comment on posts, and timeline photos are displayed in chronological order.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The idea is to get more people posting photos to their own blogs, whether that&rsquo;s hosted on Micro.blog,&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com</a>, or a self-hosted WordPress,&rdquo; Micro.blog creator Manton Reece said. Publishing to WordPress does not require any extra plugins, because&nbsp;the app uses the built-in XML-RPC support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunlit uses Micro.blog&rsquo;s infrastructure for the social aspect (replies and mentions). Users must be signed into a Micro.blog account (either paid or free) to view the timeline or reply to posts. In the current version, users are required to go to Micro.blog on the web to register first but Reece said his team is aiming to make this more seamless in the future so users can start using all the features in Sunlit right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Some people use Micro.blog for their blog exclusively, and some people have a mix of a microblog or photoblog on Micro.blog, as well as a full blog on WordPress,&rdquo; Reece said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunlit also has <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2020/08/31/countdown-to-sunlit.html\">support for following Tumblr photoblogs</a>. In the app&rsquo;s Discover tab, users can enter a Tumblr subdomain like &ldquo;username.tumblr.com,&rdquo; and then follow the blog even if the user is not on Sunlit. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Micro.blog is based on blogs and IndieWeb standards so that it can integrate well with the rest of the web, not be walled off like a silo,&rdquo; Reece said. &ldquo;One aspect of this is that you can follow many blogs in Micro.blog even if the author of the blog hasn&rsquo;t registered on Micro.blog yet, similar to how you can subscribe to blogs in a feed reader like NetNewsWire or Feedbin.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunlit 3.0 has been redesigned with a new Discover interface and a faster, more flexible posting screen. Users can publish a quick photo or even a full blog post with text and photos uploaded to the users&rsquo; blog, along with the HTML layout for the post. This version also includes user search and support for mentions when replying to conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Micro.blog is currently supporting the app&rsquo;s development, and Reese said he has no plans to add any commercial upgrades into Sunlit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We support Sunlit as part of running Micro.blog,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sunlit makes an existing Micro.blog subscription more useful, so it helps with the overall platform sustainability, even if not everyone using Sunlit is paying for a subscription. We hope that more people will sign up for a paid Micro.blog subscription, but it&rsquo;s not required.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunlit does not have an Android app but the teams would like to support Android in the future. The app is open source and <a href=\"https://github.com/microdotblog/sunlit\">available on GitHub</a> under the MIT License.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Because Sunlit for iOS is open source, this [Android support] might be something that comes from the community or it might be something we take the lead on. I personally have much more experience with iOS, so we started there.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 23:15:44 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"fa6c473f1fcd13d1cf19862499ae5cb1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Sarah Gooding","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240444},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WP Mobile Apps: Which devices will this work with?","link":"http://apps.wordpress.com/?p=4125","description":"<p>The WordPress app works with any device that is running iOS version 11 or greater.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 18:51:35 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"72e2355a2df1454202334e94db33ad5c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Nick Severson","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240444},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"HeroPress: Consistency Gets You Where You���re Going","link":"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=3263","description":"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/imran_sayed.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Imran Sayed\" /><p>The Tech Industry has given many gifts in my life. It has been an exciting journey so far. So today I decide to pen down my story as a self-taught Software Engineer and share it with the world.</p>\n<p>The story of my journey to WordPress really begins about two years ago.</p>\n<p>At the time, I was working a comfortable, well-paying job as a Team Lead at Tech Mahindra, one of the largest tech consultancy MNC���s in India. Through the 10 years that I worked at Tech M, I wore different hats &#8212; client representative, mentor, certified trainer &#8212; and collected several performance awards including mobile phones, televisions, a digital camera, microwave oven, a PlayStation and best of all, all-expense paid trip to <a href=\"https://codeytek.com/portfolio/trip-to-london/\">London</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f60e.png\" alt=\"����\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>I thought that programming will give me an ability to express my creative skills through code. The idea of how my work and my knowledge can benefit others is thrilling and something that I love.</p>\n<p>And the hero of my story is my very own brother, Sayed Taqui. Sayed is an experienced WordPress Developer and a core contributor, who gave me insights into this different world I had no idea about.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image2.jpg\"><img /></a>Sayed Taqui and Imran Sayed\n<h2>A new direction</h2>\n<p>This did not happen overnight. This was a big risk to change track and move from my job to this new world of WordPress and it actually took me two years to make up my mind.</p>\n<p>I started with saving money so I could quit my job and learn new skills. I started with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and then moved on to WordPress. I also learned to use the tools like Webpack, Babel &amp; Grunt.</p>\n<p>My brother Sayed was always around to help me and guided me with some great inputs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>learn the basics instead of specific frameworks (vanilla JS before jQuery)</li>\n<li>build games to get good at JS. I built my <a href=\"https://github.com/imranhsayed/shooting-game\">first game</a> in JavaScript, and in 2 weeks it was on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imranhsayed.birdshootinggame&hl=en\">PlayStore</a>.</li>\n<li>Hack away at the WordPress Core as a way to understand it deeply. He also suggested building a CMS in PHP to mimic WordPress, with CRUD functions, posts, pages and taxonomies, inspired by the WP Core.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>It all pays off!</b><br />\nAfter 7 months of rigorous self-training, I applied for a job in a startup called <a href=\"https://myrl.tech/\">Myrl Tech</a>. Myrl Tech was like a hardcore wrestling ground for me (������������ ������������������), where I learnt to build and deploy applications from scratch.</p>\n<p>After years��� worth of experience writing code, learning &amp; applying new technology, giving &amp; receiving training and even being involved with hiring, I got the opportunity to apply to <a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/\">rtCamp</a>, where I currently work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image4.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>rtCamp is a dream job for me. While the perks are great, what I identify most with is their importance on ethics, a friendly culture, and open-source community.</p>\n<h2>Giving back</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image3.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>During my learning journey, I realized a lot of topics can only be understood by digging into the WP Core. And while many learning resources are available online and on WordPress.org, there are not enough tutorials or blogs available for beginners.</p>\n<p>So I made a promise to myself that no matter how busy I get in future I will never forget my origin as a beginner and do what I can to help others. Knowledge is power and I feel it&#8217;s my responsibility to share what I know.</p>\n<p>So I���ve started a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/ImranSayedDev\">YouTube</a> channel, written tons of blog posts and put together several tutorials through my own open source learning platform. I am proud to have been a speaker at over 6 WordCamps across India. I am also a co-organizer of the local WP meetup group, and have organized 8 meetups last year.</p>\n<p>I have also spoken at several international events &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.crowdcast.io/e/22feb20WPstream/2\">Matt���s Popup Livestream</a> on <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/ImranSayed12/fastest-way-of-creating-gutenberg-blocks-with-minimal-javascript-knowledge-popup-livestream-22nd-feb-2020\">Gutenberg</a>, <a href=\"https://wpsessions.com/sessions/wordsesh-apac-2020/\">Wordsesh</a> on <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/ImranSayed12/why-progressive-apps-for-wordpress-wordsesh-2020\">PWA</a>, <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/#schedule\">JavaScript for WP Conference</a> on <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/ImranSayed12/harness-the-power-of-acf-for-gatsby-and-wordpress\">Gatsby</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imranhsayed/status/1243498037604827138\">WordPress VIP Webinar</a> and many more.</p>\n<p>I feel that there are many developers who have amazing knowledge but need a little push since they have never spoken in public. So while all of the above have been high points of my past couple of years, I also enjoy motivating <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Pune-WordPress-Knowledge-Exchange/events/270630113/\">new speakers</a> to share what they know.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image1.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<h2>Consistency is what got me here</h2>\n<p>Switching career paths has been very fulfilling. Having a supportive brother from the technical field was a blessing, and the skills I gained from the previous role like effective communication, public speaking etc, really helped. However, I���ve had to be patient, consistent and put in the work to make it happen. The advice I���d give to anyone pondering a similar switch is to focus on being consistent.</p>\n<p>I also feel that the best way to learn is to teach. Small positive steps ( teaching, helping others etc ) that we take today can make a big difference in a long run, not just in our life, but also the ones that directly or indirectly get influenced by our work.</p>\n<p>I encourage you to contribute to open-source, not just code but any way possible. Many of us have the potential to do better than what we are doing already. What���s important is we start and be consistent.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/consistency-gets-you-where-youre-going/\">Consistency Gets You Where You&#8217;re Going</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 20:30:48 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/imran_sayed.jpg","linkMd5":"4447190d4fb3cc76f08f6d86e2b63044","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn89@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-24-00-564_558ce617c9b0177c.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":512,"sourceBytes":63966,"destBytes":57844,"author":"Imran Sayed","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/imran_sayed.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn89@2020_3/2020/09/04/17-24-00-564_558ce617c9b0177c.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f60e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn1@2020_4/2020/09/04/17-24-27-962_faf9fcf2bac4715f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240445},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WP Mobile Apps: Which version of WordPress does the app work with?","link":"http://apps.wordpress.com/?p=4121","description":"<p>We make sure the app works with the current and two previous versions of WordPress.

I���ve never been someone to do that. I am cautious by nature, considered and ponderous. I plan, ponder, observe, I was always the child that watched and learnt through seeing. My introduction into the WordPress community like so most of my life experiences started with a circling on the edges, a gradual involvement, slowly acclimatising to the waters.</p>\n<h3>From DIY roots</h3>\n<p>It was the time when everyone was creating their own system from scratch, without asking if they could or should. PHP was fresh, smelt like newly baked cookies, delicious, tasty and often insecurely held together with hope, well-meaning wishes. I was riding the blogging community waves happy and fulfilled, yet frustrated by my own solution that was more a wish than an option. My blogging surf board was more a plank of wood well painted, but really close to breaking. Someone casually mentioned WordPress and after trying it, I was sold. This was pretty early in the life of the system we all enjoy now, but it had enough to show me that this was the way forward.</p>\n<p>What truly sold me was how I could customise and theme my site so easily. This really was at that time all I cared about.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With so many events like reboots and online refreshes, sites would change their themes more often than socks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I could embrace this with the ease of creating a theme. Style switchers were all the rage, I could change my theme as much as I wanted, with pretty minimal effort and leaving my content alone. It also meant I didn���t have to worry about security, which to be honest I avoided incidents previously out of luck over my code.</p>\n<p>Each release saw rapid improvements, bugs were easy to report and whilst I was very much on the edges, I was slowly moving a few more rings deeper into the experience, testing the water as I went. Reporting a bug, asking a question, joining an IRC chat. My contribution circles were increasing as I moved deeper within the project.</p>\n<h3>A timeline of sorts</h3>\n<p>It would be easy to get stuck on small details in this story, the problem is I want to tell as much of my journey as possible and I���ve been lucky it���s been so long so far. The temptation to expand is heavy, so I���ll try and focus on some points over a timeline.</p>\n<p>I am not sure when you say you joined a community, as I noted I sort of circled, dipping my toe in for a while. However, my first self noted contribution would be with the theme team. Working on building the &#8216;core&#8217; of WordPress itself was a hard place to find my start. It was noisy and as I mentioned I needed a quieter on-boarding. Within this space I could work through themes, learn slowly and participate in a smaller group. It was there I stayed for a while, growing my confidence as a contributor.</p>\n<h3>Following my passion</h3>\n<p>Time moved on and my freelance business grew from an acorn to a flourishing seedling and I made a choice to put my full bet on WordPress. By this time I had discovered not only WordPress, but begun to explore more fully BuddyPress too. It was there I found a place to thrive, grow and for a long time find my contribution space.</p>\n<p>Community and specifically enabling people to create, manage and build open source communities, was and always will be a passion of mine. Particularly in this day and age, the potential for empowerment from this type of software can���t be ignored. I count myself lucky to have been able to focus on this for the time I did.</p>\n<h3>Growing achievements with help</h3>\n<p>My passions were growing along with my business thanks to this project. It was incredible to not only run my own company, but thrive in this space and grow in confidence. I began to travel to WordCamps, speak at them, make connections and then in leaps and bounds grow my business. This continued for a number of years. I was incredibly lucky to count myself as one of the happy WordPress business stories.</p>\n<p>I got to focus on communities and as a result got to write a book about BuddyPress theme development.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Writing a book was powerful for me as a dyslexic.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Whilst not uncommon, for someone who is, writing a book can feel like quite a mountain and you likely are told you won���t achieve that at some point in your life. Never tell anyone they won���t do anything, because there���s a strong possibility given the chance they will, try giving them the opportunity instead.</p>\n<p>WordPress has given me some incredible opportunities in life and I count writing a book as one of them. I didn���t do it by myself though, just like I haven���t done anything in this community alone. I got to write through networking, connections, the people I met. Without the community, I wouldn���t have had the business or written the book. Behind every publication is the community, the network that helped create it.</p>\n<h3>WordPress has given me options</h3>\n<p>One thing this story so far hasn���t covered is the personal side of my life. It���s told you my WordPress journey, yet the tale of any person always has a personal side. Every single commit, every single contribution has a heart, a life behind it. Each contribution has their own ebbs and flows.</p>\n<p>Talking about myself isn���t easy because well I have a lot of privilege and right now in this world I know I am so very lucky to work remote, to have the job I do. Being able to be a full time contributor has given me a quality of life and empowerment I daily am grateful for.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It meant I could be the sole earner when my partner was too ill to work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It���s allowed us to move to the best location for medical care and support. I am not unique, so many contributors care, support and hold up so many others. It���s not just the contributor behind the contribution, it���s their families, those that depend on them.</p>\n<h3>Trying on contribution hats</h3>\n<p>If someone asks me where they should contribute, I always suggest they try a number of areas. This is motivated by my own journey. Your place can also change depending on where you are in your contribution adventure, mine did. Just because you enter one area, that doesn���t mean you should stay there. Often the project is enriched by you moving around, spreading your skills and activating. You have to go where you both are the most comfortable and effective, this could be a surprising place to you and others.</p>\n<p>A lot of the new contribution hurdles that once existed have been lowered, however for anyone joining it���s never easy. Remembering those first steps every single one of us took is crucial to keep projects alive. Once you forget how hard contribution is, you set yourself up to not have contributions.</p>\n<h3>You got this</h3>\n<p>If I could time travel there is probably a whole lot I���d do. In relation to my WordPress journey, if I could travel back through the many years to me as I click that first download of WordPress, I���d probably say this quote which I think is attributed to Winnie the Pooh.</p>\n<blockquote><p>���You���re braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.���</p>\n<p><small>��� </small><span class=\"authorOrTitle\"><small> A. A. Milne</small><br />\n</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>It���s so easy for us all to think we aren���t good enough. We can���t contribute. We can���t make a difference. We will never find our place. Nobody will ever want us in their project. I can���t lead. I am not good enough to be a team rep. I can���t speak on stage. I can���t lead a release. I can���t be a committer. A designer can���t write code. Sound familiar? I am sure one of those comments you���ve said to yourself, I���ve said them all to myself.</p>\n<p>Maybe in this complicated year, we all should take a moment to be a little gentler, kinder and more compassionate to ourselves. Take a moment to recognise that you can contribute, you can make a difference.. and you do.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/discovering-your-place/\">Discovering Your Place</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 09:00:09 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082120-min.jpg","linkMd5":"e86f69581cf1b63a3f8e005908dad350","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn94@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-24-00-671_e4980b0342ceb904.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":512,"sourceBytes":53217,"destBytes":72814,"author":"Tammie Lister","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082120-min.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn94@2020_5/2020/09/04/17-24-00-671_e4980b0342ceb904.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240445},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.5.1 Maintenance Release","link":"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=8979","description":"<p>WordPress 5.5.1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This maintenance release features&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=5.5.1&group=status&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&order=priority\" target=\"_blank\">34 bug fixes, 5 enhancements</a>, and&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/24828\" target=\"_blank\">5 bug fixes</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;block&nbsp;editor.

WP Engine also acquired Atomic Blocks in 2018, growing the plugin&rsquo;s user base from 3,000 active installs to more than 60,000 over the past two years. The purpose of rebranding is to more tightly align the block collection with the Genesis brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We decided to elevate the Genesis brand to be the parent brand for all of our block and theme products moving forward,&rdquo; WP Engine VP of web strategy David Vogelpohl said. &ldquo;While we could have changed the title of the Atomic Blocks plugin, we wanted the slug to represent the Genesis brand so we decided to create a new plugin to achieve that outcome.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, in order to get the preferred slug for the plugin, WP Engine has to create a new plugin, instead of renaming the existing one. The company is creating a migration tool to move the plugin&rsquo;s 60k users over to  Genesis Blocks.  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Based on initial prototypes, the migration path will be automated for most users of the plugin,&rdquo; Vogelpohl said. &ldquo;We believe that migration technology will be available at the end of our next two-week sprint (starting next week), but we aren&rsquo;t able to commit to a date until more work has been completed.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Genesis Blocks plugin will now be explicitly developed in support of StudioPress themes and the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://studiopress.com/genesis-pro?__hstc=141311597.cfcc56073bf7750c2817e395dcab7eff.1598463759872.1598463759872.1598463759872.1&__hssc=141311597.1.1598463759872&__hsfp=1755708871\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis Pro package</a>. This doesn&rsquo;t mean the blocks cannot be used with other themes. Rather, it&rsquo;s more clear to users that the collection is designed to look best with WP Engine&rsquo;s products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Genesis Blocks contains the same 22 free blocks found in its predecessor but can be upgraded via a Genesis Pro subscription to add more blocks, full page layouts, and pre-built sections. The subscription also includes access to advanced block-level user permissions as well as support for the Genesis Framework and its commercial child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://cloudup.com/ci12kCBu6zy\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/0-CWURP7ZY.gif\" alt=\"Pro\" width=\"1198\" height=\"794\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, all new features will be added to the new Genesis Blocks plugin, while support for Atomic Blocks gets scaled back to security releases and updates necessary for compatibility with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpdavidv\"></a>In time, it will be deprecated, but only after enough users have migrated over,&rdquo; Vogelpohl said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a date for that yet and any future decisions will be based on the percentage of people who have migrated and the effects of that decision on the users who have not migrated at that time. It&rsquo;s important for us to make decisions that are respectful of the users of any of our products and the sites they manage. We will clearly communicate future plans and dates for deprecation, but for now, users of Atomic Blocks will have plenty of time to migrate. We will continue to update Atomic Blocks for security releases and functionality relative to updates in WordPress until the plugin is officially wound down.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When WP Engine acquired StudioPress and the Genesis Framework, the company said it planned to integrate it tightly into the the WP Engine Digital Experience Platform so it performs better there than anywhere else.

It <a href=\"https://github.com/studiopress/atomic-blocks/commit/af4a4aa30b05537bc93baa48d932ab9407c8eb7f\">removed the &ldquo;AB&rdquo; branding</a> from its block titles. This minor update changed block titles such as AB Accordion and AB Button to Accordion and Button, respectively. On the surface, this change probably seemed of little consequence to the developers on the project. However, for at least one user, it created a massive workload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless users religiously followed the GitHub code commits, they would have missed this update. Stacked with several other code changes for a seemingly unrelated ticket, the team left a message that read, &ldquo;Remove unnecessary &lsquo;AB&rsquo; from block titles.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change made it into version 2.8.2 of the plugin, which launched a day later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem was that there was no message in the change log that noted this. Users had no indication that the blocks from the plugin were being renamed. Typically, this would not be a big deal since the plugin team had merely dropped the &ldquo;AB&rdquo; prefix from the otherwise unchanged titles. However, what happens when one of those blocks&rsquo; titles matches a core block title?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the issue that Marcus Tibesar ran into. The AB Button block suddenly became the Button block. Thinking he was using the core WordPress Button, he made liberal use of it throughout his site. Throw in his decision to drop the plugin after StudioPress rebranded its plugin to Genesis Blocks, it became a bit of a disaster to clean up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have been using the Button block for months now only to discover that I&rsquo;m actually using the Atomic Blocks button block!&rdquo; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/atomic-blocks-rebranded-to-genesis-blocks-migration-path-to-new-plugin-coming-soon#comment-340105\">wrote Tibesar in a comment</a> on the Atomic Blocks rebranding post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theoretically, he should have needed to update only any lingering blocks from Atomic Blocks that he had knowingly used. But, he was stuck with blocks that he had unknowingly added to his posts and pages through no fault of his own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular scenario was made worse because WordPress 5.4, released on March 31, introduced a new Buttons (plural) block. The old single Button block was removed from the normal inserter. While not all block-naming issues are so convoluted, it still begs the question: how can plugin authors avoid causing these types of user-experience issues?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to throw blame toward StudioPress &mdash; and the team could perhaps use a scolding for not being clear about the change when it happened. However, this brings forth a couple of things the greater WordPress community needs to figure out. The first is whether plugin authors need to use a consistent, prefixed naming scheme for their blocks. The second is what can WordPress do to help mitigate issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prefix All the Things</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Buttons, buttons, and more buttons.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">That is the common saying in the WordPress development world, <em>right</em>? Prefixing and namespacing guidelines generally apply to the actual code, which is where conflicts arise. However, there are times when prefixing public-facing text is warranted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those times are when plugins utilize a shared space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor is one such shared space. With more and more block plugins landing in the directory, it is time that plugin authors consider how block-naming schemes affect end-users. The issue is certainly not limited to Atomic/Genesis Blocks. This has been an ongoing trend with several block library plugins. Some do better than others, but it&rsquo;s a toss-up each time a user installs such a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest route is for plugin authors to simply prefix all custom blocks with their company branding (e.g., AB Button). On the other hand, not every block shares a title with one of the core blocks. For example, a block titled Product Carousel may not need to distinguish itself further from other blocks. It is unlikely that end-users are running multiple eCommerce plugins with blocks that share the same title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All, repeat all, should have a prefix,&rdquo; said Tibesar.  &ldquo;The prefixes eliminate any confusion as to whether we users are selecting a core block or a third-party block. The most popular plugins appear at the top of the list, and it&rsquo;s confusing from whence they came when prefixes are absent.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least, third-party blocks should have a prefix if their titles match one of the core blocks. End-users should not see two different Cover blocks in the block inserter, for example. Instead, they should see the core Cover and a second, uniquely-titled block. Prefixing is an easy way to do that. But, I could live with anything that does not cause user confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Locating Instances of Block Usage</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Manage Blocks screen.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In late 2019, the Gutenberg team released the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/version-1-prototype-of-the-wordpress-admin-block-directory-announced\">first prototype</a> of a potential block management area for the WordPress admin. The Manage Blocks screen from the prototype showcased an area that would allow users to manage every block on their site. One of the more important bits of information on this screen was an &ldquo;Instances&rdquo; count, which displayed the number of times a block was in use. It further linked to a screen with every post that had a particular block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons this feature is important is that it would allow end-users to locate posts that they may want to clean up. Using the Atomic/Genesis Button block as an example, Tibesar could track down all those old uses and make any changes he wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said he would absolutely welcome this feature in WordPress.  &ldquo;New users are tempted to load up on zillions of block plugins all to be forgotten later.  Also, maintainers would use this tool when cleaning up broken sites. Just being able to see an overview of&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;blocks were used&nbsp;<em>where</em>, will allow publishers to dial back the number of block plugins installed on their sites, especially when new plugins and technologies emerge.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because this feature is not in core yet, he had to turn to the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/find-my-blocks-plugin-shows-all-blocks-in-use-on-a-wordpress-site\">Find My Blocks</a> plugin, which helped him identify 22 posts and pages where he had unknowingly used the Button block from Atomic/Genesis Blocks. In the long term, this is something that needs to be handled directly in WordPress. It is unlikely to be the last time a user needs to clean house and get rid of old blocks.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 19:41:32 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1f302e835ac58c3a005864991e5fcc0f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Justin Tadlock","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240445},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: August 2020","link":"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=8983","description":"<p>August was special for WordPress lovers, as one of the most anticipated releases, WordPress 5.5, was launched.

She wrote the proposal after Matt Mullenweg, WordPress co-founder and project lead, reached out to discuss solutions. This was after he closed a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51043\">Trac ticket</a> last week that sought to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/no-minimum-php-version-bump-this-year-wordpress-to-support-php-5-6-for-a-while-longer\">drop support for PHP 5.6</a> and bump the minimum version to 7.1 for the next major WordPress release this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal lays out a position that many in the WordPress community could get behind. It is a clear-cut, transparent path for the platform&rsquo;s future PHP support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folmer essentially put forward two roadmaps in the proposal. The first roadmap decides at what stage WordPress would drop support for a particular PHP version. The platform would remove support for a PHP minor release that is more than five years old each December. This would coincide with whatever major release of WordPress is upcoming. The following schedule lays out the minimum-supported PHP version each year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>December 2020 &ndash; PHP 7.1</li><li>December 2021 &ndash; PHP 7.2</li><li>December 2022 &ndash; PHP 7.3</li><li>December 2023 &ndash; PHP 7.4</li><li>December 2024 &ndash; PHP 8.0</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of the proposal creates a rolling schedule for backporting security updates to WordPress. Currently, WordPress releases security updates all the way back to the version 3.7 branch. If adopted, Folmer&rsquo;s recommendation would support only the previous four years of WordPress releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a change would mean that when WordPress 5.6 is released in December 2020, the WordPress project would be committed to backporting security fixes as far back as WordPress 4.7, released in December 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folmer also proposes backporting PHP upgrade notices from the site health project to the currently-supported older versions of WordPress. This measure would inform users of PHP version issues before they make the jump to a newer version of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overlap of bumping the minimum PHP support into the future and backporting security fixes gives users a potentially huge window of nine years in which they could stay on whatever version of PHP they are currently on. Nine years may seem like a lifetime on the web with its constantly-changing technology, and it was a point of contention from some people in the comments of the post. However, it is a plan of action, something the WordPress community has not had the pleasure of experiencing with regards to PHP support. Developers will undoubtedly argue over the dates and versions, but that is secondary to actually having a predictable timeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fixed version bump schedule is welcome. It puts everyone from developers to end-users to web hosts on the same page. This level of transparency is necessary if we ever intend to move forward without rehashing the same arguments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system of waiting around to see when a specific PHP version&rsquo;s usage stats drop below a certain percentage just muddies things. The result is typically a long-winded argument that does not move the needle. Each side picks its stats. Each side digs its heels in. And each side has plenty of good points to make. Ultimately, everyone wants the same thing &mdash; to move the entire project forward and use up-to-date tools. However, they always disagree on how we get there. Eventually, the minimum PHP version gets bumped and the community gears up for the next round. It leaves us in a constant state of tug of war between those who want quicker advancement and those who do not want to leave users behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that no one is ever completely right in these arguments. There is no roadmap to follow. We have no guiding principle other than &ldquo;this has what&rsquo;s been done before.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress needs to set clear expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not just a problem with the minimum PHP version &mdash; many want a more-detailed roadmap for the entire project. However, minimum PHP support is one problematic area that we could have a solution for, and Folmer has carved out a path. We need only follow it.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 23:08:24 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4ff2d1d10d18a94e584ce83f01830ab8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Justin Tadlock","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240445},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WPTavern: MotoPress Acquires Gutenix WordPress Theme","link":"https://wptavern.com/?p=103914","description":"<p>MotoPress, a theme and plugin shop in operation since 2013, has <a href=\"https://motopress.com/blog/motopress-acquires-gutenix-wordpress-multipurpose-theme/\">acquired the Gutenix WordPress theme</a> and its commercial <a href=\"https://zeguten.zemez.io/\">ZeGuten</a> blocks plugin for Gutenberg.

Not only are our companies aligned in our Gutenberg-driven passion, but we both have realistic views on the current WordPress market demands, where Elementor and other builders have been great value for people.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenix is MotoPress&rsquo; first acquisition and the company plans to keep it as a separate product that is independent of <a href=\"https://motopress.com/membership/\">MotoPress Club</a> membership.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 04:34:51 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4ff1d6c29675353e49b12eada82c7c49","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Sarah Gooding","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240445},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WPTavern: Jetpack 8.9 Adds Donations Block, Newsletter Form, and Social Previews","link":"https://wptavern.com/?p=104088","description":"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Jeremey Herve, a Jetpack developer at Automattic, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2020/09/01/jetpack-grow-subscribers-collect-donations/\">announced the release of Jetpack 8.9</a> earlier today. The update brings several major features to the plugin&rsquo;s users. Jetpack now sports a new social preview option in the block editor, a newsletter signup form type, and a block for handling donations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 8.9 also adds support for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\">AMP plugin</a>. Herve noted that Google and Automattic have worked together over the past six months to make this integration happen. He also announced that the team would release an in-depth post on the <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/blog/\">Jetpack blog</a> on how end-users can use the tools available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the update seems to be a solid release. I have not run into any issues with the features I make use of thus far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Social Network Preview for Posts</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Social Previews popup modal.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The latest version of the plugin adds a new Social Previews tab under the Jetpack sidebar panel in the block editor. It lists a few social icons and a preview button. Clicking the button pops up a modal window that allows users to preview what their post will look like in various places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, only Google Search, Facebook, and Twitter previews are integrated. However, the announcement post noted that LinkedIn previews are in the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social Previews is not a particularly groundbreaking feature. However, it is a nice value-add for Jetpack users and almost a given in today&rsquo;s climate that is led by social networking sites. The feature is similar to what some SEO plugins, such as <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/social-previews/\">Yoast SEO Premium</a>, offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Newsletter Sign-up Form</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Select Newsletter Sign-up Form</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Form Appears with Necessary Fields</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Jetpack 8.9 introduces a Newsletter Sign-up form type via its Form block. When creating a new form, users will see the new option. It works as you might expect, adding a name and email field along with a message that the visitor is granting permission to send emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might not be immediately apparent for some users is that they will need to install and activate the third-party <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/creative-mail-by-constant-contact/\">Creative Mail</a> plugin for newsletters to work. Jetpack&rsquo;s Newsletter Sign-up merely handles the form. The newsletter aspect requires an account through the <a href=\"https://www.creativemail.com/plans/\">Creativ.eMail website</a>. The free plan allows up to 5,000 emails per month, but you will need to upgrade to a paid tier after that, which will cost at least $4.95 each month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this sounds a bit convoluted, it&rsquo;s because it is. Without reading the docs or opening the Newsletter Integration tab in the block options, some users may be wondering how this feature works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration itself works fluidly. Users can install and activate the plugin directly from the block editor. However, they will need to run through the setup and signup steps to begin using email campaigns, such as a newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Donations Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Donations block and options.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Requiring yet another third-party service is Jetpack&rsquo;s new Donations block. Users will need to be on a <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/pricing/\">paid Jetpack plan</a> to use the block, which allows them to integrate their Stripe account for collecting payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Donations block is a simple affair. With a paid account in place, it is pretty much a plug-and-play system. The block options should be straightforward for the average end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the Donations block and system may be too limited for some campaigns. This feature seems to more squarely target users who are looking to accept basic donations without all the features that a more mature donation plugin would provide. For anything beyond accepting a few small donations each year, I would lean toward the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/\">GiveWP plugin</a>. Its team is hyper-focused on making a great donation experience that scales to larger campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For users who are already using Jetpack and want to start small, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to give this block a spin. It is always possible to move up to a dedicated donation plugin down the road.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 21:06:50 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a41213a6a1a590891c993cdf81088d39","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Justin Tadlock","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240444},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WPTavern: WordPress 5.5.1 Released with Backfill for Deprecated JavaScript Globals","link":"https://wptavern.com/?p=104101","description":"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/09/wordpress-5-5-1-maintenance-release/\">WordPress 5.5.1</a> was released yesterday with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=5.5.1&group=status&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&order=priority\" target=\"_blank\">34 bug fixes, 4 enhancements</a>, and&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/24828\" target=\"_blank\">5 bug fixes</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;block&nbsp;editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 5.5 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/05/more-support-for-javascript-i18n-in-wordpress-5-5/\">removed 19 legacy&nbsp;JavaScript&nbsp;localization objects</a>, in favor of using the new functions and utilities found in the i18n package&nbsp;introduced in WordPress 5.0. One of the most notable changes in this maintenance release is the inclusion of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/09/01/deprecated-javascript-globals/\">a backfill for these now deprecated JavaScript globals</a>, which were causing errors with many popular plugins and themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If we only count plugins or themes with more than 100k installs or more, some of these already have an incredible impact, which is why we decided to&nbsp;patch&nbsp;this as fast possible.&rdquo; Joost de Valk said in an update compiling a list of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vho7hJR4DMRyns38xcUMvVUj8SBov_J8_X4a7zwpmzo/edit?usp=sharing\">affected extensions</a>, with the the help of Omar Reiss. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themes impacted include Astra (1 million+ installs), Storefront (200k+), Hestia (100k+), and dozens more. A small selection of the popular plugins that were impacted include Advanced Custom Fields (1 million+), SiteOrigins Widgets Bundle (1 million+), AMP for WP, (100k+),  WooCommerce Services (1 million+), Ocean Extra (600k+), and Rank Math SEO (400k+). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme and plugin developers still need to update their code to use&nbsp;<code>wp.i18n</code> but in the meantime the legacy code will not block JavaScript execution. De Valk said the new plan is to remove this fallback code in two major versions, so developers need to have their code updated by the time WordPress 5.7 rolls around in 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a question that also ought to be addressed is how such wide-spread breakage could happen, and how it can be prevented in future,&rdquo; David Anderson commented on the announcement regarding the backfill. &ldquo;What part of the release process ought to have flagged up that this was about to happen, how did that part fail, and how can future similar failures be prevented.&rdquo; Jake Spurlock suggested a retrospective on WordPress 5.5 might be a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three weeks after WordPress 5.5 was released, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-jquery-migrate-helper/\">Enable jQuery Migrate Helper</a> has more than 100,000 active installs. The plugin is available as a stopgap for users who experience problems with jQuery after updating to WP 5.5. Although several bumps along the road are expected for users during WordPress&rsquo; process of updating to use the latest version of jQuery, the official support forums were inundated with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/search/5.5?in=support_forums\">reports of broken sites</a> after 5.5 was released. Many users found out about the plugin after hours of troubleshooting and hunting for a fix. This is another issue that would be helpful to address in a 5.5 retrospective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This maintenance release also <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/27/wordpress-environment-types/\">removes the ability to alter the list of environment types</a> in the new&nbsp;<code>wp_get_environment_type()</code> function. Contributors decided that introducing new types wasn&rsquo;t the intention of the feature and that it makes it so that theme and plugin developers cannot rely on a set, predictable list of types. They are now limited to production, staging, development, and local, with definitions for each available in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/27/wordpress-environment-types/\">announcement</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;By limiting the set of environment types in this way, WordPress&nbsp;core, plugins, and themes can change their behavior depending on this setting,&rdquo; Joost de Valk said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.5.1 also fixes XML sitemaps paginating incorrectly, adds the site environment to debug information, and improves a number of other features that shipped with defects. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-5-1/\">full list of changes</a> is available on the release page.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 18:45:43 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d8ec87ea295275ebfeab96b9fe747298","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Sarah Gooding","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240444},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WPTavern: WordSesh EMEA 2020 Kicks Off September 2, Featuring Short Talks and Micro-Tutorials","link":"https://wptavern.com/?p=104024","description":"<p>The second edition of <a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/\">WordSesh EMEA</a> (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) is happening in less than 48 hours on September 2. The virtual event&rsquo;s schedule is tailored to attendees living in the Eastern hemisphere. In its first year running, WordSesh EMEA attracted a solid turnout of close to 1,000 attendees and was the proving ground for future regional WordSesh events. With WordCamp Europe <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-goes-virtual-for-2021-in-person-conference-to-resume-2022\">cancelling in-person events until 2022</a>, WordSesh EMEA is another way to highlight voices in the European WordPress community with a global audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There were definitely enough people at the inaugural WordSesh EMEA event that it was clear I needed to do it again, and expand into an APAC event,&rdquo; organizer Brian Richards said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richards had WordSesh APAC (Asia/Pacific) on the schedule for the end of March, right when the pandemic was breaking out. WordCamp Asia had just been cancelled the month before, as he was preparing to announce speakers for the WordSesh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I worked with the WCAsia organizers to invite as many speakers to speak as I could,&rdquo; Richards said. &ldquo;I ended up helping run a Feb 22 pop-up livestream event to host several of them and invited the remainder to join me on a second full day of sessions at WordSesh.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six months later, many WordCampers have had their fill of online events after months of mandated lockdowns and voluntary quarantining. Any new virtual event announced is immediately in competition with outdoor activities and hobbies that attendees could be engaging in away from the computer. Nevertheless, Richards has seen a threefold increase in signups over the previous year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are 3,200 folks registered currently, and we&rsquo;re on track to have 3,500 by the time things kick off on Sept 2nd,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been extremely mindful of virtual event fatigue for this one. This time around, the event is designed to fit inside an 8-hour span, inclusive of breaks, and no single session is longer than 20 minutes (plus Q&amp;A).&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas the previous WordSesh events were somewhat novel in that they gave attendees 24 hours of free live streaming WordPress presentations, pandemic era virtual events are evolving to eat up less of attendees&rsquo; free time. Organizers are now opting for scheduling fewer speakers for more manageable sections of time, or requiring them to give more condensed versions of their presentations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I worked with the speakers to compress their talks into 20 minutes instead of the historical 40 minutes of years past,&rdquo; Richards said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been developing a theory that case studies and micro-tutorials are the most optimal format for a conference talk, though, and I&rsquo;m going to test that idea more thoroughly in future events.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The schedule features 13 sessions on topics ranging from plugin development to client management to marketing with multisite networks. Whether you are a PHP developer learning how to navigate the world of blocks or an event planner seeking resources for the pandemic pivot, there&rsquo;s a session for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The talks will be a mix of live and pre-recorded, all broadcast live at their set times with speakers joining for Q&amp;A after each session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Most will be pre-recorded to eliminate any technical risks during the event (e.g. internet outage, power outage, and all the many various life emergencies),&rdquo; Richards said. &ldquo;This also offers a nice bonus of the speaker being able to interact with the chat&nbsp;<em>during</em>&nbsp;their talk.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordSesh EMEA will introduce a temporary job board, reminiscent of the kind one might find on a whiteboard in the hallway at a traditional WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Attendees can share whether they are hiring or looking for work in an entirely free-form format,&rdquo; Richards said. &ldquo;The entire board will be accessible to attendees throughout the live event only. After the event has ended I will capture the final state of the board and share that with everyone who actually attended so they can have a semi-permanent record. I think this is the first time there has ever been anything that only exists for live attendees and nobody else.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richards will also be delivering virtual swag to attendees&rsquo; inboxes again this year, with substantial discounts to various WordPress shops, hosts, and service providers. If you haven&rsquo;t signed up yet, you are not too late. <a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/register/\">Registration</a> is still open until the last minute, and tickets are free. </p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 04:00:30 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"db8d52d40d5241af3b8114cc3b1593cf","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Sarah Gooding","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240444},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WP Mobile Apps: When I try to add a self-hosted site, I get an ���The site at this address is not a WordPress site��� error message.

While the team pushed the theme live in the theme directory earlier this year, it wasn&rsquo;t until a couple of weeks ago that they officially released their blocks plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elmastudio&rsquo;s beta launch was one of the first pieces of news I noted when I began writing for the Tavern &mdash; I was already lining up stories a couple of weeks before I <em>officially</em> started. But, the story fell down the list over time. After seeing Aino Blocks land in the plugin directory two weeks ago, I thought it would be interesting to check out what the plugin looked like today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from a few minor styling issues, the Aino theme is a solid offering for users who are looking for a block-ready theme that provides an open canvas. I am generally a fan of Elmastudio&rsquo;s work with themes. However, most of the blocks from the Aino Blocks plugin are not particularly impressive. At best, they are par for the course for these types of block library plugins. I tend to install them to see if I can find a gem of an idea or two, some missing element that would solve one of the various problems I have. No such luck this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Plugin&rsquo;s Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The one block that caught my eye the most was the Grid block. I am still hopeful that core WordPress adopts some sort of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/should-the-block-editor-have-a-grid-system\">grid layout block</a> or system. Therefore, I test every such block I come across.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grid block in the Aino Blocks plugin works well enough for people who have a background in CSS code. The terminology for the block options may be hard to understand for average users. On the whole, it does not feel intuitive enough for me to recommend it over better options.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Using the Grid block.\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-automattics-block-experiments\">Layout Grid</a> by Automattic still holds the title for best grid block plugin thus far. Yes, its options can be confusing too, but it does provide dragging capabilities that will autofill those settings for less tech-savvy users. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/build-versatile-layouts-with-the-generateblocks-wordpress-plugin\">GenerateBlocks</a> also has a powerful Grid block that is far easier to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most complex block and the one that seemingly pushes some boundaries is the Hero block. It is essentially a block that combines content, buttons, and media in a specific layout. The problem is that there may not be a need for the block in every case. It is far better suited as a block pattern, and because the plugin already introduces a custom pattern, there is little reason not to move along the same route with the Hero block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within a couple of minutes, I was able to recreate the default Hero block output with core WordPress blocks. The only exception to this was the use of the Badge block included with the Aino Blocks plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Aino Hero Block</li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img />Core Media &amp; Text Block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To recreate the Hero block, an end-user merely needs to add a Media &amp; Text block. In the content/text panel for the block, they can add the Badge, Heading, Paragraph, and Buttons blocks. After adding an image in the media section, they would have recreated the Hero block. Because of the multiple inner blocks involved in this, it can be a bit complicated for some users. That&rsquo;s where patterns come into play. By using a pattern, the plugin would have:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Used less JavaScript.</li><li>Used less CSS.</li><li>Mostly used core blocks.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Users may be stuck with an unnecessary block in this case. And, if this is their first foray into the world of blocks, they are unlikely to learn that there was a better way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one thing the Hero block brings to the table is its custom grid settings. It provides end-users with control over the placement of content and media columns. That is the only thing it has going for it as an individual block, but such a feature might be better as custom block options, such as those provided through <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/control-block-design-via-the-editorplus-wordpress-plugin\">EditorPlus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aino Blocks does include a single block pattern. It is called Hero Aino. It is a customized version of the Hero block in pattern form and showcases what users can accomplish with a few adjustments of the block options.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Aino Hero block pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>This pattern is the one area where the plugin shines.  It will be interesting to see if the developers continue with more patterns in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also adds Badge, Card, Author, Testimonial, Buttons, and Arrow Button blocks. The Badge block allows users to add a small bit of text with an inline background. The Arrow Button is essentially a link with an arrow icon next to it. Everything else feels like it has been done before by a plethora of other block collection plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I question whether most of these types of block library plugins are necessary at this point. Few of them feel like they are pushing any limits, raising the bar beyond what has already been done. My fear is that we will continue to see more and more of these collections packaged from every plugin and theme shop to the point where everyone is simply building the same blocks in-house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why the block directory needs to be integrated into core. Instead of downloading an entire collection of blocks for something like a plain ol&rsquo; testimonial block, end-users can simply download a single testimonial block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I am being a bit harsh on Aino Blocks. Maybe it appeared in the plugin directory too late. Bigger plugins have already carved the path that Aino is trekking. I want to see more than <em>yet another block collection by yet another theme/plugin company</em>. I want to be dazzled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, the plugin works well. I did not see anything technically wrong with it. I just do not see it appealing to many people outside of Elmastudio&rsquo;s current theme users, not when there are more mature plugins of its type out there.  There is still room to grow.  The company&rsquo;s best bet is to focus on building patterns.  Its first pattern shows some promise.

Because the city prides itself on being &ldquo;the live music capital of the world,&rdquo; due to its abundance of music venues, the camp&rsquo;s organizers are inserting a little local Austin flavor into the schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>English poet Robert Browning, in his poem <em><a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Balaustion%27s_Adventure/I\">Balaustion&rsquo;s Adventure</a></em>, wrote, <strong>&ldquo;<em>And who hears music, feels his solitude peopled at once.</em>&rdquo; </strong>Music has a way of bringing a human aspect to virtual events where people are sitting alone behind glowing screens, hoping to connect with others during this protracted time of isolation. WordCamp Austin&rsquo;s organizers are aiming to pepper the schedule with a diverse selection of performances for attendees to enjoy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musicians from anywhere in the world are invited to send an audition video (or schedule a live audition) for the opportunity to perform 2-5 songs at WordCamp Austin between sessions. Those who are selected will have the choice of performing live (with technical support from the organizers) or submitting pre-recorded performances. Organizers are also accepting auditions from singers, beat-boxers, rappers, and anyone who plays a non-traditional instrument.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We want WC ATX to be put on the map so that it will drive more attraction when we can get back together in person,&rdquo; co-organizer Ben Moore said. &ldquo;Like all other major events, 2020 will be the catalyst for more virtual events. Virtual, in-person, and a hybrid mix of the two will emerge after all of this.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Austin organizers are planning to use <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/\">Hubs Virtual Rooms</a> by Mozilla to create a unique environment for attendees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think it will be a lot of fun and allow everyone who is burnt out on Zoom to get something different,&rdquo; co-organizer Cousett Hoover said. &ldquo;We have a lot of dedicated folks but venues in Austin are super expensive which makes it hard to coordinate a WordCamp. This allows us to get more support and with a star group of organizers we can come back even better next year.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Austin&rsquo;s use of Hubs Virtual Rooms will be an interesting experiment to follow, as most other virtual WordPress events have opted for Zoom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;One of the more exciting parts of Hubs is the spacial audio feature,&rdquo; Moore said. &ldquo;We hope this can create a more interactive experience for people as opposed to everyone having to hear everything being said. People will be able to &lsquo;walk&rsquo; around, gather in groups, and have smaller conversations without the need for a moderator to designate breakout rooms. We hope to imitate an &lsquo;in-person&rsquo; environment but remain virtual.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Austin has been running since 2012, with a few gaps in between when they were not able to make it happen. Most other city-based WordCamps are on hold right now, but Hoover said she sees an opportunity in the present circumstances for newer community members to attend virtually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think it is a beautiful opportunity for so many who might otherwise not know about WordCamps or not have one close by to be able to attend,&rdquo; Hoover said. &ldquo;Personally, I work with a lot of Mompreneurs who use WordPress daily for their livelihoods just like many other WordPressers but so many do not know about the incredible community that WordPress has and these events are an opportunity to save on travel and time and still be able to participate a bit.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers are planning two tracks, with 8-10 sessions separated by musical interludes. Applications for WordCamp Austin&rsquo;s musicians are <a href=\"https://austin.wordcamp.org/2020/call-for-musicians/\">due by September 4</a>. The deadline to submit auditions is September 11 and performers will be notified of acceptance by September 15.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 21:39:04 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"d643b94887677b8572ba4b4863787dee","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Sarah Gooding","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240445},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","title":"WPTavern: Stepping Into a Market With Major Players, Mario Peshev Acquires WP-CRM System","link":"https://wptavern.com/?p=103830","description":"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Mario Peshev, the CEO of WordPress agency DevriX, <a href=\"https://www.prweb.com/releases/renowned_wordpress_core_contributor_mario_peshev_acquires_wp_crm_system_to_drive_business_development_on_worlds_largest_web_platform/prweb17328749.htm\">officially announced</a> he had acquired the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crm-system/\">WP-CRM System</a> plugin this week. Formally, his company Premium WP Support is taking the reins for the project. Scott DeLuzio, the creator and previous owner of the plugin, <a href=\"https://scottdeluzio.com/wp-crm-system-acquired-by-mario-peshev/\">published the news</a> on his blog last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeLuzio originally built the plugin in 2015 after dissatisfaction with the solutions available on the market and having no control over the data, which was hosted on third-party services. He made the plugin available through his brand Amplify Plugins. Since then, his company has shifted focus to add-ons for eCommerce plugins in the WordPress space.  Therefore, he decided to sell his CRM project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peshev began his career as an engineer with enterprise-grade development. He said he was already familiar with CRMs after having worked with them long before he switched to WordPress development. It shaped the focus of DevriX toward small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and growing businesses using WordPress as an application framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Over the past few years, we&rsquo;ve built a number of integral solutions in-house for our brands &mdash; including our business process management system or our time tracking software,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I stumbled upon a tweet by Scott DeLuzio disclosing the sale of a couple of plugins, I got hooked almost immediately.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peshev described WP-CRM System as being closely aligned with his company&rsquo;s goal, which is to support WordPress-driven businesses given clear metrics for maximum ROI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s powerful, integrates seamlessly with most form plugins (intercepting leads through Contact Form 7 or Gravity Forms), comes with Slack callbacks when leads come in, provides multiple views for different use cases, and gets the job done through a single, yet powerful dashboard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Working with an existing customer base is also a great opportunity to refine the rest of our product offerings and work closely with businesses eager to evolve without having to migrate away from WordPress.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future of WP-CRM System</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For the short term, Peshev said his quality assurance team is doing extensive testing for performance opportunities. It is also testing to see how the plugin can integrate with other popular business plugins. However, the main goal is to push out some usability improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the long term, we will be expanding into several verticals &mdash; adding industry-specific features that better serve groups of businesses, such as accounting firms, creative studios, and event management companies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The product is customer-led and we rely a lot on existing customers to improve usability even further.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CRM market is becoming more competitive. Peshev said the contract on this acquisition was already signed by the time Automattic publicly announced its <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-zero-bs-crm-considers-rebranding-it-as-jetpack-crm\">acquisition of Zero BS CRM</a> (now <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zero-bs-crm-rebrands-and-relaunches-as-jetpack-crm\">Jetpack CRM</a>) last year. However, he feels like there is plenty of room for growth for both plugins in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Larger businesses have to scale with certain constraints in mind &mdash; both from a managerial standpoint, and when it comes to responsibility,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is how startups emerge and quickly acquire certain industries or niche markets. Automattic is known to spread across other business segments, such as the hosting or eCommerce ecosystems. I certainly don&rsquo;t believe it sets the right tone, but I&rsquo;m also not concerned about yet another CRM solution entering the space. In this case, it&rsquo;s a mutual effort toward strengthening the position of WordPress in the SME space, bringing more opportunities to matured businesses, and preventing businesses from &lsquo;outgrowing&rsquo; WordPress as a business platform.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major player in the CRM market is HubSpot, but it pushes users to an app that is hosted off-site, which is the opposite approach of both WP-CRM System and Jetpack CRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peshev said his company used to be a HubSpot agency partner between 2017 and 2019. However, they terminated the partnership because HubSpot&rsquo;s focus was on building an opinionated business ecosystem that was cluttered and incompatible with other solutions. The goal seemed to be to push users toward other CMS-type software that they owned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;WP-CRM System feels native to the WordPress user,&rdquo; said Peshev. &ldquo;With simpler sales cycles, it doesn&rsquo;t feel overwhelming. You don&rsquo;t need to spend forever sifting through options and filling out complex forms. WP-CRM System is designed for growing businesses that used to rely on group chats, emails, and spreadsheets, and can&rsquo;t justify the administrative overhead (or pricing) of the giants in the CRM space. The market is indeed saturated, especially outside of WordPress, and segmentation is the best strategy here: evolving a CRM for a specific segment (WordPress users) and audiences (mostly service businesses) in our case, and developing separate extensions for verticals that reach out more frequently.&rdquo;</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 18:23:56 +0000","feedId":10979,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f33d2441b2dfff381c6c149fca5c8c18","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Justin Tadlock","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599240240445}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 01:24:00","feedId":10979,"fetchDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 17:24:00 +0000","fetchMs":59,"handleMs":966,"totalMs":29517,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":50,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"624b369246c5868bd6aabd180baff679","hostName":"us-030*","requestId":"21d590564dae4b2290defb00b7a07bdc_10979","contentType":"text/xml","totalBytes":2457958,"bgimgsTotal":3,"bgimgsGithubTotal":3,"articlesImgsTotal":4,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":4,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx7":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx5oss":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:36:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:22:18","id":10979,"name":"WordPress Planet","url":"http://planet.wordpress.org/feed/","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://s.w.org/favicon.ico?2","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn77@2020_1/2020/09/04/17-23-59-647_b2f7bdc2e75f33e8.ico","description":"WordPress Planet -
