If you had grown up on the other side of the world, you would have a different set of values and thought patterns. </p>\n<p> But if you keep experiencing the same things, your mind keeps its same patterns. Same inputs, same responses. Your brain, which was once curious and growing, gets fixed into deep habits. Your values and opinions harden and resist change. If you don’t flex, you lose your flexibility. </p>\n<p> You really learn only when you’re surprised. If you’re not surprised, then everything is fitting into your existing thought patterns. <strong> So to get smarter, you need to get surprised, think in new ways, and deeply understand different perspectives. </strong> </p>\n<p> With effort, you could do this from the comfort of home. But the most effective way to shake things up is to move across the world. Pick a place that’s most unlike what you know, and go. </p>\n<p> This keeps you in a learning mindset. Previously mindless habits, like buying groceries, now keep your mind open, alert, and noticing new things. New arrivals in a culture often notice what the locals don’t. (<a href=\"https://sive.rs/fish\">Fish don’t know they’re in water.</a>) </p>\n<p> Don’t think of yourself as visiting. Say that you’ve moved here, and mean it. Commit. Immerse. Go native. </p>\n<p> Form deep friendships with locals. Ask lots of questions. Ask people to explain and show you how things are done. When they state a fact, ask how they know. When they state an opinion, ask for examples. </p>\n<p> At first, their values and methods will feel wrong. You’ll feel the urge to tell them how their lives or ideas could be better — more like what you know. But try to understand a perspective where they are right and you are wrong. <strong> Eventually you’ll realize that your beliefs were not correct — they were just the local culture of where you grew up. </strong> You’re a product of your environment. </p>\n<p> Every country has a shared and working philosophy. Dive in and really try to understand it. This is one of the best things you can do for your brain. Stay immersed at least until you feel yourself saying “we” instead of “they.” </p>\n<p> Then, if you want to keep your brain actively learning and growing forever, keep moving across the world and immersing yourself like this for the rest of your life. </p> \n<div class=\"small\">\n <em>(I wrote this for Tynan’s new book “<a href=\"http://tynan.com/forevernomad\">Forever Nomad</a>”, so please <a href=\"http://tynan.com/forevernomad\">buy his book</a> if you like this subject.)</em>\n</div> \n<a href=\"http://tynan.com/forevernomad\"><img alt=\"Forever Nomad\" src=\"https://sive.rs/images/forevernomad.jpg\" /></a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 31 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":2275,"bgimg":"https://sive.rs/images/forevernomad.jpg","linkMd5":"55ad4531a0a169e225ba628f98d2a2d4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn11@2020_3/2021/08/15/04-32-47-154_dfb2c23ce88557ff.webp","destWidth":313,"destHeight":500,"sourceBytes":15797,"destBytes":19062,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://sive.rs/images/forevernomad.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn11@2020_3/2021/08/15/04-32-47-154_dfb2c23ce88557ff.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1629001940575}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-08-15 12:32:20","updatedTime":"2021-08-15 12:32:20","feedId":2275,"fetchDate":"Sun, 15 Aug 2021 04:32:20 +0000","fetchMs":1191,"handleMs":37,"totalMs":28413,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":200,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"bc1eecef1292254c09de6c1e66b750f3","hostName":"europe68*","requestId":"4ce000ca60ec4f678138ce76b3635641_2275","contentType":"application/atom+xml","totalBytes":19062,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 21:31:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:03:17","id":2275,"name":"Derek Sivers","url":"https://sivers.org/en.atom","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://sive.rs/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn32@2020_1/2020/09/01/02-03-18-435_174c6f5a71124e06.ico","description":"","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":19062,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1629001939052,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":1486,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":37,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":1,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://sive.rs/images/forevernomad.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":313,"destHeight":500,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn11@2020_3/2021/08/15/04-32-47-154_dfb2c23ce88557ff.webp","sourceBytes":15797,"destBytes":19062,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":2275,"totalSpendMs":473,"convertSpendMs":8,"createdTime":"2021-08-15 12:32:46","host":"us-004*","referer":"https://sive.rs/mfg","linkMd5ListStr":"55ad4531a0a169e225ba628f98d2a2d4,55ad4531a0a169e225ba628f98d2a2d4","githubUser":"myreaderx","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"destSize":"18.6 KB","compressRate":"120.7%","sourceSize":"15.4 KB"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
