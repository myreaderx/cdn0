The national park’s proximity and drivability from much of the Southeast makes the Smoky Mountains the most-visited national park year after year. In 2018, 11 million people visited Great Smoky Mountains National Park, while the second-most visited national park, the Grand Canyon, had only 6.4 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/stay-near-national-parks-using-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to use points and miles to stay near a national park</a></strong></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_768276\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-768276\" style=\"width: 1600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes wp-image-768276 size-full lazyload\" src=\"https://thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190809_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-6.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo by Caitlin Riddell / The Points Guy)\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190809_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-6.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190809_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-6.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1 300w\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-768276\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo by Caitlin Riddell/The Points Guy)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>When to visit</h2>\n<p>Dollywood’s hours extend beyond just &#8220;9 to 5.&#8221; The theme park is open mid-March to early January each year; hours vary but usually run from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>\n<p>I’ve found the best times to go, if you have flexibility, are early June or at the end of August to soak up the full summer amusement park experience. Notably, the crowds are much more manageable &#8212; which is a huge plus during the pandemic &#8212; on days when the forecast calls for a little bit of rain. We visited on a Sunday in July with a 60% chance of rain all day &#8212; quite the gamble, but we had the flexibility to come back another day if we had to, since we were staying close by. We got very lucky and the rain held off all day, which meant we basically had the park to ourselves.</p>\n<p>The longest we had to wait in line for anything &#8212; in this case, the new family roller coaster in the <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/dollywood-wildwood-grove-open/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wildwood Grove area</a> of the park &#8212; was 20 minutes. Members of our group rode the Lightning Rod and the Wild Eagle roller coasters and were able to walk right up without any wait at all. Many of the park employees were shocked by how slow it was that day &#8212; lucky us!</p>\n<p>If you’re only going for one or two days, a weekday in the spring or fall would be your best bet for shorter lines and easier parking. (Though there is a line-cutting pass available — more on that soon.) It&#8217;s worth noting that the nearby national park&#8217;s most visited time of year is October, so I would expect the fall to be extremely busy for Dollywood as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/gatlinburg-tennessee-family-friendly-activities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10 fun activities in Gatlinburg</a></strong></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_767302\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-767302\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes wp-image-767302 size-full lazyload\" src=\"https://thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-7.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo by Caitlin Riddell / The Points Guy)\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https://i2.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-7.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-7.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1 300w\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-767302\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Despite this sign that was sitting out, we went on a Sunday in July and didn&#8217;t run into any crowds.

The winter holiday months are also really crowded, as Tennessee winters are typically milder than in the northern parts of the country, and season pass holders often make one final visit for the year before their passes expire.</p>\n<h2 class=\"standout\">COVID-19 policies</h2>\n<p>Dollywood has taken several steps to keep guests safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requiring masks to be worn while at the park for guests 2 or older. (There are also &#8220;mask-free break zones&#8221; but social distancing is still enforced.)</li>\n<li>Guests will be screened with a health assessment.</li>\n<li>Limited capacity on rides and attractions and in certain buildings and walkways.</li>\n<li>Dollywood&#8217;s water park reopens on May 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Who should visit Dollywood</h2>\n<p>The ideal audiences for a visit to Dollywood are families, couples, kids of all ages, grandparents and groups of kids. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this destination for bachelorette parties (unless the bride happens to be a Dolly superfan!), but in general, it&#8217;s great for the young and the young-at-heart.</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/disney-theme-parks-reopen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What to expect as the Disney theme parks reopen</a></strong></p>\n<h2>Admission</h2>\n<p>A one-day adult ticket to Dollywood is $79, before taxes and fees, while a child’s one-day ticket (4 to 9 years old)  and a senior ticket (62 and older) is $69. A two-day ticket costs about $20 more. Active or retired military, disabled veterans and military reservists (as well as their spouses and dependents) can show a military or dependent ID and receive 30% off admission prices at the front gates.</p>\n<p>Season pass ticket options start at $144 for Dollywood alone, before taxes and fees, and go up to $234 for season pass access to both the Dollywood theme park and Dollywood Splash Country waterpark.</p>\n<p>The amusement park and water park offer seasonal discounts at the end of the summer and at other times throughout the year; check the website for more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/best-cards-entertainment-spending/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The best credit cards for entertainment spending</a></strong></p>\n<p>For those traveling by car, parking is $20 for all standard length vehicles and $25 for oversize length vehicles such as RVs and trailers. However, parking is free for Gold season pass holders. Guests at Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort can park for free at the resort and take advantage of the complimentary shuttle to the park.</p>\n<p>Guests of Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort receive <a href=\"https://www.dollywood.com/Resort/Resort-Tickets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discounted tickets to the park</a>, as well as Complimentary TimeSaver passes.</p>\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Overall, Dollywood is truly great for park-goers of all ages &#8212; we saw families with young children, teenagers and many grandparents during our visit. We noticed that the park is very accessible and you can rent electric scooters on site. That said, the terrain at the park can be a little hilly, but there&#8217;s ample shade and places to rest and chill out in the air conditioning.</p>\n<p>Dollywood is committed to providing an enjoyable and safe experience for all of its guests and even offers a &#8220;calming room&#8221; for guests who may be experiencing sensory overload.

When I asked my older brother what he thought of the ride after he got off, he said his two-word review of the ride wasn&#8217;t suitable for young ears. This ride holds the title for the fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, hitting speeds up to 73 miles per hour.

As opposed to a typical roller coaster that has cars on a track, this ride seats riders on either side so there&#8217;s nothing but air above and below! Also note this warning, which is featured on Dollywood&#8217;s website regarding this ride:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;During the spring and fall season, the social behavior of bees and wasp changes causing them to swarm our tall attractions. </em><em>Flying insects are a natural part of the Great Smoky Mountains in the spring and fall. During the warmest part of the day, there are bees and wasps flying around the top of this attraction. We encourage each guest to use discretion when deciding to ride.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Blazing Fury:</strong> This indoor roller coaster is a little deceiving. I accidentally took my 7-year-old niece on this one, thinking I had enjoyed it during my previous trip to the park. It&#8217;s all indoors so you can&#8217;t actually see what the ride looks like. Silly me. The 7-year-old did not enjoy it and was potentially permanently scarred. Fun ride for grown-ups, not so much for little ones. Lesson learned!</p>\n<p><strong>Dragonflier:</strong> The newest addition to the park, this family-friendly roller coaster featured within the Wildwood Grove area mimics the flight of a Smoky Mountain dragonfly and was my favorite ride on my latest trip to the park. It&#8217;s just twisty and exhilarating enough without making you fear for your life.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_708698\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-708698\" style=\"width: 4000px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-708698 size-full lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https://thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dragonflier.jpg\" alt=\"Dragonflier Dollywood\" width=\"4000\" height=\"3000\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dragonflier.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dragonflier.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1 300w\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-708698\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dragonflier.

Inspired by a white-water rafting adventure, this one features a lot of wet twists and turns along the way. We always save this one for last, as you&#8217;re bound to get soaked. Be sure to bring a change of clothes; lockers can be rented at multiple points throughout the park, and there are also air dryers positioned right outside this ride for a small fee.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_767343\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-767343\" style=\"width: 1600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes wp-image-767343 size-full lazyload\" src=\"https://thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-48.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo by Caitlin Riddell / The Points Guy)\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-48.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-48.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1 300w\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-767343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Smoky Mountain River Rampage.

The authentic 110-ton coal-fired steam engine, which can be seen and heard throughout various points within the park, takes guests back in time on a breathtaking 5-mile ride through a portion of the Great Smoky Mountains to experience some of the most beautiful views the area has to offer. The train departs at the top of every hour for a 30-minute tour and is sure to impress the entire family.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend taking a ride during the fall months to admire the beautiful foliage of the Smoky Mountains. Just be careful, since it runs on real coal-burning engines and the smoke and soot could get on your clothes.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_767344\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-767344\" style=\"width: 1600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes wp-image-767344 size-full lazyload\" src=\"https://thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-49.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo by Caitlin Riddell / The Points Guy)\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-49.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-49.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1 300w\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-767344\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo by Caitlin Riddell/The Points Guy)</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>Chasing Rainbows &#8211; the Dolly Parton Museum: </strong>Of course, this theme park wouldn&#8217;t be complete without the <a href=\"https://www.dollywood.com/themepark/Rides/Chasing-Rainbows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shrine to Dolly Parton</a> she deserves.

Dollywood is the community’s largest employer with more than 3,000 local team members.</p>\n<p>The majority of the employees were born and raised in the Smoky Mountains, just like Dolly, and they help maintain the park’s authenticity. We encountered a handful of employees who had more than their fair share of Southern charm, and if we hadn’t constantly been hurrying on to the next ride, I’m certain I could’ve sat and chatted with each for hours. That’s the beauty of the South.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_776157\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-776157\" style=\"width: 4288px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes wp-image-776157 size-full lazyload\" src=\"https://thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dollywood-Leather-Shop-Action.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4288\" height=\"2848\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dollywood-Leather-Shop-Action.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Dollywood-Leather-Shop-Action.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1 300w\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-776157\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo courtesy of Dollywood)</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Eagle Mountain Sanctuary</h3>\n<p>The park&#8217;s Eagle Mountain Sanctuary is home to the largest exhibit of nonreleasable bald eagles in the United States.

I risk sounding dramatic here, but this bread will change your life. This pull-apart cinnamon loaf, so pillowy and glorious, will cost you $8.99 and will feed one really hungry person or multiple people as a snack (five of us ate it as a treat after lunch). Let me just tell you, it’s worth every penny.</p>\n<p>You can purchase apple butter or icing dipper to accompany it for an extra $0.99. I highly recommend the icing dipper. If you are lucky enough, you’ll get to see them baking the bread, which produces a scent so magical, it permeates half the park. Go early in the day to ensure they don’t run out and expect a line.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_768280\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-768280\" style=\"width: 1600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes wp-image-768280 size-full lazyload\" src=\"https://thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190809_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-9.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo by Caitlin Riddell / The Points Guy)\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190809_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-9.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190809_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-9.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1 300w\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-768280\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo by Caitlin Riddell/The Points Guy)</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_767329\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-767329\" style=\"width: 1600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"lazyautosizes wp-image-767329 size-full lazyload\" src=\"https://thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-34.jpg\" alt=\"(Photo by Caitlin Riddell / The Points Guy)\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-34.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190908_Dollywood-Review_CRiddell-34.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1 300w\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-767329\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo by Caitlin Riddell/The Points Guy)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The park’s website states that no outside food and drink is permitted; however, we had a couple of small snacks and fruit with us in my backpack and security didn’t have a problem with it.</p>\n<h3>Live music and theatrical productions</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s no shortage of live entertainment within the park, and that&#8217;s one of the things it&#8217;s most famous for, especially considering the success of its namesake.</p>\n<p>There are entertainment options every day at multiple locations throughout the park, including comedy shows, 1950s and 1960s-inspired musical theater shows, bluegrass and Southern gospel music, including <a href=\"https://www.dollywood.com/themepark/Entertainment/My-People\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">performances by Dolly&#8217;s own family</a>.

There are only a limited number of TimeSaver Passes available each day on a first-come, first-serve basis, so I recommend you purchase these online in advance. We tried to purchase TimeSaver Passes online the morning that we were going and it said they were all sold out for the day &#8212; though thanks to the weather, we lucked into not needing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/skip-line-theme-parks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to skip lines at America&#8217;s favorite theme parks</a></strong></p>\n<p>There are a few different options for TimeSaver Passes, so here’s how Dollywood’s website breaks it down:</p>\n<p><strong>TimeSaver:</strong> For rides, enjoy using expedited entrances 10 times throughout the day at your choice of TimeSaver attractions. Your combination of 10 rides can include 10 different TimeSaver attractions, or you can ride your favorite rides* up to 10 times. For theaters, enjoy unlimited daily show reservations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TimeSaver Unlimited </strong>– Allows unlimited access to expedited entrances at your choice of participating TimeSaver attractions* and unlimited show reservations at participating theaters.</li>\n<li><strong>TimeSaver Complimentary</strong> – Resort guests: For rides, enjoy using expedited entrances 10 times throughout the day at your choice of TimeSaver attractions. Your combination of 10 rides can include 10 different TimeSaver attractions, or you can ride your favorite rides* up to 10 times. For theaters, enjoy unlimited daily show reservations. Free to resort guests with exclusive resort theme park tickets or season passes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to keep in mind that not all rides and attractions are eligible for TimeSaver Passes. The eligible rides are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Barnstormer</li>\n<li>Dizzy Disk</li>\n<li>Dragonflier (limit one ride per person)</li>\n<li>FireChaser Express (limit one ride per person)</li>\n<li>Mystery Mine</li>\n<li>Sky Rider</li>\n<li>Smoky Mountain River Rampage</li>\n<li>Tennessee Tornado</li>\n<li>Thunderhead</li>\n<li>Waltzing Swinger</li>\n<li>Wild Eagle</li>\n<li>Drop Line</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TimeSaver is $44** (plus tax) per person, per day. Gold, Super Gold Passholders and Smoky Mountain Cabin guests receive a $5 discount. TimeSaver Complimentary is free for resort guests of the Dollywood DreamMore Resort with exclusive resort theme park tickets or Season Passes.</p>\n<p>Another handy resource we used on our trip was the Dollywood app. Be sure to download this before you head to the park. The app provided free Wi-Fi for the duration of our time at the park, and it also showcased wait times for any ride at that given time, which made mapping out our day much easier.</p>\n<h2>Where to stay</h2>\n<p>When it comes to lodging in Pigeon Forge, there&#8217;s no shortage of options.</p>\n<p>My favorite accommodations in the Smoky Mountains are always cabins for a truly authentic mountain visit. For this particular stay, my family and I rented a cabin about 10 minutes down the road from the theme park. There are cabin rental companies with properties scattered all across Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg and Sevierville, any of which would be a reasonable drive to Dollywood. You can find plenty of options on Airbnb. (Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/airbnb-tips-families/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">advice for families using Airbnb</a>.) Dollywood even has its own cabin company (of course): <a href=\"https://www.dollywood.com/Cabins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dollywood’s Smoky Mountain Cabins</a>.</p>\n<p>Cabins provide the luxury of letting your family spread out and feel like you’re at home (and also save money on some home-cooked meals if that’s your thing). Many of the cabins in the area offer discounts to various attractions, including Dollywood admission, so be sure to ask upon booking if they have any coupons available.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_776216\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-776216\" style=\"width: 3545px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-776216 size-full lazyautosizes lazyload\" src=\"https://thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dollywood-cabins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3545\" height=\"2372\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dollywood-cabins.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1\" data-srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thepointsguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dollywood-cabins.jpg?fit=300%2C300px&#38;ssl=1 300w\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-776216\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Photo courtesy of Dollywood)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another obvious choice for visitors of Dollywood to consider is <a href=\"https://www.dollywood.com/Resort\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dolly Parton’s DreamMore Resort</a>.

Think: Dave &#38; Busters, but a hotel.</p>\n<p>While Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, isn&#8217;t exactly a top points hotel destination, there are still a ton of hotels in the area, given it&#8217;s such a big tourist destination for this part of the country.</p>\n<p>A quick Google search will bring up a few points options like <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101l5ckm/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marriott.com%2Fhotels%2Ftravel%2Ftyssp-springhill-suites-pigeon-forge%2F%3Fscid%3Dbb1a189a-fec3-4d19-a255-54ba596febe2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Springhill Suites by Marriott</a> (Category 5, <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/guide/where-to-use-marriott-35k-certificates-families/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">35,000 Marriott points per night</a>), <a href=\"https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/tyspfru-tru-pigeon-forge/?SEO_id=GMB-RU-TYSPFRU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tru by Hilton</a> (27,000 to 30,000 Hilton Honors points per night), and <a href=\"https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/pgfhtht-home2-suites-pigeon-forge/?SEO_id=GMB-HT-PGFHTHT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Home2 Suites by Hilton</a> (from 29,000 to 50,000 Hilton Honors points per night).

While the exact dates vary a bit from year to year, these are the tentpole events that keep loyal Dollywood lovers coming back. (Note that some festivals may be canceled or postponed due to the ongoing <a href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/coronavirus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coronavirus</a> pandemic.)</p>\n<h2>Bottom line</h2>\n<p>Dollywood is unique among amusement parks and is a must-visit for all Dolly Parton fans. It&#8217;s a peaceful spot due to its location within Smoky Mountain National Park, but there&#8217;s also no lack of excitement for visitors.</p>\n<p>Add a trip to Pigeon Forge to your bucket list to experience all the delicious Southern food, Appalachian culture and incredible thrill rides this park has to offer. You&#8217;ll leave with a healthy dose of Southern charm and you may just catch yourself saying &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221; by the time you leave.</p>\n<p><em>Feature photo by Caitlin Riddell / The
