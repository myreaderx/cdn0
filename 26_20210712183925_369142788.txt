You can browse the archives of this site and come up with dozens of bold attempts to make new consumer electronics gadgets work &#8212; some of them </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/30/crunchpad-end/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very close to home</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But, like all startups, most hardware companies run into the hard-core grind of turning atoms into something worth buying. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To commemorate the hardness of hardware, idea factory/art house MSCHF is releasing a set of five </span><a href=\"https://deadstartuptoys.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dead Startup Toys as vinyl figurines</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that you can buy for $39.99 each or $159.99 for the set. It bills these as &#8220;iconic failed startups&#8221; and the sales site offers a brief history of the rise and fall of each endeavor. They range from products that never really existed, like the Theranos minilab, to poorly timed early movers like Jibo, to exercises in over-engineering like Juicero. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that I have spent much of my career absorbing and trying to understand the difficult and complicated process of bringing consumer hardware to market, I love these things. There could be a lens of malice here, but I choose not to see it that way. Fraud is fraud and the people behind Theranos and debacles like the Coolest Cooler have or will see the business end of the legal system. </span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But big visions and hardware dreams are not always so clearly pocketed into the hole of &#8220;failure.&#8221; Sometimes the hardware works but the supply chain doesn’t. Sometimes the vision is sound but the product is just too early. There are any number of reasons products fail &#8212; but (in as much as they were actually real) you often have to give it up for the teams of people and visionaries that wanted a thing to exist in the universe and dragged it kicking and screaming to that point. And off the cliffs.</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2176034\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/003.4f787ee.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2176034\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2176034 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/003.4f787ee.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"703\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/003.4f787ee.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/003.4f787ee.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/003.4f787ee.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/003.4f787ee.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/003.4f787ee.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/003.4f787ee.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2176034\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MSCHF</span></p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The figures themselves are really well done, with crisp stamping and accurate detailing with readable text and nicely printed logos. Some of them are articulated as well, and accessorized. The Coolest Cooler gets its infamous blender and the Juicero has a removable (proprietary of course) &#8220;fresh veg&#8221; pouch. The quality on these is quite high overall; I’d rank them up with some of the better novelty toys I’ve bought over the years &#8212; it’s not phoned in, much like the Cooler’s feature set.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The packaging, too, is quite impressive; each gets a customized box and the big set of all of them comes in a bigger rack box. Each one also comes with a &#8220;cause of death&#8221; on the back that tells you why each venture went under. MSCHF went the lengths to make this a pretty premium &#8220;toy&#8221; drop, which is only fitting, given that it’s a monument to physical products. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with much of MSCHF’s work, there’s an element of &#8220;wait, is this legal?&#8221; as well, because there are likely a bunch of holes that the IP connected to these products fell into but some of those holes could still have legal entities attached. But that element of danger is what has made many of its projects resonate so far. so I don’t think they’re worried. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, none of these products have the </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/style/satan-shoe-settlement-nike.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sign of the beast on them</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

That was why M-KOPA seemed attractive,&#8221; Duroshola told TechCrunch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M-KOPA launched in Kenya 10 years ago. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is known</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to have kickstarted the wider pay-as-you-go (PAYG) solar market in the country</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the years, M-KOPA has expanded its offerings to include televisions, fridges, other electronic appliances and financial services for customers in Kenya and Uganda</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through its pay-as-you-go financing model, customers can build ownership over time by paying an initial deposit followed by flexible and affordable micro-payments</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, M-KOPA has sold more than 1 million PAYG solar systems and provided $400 million in financing to millions of customers while raising over $180 million in equity and debt</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, the company added <a href=\"https://technext.ng/2020/01/29/m-kopa-partners-safaricom-samsung-to-roll-out-a-pay-as-you-go-mobile-phone-plan-in-kenya/\">smartphone financing to its offerings</a> in Kenya by partnering with Safaricom and Samsung</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Per a <a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/sub-saharan-africa/\">GSMA report</a>, mobile technologies and services generated 9% of sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s GDP in 2019, representing about $155 billion in economic value</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when you think about it, smartphones </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are used</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in people&#8217;s everyday lives more than solar systems, so it isn&#8217;t surprising that M-KOPA has already sold 500,000 smartphones, half the units solar systems have managed in a 10-year period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier this year, M-KOPA ran a pilot test in the Nigerian market by providing customers with its solar systems and smartphone financing options</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Smartphone financing had a higher uptake as M-KOPA sold over 20,000 devices in Lagos, its first market. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company considered this a success, and the appointment of Duroshola is seen as a prerequisite for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scaling the offering rapidly in Nigeria.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We’ve been deliberate about finding the right person with a strong track record and in-depth knowledge of the Nigerian tech community to lead our team as we scale up our country operations. And the milestone coincided with Babajide’s appointment as we look to grow and expand into new regions,&#8221; Mayur Patel, M-KOPA&#8217;s CCO, told TechCrunch in an email.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M-KOPA is now present in both Lagos and Oyo after expanding to the latter last month. Just as in Kenya, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M-KOPA partnered with Samsung, but a different mobile network operator in Airtel, to make its smartphone financing accessible to Nigerian customers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Patel, both Nokia and Samsung provide entry-level and mid-tier handsets at different prices to their customers</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He argues that a top priority for MNOs on the continent is converting 2G/3G network users to 4G. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To him, M-KOPA has a shot at tackling the challenge of 4G device affordability in Nigeria because 75% of its total customers are first-time 4G smartphone owners</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"t573sHF7hh\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/africas-ride-hail-markets-are-hot-spots-for-startups-and-vc/\">Africa&#8217;s ride-hail markets are hot spots for startups and VC</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Africa&#8217;s ride-hail markets are hot spots for startups and VC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/africas-ride-hail-markets-are-hot-spots-for-startups-and-vc/embed/#?secret=t573sHF7hh\" data-secret=\"t573sHF7hh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Our partnership with both these OEMs has allowed M-KOPA to offer affordable ownership of quality 4G smartphones for underbanked customers, who are otherwise excluded because they lack credit histories or salaried incomes,&#8221; he said</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>In Nigeria, M-KOPA deals with various products in the Samsung A series (A02, A12, A22, A32) ranging from $80-$250 (~₦40,000 to ₦125,000). <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to include more devices and handset manufacturers, but the COO doesn&#8217;t say when</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Kenya and Uganda, however, M-KOPA sells Nokia phones in addition to the aforementioned Samsung products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although M-KOPA is focused on smartphone financing in the West African country, Duroshola wants to mirror what Kenyan M-KOPA&#8217;s customers enjoy (where other products asides from smartphones are sold) in Nigeria</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He reckons it will help build their credit history and worthiness over time.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Kenyan company is currently recruiting for engineering roles in Nigeria and globally as part of its expansion plans</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duroshola will lead the charge in Nigeria in what can be described as his</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> third stint of scaling African startups in the country</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He seems to have a knack for it.

If you sent me a message on Twitter, email or pigeon post, please give me a few days to dig out of the pile that awaits me.</p> \n<p>You might recall that I mentioned I was off to do some backpacking and climbing in Grand Teton National Park and then eventually would make it to Yellowstone National Park. Yes, the crowds were real, especially for those who stuck to the traditional schedule of sightseeing between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. I took the early morning and late evening approach and never encountered the infamous parking lot traffic jams.</p>\n<div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div> \n<p>It’s that tactic that allowed me to take a ride in an empty T.E.D.D.Y., the autonomous vehicle that is being piloted in Yellowstone this summer. Beep, in partnership with Local Motors, is operating the autonomous shuttle called T.E.D.D.Y., which stands for The Electric Driverless Demonstration in Yellowstone. The company plans to operate two routes, seven days a week. Information collected during the pilot will be used to inform future deployments in national parks across the country.</p> \n<p>Here’s what I discovered. The two shuttles, which always have a human operator who can take manual control if needed, are currently shuttling folks around the busy Canyons section of the park, specifically between the lodging area and main shopping area, where there is a general store, post office and eateries. The folks operating the shuttle told me about 1,240 people a week are riding the TEDDY vehicles and that riders were both curious and more knowledgeable about the tech than they expected.</p> \n<p>My ride was uneventful, as it should have been. The vehicle did pause unnecessarily because the self-driving system thought it needed to. The human safety operator warned me that this pause would likely occur, as it had been happening regularly over the past few days.</p> \n<p>One final item. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theautonocast?lang=en\">The Autonocast</a>, the podcast I co-host with Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer, is teaming up with SAE for a zoom call to have a wide-ranging discussion on the future of transportation and how the discourse about autonomous vehicle technology that occurs online — yes, Twitter I’m looking at you — impacts public perception.

One thing that did catch my eye though was an announcement from Stockholm-based e-scooter operator <strong>Voi</strong> that it launched the “world’s first large scale pilot of computer vision on e-scooters” using Irish computer vision startup Luna’s technology.</p> \n<p>Now, I’m not quite sure what Voi means by “at scale” since the press release had no mention of how many of these scooters the company would be bringing to its pilot beginning this month in Northampton, U.K. However, the release did make reference to Luna’s AI models getting more accurate by using data captured from 100 cameras on e-scooters in the English city, so that’s at least 100 scooters. The problem is, Voi is by no means the first. Spin beat them to the punch.</p> \n<p>Last month, Ford-owned <strong>Spin</strong> launched its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/\">Spin Insight Level 2</a> — its bundle of sensors, cameras and on-board computing power to detect sidewalk- and bike-lane riding and validate parking from its partner Drover AI — with 100 e-scooters in Milwaukee.

Late last year, the company invested $327 million to set it up, so we’ll potentially see the fruits of that investment. Apparently, Ola Electric has 3,000 robots building a scooter every two minutes, and the factory has 10 production lines, bringing total production capacity to about 10 million e-scooters.</p> \n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/electric-kick-scooters-market\">new report</a> by <strong>Acute Market Reports</strong>, electric kick scooters are expected to reach a market volume of 1.4 million units by 2028. The analysis found kick scooters are getting more popular as more people try to avoid public transportation, and that there’s a growing demand for longer-range scooters for heavy usage. The report identified some of the key manufacturers of electric kick scooters to be Razor USA LLC, GOTRAX, Xiaomi, Segway, Inc., ZERO Electric Scooters, MINIMOTORS Co., Ltd., Kaabo Electric Scooter, Titan Group, Glion and SWAGTRON.</p> \n<p><strong>Helbiz</strong>, a micromobility operator that recently went SPAC by merging with GreenVision Acquisition Corp., has <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helbiz-partners-irengo-telepass-launch-120000016.html\">announced a partnership</a> with IrenGo and Telepass to deploy 50 MiMoto electric mopeds throughout the Italian cities of Portofino, Santa Margherita Ligure, Rapallo, Paraggi and Punta Pedale.

The big news this week comes from across the Atlantic, where European lawmakers are planning to introduce a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035.</p> \n<p>Yep — less than 15 years from now. The ban would be phased in; countries would first be required to drop emissions from new vehicles by 65% by 2030, according to a document from the European Commission that was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-09/europe-to-propose-end-of-combustion-engine-era-in-green-overhaul\">viewed by Bloomberg</a>. The ruling would accompany a larger set of procedures for lowering greenhouse gas emissions across sectors, with the overall aim of reaching net-zero emissions on the continent by 2050.</p> \n<p>News of a 2035 ban has been floating around for a while, but it seems that we’re now approaching the introduction of the proposal on July 14. Nor will it likely shock automakers, many of whom have been announcing their own ambitious zero-emissions targets. Fiat and Volvo have both set their own ICE phase outs in the continent by the end of the decade, for example. Volvo, along with Uber, also <a href=\"https://icephaseout.org/\">signed a letter in support</a> of the ban in April.</p> \n<p>If the ban is included in the final proposal, it would still need to be approved by European Commissioners before going into effect. We’ll be keeping our eyes out for that final proposal — I’m especially interested to see if it will include any mandates for installing EV chargers or other rulings to help spur the transition toward electric mobility. While many EU countries have already set electrification targets separate from the proposed mandate, auto-making remains a cornerstone of the economy in countries like France and Germany. Whatever ends up happening, it’ll likely be expensive.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>— Aria Alamalhodaei</em></p> \n<h2>Notable reads and other tidbits</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1926823 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></a></p> \n<p>A short week + vacation means this won’t be as long as usual.

Let’s dig in.</p> \n<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3> \n<p><strong>Yandex Self-Driving Group</strong>, a unit of the publicly traded Russian tech giant, is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/yandex-self-driving-group-partners-with-grubhub-to-bring-robotic-delivery-to-college-campuses/\">partnering with food delivery service GrubHub</a> to be its multiyear robotic delivery provider across American college campuses. Yandex hopes to reach more than 250 campuses over the course of this partnership, beginning with dozens of robots in the fall, according to Yandex Self-Driving CEO Dmitry Polishchuk.</p> \n<div class=\"embed breakout\"> \n <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"jXDuZFo6cj\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/yandex-self-driving-group-partners-with-grubhub-to-bring-robotic-delivery-to-college-campuses/\">Yandex Self-Driving Group partners with GrubHub to bring robotic delivery to college campuses</a></p>\n </blockquote> \n <p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"“Yandex Self-Driving Group partners with GrubHub to bring robotic delivery to college campuses” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/yandex-self-driving-group-partners-with-grubhub-to-bring-robotic-delivery-to-college-campuses/embed/#?secret=jXDuZFo6cj\" data-secret=\"jXDuZFo6cj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n</div> \n<h3>Electric vehicles</h3> \n<p><strong>Bentley Motors</strong> revealed its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/bentley-reveals-flying-spur-hybrid-its-latest-in-the-push-towards-electric/\">newest hybrid model</a> that is<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> part of the company’s Beyond100 plan to become a carbon-neutral organization with an entirely electrified range by 2023 and a totally electric lineup by 2030. As Rebecca Bellan noted, that’s a tall order, given the fact that the British company’s first all-electric vehicle isn’t expected to come to market until 2025. So far, Bentley only has this hybrid and another, the Bentayga SUV.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Tesla</strong> has started the long-promised updates for its “Full Self-Driving” Beta v9 software. This is not full self-driving, which is why this item is housed under “electric vehicles.” Instead, this is an advanced driver assist system. But it’s important because this is the first “feature complete” version of the so-called FSD. This version also only relies on cameras and doesn’t include radar, a sensor that was previously used by Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system.</p> \n<p>There are already a bunch of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NW6mICjUvM&amp;t=1128s\">videos</a> popping up on the beta V9 FSD. And while many folks are excited to have early access, what struck me was the numerous disengagements I viewed during these videoed drives. Check out this one on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrHCz4wnW8g\">unprotected left-hand turns</a>.</p> \n<h3>Other stuff</h3> \n<p>The <strong>European Union&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/eu-fines-bmw-vw-1b-for-running-emissions-cartel-since-the-90s/\">issued fines of $1 billion</a> (€875 million) to<strong> Volkswagen</strong> and <strong>BMW</strong> &nbsp;for their involvement in an emissions cartel. According to the EU, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler have been illegally colluding to restrict competition in emission cleaning for new diesel passenger cars, essentially slowing the deployment of cleaner emissions tech.</p> \n<p><strong>Halo</strong>, the Las Vegas-based startup, is launching a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/halo-will-launch-a-remotely-operated-car-service-powered-by-5g-in-las-vegas/\">remotely operated electric car service</a> powered by 5G. This is starting as a pilot with just five vehicles. Halo users can order a vehicle via an app. Once a vehicle is ordered, a remote operator will drive it to the waiting customer. The user takes delivery and then manually operates the vehicle until they’re done. When the trip is complete, the remote operator takes back over and drives it to the next waiting customer. The pilot is being conducted in partnership with T-Mobile.</p> \n<div class=\"embed breakout\"> \n <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"RNgXj8Tm34\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/halo-will-launch-a-remotely-operated-car-service-powered-by-5g-in-las-vegas/\">Halo will launch a remotely operated car service powered by 5G in Las Vegas</a></p>\n </blockquote> \n <p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"“Halo will launch a remotely operated car service powered by 5G in Las Vegas” — TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/halo-will-launch-a-remotely-operated-car-service-powered-by-5g-in-las-vegas/embed/#?secret=RNgXj8Tm34\" data-secret=\"RNgXj8Tm34\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/xwQIQtb1eYs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:00:40 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png","linkMd5":"d017d3169e43a2c28ff32f10e3ae8ff6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn14@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-359_1f46672f108f4ca5.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":401,"sourceBytes":96396,"destBytes":30270,"author":"Kirsten Korosec","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn14@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-359_1f46672f108f4ca5.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-37-22-497_bd3f01dd0a54a1d6.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn73@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-37-22-760_f13db4cccd5400f3.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-station-ride-hailing1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-37-23-182_8b753053b307bebd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-302_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-37-22-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn54@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-37-22-581_fb2344670e96ec17.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=xwQIQtb1eYs:47fdycMZ2Bg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn39@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-37-23-055_1b116f8f0d781319.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/xwQIQtb1eYs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn76@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-37-22-885_e7e3ba3d557e5609.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114919070},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","title":"Controversial WhatsApp policy change hit with consumer law complaint in Europe","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2175968","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Facebook has been accused of multiple breaches of European Union consumer protection law as a result of its attempts to force WhatsApp users to accept controversial changes to the messaging platforms&#8217; terms of use &#8212; such as threatening users that the app would stop working if they did not accept the updated policies by May 15.</p>\n<p>The consumer protection association umbrella group, the Beuc, <a href=\"https://www.beuc.eu/publications/consumer-groups-file-complaint-against-whatsapp-unfairly-pressuring-users-accept-its/html\">said today</a> that together with eight of its member organizations it&#8217;s filed a complaint with the European Commission and with the European network of consumer authorities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The complaint is first due to the persistent, recurrent and intrusive notifications pushing users to accept WhatsApp’s policy updates,&#8221; it wrote in a press release.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;The content of these notifications, their nature, timing and recurrence put an undue pressure on users and impair their freedom of choice. As such, they are a breach of the EU Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After earlier telling users that notifications about the need to accept the new policy would become persistent, interfering with their ability to use the service, WhatsApp later <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/whatsapp-is-doing-fine-despite-months-long-backlash-over-policy-update/\">rowed back from its own draconian deadline</a>.</p>\n<p>However the app continues to bug users to accept the update &#8212; with no option not to do so (users can close the policy prompt but are unable to decline the new terms or stop the app continuing to pop-up a screen asking them to accept the update).</p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition, the complaint highlights the opacity of the new terms and the fact that WhatsApp has failed to explain in plain and intelligible language the nature of the changes,&#8221; the Beuc went on. &#8220;It is basically impossible for consumers to get a clear understanding of what consequences WhatsApp’s changes entail for their privacy, particularly in relation to the transfer of their personal data to Facebook and other third parties. This ambiguity amounts to a breach of EU consumer law which obliges companies to use clear and transparent contract terms and commercial communications.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The organization pointed out that WhatsApp&#8217;s policy updates remain under scrutiny by privacy regulations in Europe &#8212; which it argues is another factor that makes Facebook&#8217;s aggressive attempts to push the policy on users highly inappropriate.</p>\n<p>And while this consumer-law focused complaint is separate to the privacy issues the Beuc also flags &#8212; which are being investigated by EU data protection authorities (DPAs) &#8212; it has called on those regulators to speed up their investigations, adding: &#8220;We urge the European network of consumer authorities and the network of data protection authorities to work in close cooperation on these issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Beuc has produced a <a href=\"https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2021-063_report_-_whats_up_with_whatsapp.pdf\">report</a> setting out its concerns about the WhatsApp ToS change in more detail &#8212; where it hits out at the &#8220;opacity&#8221; of the new policies, further asserting:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;WhatsApp remains very vague about the sections it has removed and the ones it has added. It is up to users to seek out this information by themselves. Ultimately, it is almost impossible for users to clearly understand what is new and what has been amended. The opacity of the new policies is in breach of Article 5 of the UCTD [Unfair Contract Terms Directive] and is also a misleading and unfair practice prohibited under Article 5 and 6 of the UCPD [Unfair Commercial Practices Directive].&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Reached for comment on the consumer complaint, a WhatsApp spokesperson told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Beuc’s action is based on a misunderstanding of the purpose and effect of the update to our terms of service. Our recent update explains the options people have to message a business on WhatsApp and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. The update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook, and does not impact the privacy of your messages with friends or family, wherever they are in the world. We would welcome an opportunity to explain the update to Beuc and to clarify what it means for people.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Commission was also contacted for comment on the Beuc&#8217;s complaint &#8212; we&#8217;ll update this report if we get a response.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> A Commission official told us:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have received the alert from the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) who today filed a complaint against WhatsApp for multiple breaches of EU consumer rights.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The European Commission will carefully consider all the elements brought forward by BEUC together with the national consumer authorities in the coming weeks to assess the need for further investigation into the matter and a possible coordinated action as foreseen under the Consumer protection cooperation (CPC) regulation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Coordinated actions are regularly conducted by the CPC network whose objective it is to enforce consumer rights consistently across the Single Market.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We expect all companies providing services in the EU to comply with EU data protection rules.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Under the GDPR, supervising and enforcing its rules is the responsibility of the national data protection authorities, where necessary cooperating with the European Data Protection Board.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Commission is closely following this issue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The complaint is just the latest pushback in Europe over the controversial terms change by Facebook-owned WhatsApp &#8212; which triggered a privacy warning from Italy back in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/confusion-over-whatsapps-new-tcs-triggers-privacy-warning-from-italy/\">January</a>, followed by an urgency procedure in Germany in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/facebook-ordered-not-to-apply-controversial-whatsapp-tcs-in-germany/\">May</a> when Hamburg&#8217;s DPA banned the company from processing additional WhatsApp user data.</p>\n<p>Although, earlier this year, Facebook&#8217;s lead data regulator in the EU, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission, appeared to accept Facebook&#8217;s reassurances that the ToS changes do not affect users in the region.</p>\n<p>German DPAs were less happy, though. And Hamburg invoked emergency powers allowed for in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in a bid to circumvent a mechanism in the regulation that (otherwise) funnels cross-border complaints and concerns via a lead regulator &#8212; typically where a data controller has their regional base (in Facebook/WhatsApp&#8217;s case that&#8217;s Ireland).</p>\n<p>Such emergency procedures are time-limited to three months. But the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EU_EDPB/status/1414533127511420928\">confirmed today</a> that its plenary meeting will discuss the Hamburg DPA&#8217;s request for it to make an urgent binding decision &#8212; which could see the Hamburg DPA&#8217;s intervention set on a more lasting footing, depending upon what the EDPB decides.</p>\n<p>In the meanwhile, calls for Europe&#8217;s regulators to work together to better tackle the challenges posed by platform power are growing, with a number of regional competition authorities and privacy regulators actively <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/\">taking steps to dial up their joint working</a> &#8212; in a bid to ensure that expertise across distinct areas of law doesn&#8217;t stay siloed and, thereby, risk disjointed enforcement, with conflicting and contradictory outcomes for Internet users.</p>\n<p>There seems to be a growing understanding on both sides of the Atlantic for a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/biden-executive-order-tech-antitrust/\">joined up approach to regulating platform power</a> and ensuring powerful platforms don&#8217;t simply get let off the hook.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"z2FQ6UET98\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/\">Perspectives on tackling Big Tech&#8217;s market power</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Perspectives on tackling Big Tech&#8217;s market power&#8221;

That kind of outrageous advantage &#8212; a complete understanding of the industry &#8212; is something that investors struggle to resist in a vertical SaaS company. At least, according to Emergence Capital investor Lotti Siniscalco.</p>\n<p>Wong and Siniscalco joined us on a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live and went into detail on why Emergence was eager to finance Retail Zipline&#8217;s Series A round, walking us through Zipline&#8217;s Series A pitch deck and sharing which slides and bits clinched the deal.</p>\n<p>Extra Crunch Live is a weekly virtual event series meant to help founders build better venture-backed businesses. We sit down with investors and the founders they finance to hear what brought them together, what they saw in each other and how they work together moving forward. We also host the ECL pitch-off, where founders in the audience can pitch their startups to our outstanding speakers.</p>\n<p>Extra Crunch Live is accessible to everyone on a live basis, but the on-demand content is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. You can check out the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/check-out-the-expert-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-july/\">July slate here</a> and see the full <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/ecl/\">ECL library here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Stand up, stand out</h2>\n<p>During Wong&#8217;s fundraising process, Zipline was also attending a big industry conference. Emergence suggested that they do a virtual pitch meeting while Wong was at the trade show, but Wong pushed back, insisting on an in-person pitch meeting. Not only did she know that she would deliver a better pitch in person, but she didn&#8217;t want to squander the limited amount of time she had at the trade show with potential clients and partners.</p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t&#8220;She pointed to the screen projected behind her to help us stay on the most relevant piece of information. The way she did it really made us stay with her. Like, we couldn&#8217;t break eye contact.&#8221;\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t</div>\n\t</p>\n<p>Once the in-person meeting did take place, Wong surprised the Emergence team. For one, she stood up to pitch. Wong explained that her co-founder is a bigger guy, and she&#8217;s a smaller woman, and she feels more confident and comfortable presenting from a standing position.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She was one of the few or maybe the only CEO who ever stood up to pitch the entire team,&#8221; said Siniscalco. &#8220;She pointed to the screen projected behind her to help us stay on the most relevant piece of information. The way she did it really made us stay with her. Like, we couldn&#8217;t break eye contact.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In terms of delivery, Wong had already made an impact. But the content of the deck, and her experience in retail, clinched the deal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I look for an unfair reason for a founder to be the perfect person to build this product,&#8221; said Siniscalco. &#8220;Wong gave us her background in the first slide, and I knew quickly that she was a credible person in the retail industry. Then, what I look for in a pitch, is customer love.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Siniscalco said the combination of that unfair advantage and intense customer love is highly correlated with a very positive outcome for a company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we first started out, I was really insecure <em>because</em> I came from the industry versus coming from a lot of Silicon Valley knowledge,&#8221; said Wong. &#8220;In retrospect, I really underestimated the competitive advantage of coming from the industry. People said it to me, but I didn&#8217;t understand what that resulted in. But it resulted in the numbers in our deck, because I know what customers want, what they want to buy next, how to keep them happy and I was able to be way more capital-efficient.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The Zipline deck</h2>\n<p>Zipline&#8217;s entire deck (with some minor redactions) is embedded below. You can swipe on through at your leisure, but the real value here (in my humble opinion) is Siniscalco&#8217;s breakdown of how she reacted to the information in the deck. I&#8217;ll relay that here in text, but I also strongly suggest you watch (at least) the first half of the episode below to hear the founder/investor duo walk us through this deck.</p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bMcrxGj21ZA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 15:30:20 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"3a31ef059a88dc2152040b0d8c1cfbab","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-302_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Jordan Crook","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-302_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-37-22-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn86@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-37-22-322_35f14386e075ceeb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=bMcrxGj21ZA:Ihxm8EroexA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn24@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-37-22-328_ecc1d1e5aa6cacc6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/bMcrxGj21ZA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn7@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-37-22-289_0d6db58c802cf339.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114919068},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","title":"Beyond Pride: The fight against tech’s brogrammer culture","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2175569","description":"<div class=\"article__contributor-byline-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"article__contributor-byline\">\n\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__contributor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"byline__author\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-name\">Phil Schraeder</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline__author-title\" style=\"display: block;\">Contributor</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"contributor__twitter\">\n\t\t\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/philschraeder\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<svg class=\"icon icon--twitter icon--white\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" version=\"1.1\" aria-labelledby=\"title\">\n\t\t<title>Share on Twitter</title>\n\t\t<path d=\"M20,4c-0.7,0.3-1.5,0.6-2.4,0.7c0.9-0.5,1.5-1.4,1.8-2.3c-0.8,0.5-1.7,0.8-2.6,1C16.1,2.5,15,2,13.8,2c-2.3,0-4.1,1.9-4.1,4.2c0,0.3,0,0.7,0.1,1C6.4,7,3.4,5.4,1.4,2.9C1,3.5,0.8,4.1,0.8,4.9c0,1.4,0.7,2.7,1.8,3.5C2,8.4,1.4,8.2,0.8,7.9v0.1c0,2,1.4,3.7,3.3,4.1c-0.4,0.1-0.7,0.2-1.1,0.2c-0.3,0-0.5,0-0.8-0.1c0.5,1.7,2,2.9,3.8,2.9c-1.4,1.1-3.2,2-5.1,2c-0.3,0-0.7,0-1-0.1c1.8,1.2,4,1.7,6.3,1.7c7.5,0,11.7-6.4,11.7-12V6.1C18.8,5.6,19.4,4.8,20,4z\"/>\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"contributor-byline__bio\">\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-schraeder-a971855/\">Phil Schraeder</a> is CEO of <a href=\"https://gumgum.com/\">GumGum</a>, the global technology and media company specializing in contextual intelligence.\t</div>\n\t\n\t</div>\n</div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">I was 4 years old when I started playing what I’ve come to think of as “the game.” It was dressing-up time at school, and, as I ran over to a costume box, my teacher grabbed me by the shoulders. Right up in my face, she admonished: “That’s the girls’ box — the boys’ stuff is over there.”</p>\n<p>I was taken aback; I didn’t understand what I’d done wrong. But I remember thinking: “Oh! There are rules to how we live together in the world.” Right then and there, I started conforming to the parameter of the game that so many of us operate by: the game that gives us unwritten codes on what is acceptable and how to behave &#8212; at school, in work or in society at large.</p>\n<p>This game meant I spent years dialing down my “gayness,” even after I came out in my 20s, and the impulse was particularly acute at the early stage of my career. With each new meeting or business deal, I was constantly preempting what parts of me were “OK”’ or what might put people off. Just how much gay was too much?</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>In some ways, then, the endemic “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogrammer\">brogrammer</a>” culture in tech — the industry I call home — is no great surprise to me. When everyone is busy filtering their core identity, sanding down the edges to fit the collective mold, it’s inevitable that minority voices will be pushed out. Follow this picture to its natural conclusion and Silicon Valley — the home of bold disruptors, the armada of innovation — is reduced to a narrow few.</p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tWith Pride Month drawn to a close, it’s my greatest hope that we can use its particular kind of open-minded energy to activate deeper change.\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t</div>\n\t</p>\n<p>In many ways, Pride Month and the celebrations we’ve just seen are the antidote to this hegemony. Pride, with its rainbow symbolism, is a cornucopia of all that is free, true and uninhibited. With Pride Month drawn to a close, it’s my greatest hope that we can use its particular kind of open-minded energy to activate deeper change.</p>\n<h2>Show up for your team first</h2>\n<p>I truly love Pride and the meaningful action that goes with it, but it can’t be denied that some brands are venturing into the territory of window dressing. <a href=\"https://realbusiness.co.uk/branding-corporate-performative-activism-pride\">“Performative activism,”</a> whereby companies mobilize the Pride flag for marketing purposes without necessarily making tangible changes in their own backyards, is on the rise. So too are the businesses that pay lip service to Pride from one side of their mouth while covertly supporting politicians behind <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/20/the-right-way-for-brands-to-approach-pride-month-and-all-year-round.html\">anti-transgender legislation</a> on the other.</p>\n<p>If you are a leader who’s really committed to diversity in the workplace, it stands to reason that you look within to help your own team first. How can you create a culture where employees can be present in the fullness of themselves — regardless of gender, race, sexuality or even incidental things like taste in clothes or music?</p>\n<p>According to a 2019 study by <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/the-global-closet-is-hugevast-majority-of-worlds-lesbian-gay-bisexual-population-hide-orientation-ysph-study-finds/\">the Yale School of Public Health</a>, an estimated 83% of those who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual keep their sexuality hidden from all or most of the people in their lives.</p>\n<p>This inhibition is magnified in the workplace, where it is woven into the fabric of myriad discriminatory behaviors that are particularly prominent in tech. Almost <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/lgbtq-employees-tech-companies-witness-discrimination-blind-survey-2019-6?r=US&#38;IR=T\">40% of LGBTQ tech employees</a> polled by anonymous workplace chat app Blind say they&#8217;ve witnessed homophobic discrimination and harassment at work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/five-years-tech-diversity-reports-little-progress/\">Annual diversity reports</a> show that Big Tech companies employ far fewer women and underrepresented minorities than other industries, too. This is a sector that routinely labels people from nonmajority culture groups as “diversity hires,” doling out discrimination in everything from pay to promotions &#8212; as reported by thousands of personal experiences shared under the hashtag <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/02/10/racial-discrimination-persists-facebook-google-employees-say/4307591002/\">#SiliconValleySoWhite</a>. The same industry is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-emily-chang-brotopia-interview\">hardwired to marginalize women</a>, says Emily Chang, the Bloomberg Technology anchor whose book, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Brotopia-Breaking-Boys-Silicon-Valley/dp/0735213534\">Brotopia</a>,” lifts the lid on Silicon Valley’s culture of machismo.</p>\n<p>These aren’t easy issues to solve, but I believe authenticity has an important part in the solution. It’s about calling time on that game that I used to play. When I finally learned that I could show up as I pleased at work and not worry about how people judge me, the freedom was so sweet I could practically taste it. After years of faking it without fully realizing it &#8212; in a draining, relentless loop &#8212; I was able to be the person and CEO I wanted to be. The more familiar I became with California’s tech scene, and the farther up the ladder I progressed, the more confident I became to be me.</p>\n<p>You shouldn’t have to wait until you run a company for the permission to express your full self, however. As the research shows, the price paid for not doing so reaches far beyond personal freedom alone. Though we’ve made steps with important conversations around diversity in recent years, the world we work in is still, overwhelmingly, one-dimensional. It’s full of people not able or willing to reveal the genuine, hi-def version of who they are.</p>\n<h2>The power of listening and shared vulnerability</h2>\n<p>If we, as tech leaders, are unable to roll our sleeves up and dig deep on the issue of authenticity, we have little hope of chipping away at the <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/05/ending-the-brogrammer-culture-how-to-close-the-gender.html\">“brogrammer” attitude</a> that seems all too pervasive in our industry.</p>\n<p>Not only does this kind of climate engender unsaid <a href=\"https://www.talkspace.com/blog/code-switching-what-is/\">fear, fatigue and anxiety</a>, it also affects the bottom line. Research is clear on the fact that happy employees are <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-10-24-happy-workers-are-13-more-productive\">more productive</a>, while companies with more diverse management teams have greater <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/business-case-for-diversity-in-the-workplace/\">profitability, creativity and problem-solving abilities</a>. Having the freedom to be your authentic self at work is a conduit to success and fulfillment.</p>\n<p>So, how can tech CEOs and management get to this place? In my mind, a dual-sided approach is called for. First, efforts to harness authentic expression have to be enacted as policies. Leaders must give their teams direct responsibility for helping employees to bring their full selves to work. Help make your people accountable for an inside effort allowing all voices in your organization to be heard.</p>\n<p>In GumGum’s case, this includes the formation of a STRIDE (Seeking Talent Representation Inclusion Diversity &#38; Equity) Council. Made up of employees from all divisions, locations and levels of seniority across the company, council members make tangible recommendations to improve diversity and inclusivity in the company as part of their paid daily roles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hcamag.com/ca/specialization/diversity-inclusion/five-myths-on-unconscious-bias-and-how-to-tackle-the-issue/259328\">Unconscious bias training</a> is also vital for empowering authentic expression in the workplace. If I walked down the street in glitter shorts and a crop top, everyone around me would have some kind of reaction to my chosen outfit — regardless of whether they’d admit it. Building awareness of subconscious judgments like this is the first step to reining them in, and creates understanding of how bias inevitably impacts decision-making at work.</p>\n<p>Second, the quest for business authenticity lies with CEOs and senior management and their ability to lead by example. I think today&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54374824\">cancel culture</a> has made leaders hypersensitive about the need to keep it together, to toe the line with their behavior, to be professional and not make mistakes.</p>\n<p>Professionalism has its time and a place, of course, but I’ve always made it a point to be as open as possible as a CEO &#8212; to shine a light over every element of my personality, even the aspects that other people may judge or find less desirable. My determination to do this comes directly from the hidden identity that I used to struggle with. The fear I felt over being gay is now my fuel to showing my true self. By doing so, I aim to give those around me permission to do the same.</p>\n<p>No one really wants their tech company to breed a bro culture where only one type of person can thrive. But it’s not enough to simply say that. You have to start by <em>showing</em> that it&#8217;s OK to be different, to turn up in every shade of gray. I have a penchant for flamboyant fashion, for example, so I don’t think twice about attending a Zoom meeting in a baby blue fedora. That’s just how I express myself as a CEO.</p>\n<p>Showing up like this involves an element of fear, and I think it’s important to be open about that, too. As CEOs, we should share our vulnerabilities, our struggles with identity, the secret parts of ourselves that we’re tempted to keep masked away. This includes owning up to failures &#8212; CEOs are only human, and that humanity should be put on a pedestal if authenticity is the goal.</p>\n<p>People need to feel that their vulnerabilities are heard without judgment. Whether they&#8217;re in an interview or taking on a new project, one of my favorite questions to ask employees is simply, “What are you afraid of?”</p>\n<p>We all have fears, and by answering that question, you get to access someone’s vulnerable side. They might be scared of failing, making the wrong decision or upsetting the apple cart in some way. Tapping into that emotion is a great way of giving people permission to be their full selves.</p>\n<h2>A turning point for tech</h2>\n<p>Pride Month is part of a wider narrative around acceptance and freedom of being. Companies that jump on the rainbow bandwagon <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/20/the-right-way-for-brands-to-approach-pride-month-and-all-year-round.html\">without fully living those values</a> aren’t only hypocritical — they’re also doing themselves a disservice. Pride isn’t a revenue opportunity, and even if it was, those brands that attach messaging to it without substance are missing a trick.</p>\n<p>Beneath the LGBTQ+ Pride gift wrap lies a thousand work environments in urgent need of the values that the Pride movement espouses. Making those values a living, breathing part of everyday work life is no mean feat. But allowing people to untether from who they “should&#8221; be at work is a vital starting point for a change that is long overdue.</p>\n<p>I know the shame of hiding my true self away, which is why I make every effort for others to avoid that experience. Nowadays, I show up at work as more myself than I’d ever dared in my younger years. In this one small act, I challenge my co-workers to follow suit. It’s only when, together, we embark on that exploration of what authenticity in business looks like that the endless game-playing can stop — and the real work gets underway.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"rXqe5RUxvu\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/despite-gains-gender-diversity-in-vc-funding-struggled-in-2020/\">Despite gains, gender diversity in VC funding struggled in 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Despite gains, gender diversity in VC funding struggled in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/despite-gains-gender-diversity-in-vc-funding-struggled-in-2020/embed/#?secret=rXqe5RUxvu\" data-secret=\"rXqe5RUxvu\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/u_8pVlPoFno\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:39:00 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"9e65e27e19075ea705e77e0e47a63e83","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-302_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Annie Siebert","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-302_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-37-22-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn3@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-37-22-662_26a3ee05782c5058.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=u_8pVlPoFno:ieaYT0hiqco:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn88@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-37-23-131_a52f42f9b6f770d7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/u_8pVlPoFno":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn40@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-37-22-290_110fd742964420c1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114919069},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","title":"Eat the rich, but let them build rockets in the meantime","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2175987","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/\">went to space (or the vicinity of space)</a> in a PR-suffused event over the weekend.

The company was ahead of the curve in its space tourism ambitions, but in 2014 a test flight <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/31/virgin-galactics-spaceshiptwo-has-crashed/\">ended in a horrific crash</a> and the death of one of the pilots.</p>\n<p>Virgin&#8217;s engineers and leaders worked through it, however, and built a stronger, better spacecraft which was christened Unity by Stephen Hawking, who was then still living — and, not surprisingly, hoping to hitch a ride someday.</p>\n<p>Pilots flew test flight after test flight over the years, slowly ratcheting up the power and finally, in 2018, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/virgin-galactic-touches-the-edge-of-space-with-mach-2-9-test-flight-of-spaceshiptwo/\">touching the edge of space</a>. On that note there is some slight controversy in that the exact altitude where the atmosphere gives way to space isn&#8217;t completely agreed upon. Some authorities place the Kármán line, as the imaginary boundary is called, at 100 kilometers above sea level, others at 50 miles, or about 80 kilometers.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2175922\" style=\"width: 1930px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virgin-galactic-u22-space.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2175922\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2175922 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virgin-galactic-u22-space.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virgin-galactic-u22-space.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virgin-galactic-u22-space.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virgin-galactic-u22-space.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virgin-galactic-u22-space.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virgin-galactic-u22-space.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virgin-galactic-u22-space.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/virgin-galactic-u22-space.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2175922\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Unity 22 spreads its &#8220;feathers&#8221; during descent. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Virgin Galactic</p></div></p>\n<p>Virgin uses the lower estimate, while its arch rival, Jeff Bezos&#8217;s Blue Origin, uses the higher. This led Bezos to throw shade on Virgin&#8217;s flights, saying he didn&#8217;t want his customers to have an &#8220;asterisk&#8221; on their trip to space. When I asked about this before, a Virgin representative said they use the same standard that NASA and the U.S. Air Force does: pilots are given their &#8220;astronaut wings&#8221; if they pass the 50-mile mark.</p>\n<p>Kármán quibbles aside, the race to send passengers to space has been heating up lately, and Bezos recently announced that he would be flying aboard the first crewed launch of Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard rocket on July 22 — with his brother, a mystery passenger who has paid $28M for the privilege, and Wally Funk, among the first women trained to be astronauts in 1961 but who never made it to space.</p>\n<p>But Branson rained on his parade by announcing shortly afterward that he would fly aboard Virgin&#8217;s first passenger launch to space (crew and pilots have been up several times) about a week earlier.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YOtB7mXPck\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/branson-aims-to-beat-bezos-to-orbit-in-final-stretch-of-billionaire-space-race/\">Branson aims to beat Bezos to orbit in final stretch of billionaire space race</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Branson aims to beat Bezos to orbit in final stretch of billionaire space race&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/branson-aims-to-beat-bezos-to-orbit-in-final-stretch-of-billionaire-space-race/embed/#?secret=YOtB7mXPck\" data-secret=\"YOtB7mXPck\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>While Branson has good-naturedly denied any competition between himself and Bezos (&#8220;We wish Jeff the absolute best,&#8221; he said, adding that Bezos sent over a message of goodwill before the flight) it&#8217;s hard to believe that&#8217;s completely true. Though neither man has anything to prove at this point, there must surely be some satisfaction in Branson&#8217;s not merely going to space (a lifelong dream, as he tells it) but doing so before his upstart rival. However much he denies it, the narrative is too tempting to quash completely.</p>\n<p>The direction forward for Virgin Galactic now is, clearly, towards paying customers, of which there are plenty lined up. Of course, they all have a quarter of a million dollars to spare, but you might not, and for you Branson has a special offer. <a href=\"https://www.omaze.com/products/virgin-galactic-2021\">They&#8217;ve partnered with Omaze</a>, and donations to the chosen charity will enter you into a raffle of sorts, with the winner receiving two tickets on an upcoming Virgin Galactic flight. &#8220;And with my Willy Wonka hat on, a guided tour of Spaceport America, given by yours truly,&#8221; Branson added.</p>\n<p>Branson expressed hope that this would become an ongoing thing as long as donations continue, so perhaps this is the answer to the question of how they hope to, as he so frequently promises, make space available to <em>everyone</em>.</p>\n<p>You can watch the whole day unfold as it happened in Virgin Galactic&#8217;s archived livestream below:</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\"

As an investor, Dovetail has written check sizes ranging from $150,000 to $1 million AUD.</p>\n<p>One of Dovetail’s goals is prepare startups to seek funding from other VCs; firms that have invested in Dovetail’s portfolio companies include Blackbird, Qantas and Wavemaker.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Z5SgEShOR6\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/as-buy-now-pay-later-startups-keep-raising-capital-a-dive-into-klarna-afterpay-and-affirms-earnings/\">As buy now, pay later startups keep raising capital, a dive into Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm&#8217;s earnings</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;As buy now, pay later startups keep raising capital, a dive into Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm&#8217;s earnings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/as-buy-now-pay-later-startups-keep-raising-capital-a-dive-into-klarna-afterpay-and-affirms-earnings/embed/#?secret=Z5SgEShOR6\" data-secret=\"Z5SgEShOR6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>“By the time we need to make an investment decision, we would have worked collaboratively on a day-to-day basis with them for at least three months prior to a seed round and 12 months for a Series A. This means we’re essentially investing with the informational edge of a co-founder,” said Frandsen. “Another trait that makes Dovetail unique is that we share our ownership in our portfolio companies with the entire team. This further drives unity, dedication and a desire to succeed from our team.”</p>\n<p>Dovetail began working with Afterpay in 2017, when the company had less than 40 employees. Frandsen said Afterpay’s founders, Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen, were looking for a digital product development partner to build and scale their mobile and web apps. While both had deep experience in financial services, they came from non-technical backgrounds. That’s where Dovetail came into play, building out Afterpay’s tech platforms and helping launch its consumer-facing products.</p>\n<p>Some other notable startups that have gone through its venture studio program are resource planning SaaS platform <a href=\"https://www.runn.io/\">Runn</a>; one-click invoicing tool <a href=\"https://www.withmarmalade.com.au/\">Marmalade</a>; <a href=\"https://providerchoice.com.au/\">Provider Choice</a>, a management platform for providers in Australia’s National Disability Insurance Scheme; <a href=\"https://www.landmarksid.com/\">Landmarks ID</a>, a privacy-compliant mobile location intelligence platform for marketers; and <a href=\"https://www.fluenccy.com/\">Fluenccy</a>, a service that helps importers and exporters save money on foreign exchange.</p>\n<p>Before they started Dovetail, Frandsen and co-founder Ash Fogelberg’s startup, ticketing and payments platform 1-Night, was acquired by TicketDirect in 2013.</p>\n<p>Dovetail’s venture studio is sector-agnostic (though it has strong experience in fintech, SaaS and marketplaces), and works with startups that may not have a product yet, but have founders who “are ambitious, commercially-savvy and bring industry expertise from the field in which they are trying to solve a problem,” said Frandsen.</p>\n<p>When deciding what founders to work with, Dovetail considers at the viability and growth potential of their idea.This includes looking at how well-suited founders are to the issue, if there is enough market potential for the startup to grow into a large company and how much competition there is.</p>\n<p>Dovetail has a product agency that serves mostly U.S. companies, but its venture studio is currently focused on Australasian startups, with plans to expand into North America in the future.</p>\n<p>“We are actively seeking industries that are large yet underappreciated by the startup community,” Frandsen said. “We’re looking for ideas. that require hard-earned industry experience and can’t easily be replicated by teams of young aspiring entrepreneurs.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote

The shareholders are seeking repayment to Tesla of the cost to purchase SolarCity.</p>\n<p>The suit, filed in the Delaware District Court in 2017, alleges that SolarCity was near bankruptcy at the time of the acquisition. Musk, who was the ailing company’s chairman of the board of directors and its largest stockholder, directly benefited from the transaction, as did some of his friends and family, the lawsuit alleges. SolarCity’s founders, Lyndon and Peter Rive, are Musk’s cousins.</p>\n<p>SolarCity “had consistently failed to turn a profit, had mounting debt, and was burning through cash at an unsustainable rate,” the plaintiffs say. The suit goes on to note that the company had accumulated over $3 billion in debt in its 10-year history, nearly half of which was due for repayment before the end of 2017. The purchase by Tesla was approved by vote by 85% of shareholders.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Attorneys for Musk say that the acquisition was part of the CEO’s longer-term vision to transform Tesla into a transportation and energy company. In a blog post titled “<a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux\">Master Plan, Part Deux</a>,” published to Tesla’s website around the time of the deal’s closing, Musk says that combining SolarCity and the electric vehicle startup was key to realizing his vision of combining Powerwall (Tesla’s home and industry battery storage product) and solar roof panels.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1463267\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1463267\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1463267\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1463267\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Model X stood ready for inspection by attendees at the Kauai solar storage facility launch.

USA Today reporter Isabel Hughes, also at the courtroom, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/izzihughes_/status/1414598289475911682\">tweeted</a> that Musk blamed the pandemic for poor performance of the company’s solar division. He was being questioned by attorney for the plaintiffs Randall Baron, whom Musk called “a shameful person” at a 2019 deposition.</p>\n<p>Musk’s lawyers say that he recused himself from board discussions and negotiations relating to the acquisition &#8212; but the plaintiffs maintain that the recusal was “superficial.” A primary question for the court will be whether Musk exerted undue influence over the transaction, and whether he and other board members concealed information relating to the transaction from shareholders.</p>\n<p>The other board members named in the suit &#8212; Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Kimbal Musk and Stephen Jurvetson &#8212; settled for $60 million last year, plus $16.8 million in legal fees and expenses, paid for by insurance. The trial, with Musk as the sole defendant, was postponed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n<p>The trial is expected to last 10 business days. The Delaware Court of Chancery, where the suit is being heard, does not have a jury; instead, the case will be heard by judge Vice-Chancellor Joseph Slights III. Even if Slights finds that the deal was improper, he could order Musk to pay far less than the $2.6 billion that Tesla paid for SolarCity at the time.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2XW39Pjn2y\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/eat-the-rich-but-let-them-build-rockets-in-the-meantime/\">Eat the rich, but let them build rockets in the meantime</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Eat the rich, but let them build rockets in the meantime&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/eat-the-rich-but-let-them-build-rockets-in-the-meantime/embed/#?secret=2XW39Pjn2y\" data-secret=\"2XW39Pjn2y\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/4TE2jwTvnJ0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:26:25 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg","linkMd5":"8977c9238a6d3802caa2b4458a4f8c8f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn5@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-19-530_67628fa30da38eba.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":1305650,"destBytes":190482,"author":"Aria Alamalhodaei","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tesla-kauai-14.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn5@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-19-530_67628fa30da38eba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-302_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-37-22-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn66@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-37-22-854_575c7f7e98d537ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=4TE2jwTvnJ0:L6mAefSBRrY:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn98@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-37-22-560_ee0af54d78d89f6e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/4TE2jwTvnJ0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn30@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-37-22-294_051ee11f1462f1ad.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114919067},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","title":"Cutting out carbon emitters with bioengineering at XTC Global Finals on July 22","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2174697","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Bioengineering may soon provide compelling, low-carbon alternatives in industries where even the best methods produce significant emissions.

Thrasio &#8212; one of Elevated&#8217;s larger consolidator-competitors &#8212; believes that around 50,000 of them are making $1 million or more annually in sales. Elevate estimates that the Amazon marketplace, currently valued at $300 billion, will double in the next five years.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, all that has led to a number of companies like Elevated racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and equity to consolidate the most promising of these businesses. Their rationale: The founders and management of these third-party sellers may lack the appetite to stay with their businesses for the longer-term, or they may lack the capital to scale to the next level; so consolidating these businesses to leverage investments in technology for better market analytics, marketing, manufacturing and supply chains is the logical solution.</p>\n<p>Given the size of the market opportunity, that&#8217;s led to a lot of investment.

That gave the company an early look at how to handle supply chains in manufacturing, and to think about how to differentiate its products from similar ones that are sold alongside them on Amazon. <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">By 2017, Elevate was managing some 8,000 SKUs under that model. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">That shifted in 2018 to a wholesale model, he said, reselling established brands on Amazon. It ran into trouble multiple times in that period, with Amazon shutting it down three times under suspicion of running counterfeit activities. </span></p>\n<p>&#8220;We got caught up in an algorithm because we were scaling so quickly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They assumed we were doing something wrong.&#8221; All of that helped Elevate learn how to navigate the waters more adeptly, with the first shut down taking three months to fix, but the second only one month, and the third a mere 24 hours. Eventually, in 2019, the company decided to take what it had learned and apply it to a wider range of brands, which it would pick up by way of acquisition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We began as third-party merchants and so we truly relate to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We didn’t just wake up and start buying Amazon businesses. This is what we are in our core, operators first. Anyone can buy a business, but the ones who can grow them are the most successful. That is our long-term view.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Companies that become the target of roll-up acquirers are an interesting lot. As Gnesin describes it, in many cases the businesses Elevate talks to were built as side-hustles, and so when they take off, the founders are just as happy to pass them on to someone else for a decent exit than they are to stay the course. This is one reason why some of the acquisitions end up staying confidential, he said. Another is that the sellers are simply getting on, looking to retire and don&#8217;t have anyone to pass the business on to. Other times, this is just how entrepreneurs work. &#8220;If they make $5 million in a sale to Elevate, they will keep back $4 million for themselves, and use $1 million to start their next business,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LIw8kaGel1\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/e-commerce-roll-ups-present-the-next-wave-of-disruption-in-consumer-packaged-goods/\">E-commerce roll-ups are the next wave of disruption in consumer packaged goods</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;E-commerce roll-ups are the next wave of disruption in consumer packaged goods&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/e-commerce-roll-ups-present-the-next-wave-of-disruption-in-consumer-packaged-goods/embed/#?secret=LIw8kaGel1\" data-secret=\"LIw8kaGel1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p>As for target companies, Elevate right now doesn&#8217;t focus on any specific product categories as other roll-up players might, although that may change in the future as the company gets more focused. What is a priority, however, is intellectual property &#8212; which to me is notable, given what sometimes feels like a genuine lack of differentiation when you look for products on Amazon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have preferences for businesses with patents, since those tend to be more differentiated,&#8221; he said. From there, it goes to those that have strong traction and brand pull. &#8220;When a product is doing well on Amazon, there is an enormous amount of data there, and so you tend to have copycats.

The Austin-based company says it’s looking to “democratize product innovation by drastically lowering barriers to entry for creation of new products.” In that respect, at least, it’s not so dissimilar from various startup initiatives that have arrived over the past decade, from crowdfunding to additive manufacturing.</p>\n<p>The company’s product is a platform/marketplace designed to guide users through the product-creation process, promising results in “as little as 90 days.” The forum connects smaller businesses to factories, supply chain experts, designers, engineers, etc. to help speed up the process. Just ask anyone who has attempted to launch a hardware startup &#8212; these things can be massively difficult to navigate.</p>\n<p>To help accelerate its own vision, <a href=\"https://gembah.com/\">Gembah</a> has raised an $11 million Series A, led by local firm ATX Venture Partners along with Silverton, Flexport, Brett Hurt, Jim Curry and Dan Graham.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2174867\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2174867\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2174867\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"759\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png 1172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=300,222 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=768,569 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=680,504 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Gembah-Screenshot-Customer-Example-Trail-Buddy-2.0.png?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2174867\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gembah</p></div></p>\n<p>It follows a <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-gembah-secures-3-28m-seed-funding-round-for-product-development-platform/\">$3.28 million seed</a> round led by Silverton announced in April of last year, bringing its total funding up to $14.75 million.</p>\n<p>The company says the pandemic has actually been something of a boon for its business model, as hardware startups are looking toward a more online model &#8212; and something a bit closer to home than the traditional sales channels. The company says its revenue grew 500% in 2020 and is on track to triple revenues this year. It&#8217;s impressive growth in the face of some major supply chain issues that have impacted the industry during the past year and a half.</p>\n<p>It currently has 300 active customers, though it was yet to achieve profitability &#8212; hence the new round. “Since most of our customers are e-commerce companies we benefited from the accelerated growth of e-commerce,” CEO and co-founder Henrik Johansson tells TechCrunch. “Supply chains have been impacted to some degree, but as the global supply chain gets more complex and many companies want to diversify outside of China, they need help to navigate that change, and Gembah can help with that transition.”</p>\n<p>The funding will go toward increasing the company’s engineering team. At present, Gembah has 55 employees in the U.S., and 19 in other locations, including Asia and Mexico. The new headcount will be focused on growing the marketplace, supply chain workflow and machine-learning capabilities. Gembah will also look to grow its global network and make additional hires in marketing and UI/UX.</p>\n<p>“Gembah is a true innovator poised to help businesses capitalize on the growth of global eCommerce,” ATX Venture Partners&#8217; Chris Shonk said in a statement. “The Gembah marketplace promises to unlock virtually unlimited entrepreneurial equity by enabling a whole new breed of creators to enter the market.”</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LhObVh1L0w\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce/\">5 predictions for the future of e-commerce</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;5 predictions for the future of e-commerce&#8221;

A special squad of Delhi police <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/\">made a surprise visit to two of Twitter’s offices</a> in late May in what many perceived as an intimidation tactic. Twitter said at the time that it was “concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve” and requested the Indian government to grant it three additional months to comply with the new IT rules.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, Twitter told an Indian court that it was working to &#8220;fully comply&#8221; with the new rules.</p>\n<p>More countries are formulating similar requirements for tech giants in their nations. Russia President Vladimir Putin signed a law that mandates foreign social media giants to open offices in Russia. Any social firm with a daily user base of 500,000 people or more is required to comply with the new law.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4AejhKhEsH\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/india-it-ravi-shankar-prasad-and-broadcasting-minister-javadekar-resign/\">India&#8217;s IT and Broadcasting ministers resign</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;India&#8217;s IT and Broadcasting ministers resign&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/india-it-ravi-shankar-prasad-and-broadcasting-minister-javadekar-resign/embed/#?secret=4AejhKhEsH\" data-secret=\"4AejhKhEsH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/93gDeiVZMUM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 11 Jul 2021 06:55:03 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"aebf142dc57b3a571917ae0f7d7cc649","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-302_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","destWidth":59,"destHeight":24,"sourceBytes":990,"destBytes":324,"author":"Manish Singh","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn20@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-19-302_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn20@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-37-22-668_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn8@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-37-22-672_24b5a8b297f0fb23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=93gDeiVZMUM:oFBG5YZ0fNQ:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn94@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-37-22-317_71acc33f4b20a953.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/93gDeiVZMUM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn36@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-37-22-289_d91adb5d7792775d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114919068},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:19","title":"Microsoft confirms it’s buying cybersecurity startup RiskIQ","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2176145","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Microsoft has confirmed it&#8217;s buying <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/tag/riskiq/\">RiskIQ</a>, a San Francisco-based cybersecurity company that provides threat intelligence and cloud-based software as a service for organizations.</p>\n<p>Terms of the deal, which will see RiskIQ&#8217;s threat intelligence services integrated into Microsoft&#8217;s flagship security offerings, were not disclosed, although <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-11/microsoft-is-said-to-be-buying-cybersecurity-company-riskiq?sref=BAcrnccI\">Bloomberg</a> previously reported that Microsoft will pay more than $500 million in cash for the company. Microsoft declined to confirm the reported figure.</p>\n<p>The announcement comes amid a heightened security landscape as organizations shift to remote and hybrid working strategies.</p>\n<p>RiskIQ scours the web, mapping out details about websites and networks, domain name records, certificates and other information, like WHOIS registration data, providing customers visibility into what assets, devices and services can be accessed outside of a company&#8217;s firewall. That helps companies lock down their assets and limit their attack surface from malicious actors. It&#8217;s that data in large part that helped the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/13/magecart-hackers-persistent-credit-card-skimmer-groups/\">discover and understand Magecart</a>, a collection of groups that inject credit card stealing malware into vulnerable websites.</p>\n<p>Microsoft says that by embedding RiskIQ&#8217;s technologies into its core products, its customers will be able to build a more comprehensive view of the global threats to their businesses as workforces continue to work outside of the traditional office environment.</p>\n<p>The deal will also help organizations to keep an eye on supply-chain risks, Microsoft says. This is likely a growing priority for many: an attack on software provider SolarWinds last year saw affected at least 18,000 of its customers, and just this month IT vendor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/\">Kaseya fell victim to a ransomware attack</a> that spread to more than 1,000 downstream businesses.</p>\n<p>Eric Doerr, vice president of cloud security at Microsoft, said: &#8220;RiskIQ helps customers discover and assess the security of their entire enterprise attack surface — <wbr></wbr>in the Microsoft cloud, AWS, other clouds, on-premises, and from their supply chain. With more than a decade of experience scanning and analyzing the internet, RiskIQ can help enterprises identify and remediate vulnerable assets before an attacker can capitalize on them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>RiskIQ was founded in 2009 and has raised a total of $83 million over four rounds of funding. Elias Manousos, who co-founded RiskIQ and serves as its chief executive, said he was &#8220;thrilled&#8221; at the acquisition.</p>\n<p>“The vision and mission of RiskIQ is to provide unmatched internet visibility and insights to better protect and inform our customers and partners’ security programs,&#8221; said Manousos. &#8220;Our combined capabilities will enable best-in-class protection, investigations, and response against today’s threats.”</p>\n<p>The acquisition is one of many Microsoft has made recently in the cybersecurity space in recent months. The software giant last year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/microsoft-confirms-acquisition-of-cyberx-to-boost-security-in-its-iot-business/\">bought Israeli security startup CyberX in a bid to boost its Azure IoT business, </a>and just last month it acquired Internet of Things security firm ReFirm Labs.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"
