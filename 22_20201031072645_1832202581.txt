Trump. The poll also asked respondents questions about foreign and domestic policies related to both candidates.</p><p>Trump's support among Arab American Republicans has grown, according to AAI. In 2016 the polling found that 58% of Arab American voters supported Hillary Clinton and 25% supported Donald Trump, showing that this year, his percentage points jumped up 10%.&#160;</p><p>A separate <a href=\"https://www.ispu.org/public-policy/american-muslim-poll/\">poll</a> by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding correlated the findings that support for Trump among conservative American Muslims has increased since 2016.&#160;</p><p>The majority of respondents to AAI's poll, though, showed strong backing for Biden on the issues and disapproval of Trump's handling of various issues, from the pandemic to protests for racial justice. A quarter of those supporting Biden stated that they were voting for the former Vice President in opposition to Trump, as opposed to directly supporting the Biden campaign.</p><p>Overall, Arab Americans who responded showed that their greatest concerns this election year were ranked as race relations, then the faltering economy, and third, healthcare, as the pandemic continues. Seventy percent of those polled said that they viewed the nationwide demonstrations supporting Black Lives Matter in a positive light.</p><p>Respondents also relayed that Palestine, \"meeting the humanitarian concerns of the Syrian people,\" and addressing the political and economic crisis in Lebanon, were the top areas of concern on international issues. By a margin of two to one, Trump was seen as being more ineffective than effective in addressing polled domestic and foreign policy issues. Most respondents answered that Biden could improve relations with the Arab world.</p><p>The AAI also found that turnout will likely be high for Arab Americans in this election, particularly in Michigan, where Arab Americans could make up 5% of the electorate. More than 80% responded that they were likely to vote, as the Trump and Biden campaigns make their final pitch across the crucial swing state.</p><p>Last week, Jill Biden spoke to Arab American activists and community members in Dearborn, Michigan, in front of the iconic Shatila Bakery, an Arab bakery and community mainstay which has been around since the 1970s. There, she spoke about the US being a \"nation of immigrants\" and claimed that Joe Biden's vision included Arab American communities. Senator Kamala Harris, Biden's vice-presidential pick, also campaigned on the ground, speaking to Arab voters in Dearborn.</p><p>On Friday, in Michigan, Trump again touted his support in the Chaldean Iraqi community, a Christian minority that played a helpful role in the 11,000 vote lead which tipped Trump over the edge in Michigan in 2016. The Chaldean community has experienced a subsequent wave of deportations by ICE throughout Trump's presidency, including the case of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/detroit-man-died-after-being-deported-to-iraq-attorney-says-2019-8\">Jimmy Aldaoud</a>, a 41 year old Iraqi national who had never lived in Iraq. Aldaoud was deported to Iraq, without family on the ground or insulin for his diabetes, and later died, homeless in Baghdad.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

us to enjoy together almost every week. Besides dedicated family time, what makes it special is the setup. The first task is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-shows-disney-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">finding a flick</a> we can all agree on, although we usually take turns picking one to watch on the big screen. After that is the next most important step: snacks, usually some combo of popcorn, candy, and cookies. Then, settle in, park it a comfortable chair, wrap up in cozy blanket, and watch the show.&#160;&#160;</p><p>If you're looking to make your family movie night into a running tradition, it's important to settle on a few essentials that will make it easy, except for maybe deciding what to watch. Below are some suggestions we've collected to help you enjoy a trip to the theater without leaving the comfort of home.</p><h2>Here are 13 things to make a great family movie night at home:</h2>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe popcorn, of course\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c686369331a0011bc672c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"lekue popcorn maker\" height=\"1124\" width=\"1498\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Popcorn is the best part about a trip to the theater, besides the movie itself. The Lukue Microwave Popcorn Popper makes it easy to recreate that experience &#8212; just add kernels and set the cook timer for two to three minutes. Unlike the bagged stuff, you won't be stuck with a bowl full of unpopped kernels either. It's also easy to clean and small enough to stow away in the cabinet. If you want something a little bigger, there are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-popcorn-maker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plenty of options available</a>.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5db2f89edee0190409681702\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5db2f89edee0190409681702&type=button&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div>\n\tPopcorn buckets\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c6dd969331a0011bc675d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"westbend popcorn bucket\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Target</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>You can leave your popcorn in the bowl, or you can dish it out into one of these novelty popcorn containers that look just like the tubs you'd get at the theater.

Besides, giving the kids anything too sweet before bedtime is never a good idea. Perfect Snacks Peanut Butter Cups have a lower glycemic index than most candy bars to keep everyone focused on the show and not bouncing off the walls. If you'd rather have a chocolate bar or sour candies, there are plenty of other tasty, low-sugar <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/healthy-halloween-treats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">treats out there</a>.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5f7f2034acfefb57003e88d3\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f7f2034acfefb57003e88d3&type=button&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div>\n\tCookies that taste great and even have some nutritional value\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c71ee69331a0011bc677f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"lenny larry chocolate chip cookie\" height=\"525\" width=\"700\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lenny &#38; Larry</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Just because a cookie isn't loaded with empty calories doesn't mean it has to taste like cardboard.

The app serves as a virtual mood board and recommendation engine, and offers up an endless stream of content curated around both my current interests and those I haven't discovered yet. For me, it's a pleasant, dependable distraction.&#160;</p><p>It seems I'm not alone. After a decade of being something of an anti-social-network with a devoted following of hobbyists, Pinterest is surging.&#160;The company posted <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/pinterest-stock-soars-more-than-10percent-revenue-up-49percent.html\">blow-out third-quarter earnings</a> this week, reporting $443 million in revenue, up 58% year over year. The app is now boasting 442 million users worldwide, a 37% growth in monthly active users since last year. Pinterest's strong quarter sent its stock <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/29/pinterest-more-than-delivered-the-goods-in-q3-on-back-of-ad-rebound.html\">soaring 27%</a> on Wednesday.&#160;</p><p>Pinterest isn't shying away from its position as a positive place to hang out in an otherwise bleak landscape.</p><p>\"In Q3, the world was still dealing with the economic and health challenges brought on by COVID-19. Nobody knows exactly how all of this will play out,\" CEO Ben Silbermann and CFO Todd Morgenfeld wrote in a letter to shareholders.</p><p>\"But at Pinterest, we continued to focus on what we can control: supporting all of our stakeholders in this unpredictable time. This included giving Pinners and brands a positive place to be online during a divisive election in the United States,\" they wrote.</p><h2>High engagement during lockdowns</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9b322069331a0011bc6316?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pinterest\" height=\"1998\" width=\"2664\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Rich Polk/Getty Images for Pinterest</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Pinterest's strong quarter was fueled by a swell of new users on the platform, particularly those under 25, Silbermann and Morgenfeld noted in the shareholder letter.</p><p>Many of those <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ios-14-widgets-home-screen-ideas-pinterest-downloads-2020-9\">young users flocked to Pinterest</a> after the release of iOS 14, Apple's latest smartphone operating system, which allows iPhone users to customize their home screens using widgets. The hunt for home screen inspiration led to millions of new users, Pinterest said.&#160;</p><p>\"We experienced a particular benefit of about 4 million global MAUs at the end of the quarter as younger users upgraded their iPhones to iOS 14 and used Pinterest for inspiration for customized background filters,\" Silbermann and Morgenfeld wrote.</p><p>Overall, app usage seems closely tied to the pandemic: The company said it saw higher engagement during coronavirus lockdowns — when those lockdowns lifted, Pinterest saw engagement decrease. Users who joined during the pandemic have been relying Pinterest to search for something specific, the company says, and have \"higher commercial intent\" — meaning, those users are looking to shop. Pinterest says that the number of users engaging with its built-in shopping platform is risen 85% since March.</p><p>Andrew Lipsman, a principal analyst at eMarketer, said following Pinterest's earnings that the company is a beneficiary of the rise in online shopping.</p><p>\"The company is especially well positioned for the moment, with users flocking to the site for inspiration amid new pandemic habits and also benefiting from the surge in ecommerce buying,\" Lipsman wrote.</p><p>Analysts at MKM Partners said that although it's still \"early days\" for shopping on Pinterest, growth will only continue, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/29/pinterest-more-than-delivered-the-goods-in-q3-on-back-of-ad-rebound.html\">according to CNBC</a>.&#160;</p><p>\"Catalog growth and integration with leading eCommerce ecosystem stakeholders such as Shopify is going to increase the importance of Pinterest in the overall shopping funnel,\" the firm wrote.</p><p>But there's more to Pinterest's growth than bored young people stuck inside or a global acceleration in online shopping: advertisers are looking for a more pleasant place to spend their money.</p><p>Pinterest has <a href=\"https://business.pinterest.com/content/it-pays-to-be-positive/\">billed itself</a> to advertisers as a smarter alternative to Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites given its lack of news-related content and its reputation for having fewer internet trolls. This past summer, when civil rights organizations urged brands to stop advertising on Facebook over its hate-speech moderation and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-no-longer-advertising-on-facebook-after-poor-speech-moderation-2020-6\">major companies like Starbucks, Unilever, and Verizon joined the boycott</a>, it seems to have paid off for Pinterest, at least in the near-term.&#160;</p><p>\"Spend from the group of advertisers boycotting social media accelerated in Q3, though it's not yet clear how sustainable this trend will be, particularly after the US presidential election cycle ends,\" Silbermann and Morgenfeld wrote in the shareholder letter.</p><p>Morgenfeld said during the company's earnings call though Pinterest isn't banking on the trend to continue, it believes \"the positivity of Pinterest is a long-term competitive advantage.\"</p><p>While there's no telling if Pinterest's welcoming and stress-free platform will continue to fuel it's growth in the fourth quarter and beyond, one thing remains true: for anyone overwhelmed by the news cycle or looking for a few minutes of escape, Pinterest remains one of the most relaxing places on the internet.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

While men and women from rural and urban areas tended to vote similarly, a split is seen along gender lines in suburban areas that may define the outcome of this election cycle.&#160;</p><p>This breakdown comes from an aggregation of nine polls taken between August 8 and October 12. All told, the polls combined to 10,077 respondents, 8,623 of whom indicated they were registered to vote and 8,321 of whom said they would likely do so.&#160;</p><p>Respondents were asked about who they intended to vote for in November as well as a number of other questions. Respondents were asked to provide their zip code, which was later matched to census data regarding population density. Suburbs were classified as any zip code with a population between 100 and 2,900 people per square kilometer.</p><p>Among the survey respondents, suburban women made up 44% of likely voters. As a whole, respondents from zip codes classified as the suburbs make up 80% of likely voters.</p><p>While Trump trails among women in the suburbs, it appears that his campaign understands the importance of their vote. Earlier this month, he made a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-addresses-voter-group-struggled-to-reach-suburban-women-2020-10\">plea to female voters</a> at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, saying \"Suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, OK?\"</p><p>And then in Lansing, Michigan, he further attempted to woo female voters by saying, \"We're getting your husbands back to work.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls\">Exit polls in 2016</a> found that Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in suburban areas by 4 percentage points.</p><p>Trump narrowly won some swing states in 2016 by less than 1 percentage point. If Biden can win over the suburbs on Election Day, it may be enough to propel those states back to the Democratic Party.&#160;</p><p>Additionally, Insider polling found that while female suburban voters prefer Biden at higher rates than Trump, rural men are slightly more likely to support Biden than rural women.&#160;</p><section data-track-content=\"\" data-post-type=\"post\"><p><em>SurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender.

We stand behind our community as they share their voices, and we are committed to continuing to provide a home for them to do so.\"</p><p>The judge's motion to block the ban is the latest development in a series of efforts made by the Trump administration to bar the app from the US market. US officials have criticized the app's China-based parent company, ByteDance, over national security concerns. Some US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed fear that the Chinese government could access millions of Americans' personal data through the app.</p><p>In addition to the ban, Presiden Trump has also ordered ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to sell TikTok's US business to an American firm.

My first lessons in economics and marketing — scarcity, fiat currency, opportunity cost, sub-brands — were in Anaheim.</p><p>Between 1959 and 1982, park visitors were asked to engage in game-theory and segmentation exercises to get the most magic from their kingdom. In 1972, admission only set you back <a href=\"https://allears.net/walt-disney-world/wdw-planning/wdw-ticket-increase-guide/\">$3.75</a>. It's now $154, an inflation-adjusted increase in excess of 300% (#worthit).

I have successful friends in Florida who have a statue of themselves at the base of their circular stairway. Make. It. Stop. Anyway, I felt similar disgust when a rookie visitor would burn an E-ticket on a lesser ride like The Sailing Ship Columbia or The Enchanted Tiki Room. What a waste. You didn't want to go on Space Mountain? Yeah, that makes sense.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Senate commerce committee had a book of E-tickets. They patched in three big tech CEOs (Pichai, Dorsey, and Zuckerberg) and were set to delve into the future of internet regulation. Specifically the thorny but critical topic of Section 230, an all-day pass that lets big tech do whatever they want in the park. They can even smoke pot on the Skyway gondola, a sublime if inefficient way to get from Tomorrowland to Fantasyland, without risking incarceration at Disney Jail. An actual thing. Not that it happened to me in 1983. Definitely not. But I digress.</p><p>Senators on the committee had Space Mountain within reach but opted for Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln instead. Only Ted Cruz was Lincoln. And the Great Moments were weak and weird diversions to The Rainbow Ridge Pack Mules and Tom Sawyer River Rafts. Note: If you're thinking I've taken this analogy way too far, trust your instincts.</p><p>At some point, Senate and House subcommittees will run out of E tickets, and big tech CEOs — whose lobbyists, money, and comms departments have nearly overrun government — will begin ignoring House and Senate subpoenas and will start sending underlings, as they've been to the park too many times and have companies to run.</p><p><em>\"Mr. Dorsey, who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear? And why do you persist in behaving as a Democratic super PAC suppressing views contrary to your political beliefs?\" — Senator Ted Cruz</em></p><p>Uh, well, Senator… nobody elects a CEO of a company. They are appointed by a board, who are (theoretically) elected by shareholders. And every media company, including Twitter, despite what they claim, gets to make these decisions.&#160;</p><p>What's crazytown here is the GOP panel members, similar to George W. Bush, decided to attack the wrong enemy (Saddam had as much to do with 9/11 as Bambi's mom, and we'd be better off if both were still alive, can't wait for the hate mail on that one).

The cancer is algorithms that register, in a millionth of a second, that Messrs.

They were prepared, disciplined and went straight for the Pirates of the Caribbean — allocated resources effectively. I wonder if the House is becoming the body where youth, preparation, greater turnover, and diversity (on several dimensions) elevates their brand above what was once considered the chamber with more gravitas. The Senate's \"hearing\" this week was a sh-tshow, with Senators Cruz and Blackburn swinging wildly and not landing a glove on the platforms. It was similar to watching our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Eagle_Claw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">failed attempt</a> to end the Iran hostage crisis… minus the dignity and heroism. This was an October surprise that didn't even try to cover up how politically motivated the timing and flawed the mission.&#160;</p><p>The silver lining?

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/netflix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Netflix</a> in addition to cable television or as a replacement, most people would agree that it's become nearly essential. With a vast library of TV shows, movies, and Netflix original programming, Netflix has become a cultural juggernaut of the 21st century.</p><p>Like its competitors, Netflix offers a variety of subscription tiers, which differ on price and features. In the US, Netflix even still offers the ability to order DVD and Blu-ray discs in the mail.</p><p>Here's a guide to what Netflix charges for each of its plans.</p><h2><strong>How much Netflix's streaming plans cost</strong></h2><p>Netflix offers three streaming plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium, starting at $9 per month and ending at $18 per month. Here's what you get with each plan.</p><ul><li><strong>Basic</strong>. The Basic streaming plan costs $8.99 per month and has the most limited features. You can only use it on a single screen at a time (which is fine if you're the only user of the account), and resolution is limited to standard definition (SD), which is equivalent to old, pre-HD television.</li><li><strong>Standard</strong>. The Standard streaming plan costs $13.99 per month and allows you two watch on two screens at a time in high definition (HD).</li><li><strong>Premium</strong>. The Premium streaming plan costs $17.99 per month. For that, you can watch on four screens at once (ideal for a large family), and you can video programming in HD or 4K Ultra HD, if available.</li></ul><h2><strong>How much Netflix's DVD and Blu-ray plans costs</strong></h2><p>In the US, Netflix continues to offer discs by mail at <a href=\"https://dvd.netflix.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dvd.netflix.com</a>. This was, in fact, the way Netflix originally delivered its content — via DVD — when it launched in 1998. It added streaming video in 2007, and DVD rentals declined rapidly. Today, it's still an option, though an uncommon one.</p><p>Here are the pricing plans.</p><ul><li><strong>Standard</strong>. The Standard DVD plan costs $7.99 per month. If you prefer Blu-ray, the cost is $9.99 per month. &#160;In both cases, Netflix allows you to keep one disc at a time for as long as you want (as soon as you return that disc, Netflix immediately sends you the next disc listed in your queue). There's no limit to how many discs you can watch over time, though — the only limitation is how quickly you can watch and return discs.</li><li><strong>Premier</strong>. The Premier DVD plan allows you to keep two discs at a time for $11.99 per month, or $14.99 per month for Blu-rays. Otherwise, the plan works the same as the Standard plan.</li></ul><h2>Related coverage from&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"4c86c1c3a45644bf07d168dc4c802e5e\">Tech Reference</a>:</h2><ul><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-netflix-gift-card\" data-analytics-position=\"8\" data-analytics-module=\"\">How to use a Netflix gift card to pay for your Netflix subscription plan</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/does-apple-tv-have-netflix\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"e9f35cab23ba579ab6a4f5258fbfb80e\">'Does Apple TV have Netflix?': How to download Netflix on your Apple TV from the App Store</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-change-netflix-profile-on-roku\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"16cc3b9711810358dd6974d4a2fb245c\">How to change your Netflix profile on a Roku player in 2 ways</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-netflix-on-ps4\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"d7645f0510a0ab619ad9ac1bcc3a925d\">How to get Netflix on a PS4 to watch TV shows and movies from your console</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-change-language-on-netflix\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"1094ce04303634dd3f41861c5054f9c5\">How to change the primary language on your Netflix profile, on desktop and mobile</a></h3></li></ul><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-is-netflix'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/50qGBRsRY-w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 21:43:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f9c887369331a0011bc685a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f9db9514e78ee813968cb8fbc8344478","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn12@2020_1/2020/10/31/07-26-27-671_a73134ea25a208bd.webp","destWidth":2454,"destHeight":1841,"sourceBytes":57650,"destBytes":57650,"author":"insider@insider.com (Dave Johnson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f9c88816f5b310011724a26?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn39@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-33-287_81f71dda36ce46c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn81@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-35-995_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn83@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-35-954_46231989fb98dd2c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-34-071_092f22ca4e833bab.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn84@2020_1/2020/10/31/07-26-32-089_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=50qGBRsRY-w:Oat_-qrUYJw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn89@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-36-672_0da6e6e78b758063.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/50qGBRsRY-w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-27-031_d79342e189f8ea08.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604129167103},{"createdTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:07","updatedTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:07","title":"How billionaires saw their net worth increase by half a trillion dollars during the pandemic","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7","description":"<div style=\"position:relative;

And this is Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' net worth during that same time span. From March to June 2020, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos saw his wealth rise by an estimated $48 billion. The founder of the video-conferencing platform Zoom grew his nest egg by over $2.5 billion, and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's net worth increased by $15.7 billion.</p><p>These kinds of examples might lead you to think that when billionaires profit during a crisis, it's just a matter of right place, right time. Well, that's not false, but it's not entirely true either. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson saw his wealth increase by $5 billion, while Elon Musk saw an increase of $17.2 billion. When you add up the numbers, billionaires in the United States have increased their total net worth $637 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic so far.</p><p>At the same time, more than 40 million Americans filed for unemployment. With tens of millions of Americans out of a paycheck and the stock market plummeting by 37% in March, how is it that the rich have continued getting richer?</p><p>This isn't the first time billionaires have seen gains while a large portion of Americans were feeling losses. When the housing bubble burst in 2007, home prices fell 21% and roughly 3.1 million homes were foreclosed on in the United States. The stock market plummeted by over 50%. And by the end of 2009, 8.8 million Americans had lost their jobs. And the effects lingered. From 2009 to 2012, the incomes of the bottom 99% grew by only 0.4%, but the income of the top 1% grew by a staggering 31.4% in the same time span. And it all ties back to two things.</p><p>First, the government disproportionately gave more aid to banks and corporations. In 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act was signed into law, creating a $700 billion program to purchase devalued assets from banks. This was called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Later, President Obama would direct $75 billion in funds from TARP to help reduce interest payments for homeowners. That means homeowners received around 10% of the direct relief that banks and corporations did.</p><p>And this leads to reason No. 2. When the stock market bounced back, the unequal bailouts meant that the wealthy still had money on hand to invest and thus profit, while the middle and lower classes did not. In 2008, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates to near zero. They would remain that low for nearly a decade. This paved the way for a historic bull market on Wall Street that began in 2009 and lasted until March 2020, when the pandemic hit.</p><p>In that time, the S&#38;P 500 gained 462%. That means that a $1,000 investment in the S&#38;P 500 at the low point of the financial crisis could have returned roughly $4,620, while someone who could afford a $1 million investment could have pulled in over $4.6 million.</p><p>By 2009, the world's high-net-worth individuals had grown their share of global wealth by 19% to $39 trillion, recouping nearly all of their losses in a single year. That quick recovery and larger share of the world's wealth enabled them to continue to make money at an exponential rate. In fact, the top 1% captured 95% of the income gains made from 2009 to 2012. And by 2020, the combined wealth of the billionaire class in the United States had increased by over 80%.</p><p>Which brings us back to the moment when the coronavirus pandemic rocked the economy. In 2019, the Fed reported that four in 10 Americans didn't have enough cash in their bank accounts to cover a $400 unexpected expense. And in the first few months of 2020, 40 million Americans found themselves unemployed due to COVID-19. Many small businesses had to close due to lockdowns and social distancing, while others were forced to try to operate with entirely remote staff.</p><p>The Small Business Administration made $349 billion available to small businesses with the Paycheck Protection Program. But like in 2008, $243 million of that was snapped up by large, publicly traded corporations, some of which were valued at over $100 million. Even hedge funds submitted claims to try to tap into what they saw as free money.</p><p>On March 16, 2020, just five days after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, the Dow suffered the worst single-day points drop in its history. But by June 4, seven of the world's richest people had seen their fortunes increase by over 50%. Part of what made this possible was a stock-market rebound fueled both by the Paycheck Protection Program and actions by the Fed. Again, the Fed lowered short-term interest rates for banks to near 0%, and as before, they have promised to hold those rates low until the economy is on track.</p><p>This is a cycle that has happened time and time again. During the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, only 2.5% of the $195 million of relief funds went to Haitian companies. Much of the rest was awarded to DC-based construction companies. And when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, real-estate developer Joseph Canizaro said the clearing out caused by Katrina represented some \"very big opportunities.\" Canizaro was selected as part of a panel to develop the Bring New Orleans Back plan, part of which put a stop on reconstruction of low-income neighborhoods until the residents returned. Of course, residents couldn't return to their destroyed homes, and many were foreclosed on, paving the way for others to buy those properties and develop them.</p><p>When the time did come to rebuild New Orleans, the engineering and construction company KBR received no-bid contracts from the federal government for tens of millions of dollars. KBR received $31 billion in contracts from the government between 2001 and 2010. Vice President Dick Cheney served as CEO of KBR's parent company, Halliburton, for the five years leading up to his two terms in office.</p><p>Combined with their immense investing and purchasing power, billionaires have had government resources in addition to their own resources to profit from during economic upheavals. And wealth-friendly tax laws and loopholes then keep those billionaires at the top. Legal structures such as limited liability companies protect personal assets from being repossessed to pay the debts from business downturns. As it's set up today, IRS rules allowed Amazon to pay $0 in taxes two years in a row. When its bill finally came due in 2019, it paid just $162 million, a measly 1.2% of the company's income that year.</p><p>And it's not just Amazon. Taxes paid by billionaires have decreased 79% since 1980. And those are just the legal avenues that the wealthy take to avoid paying taxes. In 2017, researchers estimated that about 10% of the world's GDP was stashed in offshore tax havens. A study in 2012 found that as much as $32 trillion was being held offshore by the world's wealthiest people.</p><p>So, after reviewing all this, what can be done to help level the playing field? A recent report by the Institute for Policy Studies lays out several action items. It suggests forming a pandemic profiteering oversight committee that would go beyond the oversight of federal stimulus money. It also supports the Corporate Transparency Act, which would create stronger regulations to prevent US billionaires from using shell corporations to hide their income. After the House passed the bill in 2019, it was introduced in the Senate but has not been brought to a vote.</p><p>Other suggestions include an emergency 10% millionaire income surtax, a stimulus package aimed at funding charities, instituting a wealth tax, and reducing the amount allowed by the gift and estate tax. Last, and perhaps most importantly, the report underscores the need to shut down the global hidden-wealth economy. The US alone is estimated to lose nearly $200 billion in tax revenues to offshore havens each year. That's roughly three times the amount of all the money budgeted for the Department of Education in 2021.</p><p>Changes like the ideas above are global in scale and require political cooperation to become reality. If the relationship between wealth and income inequality are ever going to change, it's going to require all of us.'</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published in August 2020.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ZFoiQBSw5Zs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 21:30:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f22d3bf5fa9a4650320a8f7?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"200b3c572992160855a1cac0a8e44515","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn17@2020_2/2020/10/31/07-26-25-958_b3a72ae8ae3152f8.webp","destWidth":1440,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":47318,"destBytes":47318,"author":"insider@insider.com (Hiatt Woods)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn81@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-35-995_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn7@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-30-841_dd33a64d1d509225.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn31@2020_4/2020/10/31/07-26-27-870_4976073310fc8816.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn84@2020_1/2020/10/31/07-26-32-089_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ZFoiQBSw5Zs:UP-0u1pUfgU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn44@2020_4/2020/10/31/07-26-37-068_81807457de3ea7db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ZFoiQBSw5Zs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn61@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-35-829_87555e6872a14ee8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604129167077},{"createdTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:07","updatedTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:07","title":"Insider poll: Biden voters are more anxious about the economy than Trump voters","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-voters-more-anxious-about-economy-than-trump-voters-poll-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c56fb6f5b310011724865?format=jpeg\" alt=\"GettyImages economy covid\" height=\"723\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>People wearing protective masks walk by a going out of business sign displayed outside Century 21 in New York City.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Noam Galai/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>A new series of polls suggests there's a link between a voter's financial status and their preferred 2020 presidential candidate.</li>\n<li>Affluent voters tended to favor President Donald Trump, according to the data.&#160;</li>\n<li>Former Vice President Joe Biden was more likely to gain support from voters with financial hardships.</li>\n<li>The surveys were conducted by Insider with SurveyMonkey from August to October.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>A new series of polls suggests that voters who are economically anxious, financially imperiled due to coronavirus, and otherwise worried about money are more likely to back Democratic nominee Joe Biden, not President Donald Trump.</p><p>The surveys, conducted by Insider with SurveyMonkey, reveal that Americans' housing, employment, and debt situations each played roles in their voting habits.

Wall Street isn't so concerned.</p><p>The tech giant's revenue and profit for the September quarter beat expectations, but all-important iPhone sales missed analysts' hopes. The shortfall and a lack of forward guidance dragged shares to their lowest in a month and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/apple-stock-price-fiscal-q4-earnings-iphone-sales-miss-estimates-2020-10-1029746691\">erased as much as $111 billion from Apple's market cap</a>.</p><p>Still, analysts are mostly optimistic about iPhone performance.

But in the midst of a rut, this often feels impossible.</p><p>Fortunately, the following strategies can help you get out of a rut no matter how stuck you feel.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">1. Identify several escape routes</strong></h2><p>There are always many different solutions to a problem. Of course, not all of them are good solutions. But when you're first trying to look at how to get unstuck, brainstorm as many ideas as you can — even ones you think might be bad.</p><p>Create a long list of strategies that could help you escape your current situation. Include ideas that seem awful and ones that might seem impossible (at least for now). The goal is to create a long enough list that your brain will recognize you have plenty of options.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">2. Change your routine</strong></h2><p>While routines can be good for developing good habits — like going to the gym every day — having too much structure in your life could cause you to feel robotic. You need to change things up a bit to get out of the rut.</p><p>Doing things differently helps your brain look at matters from a new angle. It might spark new ideas, fuel a passion, or give you more energy.</p><p>You don't necessarily need to make huge changes — smaller ones can be effective too. Instead of eating dinner right when you get home from work, go for a walk. Or sign up for a class that will help you learn something new.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">3. Develop a challenge</strong></h2><p>Competition is a great way to add fuel to a dwindling fire. And you don't necessarily need to compete against anyone else. Instead, you can create a challenge that's just for you.</p><p>Your challenge could be related to a specific problem. If you're in a financial rut, you might challenge yourself to pay down $1,000 worth of debt in a month.</p><p>Or you could just create a challenge that gives you a goal to reach every day — like running a mile to see how fast you can do it. Running each day might give you something to look forward to, it could offer a sense of accomplishment, and it may spark new interests in other areas of your life.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">4. Design experiments</strong></h2><p>You don't have to commit to making a change that is going to last forever. Instead, you can design short-term experiments.</p><p>See if they make your life better or worse. If your experiment makes things better, stick to it. If it makes things worse, do something else.</p><p>You might design a small experiment like testing whether wearing a different type of clothing makes you feel differently about yourself. If your wardrobe change boosts your confidence, stick with it. If it doesn't, do something different.</p><p>Or you could test a different social media strategy for your business one week. If it gets you positive results, keep it up. If not, try something different.</p><p>Make it a goal to have a new experiment every week — whether it's social, business, fitness, or financial — and you'll find ways to improve your life.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">5. Switch up your social circle</strong></h2><p>The people you surround yourself with make a big difference in how you see yourself and the world around you. Switching up your social circle can be one of the fastest ways to get unstuck.</p><p>Look for ways to reconnect with people you've lost touch with, or find ways to meet new people.

While crowded hotel pools don't sound too appealing right now due to COVID-19, secluded pools at private Airbnbs sure do. Of course, if you're looking for a simple above-ground pool solution for your own backyard, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-swimming-pool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we can help you out with that too</a>. Or, if you prefer an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-inflatable-hot-tub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inflatable hot tub for the winter, try one of these</a>.&#160;</p><p>If you're wondering <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-airbnbs-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">whether Airbnbs are safe</a> right now, we spoke with experts who said staying at an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/which-is-safer-airbnb-hotels-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airbnb as opposed to a hotel</a> may actually be one of the safer options, especially if booking the entire house so there are no interactions with hosts or other guests.&#160;</p><p>Airbnb <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-airbnbs-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">also recently implemented new procedures</a> and cleaning policies, which include new protocols all hosts must now follow. However, there are still hosts going the extra mile and taking part in Airbnb's most stringent Enhanced Clean protocols.&#160;We've noted new cleaning policies for each listing below, but keep in mind that without a vaccine there's no guarantee of safety. Experts also advise guests that it may be wise to take extra precautions like bringing your own sheets and wiping down all surfaces yourself upon arrival.&#160;&#160;</p><p>If you're okay with those potential risks and inconveniences, then Airbnb can be a good option for a socially distant summer vacation. We also asked experts to weigh in on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-travel-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other travel risks like renting a car, flying, and more</a>, so you can feel safe getting to your planned destination.&#160;</p><p>We strongly advise following guidelines and advice from organizations such as the CDC and WHO, and practicing safety measures including wearing a mask, washing your hands, and maintaining social distancing. It's also necessary to check travel restrictions and guidelines for the state you plan on visiting since many still have mandatory quarantines for out-of-staters.</p><p>With all that in mind, if you're ready to kick summer off by cannonballing straight into the deep end, we rounded up some excellent Airbnbs with pools across the country. We used the following criteria for our selections:</p><ol><li><strong>Airbnb listing is for the entire home (no awkward bathroom sharing situations).</strong></li><li><strong>All are highly-rated Airbnb listings with a rating of 4.8 or higher.</strong></li><li><strong>Listings include a private pool for guest use.</strong></li></ol><h2>Read on for 17 of the best Airbnbs with pools, sorted by price from low to high.</h2>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tFarm cottage in Silver Creek, Georgia, $49\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c8d106f5b310011724a46?format=jpeg\" alt=\"airbnbs with private pools georgia\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Airbnb</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h2><a href=\"https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/196318/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Frooms%2F39226331%3Fsource_impression_id%3Dp3_1604094621_QxS2vrl6mt2C2xa0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Book this farm cottage starting at $49 per night</a></h2><p>Coming in at just $49 and located on an idyllic farm, this charming cottage with a private pool is a remote getaway away from the city bustle and a serious deal.

Over the years, I've reached out to well over 200 people doing things I thought were cool, requesting a chance to speak with them. Only three people have declined my invitation to talk. (Well, technically four — Oprah never got back to me.) This&#160;<a href=\"https://forge.medium.com/youll-never-get-what-you-want-if-you-re-too-scared-to-ask-for-it-ec3c0c210a4d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">practice of cold-emailing</a>&#160;has helped me build a professional tribe that has become a place for support, connection, and more opportunities than I ever thought possible.</p><p id=\"dfb8\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">At a time when everyone is dealing with a lot, the ability to craft an email that not only gets read but gets a positive response is an increasingly valuable skill. Here's what I've learned about how to do it well.</p><h2 id=\"2e53\"><strong>Don't begin by trying to call Oprah</strong></h2><p id=\"4e5c\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If I learned anything from my experience of reaching out to strangers, it's that&#160;<a href=\"https://forge.medium.com/how-to-like-people-more-bf99b6cf4c74\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the world is full of incredibly talented people</a> who can help you grow.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You don't need Oprah, Bill Gates, Tim Ferriss, or any other high-profile figure who will definitely never see your request to \"put some time on their calendar.\" Start smart by identifying friends of friends who are doing cool things.</p><p id=\"1ef0\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Don't limit your list to people who are in your exact field, either. Breakthroughs often come when you surround yourself with people who view things through a different lens.</p><h2 id=\"7754\"><strong>Your subject line matters</strong></h2><p id=\"e3ff\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">After you've made a list of people to reach out to, it's time to craft your email. The subject line \"Friend of [mutual friend's name]\" is a solid option, but it's not the only one.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In one&#160;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3036672/what-we-learned-from-sending-1000-cold-emails\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">experiment</a>, the entrepreneur and author Shane Snow found that simple subject lines like \"Quick question\" net strong results when you're reaching out to new people. (Marketers, however, are starting to use this subject line more often, so its effectiveness may be waning.)</p><p id=\"d9ef\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For me personally, the subject line \"Thank you\" has consistently been the most effective in starting conversations. (We'll talk about how you should thank the person in your email in a bit.) People don't write thank-you notes as much as they say they do. This simple act will help you to stand out without showing off.</p><h2 id=\"eb92\"><strong>Know your 'North Star'</strong></h2><p id=\"0bdf\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When I first started becoming more serious about my writing, the speaker and entrepreneur&#160;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/conorneill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Conor Neill</a> gave me this advice: When drafting an article, write at the top of the page: \"After reading this, I want the reader to ________?\" He told me to use this question as my \"North Star\" to guide my writing.</p><p id=\"b3d1\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You can apply this same strategy to writing your email. Have one clear agenda, even if it's simply to try to get them on a call so you can learn more about them. Make sure your goal is clear so the message you send supports exactly what you're looking to accomplish.</p><h2 id=\"3780\"><strong>Embrace the 'Rule of 7'</strong></h2><p id=\"b7bb\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One of the oldest principles in marketing is the \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-contacts-does-it-take-before-someone-buys-your-product-2011-7?IR=T#:~:text=A%20good%20starting%20point%20for,within%20an%2018%2Dmonth%20period.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rule of 7</a>,\" which states that a prospective customer needs to be exposed to an advertiser's message seven times before they will take action.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This doesn't mean that if you send an email and don't get a response you should follow up six more times (please don't do that). But it does mean that a person will be more open to an email from you if they're somewhat familiar with your name.</p><p id=\"5dd4\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Play with ways to get your name in front of them before making that initial direct contact. Sharing their work on social media is one way to do this. If you have a blog, you can write a post that mentions how their work has positively affected you and then tag them on Twitter, thanking them for the inspiration. Get creative. Just don't do too many things at once, too close together, or you risk turning them off.</p><h2 id=\"eb5f\"><strong>Show them what their work has helped you achieve</strong></h2><p id=\"6fb5\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Successful people get a lot of fan mail and requests to chat. To help your email stand out, make it clear that you've been following their work for a while (instead of just gushing over the latest thing that went viral) and that it has impacted you in a specific way.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You can use the formula: \"Thanks to your work doing X, I've been able to accomplish Y.\"</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">I like to pull out a small detail from their work that has made my life easier. For instance, I've always admired the energy and sense of humor that&#160;<a href=\"https://okdork.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Noah Kagan</a>, the founder of&#160;<a href=\"https://appsumo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">AppSumo</a>, brings to his work. But instead of giving him this generic message, I recently let him know I was writing an article about something he had mentioned in passing on a podcast — his \"<a href=\"https://forge.medium.com/get-yourself-a-holy-shit-jar-6136ea18dbf8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Holy S--t Jar</a>\" — and asked him how I could best link to his work. We didn't automatically become best friends after that, but we do have plans to talk.</p><h2 id=\"e22d\"><strong>Before asking for a favor, think of how you can help them</strong></h2><p id=\"751c\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">To really forge a connection, it's important to let the person know that building a relationship with you would be mutually beneficial. Maybe that person is writing a book and you can be a part of their launch team. Or perhaps they're starting a business and your work as a designer can help them to create a more persuasive website. One of the best habits you can form is to ask yourself every day how you can make the lives of the people around you better.</p><p id=\"75c2\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This advice isn't foolproof — some people are busy, while others may not be prioritizing meeting new people at the moment. But keep at it. When you grow your network, you expand your world.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikethompsonblog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikethompsonblog&source=gmail&ust=1600877736032000&usg=AFQjCNFXurXpxSyJcm8BU1CviNUpKE2dswCviNUpKE2dsw\">Michael&#160;Thompson</a> is a career strategist who works with business professionals and entrepreneurs to open more doors and receive greater satisfaction from their work.

That long heritage shows through in all its products, which stand head and shoulders above the competition in terms of build quality, technology, and features. The company's newest model is the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fportable-power%2Fgoal-zero-yeti-3000x-portable-power-station%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Yeti 3000X</a>, which manages to extend that lead even further, particularly amongst power stations in the high-capacity segment.&#160;</p><p>At its core, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fportable-power%2Fgoal-zero-yeti-3000x-portable-power-station%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Yeti 3000X</a> is powered by a lithium-ion battery pack that offers more than 3000 watt-hours of capacity. That's enough juice to recharge a typical smartphone more than 250 times or a laptop more than 60 times. But this power station is versatile enough to go well beyond just recharging other devices. It also happens to be capable of powering appliances such as a microwave for up to three hours, a mini-refrigerator up to 87 hours, or a full-sized fridge for 55.&#160;</p><p>One of the features that sets the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fportable-power%2Fgoal-zero-yeti-3000x-portable-power-station%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Yeti 3000X</a> apart is Goal Zero's specially designed AC inverter. Capable of providing 2000 watts of power &#8212; with a surge up to 3500 watts &#8212; this component is what gives this power station the ability to run not charge my smartphone, laptop, or camera, but I could use it on appliances, lights, and even to power my TV. Other power stations include AC power outlets that allow these types of devices to be plugged into them, but very few have the battery capacity and power management to keep them running for extended periods of time.&#160;</p><p>In addition to sporting two standard AC power outlets, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fportable-power%2Fgoal-zero-yeti-3000x-portable-power-station%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Yeti 3000X</a> comes with plenty of other charging ports, too. Goal Zero ships this model with two standard USB-A ports, a USB-C port, and a USB-C PD (Power Delivery) port, which is also capable of charging a laptop or large tablet. It comes with a 12-volt car port and two 12-volt power pole ports, giving it the ability to power just about any kind of device imaginable, including construction tools like drills or saws.&#160;</p><p>The large lithium-ion batteries that give the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fportable-power%2Fgoal-zero-yeti-3000x-portable-power-station%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Yeti 3000X</a> such a high capacity also adds a considerable amount of weight. This power station weighs in at just over 69 pounds, which takes away from its portability to a degree. To counter this added bulk, it comes equipped with wheels, which does make it much easier to maneuver around the garage, backyard, or campsite if you don't mind hauling it in your car.</p><p>Those same high-capacity batteries also require a substantial amount of time to recharge. When plugged into a wall outlet, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fportable-power%2Fgoal-zero-yeti-3000x-portable-power-station%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Yeti 3000X</a> would often take up to 14 hours to replenish its onboard power supply. Using a solar panel to recharge the power station can help if you have one, though expect the recharge times to fluctuate wildly depending on the size of the panel and the amount of available sunlight.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fportable-power%2Fgoal-zero-yeti-3000x-portable-power-station%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Yeti 3000X</a> is built for those who not only need a portable power station with plenty of capacity, but also one that can survive in challenging environments. Built like a tank, this is a model that professionals can turn to when they need power at a job site, although it is equally useful in emergency situations around the home. Best of all, because it isn't powered by gas, it's completely silent and doesn't produce dangerous noxious fumes.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best mid-sized portable power station\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c6c5e69331a0011bc6758?format=jpeg\" alt=\"EcoFlow slide\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">EcoFlow</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Compact and lightweight, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083FR3762/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B083FR3762&#38;linkId=c782f80896d08a242c03fec268287d40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">EcoFlow Delta 1300</a> is a feature-packed portable power station that offers plenty of charging ports, including six AC wall outlets.</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Able to power up to 13 devices at once, still portable despite its 31-pound weight, recharges quickly<strong><br /></strong><strong>Cons:</strong> Power can drain rapidly when charging multiple devices</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083FR3762/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B083FR3762&#38;linkId=c782f80896d08a242c03fec268287d40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">EcoFlow Delta 1300</a> is my favorite power station when it comes to charging the most devices at once. All told, it comes equipped with no fewer than 13 individual ports, including two standard USB-A ports, two USB-A quick-charging ports, and a pair of 60-watt USB-C PD ports. Additionally, it features a 12-volt car port and six (yes, <em>six</em>) AC wall outlets, making it easy to keep a large number of gadgets and tools functioning at the same time.&#160;</p><p>Powering the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083FR3762/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B083FR3762&#38;linkId=c782f80896d08a242c03fec268287d40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Delta 1300</a> is a 1260 watt-hour battery, which pumps out enough juice to recharge smartphones and tablets dozens of times and extend the life of a laptop by nearly 24 hours. The 1800-watt AC outlets can also power a small refrigerator, an LCD TV, a toaster, and even a hairdryer. That gives this particular battery pack a level of versatility that you won't find in most other mid-range power stations &#8212; and made it a highly useful thing to pack on car camping trips.&#160;</p><p>Considering the size of its battery and the number of ports that it offers, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083FR3762/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B083FR3762&#38;linkId=c782f80896d08a242c03fec268287d40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Delta 1300</a> is surprisingly small. Compared to other power stations in this class, it's relatively compact, making it easier to carry around. A pair of integrated heavy-duty handles aid in that process, although its 31-pound weight will still likely give you pause when having to carry it too far.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind when using this power station is that because it can charge up to 13 individual devices at once, the battery occasionally runs out of juice fairly quickly. Thankfully, I didn't really have the need to recharge that many gadgets at once, although it was nice to know I could if needed. Thankfully, to help compensate for a potentially rapid power drain, EcoFlow gives the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083FR3762/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B083FR3762&#38;linkId=c782f80896d08a242c03fec268287d40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Delta 1300</a> the ability to recharge itself quite fast. When plugged into a power outlet, it would often regain around 80% of its power in about an hour and would fully recharge in a little more than 90 minutes.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083FR3762/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B083FR3762&#38;linkId=c782f80896d08a242c03fec268287d40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Delta 1300</a> is a bit pricier than other models with a similar capacity, though this is due, at least in part, to a large number of charging ports. If you don't need to power 13 devices at once, there are less expensive alternatives available. But if you're looking for the best all-around product, this is the one you'll want.</p>\n\tThe best small portable power station\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c702d6f5b310011724941?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Anker PowerHouse\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Walmart</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Sleek and small yet highly capable, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAnker-PowerHouse-Compact-400Wh-120000mAh-Portable-Outlet-Generator-Alternative-Rechargeable-Power-Source-Silent-DC-AC-Inverter-12V-Car-AC-USB-Outputs%2F605513371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Anker PowerHouse</a> offers a nice blend of features and functionality at a reasonable price point.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Small and compact yet still offers a good-sized battery, lightweight for a power station</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No USB-C ports</p><p>Well-known for its extensive line of battery packs for keeping smartphones charged, Anker also dipped its toe into the portable power station market.

This allows the power station to recharge a smartphone more than 40 times or a laptop as much as 15 times. It's also capable of powering a CPAP machine for several nights in a row, as well as running small appliances such as a mini-refrigerator or outdoor lighting system, for short periods of time.&#160;</p><p>Capable of charging multiple devices as once, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAnker-PowerHouse-Compact-400Wh-120000mAh-Portable-Outlet-Generator-Alternative-Rechargeable-Power-Source-Silent-DC-AC-Inverter-12V-Car-AC-USB-Outputs%2F605513371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">PowerHouse</a> features four USB-A ports, a 12-volt car port, and a 120-watt AC outlet. That is certainly enough power plugs to accommodate most situations, but the lack of USB-C ports is somewhat limiting. With more and more devices switching to the USB-C format, it's a shame this device doesn't have at least one or two.</p><p>With an aesthetic that somewhat resembles a kitchen appliance, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAnker-PowerHouse-Compact-400Wh-120000mAh-Portable-Outlet-Generator-Alternative-Rechargeable-Power-Source-Silent-DC-AC-Inverter-12V-Car-AC-USB-Outputs%2F605513371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">PowerHouse</a> has a clean, utilitarian design. This allows it to remain fairly inconspicuous when used around the house, although it remains durable enough to survive in the outdoors, too. Its built-in handle and 9.2-pound weight make it easy to carry, striking a good balance between durability and portability.&#160;</p><p>If you're looking for a solidly built power station that combines good battery life, plenty of ports, and an approachable price, Anker has you covered with the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAnker-PowerHouse-Compact-400Wh-120000mAh-Portable-Outlet-Generator-Alternative-Rechargeable-Power-Source-Silent-DC-AC-Inverter-12V-Car-AC-USB-Outputs%2F605513371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">PowerHouse</a>.

It offers a nice blend of features &#8212; including a built-in LCD screen for monitoring its use &#8212; in a package that's easy to transport. While it may not have a high-capacity battery or an over-abundance of charging ports, its $150 price tag more than makes up for those discrepancies.</p><p>Equipped with 167 watt-hour battery, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FYJVFNK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07FYJVFNK&#38;linkId=5828c345d3548fb4960abb7f6a6d4348\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Explorer 160</a> recharges an iPhone more than ten times or a large tablet as many as five. It even did well to extend the life of a laptop and power a digital camera and Bluetooth speaker. However, it isn't capable of running anything with a power draw of more than 100 watts, ruling out television sets, mini-fridges, and CPAP machines.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FYJVFNK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07FYJVFNK&#38;linkId=5828c345d3548fb4960abb7f6a6d4348\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Explorer 160</a> won't overwhelm you with a large number of charging ports either, although it certainly has enough to get the job done. It features two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and an AC wall outlet. This gives it the ability to charge up to four gadgets at once, which is decent considering its price point. That said, considering how widespread USB-C is becoming, I'd have liked to see another of those ports included.&#160;</p><p>Thanks to its low-capacity battery, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FYJVFNK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07FYJVFNK&#38;linkId=5828c345d3548fb4960abb7f6a6d4348\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Explorer 160</a> recharges very quickly, requiring just five hours to go from empty to completely filled. As an added plus, the power station can be charged via AC outlet,12-volt car port, or via solar panel. And while there may be times when you wish it had just a bit more capacity, its ease of charging mostly makes this a nonissue.&#160;</p><p>Other than its affordable price, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FYJVFNK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_081718_best-portable-power-station-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07FYJVFNK&#38;linkId=5828c345d3548fb4960abb7f6a6d4348\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Explorer 160</a>'s best feature is its size. It's extremely small and easy to carry, tipping the scales at just 3.8 pounds. This makes it a great choice for use around the house, while camping, or anywhere else you might need a bit of portable power. Its built-in handle makes it a breeze to take it along with you wherever you go, ensuring you always have an ample supply of energy to keep your gadgets running.&#160;</p>\n\tThe best portable power station for travel\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9c73e169331a0011bc678d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Goal Zero sherpa\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Goal Zero</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>With its surprisingly large battery pack, an array of charging options, and rugged construction, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fsherpa-power-banks-and-accessories%2Fsherpa-100ac-power-bank%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Sherpa 100AC</a> is a portable power station designed specifically with frequent travelers in mind.&#160;</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Perfect for travelers, multiple charge ports plus it supports wireless charging, highly portable</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Expensive, capacity can be an issue if it's the only battery/power source you rely on</p><p>When it comes to choosing the gear that they carry with them on the road frequent travelers, backpackers, and professional nomads are always looking to strike a balance between size, weight, and functionality. Fortunately for them, Goal Zero built a portable power solution that fits that criteria nicely, combining a sizable battery with a good number of ports in a rugged package built to survive just about anything.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fsherpa-power-banks-and-accessories%2Fsherpa-100ac-power-bank%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Sherpa 100AC</a> features a 94.7 watt-hour battery pack, which translates to 25,600 mAh. That's the highest capacity battery you're allowed to carry onto a flight, with enough juice to recharge a smartphone roughly 8 times or a laptop twice. Compared to other portable power stations that may not seem like a lot, but when you realize that this one can easily slip into a backpack, it's easy to realize its value.&#160;</p><p>Despite the fact it's relatively small and easy to carry, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fsherpa-power-banks-and-accessories%2Fsherpa-100ac-power-bank%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Sherpa 100AC</a> does have enough charging options to keep you functioning for an extended period of time. The line-up includes dual USB-A ports, as well as two 60-watt USB-C Power Delivery ports, which are bi-directional so they can be used to recharge the Sherpa, too.</p><p>Additionally, Goal Zero managed to squeeze in a small AC inverter for plugging in larger devices and the top of the battery pack has an integrated Qi wireless charging pad. If your phone supports wireless charging, you can simply place it on top of the battery pack, freeing up one of the ports for another device.&#160;</p><p>Additional features include a built-in OLED display for monitoring power usage and a special port for recharging the Sherpa via a solar panel. Keeping with the travel theme, Goal Zero also ships the power bank with four different charging cables, providing everything you need to say powered up on the road.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goalzero.com%2Fshop%2Fsherpa-power-banks-and-accessories%2Fsherpa-100ac-power-bank%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Sherpa AC100</a>'s main limiting factor is the size of its battery, which is on the small side if you plan to use it to recharge a laptop or other high-capacity devices on a regular basis. It also happens to be fairly expensive compared to battery packs with a similar capacity from other manufacturers. But where Goal Zero separates itself is with the exceptional build-quality and the components used the Sherpa's construction.</p><p>This is a power bank that feels like it could be run over by a car and keep functioning. However, this level of durability <em>does</em> result in a weight of about two pounds. That's quite svelte for a power station but on the hefty side for a power bank. If you don't mind the extra bulk, you'll get a power supply that's above and beyond anything else in its class.&#160;</p>\n\tHow to shop for a portable power station\n\t\n\t<p>When shopping for a portable power station, there are a number of factors to consider. First and foremost is the amount of power it can store, which is typically measured in watt-hours. The higher the number of watt-hours, the more energy you'll have at your disposal. For instance, a power station with a capacity of 150-watt hours can recharge a smartphone roughly 10 to 12 times. Meanwhile, a 1500 watt-hour battery pack will provide more than 120 recharges. <strong style=\"color: #222222;\">&#160;</strong></p><p>That said, in order to achieve a higher number of watt-hours, more power cells are required. That translates to a larger and heavier power station which reduces its level of portability. It also means that it takes significantly longer to recharge the battery pack, whether from a wall outlet or a solar panel. <strong style=\"color: #222222;\">&#160;</strong></p><p>The next thing you'll want to look for in a power station is the number &#8212; and type &#8212; of charging ports the power station offers. Not only will you want enough ports to accommodate all your devices, but you'll want a variety of ports, too. That includes USB-A, USB-C, and at least one AC wall outlet. Another common port is 12-volt power ports, like the so-called cigarette lighter outlets found in your car.</p><p>Many models come with built-in LCD screens that display the current power level, as well as how that power is being allocated to the various devices plugged into the charging ports. Some also offer a specialized port for connecting the power station to a solar panel, providing an alternative method of recharging while in the field. Others come equipped with built-in lights, which is an especially nice feature to have during an emergency situation.&#160;</p>\n\tCheck out our guide to the best battery packs you can

before they can welcome eager holiday shoppers, stores will have to survive Election Day.</p><p>An already contentious campaign season is projected to result in an unprecedented election, and retailers across the country are gearing up for another round of civil unrest in the aftermath.&#160;</p><p>Protests in the wake of George Floyd's killing in May saw over $1 billion in damages over a 13-day period from May 26 to June 8, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/riots-cost-property-damage-276c9bcc-a455-4067-b06a-66f9db4cea9c.html\">Axios</a> reported, the costliest in insurance

In Philadelphia, progressive groups are banding together to ensure a fair election process, and will stage protests if there appears to be any foul play, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/philadelphia-election-progressive-activists-working-families-party-philly-we-rise-20201022.html\">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a> reported.</p><p>The stakes are high, as the winner of the election will set the course for the US' recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and guide the country's reopening, as <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf\">12.6 million Americans remain unemployed</a>.</p><p>An influx of mail-in ballots this election cycle will likely delay the announcement of a winner on election night. That departure from Election Day norms is also setting up the country for uncertainty in the days following as the prospect of a contest election lingers and both parties prepare for a 2000-esque showdown to declare a winner.</p><h2>How retailers are preparing</h2><p>Already reeling from the effects of the pandemic combined with a summer of nationwide protests curtailing business, retailers are once again preparing for the worst as the country heads to the polls.</p><p>As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-30/shuttered-rodeo-drive-shows-retail-industry-s-election-day-worry?sref=p7zS9UoY\">Bloomberg</a> reported, the famed Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif., is going dark, and the entire street won't be accessible to pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Shopping districts in other major cities are staying open but implementing plans in case protesters resort to violence, looting, or vandalism.&#160;</p><p>Chicago's Magnificent Mile along Michigan Avenue will be armed with \"everything from snow plows to salt trucks\" to control crowds, Rich Gamble, chairman of the Magnificent Mile Association, told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-30/shuttered-rodeo-drive-shows-retail-industry-s-election-day-worry?sref=p7zS9UoY\">Bloomberg</a>.&#160;</p><p>Some stores are building fortifications as they prepare for the election and spending in the tens of thousands to do so. One industry's misfortune is another's time to shine as ServiceChannel, a broker of sorts for commercial construction work, has seen $20 million in invoices come across its platform for civil unrest claims, CEO Tom Buiocchi told <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2020/10/11/retailers-prepare-for-election-day--and-a-possible-new-wave-of-protests/?sh=7ae9cd3f6c0c\">Forbes</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Boarding up a storefront to withstand vandalism can cost up to $31,000, depending on the structure, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2020/10/11/retailers-prepare-for-election-day--and-a-possible-new-wave-of-protests/?sh=7ae9cd3f6c0c\">Forbes</a> reported. Unbreakable window glass, as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-30/shuttered-rodeo-drive-shows-retail-industry-s-election-day-worry?sref=p7zS9UoY\">Bloomberg</a> reported, is also in high demand with manufacturer Riot Glass turning away new clients to accommodate existing ones, according to CEO Brad Campbell.</p><p>That's why some businesses are picking and choosing which locations they'll protect, with flagship stores taking the highest priority for most.&#160;</p><p>The extent and duration of the unrest are still unknown as the country hasn't settled on a set end date for ballot counting and both sides will be angling for their candidate. In Portland, Ore., shops downtown are still boarded up as protests have continued for months.&#160;</p><h2>Walmart won't be pulling guns from its shelves, after all</h2><p>Walmart reversed a decision to remove firearms from its sales floors amid civil unrest less than one day after the policy was implemented, as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-returns-guns-and-ammo-to-store-floors-2020-10\">Business Insider's Mary Meisenzahl reported</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-removing-guns-ammo-from-shelves-displays-2020-10\">original announcement Thursday</a> to remove the weapons from stores followed the looting of a Philadelphia Walmart after protests in the city turned violent. The protests began after the death of Walter Wallace Jr., a 27-year-old Black man who police shot multiple times after responding to a call about a man with a knife.&#160;</p><p>Following the initial announcement, a Walmart spokesperson in a statement to Business Insider cited previous instances of civil unrest in justifying the policy change. Walmart had previously pulled guns from its shelves over the summer as protests gripped the nation following the police killing of George Floyd.</p><p>Walmart sells firearms in around 2,350 stores nationwide, and those seeking to purchase one could still do so under the new policy. Stores would shift to an on-request system, Meisenzahl reported, instead of displaying the merchandise on the sales floor.</p><p>In its statement quickly reversing the policy, Walmart cited the \"geographically isolated\" nature of the unrest.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/corporate-america-getting-ready-for-unrest-after-election-day-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/vo69ffn2mq8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 21:24:55 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f9c53ec6f5b310011724859?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4968427da91441178e57a30b6b82fe1a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_3/2020/10/31/07-26-07-490_a4d979e323b2c78d.webp","destWidth":2223,"destHeight":1666,"sourceBytes":202852,"destBytes":202852,"author":"tpallini@businessinsider.com (Thomas Pallini)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f9c53ec6f5b310011724859?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_3/2020/10/31/07-26-07-490_a4d979e323b2c78d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn81@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-35-995_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-28-503_f6360cf0a56eb1f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn56@2020_4/2020/10/31/07-26-31-976_9e6775a700156218.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn84@2020_1/2020/10/31/07-26-32-089_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vo69ffn2mq8:ri-ggRAeLAg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn74@2020_3/2020/10/31/07-26-38-957_79680e90178ce957.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/vo69ffn2mq8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn12@2020_6/2020/10/31/07-26-38-396_b76c930ab2e22e0e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1604129167128},{"createdTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:07","updatedTime":"2020-10-31 15:26:07","title":"Texas Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones could become the first Filipina-American elected to Congress","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/gina-ortiz-jones-texas-23rd-district-house-congressional-election-interview-2020-10","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f97bd3bf21803001222c207?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Gina-Ortiz-Jones\" height=\"1454\" width=\"2180\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Gina Ortiz Jones is the Democratic nominee for Texas&#39; 23rd Congressional district.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/Eric Gay, File</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Gina Ortiz Jones is the Democratic nominee for Texas' 23rd Congressional District, an expansive border district that is politically competitive.</li>\n<li>Jones first ran for the seat in 2018 and narrowly lost to Rep.

The initial results were so close that Jones <a href=\"https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/politics/article/Ortiz-Jones-attends-freshman-orientation-in-13392058.php\">even attended the House freshman orientation</a> for new members when the final tally was still in doubt days after the election.&#160;</p><p>In May 2019, Jones announced that she would run for the seat again.

What would your ideal plan look?</strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> I'm a proud first-generation American. I fully support a clean DREAM Act. [The act allows for conditional residency for qualifying immigrants who came to the US as minors and creates a pathway to citizenship if several requirements are fulfilled.] I live right down the street from the University of Texas at San Antonio, which has one of the largest student \"Dreamer\" populations in the entire country, and we should keep the promise that we made to these young people who are American in every sense of the word. They are our frontline workers, military officers, and teachers. I appreciate the vice president's commitment to immigration reform and that absolutely includes a path to citizenship.</p><p><strong>How would you tackle the issue of border security?</strong></p><p>This is a district that includes 800 miles of the US-Mexico border. I do not support a border wall. When I speak to leaders in our border communities, they do not want a border wall. They very much want infrastructure that helps strengthen those communities given the economic, social, and cultural ties between cities on this side of the border as well as cities on the Mexican side of the border.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f9affc269331a0011bc61c2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Big-Bend2\" height=\"3648\" width=\"4864\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An overlook of Chisos Basin in the Big Bend National Park in West Texas, near the US-Mexico border.\n<p class=\"copyright\">John Moore/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I will always listen to our border patrol and the experts. I was actually just in Del Rio [a border city in Val Verde County], where I met with the county sheriff and the mayor. They showed me exactly where fencing makes sense. However, there are also parts of the district like Big Bend [National Park], for example, where it would be a travesty to have a border wall running through that national treasure. We know that the vast majority of contraband comes through ports of entry, so I want to make sure that our agents have the resources to do their jobs and do so as safely as possible.</p><p><strong>If elected, what are some of your highest priorities for fighting the coronavirus?&#160;</strong></p><p>Over 800,000 Texans have gotten COVID-19, and now that's 800,000 folks that have a preexisting condition, if they didn't have one already. We know that more testing, contact tracing, and PPE [protective personal equipment] is critical to addressing this pandemic, along with ensuring that people have access to quality, affordable health care. <a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Bexar-leads-coronavirus-deaths-Texas-15517271.php#:~:text=Antonio's%20grim%20distinction-,The%20city%20has%20the%20highest%20COVID%2D19%20death,among%20Texas'%20major%20urban%20areas.&text=Bexar%20County%20has%20suffered%20more,to%20state%20and%20federal%20data.ata.\">San Antonio has the highest coronavirus-related fatality rate</a> of any major urban area in Texas. It's just critical that we get this pandemic under control so that we're not needlessly losing lives and needlessly losing small businesses and jobs.</p><p><strong>What are the top issues that you hear from rural Texans when campaigning?</strong></p><p>The issues that I hear about are in this order: Health care, health care, and health care. I'm committed to making sure that people have coverage by expanding Medicaid so that they can show up to these rural clinics and hospitals and get the preventative care that they need. It's critical that we invest in broadband, which helps address these inequities with telemedicine and tele-psychiatry. We also need more doctors. Even if every rural medical who student graduated from medical school and returned to a rural community, we're still only meeting 25% of our country's rural health care needs.</p><p><strong>How would you tackle the rising cost of college tuition?</strong></p><p>We're seeing a large number of students not reenrolling in community college here in San Antonio. That's a critical issue, because at two large universities in the city, Texas A&#38;M University-San Antonio and the University of Texas at San Antonio, almost half of the student body spends time at the community college here. If folks aren't reenrolling now because they don't have an internet connection or can't pay their tuition, that'll hurt us down the line. We have the resources as a country to make sure that we're preparing our young people for future economic opportunities, and that starts with investing in community colleges and supporting our colleges and universities.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/gina-ortiz-jones-texas-23rd-district-house-congressional-election-interview-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1Q42htln3ds:YogIE8GbcMw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1Q42htln3ds:YogIE8GbcMw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1Q42htln3ds:YogIE8GbcMw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1Q42htln3ds:YogIE8GbcMw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1Q42htln3ds:YogIE8GbcMw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1Q42htln3ds:YogIE8GbcMw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1Q42htln3ds:YogIE8GbcMw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1Q42htln3ds:YogIE8GbcMw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/1Q42htln3ds\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 21:47:10 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f97bd714743a3001216bcfc?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"9b6447333e2858f490a8a8d927455940","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_5/2020/10/31/07-26-27-015_0c627499984bcc71.webp","destWidth":1938,"destHeight":1453,"sourceBytes":91260,"destBytes":91260,"author":"insider@insider.com (John L.

In fact, as a part of a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-home-gym\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home gym setup</a>, an exercise ball has the ability to greatly improve one's core strength while also helping hone balance and flexibility.</p><p>Whether it accompanies <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/work-from-home-workout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a daily workout routine</a> or becomes the central focal point, an exercise ball can be an important part of anyone's plan to keep fit and healthy — they even make for a suitable office chair substitute.&#160;</p><h2>Exercise balls are an important part of any home gym</h2><p>Despite their inherent value, exercise balls aren't typically the first piece of gear you think of when piecing together a home gym. The truth is in the application, however, as&#160;they work for a host of exercises requiring flexible support. Even though an exercise ball is round, it gives you a base that's more solid than you might think and provides impressive stability.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The balls compress when weight is put on them to create a flatter, more stable edge. It won't be as stable as a normal chair but it's far more solid than you'd expect — which is what makes them great for everything from active seating to working out.</p><p>To find the best exercise balls worth using, I tested an assortment of models from brands like TheraBand, DynaPro, and Wacces. The goal was to find exercise balls that fit a variety of use cases, like being able to be taken on the road, or those that are constructed of a thicker material that increases its durability.</p><p>After spending the last several months using exercise balls as both my office chair and main workout partner, I narrowed the list down to my four favorites listed below.

As these muscles strengthen, your overall balance improves.</li><li><strong>Core strength: </strong>Athletes constantly talk about the importance of having core strength in the body, as it gives you great balance and coordination. Using an exercise ball increases core strength.</li><li><strong>Muscle work: </strong>Because you have to continually adjust your weight slightly to maintain your balance on the ball, you'll be using different muscle groups, which benefits your whole body.</li><li><strong>Rehabilitation and flexibility: </strong>You'll stretch muscles and joints while moving around. Physical therapists sometimes assign a set of exercises using an exercise ball for people to follow as part of rehabilitating a specific joint or muscle group to gain more range of motion.</li><li><strong>Specific exercises: </strong>If you enjoy exercises like Pilates or yoga, you'll gain some additional benefits by <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/best-at-home-exercise-ball-routines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">incorporating an exercise ball into the routine</a>.</li><li><strong>Spinal support: </strong>The way the body and exercise ball interact relieves pressure on the spine when you are sitting on the ball. To use the ball properly, you will need good posture, which also will help your spine and will alleviate back pain.</li></ul><h3>Exercise ball features</h3><p>Yes, an exercise ball is a simple, large round ball that looks like every other exercise ball at first glance. There are still several key differences you can pay attention to when looking to find the right exercise ball to meet your needs.</p><ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 30px; font-family: Georgia,Times,sans-serif;\"><li><strong>Adding air: </strong>Some exercise balls include an air pump, however, most of these pumps work very slowly. If you want a faster option, you should be able to use almost any type of pump to inflate your exercise ball, such as an air mattress pump, a bicycle tire pump, or even an air compressor. To determine when the ball is properly filled with air, measure its diameter.</li><li><strong>Extras: </strong>Depending on the model of exercise ball you pick, you may find the ball ships with an air pump, exercise bands, a stability ring, stability legs, a measuring tape, an exercise tip guide, or handles built into the ball.&#160;</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>The size of a stability ball is determined by its diameter. Common sizes of exercise balls range from 45 cm to 85 cm in 10 cm intervals. (Ten centimeters is roughly 4 inches.) People shorter than 5 feet will have the best results with sitting on a 45 cm ball, 6-feet-tall people will want a 65 cm ball, and those 6-foot-8 and taller will want an 85 cm ball.&#160;</li><li><strong>Supported weight: </strong>Exercise balls should offer supported weight limits for static weight and body weight. Static weight refers to the weight the ball supports without bursting when the user is not moving. Bodyweight refers to the weight it can support when the user is exercising. High-end balls may support static weight limits of 2,200 pounds and body weights of 500 pounds.

students can brainstorm over virtual tools like Zoom, and schools can break up the duties so that children can work on projects individually.</li>\n<li>But the end-of-season competitions will be more difficult to recreate in the era of COVID-19, says Erica Newton Fessia, FIRST's vice president of global field operations.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>In Missouri's Camdenton R-III School District, three to five elementary school students would usually share a single robot kit when working on their projects for FIRST.</p><p>FIRST is the global STEM education program designed for elementary, middle, and high schools in which students build robots, program them to complete missions, and showcase their creations in an end-of-season competition. Nearly 700,000 students in about 110 countries participated in its 2019-2020 season. The organization counts industry giants such as 3M, Apple, Google, Ford, Kleiner Perkins, and Qualcomm among its <a href=\"https://www.firstinspires.org/about/our-supporters/founding-and-strategic-sponsors\">strategic partners.</a></p><p>But 2020 isn't like any other school year. Instead, kits in Camdenton are being separated into Rubbermaid containers so that they can be distributed to individual students, allowing them to each work on their own robot rather than sharing parts with their teammates.</p><p>When students are working together in person, they're wearing masks anytime they're in close proximity. Brainstorming sometimes occurs over virtual video chatting platforms.</p><p>Right now, students in the Camdenton district are attending school in person, but Sherry Comer, the after-school services director for the distric, and the rest of the faculty and staff are prepared for that to change at any minute.</p><p>\"It's definitely changed the scope of how we do things on a regular basis,\" Comer said to Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>This is what it's like to run an after-school program in the fall of 2020, when the looming threat of COVID-19 has forced teachers, administrators, and organizations running extracurricular programs like FIRST to rethink their approach to education.&#160;</p><p>For FIRST, which stands for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, the key to keeping its 2020-2021 programs going is in providing guidance that schools can follow whether students are in the classroom or in front of a screen at home, since schools' in-person attendance varies by region.&#160;</p><p>The approach that Comer described, dividing the robotics kit among students, is one example of putting these guidelines into practice. FIRST is also moving entirely to remote gameplay for its 2021 FIRST Robotics Competition season, which starts in January.</p><p>\"Each season we give our student participants the challenge to solve a problem with creative solutions and innovation,\" Erica Newton Fessia, vice president of global field operations for FIRST, said in an interview with Business Insider. \"And so we're now doing what we ask our students to do every season.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6b587939ab3b001192c891?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FIRST camdenton laser 2 (1)\" height=\"2016\" width=\"1512\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nick, a junior in Camdenton&#39;s school district, works on his robotics project for the FIRST Robotics Competition.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Sherry Comer</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The early stages of robotics projects that mostly involve brainstorming and talking through ideas translate well to remote environments, Fessia said, since many students are already used to using video chat platforms for remote learning.&#160;</p><p>Although FIRST is a robotics program and competition, not every aspect of its projects involve programming or building robots. The program also tasks students&#160; with raising funds for their team and coming up with a plan for their project as well as designing and marketing their team brand. And some of those elements are much more suited to remote, virtual collaboration.</p><p>\"In essence, we're really walking them through what it is to be a small robotics startup,\" said Fessia, who was previously director of global philanthropy at Qualcomm before joining FIRST. \"And so they're learning so much more than just how to build a robot.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Scorpius 6 - FLL Team 44266  (@theEclecTechHs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1261339249640706048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>It's the hands-on portion of the program that has changed the most, Fessia said. Instead of students coming together as a team to unpack their kits and build robots together, they may be splitting up the work individually, similar to the scenario Comer, in Camdenton, described.</p><p>For example, one solution could involve breaking up challenges — which usually consist of multiple missions that students must program their robots to complete — by distributing specific missions to each student.</p><p>Or students may come together in smaller, socially distanced groups rather than gathering as a whole team, Fessia said.</p><p>In Comer's district, each child works on his or her own robot and then combines all of their work to run all of their missions as one team. Even though the children may be working together differently, Comer says they're still learning the core collaboration and communication skills that will help them in their future careers.</p><p>\"Technical skills are fairly easy to reproduce and teach,\" Comer said. \"But sometimes those skills of just being able to sit down with a group of people, come up with a common goal, and work toward that goal is really hard.\"</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Robo Bears FLL #30898  (@R30898) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1300595519715192833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 1, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>Another challenge for FIRST will be recreating the usual end-of-season competition in which students get to show off their work. When the end of last season was disrupted because of COVID-19, FIRST created a digital showcase so that students could still demonstrate their robots and share their learnings and discoveries, Fessia said.</p><p>This season, FIRST has pushed the championship back to summer 2021 to allow for more flexibility when scheduling events given the uncertainly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. FIRST also <a href=\"https://www.firstinspires.org/community/inspire/update-2021-first-robotics-competition-season\">announced last month</a> that this season would include new challenges to the FIRST Robotics Competition that focus on remote learning and building.&#160;</p><p>Although it usually introduces a completely new theme and series of challenges each year, Fessia said that FIRST is using many of the same challenges as it did last year, since the shift to remote learning in March left many US students unable to compete with their robots.</p><p>Despite the disruptions, students still learned to address real-world problems when the coronavirus outbreak suddenly interrupted daily life in March and April. Some students in <a href=\"https://foxsanantonio.com/news/nation-world/camas-high-school-robotics-team-makes-ppe-for-healthcare-workers\">Washington</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whmi.com/news/article/first-howell-brighton-fowlerville-hartland-robotics\">Michigan</a>, for example, pivoted their efforts toward making personal protective equipment for frontline medical workers in the pandemic's early days.&#160;</p><p>The goal of FIRST has always been to prepare students for whatever career path they choose, whether it be in STEM or another field. And that may hold truer than ever during the pandemic.</p><p>\"They're adapting the way they do the work and the way they learn in a way that is going to prepare them for the future,\" Fessia said. \"So in many respects, they're still having that same real world experience that adults are having.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The business was created after most of my own close friends had gotten married, and I'd became the perpetual bridesmaid, and did my duties well — so well, in fact, that distant friends asked me to take on the role for them, which made me flirt with the question, \"If I can be a great bridesmaid for people I'm hardly friends with anymore, couldn't I get paid to do it for strangers?\"</p><p>Six years later, that idea has flourished as a business and has made me an undercover member of bridal parties all over the country. I've worked with hundreds of clients, seen all kinds of drama, and experienced so many different personality types.</p><p>But the main service I offer, at its core, is supportive friendship to a person getting married. And one of the lessons I've had to learn the hard way in this unique business is what I should do when the wedding ends.</p><h2>How do I let the client know the gig is over and so is our relationship?</h2><p>How do I ask a client to stay friends even after my bridesmaid dress for that wedding is retired? What do I do when a client tells me they don't want to be my friend, but I imagined having a real-life friendship with them?</p><p>Those are the real questions I face on a weekly basis, and have had to find different ways to handle.</p><p>If you've ever wondered how my business works in the sense of staying friends with people after our contract ends, here are the four main scenarios I've come across, and how I've dealt with them.&#160;</p><h2><strong>In some cases, a continued friendship isn't possible</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/57ea81608ceb955c40f3ee03?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jen Glantz\" height=\"800\" width=\"1067\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Glantz has a fake identity at some of the weddings she works, which makes keeping up a real friendship difficult.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Jen Glantz</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>One part of my job that makes a post-wedding friendship complicated is that when some clients hire me, I have a fake identity. We decide on a fake name and back story so that nobody in their life (including their fiancé) will know that they hired me. Because of that, seeing them when the wedding ends can be a bit complicated because I'd have to still take on that fake identity.</p><p>Pretending to be someone else is easy at a wedding, because there's a lot going on around you that can serve as easy distractions when people start to make small talk or ask questions. If someone asks me how I know the bride, I share a prepared, one-sentence answer and change the subject to ask if they know if the bar is open yet or if they've tried the shrimp appetizer. In real life, that might be more difficult.</p><p>In those situations, where my identity is fabricated, the person hiring me usually has the expectation that after the wedding, I will disappear and we won't talk again. Rarely, in those cases, will the bride or groom reach out to catch up in the future. But it has happened a few times, and we'll usually just have a quick chat over text.</p><h2><strong>Sometimes, I just don't want to be their friend.&#160;</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f11a5403ad861163c73c459?format=jpeg\" alt=\"At some weddings, Jen is happy to have it be over so she never has to see the person who hired her again. Courtesy of Jen Glantz\" height=\"901\" width=\"1202\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>After some weddings, Glantz feels happy it&#39;s over because she&#39;ll never have to see the bride again.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Glantz</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>Just like at any job, there are people you work with that you adore, and people you work with that you don't want to be friends with outside of work. Some clients are just not people I'd be friends with in real life, and usually that's because their personality or negative character traits don't align with my personal values.</p><p>When this happens and they do reach out post-wedding, I usually let them know that I'm glad we had the chance to work together, but I'm not interested in continuing the friendship. I keep it professional and am genuinely kind to them during the job and afterward. I just don't accept extended invitations to remain friends when I know that person isn't someone I necessarily want to be around for fun.</p><h2><strong>Most of the time, we stay in touch occasionally</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f11a5773ad861166e70e8f2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"In most cases, Jen stays casual friends with her clients. Courtesy of Jen Glantz\" height=\"1024\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>In many cases, Glantz stays casual acquaintances with her clients.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Jen Glantz</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>The most common scenario is that when the wedding ends, the person who hired me stays an acquaintance, which means that we catch up occasionally over the phone but don't get together and hang out. Sometimes we do cross paths again and see each other at events around New York City, and we say hello and chat in-person.</p><p>To some people, this part sounds weird because I was hired to be there for them on their big day and am in their wedding pictures. But it's part of the job to leave most of the relationship behind at the wedding. That's why in most cases, I do stay friendly with my clients, but not at a level where we meet up or talk constantly.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Now and then, we stay good friends</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f11a73f3ad86116b24eae3b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jen Glantz\" height=\"2448\" width=\"3264\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Some of these working relationships have evolved into hanging out and even spending special occasions together as real friends.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Jen Glantz</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Out of the 50+ clients I work with every year, I stay good friends with around three to four of them. These are the people that when the wedding ends, I'm eager to ask them if they want to hang out afterward. Sometimes I ask and they decline, but occasionally some do say yes and we become good friends. It does get complicated for the brides who hired me under a false identity, and in those cases we usually just hang out one on one. But for the ones who were open and honest about hiring me, our friendship has evolved into nights out and special occasions spent together as real friends.</p><p>I'm planning on getting married in 2021 and will invite some of those people to my own wedding. I'm excited to bring the best part of my job full-circle, and invite those people who were once strangers to join in celebrating my own big day.&#160;</p><section><p><em>Jen Glantz is the founder of

If you do choose a hotel, make sure to select one with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hotel-precautions-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stringent new policies in place</a>.</p><p>Additionally, without a vaccine, there is no firm guarantee with regard to safety. It's crucial to follow guidelines and advice from organizations such as the CDC and WHO, and practice safety measures including wearing a mask, washing your hands, and maintaining social distancing. Also consider your own level of risk, and whether you're traveling from or to a hotspot, so as not to increase the rate of infection.</p><p>As such, we kept safety top of mind while rounding up our favorite rock-inspired homes and note COVID-19 safety protocols for each listing below.&#160;&#160;</p><p>When choosing cave hotels and rentals, we considered the following criteria:</p><ol><li><strong>While international travel is still on pause with the ongoing pandemic, we kept our search limited to the US.</strong></li><li><strong>Not every accommodation on this list is an actual underground cave, but those that aren't still boast a cave-like experience with stone exteriors and rock-themed interiors.</strong></li><li><strong>Sleeping under a rock is about disconnecting from the rest of the world, not being uncomfortable. Each cave has suitable amenities, beds, and access to a bathroom with running water.</strong></li><li><strong>It takes a lot of labor and calculation to turn a hole in the ground into a livable and structurally-sound environment for guests, which factors into the cost.

My room is small but has great light and most of my home goods purchases aim to maximize that. <a href=\"https://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parachutehome.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Parachute</a>, with its light tones and easy draping, has a light-handed way of making every room look a little more laid-back and sun-drenched. The products are designed in Venice Beach, and their effortless construction is reminiscent of that.</p><p>In terms of feel, the <a href=\"https://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parachutehome.com%2Fproducts%2Fpercale-venice-set%3Fopt-color-sheet%3Dwhite%26opt-size%3Dqueen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Percale</a> was crisp and crinkly like a white button-down. The Percale is best for those who get hot at night since the fabric is lightweight, breathable, and cool to the touch. It's made from 100% long-staple Egyptian cotton.&#160;</p><p>On my bed, it looked clean and comfortable, but it was slightly softer (and perhaps a bit thinner) out of the box than sheets I've tried at a similar price point. This is probably due to the fact that when you come into contact with Parachute bedding, you're interacting with the materials in their natural form, without being treated by toxic materials.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parachutehome.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Parachute</a> is Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified, which means its products are not made with harmful chemicals and synthetics. Most importantly, it doesn't artificially soften their fabrics. The <a href=\"https://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parachutehome.com%2Fproducts%2Fpercale-venice-set%3Fopt-color-sheet%3Dwhite%26opt-size%3Dqueen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Percale sheets</a>, for instance, are stonewashed for comfort, which uses (you guessed it) large stones to roughen up fabric in order to increase softness and flexibility.&#160;</p><p>This natural take, however, means that their sheets may be more susceptible to chemicals. <a href=\"http://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.parachutehome.com%2Fhow-to-care-for-bedding%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">The company advises</a> you to stay away from harsh liquid and powdered detergents, fabric softeners, dryer sheets, and bleaching agents because they coat and weaken natural fibers. You'll want to keep the bedding away from household cleaners and personal care products that contain benzoyl peroxide or alpha hydroxy acids to prevent any color change. If you have a face or body cream that works on regulating the clarity of your skin, check the ingredients before buying a set.&#160;&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parachutehome.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Parachute</a>'s design plan also makes my life a little easier. Pillowcases have an envelope-close so my pillow doesn't slide out of one end during the night, and the duvet covers have a button closure and twill ties in all four corners, plus an added fabric flap to smooth out the texture of the corners. &#160;</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>All in all,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parachutehome.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Parachute</a>'s quality is pretty stellar across the board. My experience with its <a href=\"https://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parachutehome.com%2Fproducts%2Fpercale-venice-set%3Fopt-color-sheet%3Dwhite%26opt-size%3Dqueen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Percale Venice Sheet Set</a> means I'll likely be coming back for a <a href=\"https://www.pntrs.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parachutehome.com%2Fproducts%2Fsateen-sheet-set%3Fopt-color-sheet%3Dwhite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Sateen set</a> in the near future, or to check out the <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/TUJGRUxJR0JGSEhLR01CRkhKTk1H?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.parachutehome.com%2Fproducts%2Fclassic-bathrobe%3Fopt-color%3Dwhite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">bathrobe</a> that has generated <a href=\"https://www.racked.com/2016/11/3/13495284/perfect-cotton-terry-bathrobe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">so much buzz online</a>. If you're looking for a pair of soft, chemical-free sheets that you can feel good about sleeping on, I highly recommend checking out Parachute. And if you don't love them as much as I did, you have 60-days to make up your mind and send them back.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5e582b5efee23d28f3141334\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5e582b5efee23d28f3141334&type=small&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;

You might be skeptical, but trust me: The LectroFan's fan sounds are actually the most calming ambient noise I have ever heard. (For more traditional users, it plays 10 levels of white noise as well).

One method at their disposal is to issue bonds.</p><p>A corporate bond, like any bond, is basically a type of debt. The purchaser of a corporate bond effectively lends cash to the issuing company. In exchange, the company becomes obligated to pay interest on this principal sum and to return it in full after a set period,&#160; when the bond matures.</p><p>For investors, corporate bonds offer a source of income — one that's more reliable than stock dividends, since the interest payments are usually fixed, and more lucrative than ultra-safe-but stolid US Treasury bonds. Of course, in the investment world, there's always a tradeoff between risk and reward. And the reliability of corporate bonds can vary, depending on the company issuing them.</p><h2>What is a corporate bond?</h2><p>The main purpose of corporate bonds is to help companies raise additional cash, without having to borrow from a bank, sell equity — that is, issue more stock shares —&#160; or seek out venture capitalists.&#160;</p><p>\"Companies issue bonds to raise cash to bolster their balance sheets or re-invest in a particular project or expansion plan, \" says Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at <a href=\"https://www.hl.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hargreaves Lansdow</a>. \"Investors who buy corporate bonds are lending money to the company, in the same way as investors who buy government bonds like US Treasuries or UK Gilts are lending money to governments to finance public spending.\"</p><p>Bondholders are entitled to two sources of income:</p><ul><li>The regular interest installments, usually paid annually or semi-annually. Most bonds pay a fixed interest rate, but variable-rate, or floating, bonds exist too. These are usually based on a benchmark, such as a bond index or prevailing Treasury rate.</li><li>A full repayment of the principal after the bond's term ends. Corporate bonds generally have maturities from three years to 10, though they can be shorter or longer.</li></ul><p>After they're issued, corporate bonds trade on stock exchanges, in the secondary <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bond markets</a>. Investors can always choose to sell a bond at market price before it matures. This move may be profitable if interest rates, in general, have declined since the bond was issued: A fall in interest rates sparks a rise in bond prices — because that bond is paying a now higher-that-average rate.</p><h2>How are corporate bonds evaluated?</h2><p>In terms of risk, corporate bonds are not all created equal. Much depends on the company issuing them — specifically, on its creditworthiness (the soundness of its finances and ability to pay its debts). This is expressed by its credit rating, something akin to an individual's credit score.</p><p>Corporate credit ratings are provided by the three major credit rating agencies: Moody's, Fitch, and S&#38;P. The rating systems used by these independent firms differ from each other slightly, but they all use letter grades:</p><ul><li>A ratings are assigned to companies deemed to be subject to the lowest level of credit risk</li><li>B ratings usually indicate some moderate credit risk</li><li>C ratings indicate very high credit risk</li><li>D ratings are reserved for companies in default, or bankrupt</li></ul><p>Any bond rated BBB (for Fitch and S&#38;P) or Baa (for Moody's) or above is considered \"investment-grade,\" which — as the name implies — indicates the most suitable choice for investors.&#160;</p><p>In contrast, any corporate bond with a rating below BBB (for Fitch and S&#38;P) or Baa (for Moody's) is classified as \"non-investment grade.\" This doesn't mean they're off-limits to investors, just that they're higher-risk — and so they pay higher interest. Officially, they're called \"high-yield bonds\" — or, more colloquially, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-junk-bonds?r=US&IR=TIR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">junk bonds</a>.&#160;</p><h2>Why invest in a corporate bond?</h2><p>Corporate bonds have a variety of advantages, including:</p><h3>They're a good source of income</h3><p>&#160;\"Corporate bonds traditionally offer very attractive yields because they carry more credit risk than government bonds,\" says Edward Moya, a market analyst with New-York based forex broker OANDA.</p><p>But then, just about everything does, since government bonds are considered virtually risk-free. \"Corporate bonds which have attracted a high-quality rating are viewed as a relatively safe investment,\" says Susannah Streeter.</p><p>While average yields will vary according to the economic cycle, investment-grade corporate bonds usually offer rates that are two to three percentage points higher than <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-treasury-bonds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US Treasury bonds</a>. For example, Intel and Coca-Cola — two companies with an A1 rating — are paying a 4% and 3.25% rate on bonds that mature in 2022 and 2024, respectively.</p><p>The difference <a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2004/january/corporate-treasury-bonds-interest-rates-risk-spreads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tends to grow during downturns and shrink during expansions</a>&#160;when Treasuries have to offer higher rates to attract buyers.</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><iframe title=\"Corporate bonds move in tandem with government bonds, but consistently pay higher interest\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-kfSVT\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kfSVT/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% ; border: none;\" height=\"400\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();</script></div><h3>They diversify your portfolio</h3><p>Corporate bonds can help investors diversify their holdings. Debt instruments like bonds often act as a counterbalance to equities, moving opposite to stocks.</p><p>\"Many investors want to build a balanced portfolio. Including bonds can offset the higher risk of buying shares in companies with ambitious growth strategies,\" Streeter says.</p><h3>They can offer capital gains</h3><p>While corporate bonds are basically an<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investment-income-assets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> income investment</a>, it's still possible for investors to speculate with them. Given that bond prices can fluctuate depending on the interest rates and economic conditions, corporate bonds can present opportunities for profit during volatile periods.</p><p>This is particularly true of junk bonds, which <a href=\"https://www.alliancebernstein.com/abcom/perspectives_web/market/retail/equity-like-returns/equity-like-returns-whitepaper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have historically behaved more like equities than low-risk corporate bonds</a>. The correlation between junk bonds and equities even increased since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, buoyed by <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/federal-reserve-emergency-corporate-bond-etf-purchases-coronavirus-policy-economy-2020-5-1029191923?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest#est#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Federal Reserve's commitment to buy corporate bonds</a>.</p><p>Of course, you have to time the selling of your bonds carefully and be ready to move fast when prices rise.</p><h2>Risks associated with corporate bonds</h2><p>Where there's reward, there's also risk, and corporate bonds are no exception.&#160;</p><h3>Credit risk: The company could default</h3><p>Credit or default risk relates to the possibility that a company may get into financial straits, impairing its ability to make its interest payments — and even the principal on its bond. \"Should a company go bust, bond investors may lose money,\" says Streeter. \"However, even bankrupt firms must pay creditors, including bondholders first, before reimbursing investors who hold the company's shares,\" she adds.</p><h3>Call risk: You could lose the bond</h3><p>Some corporate bonds include a call provision, which provides the company with the ability to repurchase, or \"call,\" the bonds at face value before maturity. This is particularly risky for investors in situations where interest rates have fallen and market prices for bonds have risen since it would deprive them of the ability to make a profit from selling their bonds on the open market. And of course, you lose the interest from the bond, and may not be able to find another with an equally good rate.</p><h3>Liquidity risk: You could find it hard to sell</h3><p>The bond market has historically lacked the pricing transparency of the stock market. This is more of a problem for bonds issued by private companies or smaller firms that trade over the counter. Investment-grade bonds issued by bigger companies are less likely to run into this issue.</p><h3>Interest/inflation risk: The bond loses value</h3><p>This is a systematic risk that's faced by every fixed-interest bond: Potential interest rate rises will cause the market value of bonds to fall. There's also the problem of inflation, which could erode the value of interest payments and the face value of a bond reaching maturity.&#160;</p><p>Generally, the longer the bond's maturity, the greater its vulnerability to these risks; that's why longer-term bonds pay a bigger interest rate.</p><h2>How to buy corporate bonds</h2><p>There are two ways to buy corporate bonds.</p><ul><li><strong>Individual bonds: </strong>Corporate bonds are issued and sold in blocks of $1,000. Individual investors can buy them through Investment platforms, brokers, and financial services companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, and E*TRADE, which charge fees of anything from $1 to $2 per bond. Banks such as Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley also let you buy individual bonds, although these generally charge higher fees.</li><li><strong>Bond funds:</strong> \"Most investors buy a corporate bond fund, as this spreads risk and allows lower investment entry amounts,\" says Susannah Streeter. Bond funds can be either mutual funds, like the Payden Corporate Bond Fund (<a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/funds/payden-corporate-bond-fund-us7043293668\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PYACX</a>), or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), like the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corp Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/etfs/ishares-iboxx-investment-grade-corporate-bond-etf-us4642872422\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LQD</a>).</li></ul><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>The main attraction of corporate bonds is that they offer a safe income stream, assuming that the companies issuing them have high credit ratings. Corporate bonds offer higher returns than you'll likely find with government bonds.&#160;</p><p>They can be also used by less risk-averse investors to speculate, with falls in interest rates tending to increase bond prices. Such strategies come with a number of dangers, chief amongst them being the risk that interest rate rises will depress bond prices.&#160;</p><p>There's also the omnipresent risk of default, which would deprive bondholders of interest payments and potentially their entire investment.</p><p>These caveats aside, corporate bonds (and bond funds) can serve as key elements in a diversified portfolio — provided you know which ones to pick.</p><h2>Related Coverage in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Investing</a>:</h2><h3><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/corporate-bond-sales-reach-trillion-fastest-pace-ever-debt-market-2020-5-1029258342\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">US corporate bond sales surge past the $1 trillion threshold at the fastest pace ever</a></h3><h3><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/federal-reserve-corporate-debt-index-top-beneficiaries-purchases-companies-bonds-2020-6-1029351621#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here are the 10 companies set to benefit the most from the Fed's debt purchases</a></h3><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bonds-vs-cds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-position=\"8\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Bonds vs. CDs: The key differences and how to decide which income-producing option is better for you</a></h3><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-an-etn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-position=\"15\" data-analytics-module=\"\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">ETNs combine a bond's reliability with a stock's profitability.

Since 2013, Amazon has relied on the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Southern Poverty Law Center to help us make these determinations.\"</p><h2>The National Vaccine Information Center is a huge source of anti-vaccination sentiment in the US&#160;</h2><p>The NVIC is \"one of the most prominent organizations that has been against vaccines of any kind,\" K. \"Vish\" Viswanath, a professor of health communication at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told Insider. \"The fact that one of the most prominent, richest, successful companies is actually funding them is shocking.\"&#160;</p><p>The non-profit organization \"campaigns against legislation encouraging or mandating vaccines,\" Popular Information reported.&#160;</p><p>According to the group's website, the NVIC is \"dedicated to preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education and advocating for informed consent protections in medical policies and public health laws.\" Barbara Loe Fisher, the NVIC president whom Viswanath said is the nation's most visible spokesperson for \"spreading anti-vaccine sentiment,\" co-founded the group in 1982.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Despite their similar names, the NVIC is unaffiliated with the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/vaccines/about/index.html\">National Vaccine Program Office of the US Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS). The \"innocuous\" name of the group is \"very intentional,\" Viswanath said, as it makes the group appear more credible than it is.&#160;</p><p>\"They're very sophisticated in the way they cast seeds of doubt — doubts of vaccines, the effectiveness of vaccines, and the safety of vaccines,\" Viswanath said.&#160;</p><p>That sophistication is evident on the group's website, where a landing page called \"Introduction to Autism Information\" frames the debunked myth that vaccines cause autism as a \"debate.\" There is <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html\">no link</a> between vaccines of any kind of developmental disability.&#160;</p><p>Viswanath said that while Amazon may not have realized the group's true purpose, it's up to the company to take stock of organizations receiving money through AmazonSmile.&#160;\"They have to realize that they are funding an organization that is anti-public health and anti-science,\" he said. \"It's a question of values that they want to espouse as a company.\"</p><h2>It's not Amazon's first brush with criticism over appearing to support anti-vaccination&#160;</h2><p>AmazonSmile also partners with other anti-vaccination groups, Popular Information reported, including the Children's Health Defense and the Informed Consent Action Network, both of which have shared COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/coronavirus-covid-19/most-notorious-anti-vax-groups-use-facebook-lay-groundwork-against-novel\">according to Media Matters for America (MMFA)</a>, the progressive media watchdog.&#160;</p><p>In March 2019, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California pressured Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to stop facilitating the spread of vaccine misinformation through anti-vaccination books available on Amazon, The Verge <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18246461/amazon-anti-vaccination-vaxx-books-films-vaccines-media-schiff-letter\">reported</a>.&#160;</p><p>\"Every online platform, including Amazon, must act responsibly and ensure that they do not contribute to this growing public-health catastrophe,\" Schiff wrote Bezos in a letter, one year before misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic would begin to threaten every social platform.&#160;</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-every-tech-company-social-media-platform-handling-qanon-2020-10\">other tech companies like Facebook</a> have announced efforts to curb the spread of misinformation during the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-qanon-merchandise-products-shirt-item-facebook-ban-conspiracy-theory-2020-10\">Amazon has been slow to act</a> on removing products related to the QAnon conspiracy theory, declining to comment when previously asked by Insider about the company's stance on the movement.&#160;</p><h2>Vaccine misinformation is increasingly dangerous during the pandemic&#160;</h2><p>Though infectious disease experts have repeatedly warned that the pandemic is not to be taken lightly — 229,000 people have died of the virus in the US alone — myths about the virus and its spread have continued to swarm social media.&#160;</p><p>The NVIC has been a source of COVID-19 misinformation. In a June article, the organization questioned the severity of COVID-19, asking, \"why are the majority of people in educated societies like the U.S. cowering in fear,\" a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/business/media/right-wing-media-stars-mislead-on-covid-19-death-toll.html\">common far-right talking point</a> amid the pandemic.&#160;</p><p>Along with other prominent anti-vaccination groups, the NVIC is using \"Facebook and other major social media platforms to lay the groundwork for widespread coronavirus vaccine rejection,\" <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/coronavirus-covid-19/most-notorious-anti-vax-groups-use-facebook-lay-groundwork-against-novel\">MMFA reported</a>.&#160;</p><p>As Popular Information reported, the group's Facebook page has shared several posts containing false information about the virus, including the false claim that wearing face masks can be dangerous.</p><p>In May, the NVIC also shared a conspiracy theory from QAnon influencer Miss Polly, who is credited with helping start the <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/wayfair-human-trafficking-conspiracy-theory-tied-to-qanon-2020-7\">Wayfair conspiracy theory</a> in July and <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/conspiracy-theory-influencers-sue-youtube-for-removing-content-qanon-2020-10\">has since been banned from YouTube</a>. \"Another BOOM from Amazing Polly,\" the group said in the post's caption.&#160;</p><p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose false claims have gotten him banned from mainstream social media platforms, has called the NVIC \"the best-informed group trying to expose the dangers of vaccines,\" <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/05/vaccine-safety-program/589354/\">The Atlantic reported</a>.&#160;</p><p>Because the NVIC is against government-mandated vaccines, Viswanath said there's huge overlap between antigovernment or conspiracy theory groups and the NVIC, particularly during the pandemic.&#160;</p><p>The concern, of course, is how \"mainstream\" this type of misinformation has become during the pandemic, Viswanath said, as groups like the NVIC are \"amplifying voices against government mandates\" related to healthcare. \"This is not laying on one corner of the internet,\" he said.&#160;</p><ul class=\"read-more-links\"><li>Read more:</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-every-tech-company-social-media-platform-handling-qanon-2020-10\">This is how 16 tech companies have reacted to the QAnon conspiracy theory on their platform</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.insider.com/doctors-say-more-patients-are-denying-medical-advice-misinformation-2020-8\">Doctors say they're dealing with significantly more patients who resist their advice because of misinformation they read online</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.insider.com/youtube-demonetized-covid-19-disinformation-moderation-automation-bots-strikes-2020-9\">YouTubers' channels and videos are being mistakenly deleted for debunking COVID-19 conspiracy theories</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.insider.com/what-is-a-vaccine\">What is a vaccine?

four years ago.</p><p>Yeah, it's been a journey. So you'll understand why a seemingly simple tub of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pipette-Renewable-Plant-Derived-Squalane-2-Ounce/dp/B07VW3HQ6T/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipf_010620_pipettes-baby-balm-review-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=fe9f1918a0d4e23eaac54eb03429374c&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Pipette Baby Balm</a> has me as hyped up as a kid at \"Baby Shark Live.\"&#160;</p><p>Two weeks and 22 uses since purchase, I think I may finally be able to toss out the graveyard of half-used lotions and balms taking up space in my bathroom cabinet.</p><p>I tried <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pipette-Renewable-Plant-Derived-Squalane-2-Ounce/dp/B07VW3HQ6T/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipf_010620_pipettes-baby-balm-review-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=fe9f1918a0d4e23eaac54eb03429374c&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Pipette</a> on a lark thanks to a 20% off coupon. The brand, which launched in September 2019, makes moisturizers and bath products for babies and moms.</p><p>Although my daughter is a toddler now, I still gravitate toward baby products because they tend to have fewer ingredients and lighter scents. It's also a consideration for my work as a postpartum doula. New families are <em>always </em>in need of reliable, baby-safe products that aren't a waste of money.</p><h2>What makes Pipette stand out?</h2><p>While cruelty-free, vegan, and unscented were the initial draw for me, I will admit that I am a sucker for minimalist packaging, and Pipette's sedate, slightly retro, mint-and-navy blue combo definitely caught my eye.</p><p>The design is as clean and simple as its ingredients. The packaging is recyclable, and according to the brand's website, renewable plastics are used \"whenever possible.\" Although that iffy language is underwhelming, the company does not test on animals and features only plant-derived ingredients.</p><p>On top of that, all of their products carry the Environmental Working Group's <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/ewgverified/about-the-mark.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">EWG Verified</a> guarantee that they do not contain potentially harmful ingredients.</p><h2>Ingredients</h2><p>When it comes to babies, less is definitely more. A main selling point of this brand is that it does not contain fillers or synthetics.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pipette-Renewable-Plant-Derived-Squalane-2-Ounce/dp/B07VW3HQ6T/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipf_010620_pipettes-baby-balm-review-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=fe9f1918a0d4e23eaac54eb03429374c&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Pipette</a> relies on sugarcane-derived \"squalane,\" which is intended to mimic our body's own squalene (with an \"e\"), a skin-moisturizing lipid we naturally produce. To that, it adds plant-derived fatty acids, berry wax, a few fruit/plant-based binders and moisturizers, and vitamin E.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pipette-Renewable-Plant-Derived-Squalane-2-Ounce/dp/B07VW3HQ6T/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipf_010620_pipettes-baby-balm-review-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=fe9f1918a0d4e23eaac54eb03429374c&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e1356e2855cc23934667495?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pipette Baby Balm2\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>I apply a thin coat of the balm to my daughter&#39;s face post-bath, as well as the crooks of her elbows and several other targeted spots.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mandy Major/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>What it does <em>not</em> contain may be more newsworthy: no petrolatum, sulfates, parabens, phthalates, oxybenzone, talc, polyethylene glycol, formaldehyde, or retinyl palmitate. Although these ingredients are commonly found in <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">beauty and bath products</a>, they are arguably irritants, potential carcinogens, allergens, and/or hormone disruptors.</p><h2>Putting the Baby Balm to the test</h2><p>Once fall hits, dryness is a given. And as the chilly New England temperatures drop further, my household is up against something even worse: eczema. It manifests as small red and raised patches that drive my daughter crazy with itching. Unrefined extra-virgin coconut oil has been my fallback since she was an infant, but it is messy and takes time to absorb.</p><p>Other nonsynthetic products didn't work for us, for various combinations of lackluster moisture, allergenic ingredients, or not-quite-right scents. Everyone for Everybody is a terrific synthetic-free brand, but it's extremely lightweight. I even plunked down $35 to try a jar of Pommade Divine Nature's Remedy Balm, but its medicinal scent and greasy after-life doomed it to the back of the drawer almost instantly.</p><p>That brings us to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pipette-Renewable-Plant-Derived-Squalane-2-Ounce/dp/B07VW3HQ6T/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipf_010620_pipettes-baby-balm-review-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=fe9f1918a0d4e23eaac54eb03429374c&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Pipette</a>. I decided to test the balm by finger-painting a thin coat on my daughter's face post-bath, as well as the crooks of her elbows and several other targeted spots. Once our mornings hit below freezing, I repeated a quick swipe on her cheeks before heading out to daycare. In three days, her cheeks went from a patchwork of bright red blotches to a few faint rosy marks. Nothing else has done that as fast or as effectively.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>So, should you buy it? Yes. Particularly if you are interested in vegan products without synthetic ingredients, are sensitive to perfumed baby lotions, or need a quality baby moisturizer suitable for fall and winter.</p><p>There are literally thousands of options there. I am recommending this as a replacement for baby's daily lotion and as a spot fix for patches of extra-dry skin. Depending on your needs, other products may be better for your baby. If cradle cap is a concern, I recommend unrefined extra virgin coconut oil. If diaper rash is cropping up, there is nothing better than <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009RF8G0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipf_010620_pipettes-baby-balm-review-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0009RF8G0&linkId=610aa9304361f3aa48cfc98690b90a724361f3aa48cfc98690b90a72\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Boudreaux's Butt Paste</a> in my experience.</p><p>If you love fragrant \"baby-smelling\" things, this probably won't hit the mark for you. Though it's marketed as \"unscented,\" the balm smells a bit like linseed oil. Or, if you ask my toddler, it \"smells like unicorn syrup!!!\"</p><p>I've read some reviews that say the balm felt greasy or didn't absorb. That was not my experience. In fact, I felt it was the opposite.
