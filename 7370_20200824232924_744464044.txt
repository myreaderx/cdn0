In 1839, the <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?f=0&fips=25&elect=0&off=5&year=1839\">Massachusetts gubernatorial election</a> was decided by just two votes out of 102,066. The same was the case in a 1974 <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Closest_election_in_Senate_history.htm\">New Hampshire Senate race</a> — out of 233,363 votes, only two made the difference. And in 2008, an <a href=\"http://www.alaskapublic.org/2008/11/25/house-district-7-election-completed-kelly-wins-by-1-vote/\">Alaskan State House race</a> was decided by a single vote.<br /><br />With Election Day just 25 days away, it’s time to make your vote count.

Last September, <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/09/matching-your-donation-to-humanitarian.html\">we invited people</a> around the world to help us in supporting organizations on the ground — with Google.org matching every dollar. Since that time, Google.org has committed more than $16.5 million to refugee relief efforts, focused on immediate humanitarian assistance, information and connectivity, and education. <br /><br /><b>Clooney Foundation for Justice Grant</b> <br />Today, we’re supporting the <a href=\"http://cfj.org/\">Clooney Foundation for Justice</a> with a $1 million grant focused on education for refugee children in Lebanon. More than half of global refugees are under the age of eighteen, and in Lebanon, which is hosting the <a href=\"http://www.mercycorps.org.uk/countries/lebanon\">largest number of Syrian refugees per capita</a> in the world, nearly half of those are Syrian refugee children who are <a href=\"http://www.oosci-mena.org/uploads/1/wysiwyg/160128_UNICEF_MENARO_Syria_policy_paper_final.pdf\">currently out of school</a>. <br /><br />The Clooney Foundation for Justice is teaming up with <a href=\"http://www.sabis.net/\">SABIS</a>, a global education network that has already taught many refugee children in Lebanon. SABIS is taking its accredited teaching methodology and making it accessible to more refugees in Lebanon by setting up semi-permanent schools in areas with a high concentration of refugee children. This grant will support expanding their efforts to develop a new school model, using digital tools, for up to 10,000 out-of-school children in Lebanon. Through our employee volunteering program, we’ll also provide technical expertise to help with everything from connectivity to cloud storage by having Googlers helping both on the ground and remotely.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lwTMGn4MJg\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br /><br />This grant builds on <a href=\"http://google.org/refugees\">our work with organizations</a> who also support refugees in Germany, France, Turkey and Greece with access to education and learning opportunities. Collectively, our efforts across humanitarian assistance, connectivity and access to information and education will help more than 1 million refugees. <br /><br /><b>Information and Connectivity</b><br />In October 2015, we granted NetHope $900,000, and our employees from around the world helped set up WiFi hotspots and charging kits at key transit points along the refugee route in Europe. So far, more than 300,000 refugees have been able to access NetHope’s WiFi to access vital information. Googlers also helped build the site <a href=\"https://refugeeinfo.eu/\">RefugeeInfo.eu</a> with the International Rescue Committee, Mercy Corps, and others. The site is now accessible in 18 locations in Greece, Italy, Germany, Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, and is being used more than 1,000 times a day.<br /><br />We’re also working to help refugees in the United States get mobile connectivity by partnering with the International Rescue Committee to donate 1,000 Nexus devices and Project Fi wireless service to refugees in 24 cities across the country. <br /><br /><b>Education</b><br /><a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/01/refugees-education-chromebooks.html\">In January</a>, together with NetHope, we launched “<a href=\"http://reconnect.nethope.org/project-reconnect-english/\">Project Reconnect</a>” — an effort to to equip German NGOs with 25,000 Chromebooks that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRdsOS7FJg8\">help refugees</a> learn more about local languages, resources, and job opportunities. To date, more than half of them have been delivered and used by nonprofits in Germany. Last year, we also gave a grant to Libraries without Borders to send their <a href=\"http://www.librarieswithoutborders.org/index.php/news-and-events/lwb-news/item/291-the-ideas-box-a-portable-multi-media-kit-for-emergency-humanitarian-situations\">Ideas Boxes</a> to create safe learning and playing spaces for children in refugee camps.

With Google Home, you can play music, get answers from Google, manage your everyday tasks, and control smart home devices, like Chromecast.

We're excited that the lineup features the first phone made by Google inside and out — Pixel. <br /><br />For those of you who have followed Google closely, that name may sound familiar to you because we've used the Pixel name in the past for consumer hardware products that represented an overall premium Google experience. Many of you may also be familiar with the Nexus program. Since 2010, we’ve partnered closely with mobile handset partners around the world to bring you the best of Android. Through Nexus, the goal was to work with these various partners to push the boundaries of what’s possible with a smartphone. We’ve now decided to take the next step and provide our take on the best Google experience, by bringing hardware and software design together under one roof.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rykmwn0SMWU\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br /><b>Pixel, Phone by Google</b><br />With Pixel, we obsessed over every detail, from the industrial design to the user experience. We carefully sculpted the surfaces of the phone, and rounded the edges to make it easy to grip. We used 2.5D Corning® Gorilla® Glass 4 on the front display and back glass to accent the aerospace grade aluminum body. The glass on the back also features Pixel Imprint, our fingerprint sensor, which is placed on the back of the phone where your finger expects it. You can even swipe it to access your notifications. And no matter what you’re using your phone for, you’ll need a battery that lasts all day and charges fast — up to seven hours in 15 minutes.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_HoHWCiQYdE/V_QX2-w4SwI/AAAAAAAATH8/UlkaeafDHuQ4qAEA-lgjMYWojsV14Z_2ACLcB/s1600/pixel.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_HoHWCiQYdE/V_QX2-w4SwI/AAAAAAAATH8/UlkaeafDHuQ4qAEA-lgjMYWojsV14Z_2ACLcB/s640/pixel.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><b>Meet your Google Assistant</b><br />Pixel is the first phone with the <a href=\"http://assistant.google.com/\">Google Assistant</a> built in. With your Assistant, you can have a natural conversation with Google to find answers or get things done on the go. Say \"Ok Google\" or touch and hold the Home button and your Assistant is ready to help. Ask it for a brief update on your day or to play a video on YouTube. Look up traffic on the way home from work or when the nearest pharmacy closes. You can even say “show me my camping photos with Andrew” and it'll instantly display the photos you're looking for. Your Assistant can also offer help with what’s on-screen in any app. So if your friend texts you to meet up at a new restaurant, you can just say “navigate there.”<br /><br /><b>The best smartphone camera. Ever.</b><br />The Pixel camera is not only the best smartphone camera we’ve ever made, it’s the highest rated smartphone camera anyone has ever made. Our DxOMark Mobile score of 89 is a great example of what’s possible when great hardware meets great software. Pixel puts cutting-edge computational photography in an ultra-fast and easy-to-use camera.<br /><br />Pixel has a 12.3MP camera, featuring an f/2.0 aperture and big 1.55 micron pixels to capture lots and lots of light. Our team of photography gurus and image processing experts have spent the last year designing and tirelessly optimizing our entire camera stack.<br /><br />Pixel’s camera lets you take stunning photos in low light, bright light or any light. Catch action shots as they happen with <i>Smartburst</i>, which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best one. Use <i>Lens Blur </i>to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, making your subject pop. You can capture dramatic landscapes or make faces glow with new exposure controls.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1P6vpr9VqQg\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />And as a special bonus for Pixel owners, we’re including free unlimited storage for original quality photos and videos at full resolution in Google Photos.<br /><br /><b>More to love</b><br />Pixel ships with the newest Android operating system, Android 7.1 Nougat. Phones will get software and security updates as soon as they’re available, directly from Google. We’ve also made the update process easier. When a new update is available, it can download and install in the background — no more waiting around for your phone to update.<br /><br />The Pixel also comes with Google Duo and Allo pre-installed so you can video call and text with all your friends, whether they’re on Android or iOS. <br /><br /><b>Make it yours</b><br />Pixel comes in two sizes, 5” or 5.5”, and three colors: Very Silver, Quite Black and our limited edition for the U.S. only, Really Blue. And whatever you choose, we’ve got cases to match. In addition to customizing <a href=\"https://store.google.com/category/customizable_live_case\">Live Cases</a> with your favorite photos and places, we’re introducing a new Artworks collection that features exclusive designs from artists like Justin Maller, and photographers like Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield. We’re also excited to offer a new collection of <a href=\"https://store.google.com/collection/accessories\">silicone and clear cases</a>.<br /><br />Pixel is available for <a href=\"https://madeby.google.com/phone/\">pre-order today</a> starting at $649 in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and Australia. Pre-orders in India will begin October 13. In the U.S., we’re teaming up exclusively with Verizon to make Pixel available nationwide at all Verizon retail outlets, including Best Buy stores. We’re also offering Pixel unlocked on the Google Store and, for you <a href=\"https://fi.google.com/\">Project Fi</a> fans out there, you'll be happy to know that Pixel is the latest device to work on the Fi network. <br /><br />Personally, I’m rocking the 5.5” Quite Black with a Live Case centered on 1060 W Addison.

But too often we have to hit pause on our conversations — whether it’s to check the status of a flight or look up that new restaurant. So we created a messaging app that helps you keep your conversation going, by providing assistance when you need it. <br /><br />Today, we’re releasing <a href=\"https://allo.google.com/\">Google Allo</a>, a new smart messaging app for Android and iOS that helps you say more and do more right in your chats. Google Allo can help you make plans, find information, and express yourself more easily in chat. And the more you use it, the more it improves over time.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-psK4kT-Sb4E/V-Lt_GSvZ2I/AAAAAAAATD8/nw2v2ZbPcRIdXDAh3RptfgdBieATkvUKQCLcB/s1600/logo_allo_bubble_color_2x_web_48dp.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-psK4kT-Sb4E/V-Lt_GSvZ2I/AAAAAAAATD8/nw2v2ZbPcRIdXDAh3RptfgdBieATkvUKQCLcB/s1600/logo_allo_bubble_color_2x_web_48dp.png\" /></a></div><br /><br /><b>Respond quickly with Smart Reply</b><br />Google Allo makes it easier for you to respond quickly and keep the conversation going, even when you’re on the go. With Smart Reply, you can respond to messages with just a tap, so you can send a quick “yup” in response to a friend asking “Are you on your way?” Smart Reply will also suggest responses for photos. If your friend sends you a photo of their pet, you might see Smart Reply suggestions like “aww cute!” And whether you’re a “haha” or “😂” kind of person, Smart Reply will improve over time and adjust to your style. <br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4PzDp6QNEwg/V-HiMITUQGI/AAAAAAAATCw/O9cwkMWXjrsxLRaGjWc8t4XOFwS87sCRwCLcB/s1600/SmartReply.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4PzDp6QNEwg/V-HiMITUQGI/AAAAAAAATCw/O9cwkMWXjrsxLRaGjWc8t4XOFwS87sCRwCLcB/s640/SmartReply.gif\" width=\"410\" /></a></div><br /><b>Express yourself with photos, emojis and stickers</b><br />Chat is more than just text, so we’ve created a rich canvas for you to express yourself in Google Allo. You can make emojis and text larger or smaller in size by simply dragging the “send” button up or down. Make photos your own by scribbling on them before you send. And we’ve worked with independent artists and studios around the world to create more than 25 custom sticker packs, because sometimes a “sloth riding a pizza” says it all.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WaSKEEA7O7Q/V-HOcpsJ_sI/AAAAAAAATCY/hPxAVf6KGUYCmat5uMf79-KKd4OFum4hACLcB/s1600/blog%2Bimage%2Bscreens%2B%25286%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"571\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WaSKEEA7O7Q/V-HOcpsJ_sI/AAAAAAAATCY/hPxAVf6KGUYCmat5uMf79-KKd4OFum4hACLcB/s640/blog%2Bimage%2Bscreens%2B%25286%2529.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><b>Meet your personal Google Assistant</b><br />In Google Allo you’ll also be introduced to a preview edition of the <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/io-building-next-evolution-of-google.html\">Google Assistant</a>. With your Assistant in Allo, you can have a conversation with Google — ask it questions and let it help you get things done directly in your chats. You no longer need to leave a conversation with friends just to grab an address, share your favorite YouTube video, or pick a dinner spot. Just type @google to bring your Assistant into any group chat. And of course, you can also chat one-one-one with your Assistant in Allo.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kwpLyH6F6hc/V-HOuEGhYBI/AAAAAAAATCc/U_Z5JhZDn5scFngHdRnDNBO-NlsznwHtQCLcB/s1600/GA_Contextual.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kwpLyH6F6hc/V-HOuEGhYBI/AAAAAAAATCc/U_Z5JhZDn5scFngHdRnDNBO-NlsznwHtQCLcB/s640/GA_Contextual.gif\" width=\"410\" /></a></div>Here are just a few ways your Google Assistant can help in Google Allo:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Make plans with friends. </b>You can easily move from discussing dinner with friends to making plans for the night, right in your chat. Just add the Assistant to your group chat and ask for movie times, local restaurants and more. You can also research travel destinations, flights and hotels together with friends.</li><li><b>Get answers. </b>Get the latest info on everything from news, weather, traffic, sports, or your upcoming flights status. Ask the Assistant to send you daily updates on the information you care about.</li><li><b>Have some fun. </b>Ask your Assistant to share that funny YouTube video or play games with friends right in your group chat — for instance you can compete to guess a movie title based on a series of emojis.</li></ul><br /><br />The Google Assistant is the next chapter in a journey Google has been on for many years to assist people in their everyday lives. We’re starting with a preview edition to show you just one way that your Assistant will work for you in chat. Over the coming months, your Assistant will be available in more Google products, working seamlessly throughout your day at home or on the go. The Assistant will initially be available in English, with more languages coming soon. <br /><br /><b>Chat in Incognito mode</b><br />We take privacy and security seriously in Google Allo. All chats in Google Allo are encrypted using industry standard technologies like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security\">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS).

How many fewer great books would there be? How many important stories would go unreported? How many innovations would we lose? How many brilliant women would be unable to fulfill their potential?<br /><br />That’s not just a theoretical question. Today, only a small minority of women know how to write code. That limits their ability to participate in a growing part of our global economy. It limits their ability to affect change as entire industries are transformed by technology. And it limits their potential to impact millions of lives through the power of code.<br /><br />To change this trajectory, we need to do all we can to inspire women and girls that learning to code is critical to creating a brighter future for everyone. That’s why I’m excited to share that, today, Google’s Made with Code, together with YouTube, is teaming up with the <a href=\"http://globalcitizen.org/\">Global Citizen Festival</a> and millions of teen girls to ignite a movement for young women to change the world through the power of code.<br /><br />Over the last five years, millions of Global Citizens have influenced world leaders and decision makers, and contributed to shaping our world for the better. As we’ve seen this movement grow, we’ve learned about some incredible women who saw problems in their communities and realized that the biggest impact they could have was through computer science. They’ve used an interest in computer science and tech to help the homeless, stop sexual assault, and bridge the gender gap in technology - check out their stories here: <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzzcZdLKA2g\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br /><br />These women are doing big things, blazing a path for the next generation of girls, but they can’t do it alone. The vast potential around using code to improve the world cannot be realized if there are only a few voices influencing how it’s shaped. That’s why, today, we’re inviting teen girls everywhere to join the movement. Our <a href=\"http://madewithcode.com/\">new coding project</a> gives young women a chance to make their voice heard by coding a statement about the change they want to see in the world.<br />This week, hundreds of thousands of girls from around the country have already used code to share their vision for a better, more inclusive, more equitable world:<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o_39leotG68/V-K2aC6HY6I/AAAAAAAATDQ/mCgYWRf0R6QfPf9b0jIWGGQ90nPoBDUMACLcB/s1600/Illustrations_MWC.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"207\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o_39leotG68/V-K2aC6HY6I/AAAAAAAATDQ/mCgYWRf0R6QfPf9b0jIWGGQ90nPoBDUMACLcB/s640/Illustrations_MWC.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />These coded designs will be displayed onstage at the Global Citizen Festival, as symbols of the many different voices from teen girls, standing up for the change they want to see in the world.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sdDxHFk2YtQ/V-K2fzOyPUI/AAAAAAAATDU/O0XKQNvwRDQRzabEQtcPr0qPhwzOuuO2wCLcB/s1600/cxh_MWC.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"141\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sdDxHFk2YtQ/V-K2fzOyPUI/AAAAAAAATDU/O0XKQNvwRDQRzabEQtcPr0qPhwzOuuO2wCLcB/s640/cxh_MWC.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><i>Together with musicians, sisters, YouTube sensations and newly minted coders, <br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/ddbail2\">Chloe x Halle</a>, teen girls are getting their start in code</i><br /><br />Our efforts go well beyond this project. Made with Code is joining forces with Iridescent and UN Women to support the launch of the <a href=\"http://www.technovationchallenge.org/madewithcode/\">Technovation Challenge 2017</a> which gives girls the opportunity to build their own apps that tackle the real-life issues they see around them. <br /><br />Please tune into the <b>Global Citizen Festival livestream at youtube.com/globalcitizen</b> on September 24 to catch all the action.  And, more importantly, join us and encourage the young women in your life to try out coding and contribute their ideas for how to make a better future.<br /><br /><span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Susan Wojcicki, CEO, YouTube</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"> <span class=\"post-image\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-795tCTWiCSI/V-K3lylC2OI/AAAAAAAATDY/kwzdr3Zn-Lg7n8jeXmGAeW--NqOTuVaIACLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-09-21%2Bat%2B9.38.06%2BAM.png</span>   <span class=\"post-author-name\">Susan Wojcicki</span>   <span class=\"post-author-title\">CEO</span>   <span class=\"post-author-team\">YouTube</span> <!--    INSTRUCTIONS   Enter info below to be used in google.com/about site blog syndication.

Sixty-nine percent of U.S. leisure travelers worry that they're not finding the best price or making the best decision while booking a trip — making this kind of purchase more worrisome than financial investments, home improvements or electronics purchases.*<br /><br />This holiday season we’re making travel planning less stressful by updating you when flights are likely to increase in price, helping you find good hotel deals, and making travel planning easier on mobile.  <br /><br /><b>Making it easier than ever to choose the right flight</b><br />Google Flights can now help you be more confident that you’re booking your flight at the right time to get the best price. We now show you when prices are expected to increase for some specific flights and routes you’re interested in.<br /><br />After selecting a specific flight, a notification may appear letting you know when the current fare is expected to expire and how much you can save if you book now. For example, this flight to San Diego is likely to cost more in eight hours — and you would likely save $87 if you book before then.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LOIpqOTgdh8/WBOXO38UKII/AAAAAAAATK8/JZtf6HLRLconcu9bE4t4rS0Ap-ZzLdgMACLcB/s1600/FlightImmersive_1A.width-800.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LOIpqOTgdh8/WBOXO38UKII/AAAAAAAATK8/JZtf6HLRLconcu9bE4t4rS0Ap-ZzLdgMACLcB/s640/FlightImmersive_1A.width-800.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></div><br />If you’re looking at a certain route like New York to San Diego, but haven’t selected a specific flight yet, you may see a notification bar with multiple tips showing how to find the best price for this route. Tips can include things like recommendations for alternate airports or dates. You may also see a new tip telling you about an expected price jump based on historic prices for that route. When you tap on the card, you’ll see more details like how much the price is likely to increase and when.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mhKLI_Om0UE/WBOXWNLcsgI/AAAAAAAATLA/7zvcCHsZ5ygspqAR7xb_GRxLrwfPnVCOwCLcB/s1600/FlightImmersive_2.width-800.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mhKLI_Om0UE/WBOXWNLcsgI/AAAAAAAATLA/7zvcCHsZ5ygspqAR7xb_GRxLrwfPnVCOwCLcB/s640/FlightImmersive_2.width-800.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" /></a></div><br />If you’re not ready to book yet, you can choose to track your flight or route and receive notifications via email letting you know when prices are expected to change.

The vast majority of them were sitting at desktop computers and looking for answers that came in the form of blue links. Today, the Internet community is closer to 3 billion people, and you’re searching for all kinds of help everywhere — from your cars and your classrooms, to your homes, to the phones in your pockets. Across all these contexts and devices, there are even more questions to be asked, and more that we can do to help you get the answers you need.<br /><br /><b>From mobile first to AI-first </b><br />When I look at where computing is heading, I see how machine learning and artificial intelligence are unlocking capabilities that were unthinkable only a few years ago. This means that the power of the software — the “smarts” — really matter for hardware more than ever before. The last 10 years have been about building a world that is mobile-first, turning our phones into remote controls for our lives. But in the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available — be it at home, at work, in the car, or on the go — and interacting with all of these surfaces becomes much more natural and intuitive, and above all, more intelligent.<br /><br />This is why we built the Google Assistant, which allows you to have a natural conversation between you and Google. It’s one Assistant that’s ready to help you throughout your day. The first instance appeared in our new smart messaging app Google Allo to help you in group conversations. But that’s just the beginning. We want to help you get things done in your world, across different places, contexts and situations. And that means building the Google Assistant and other amazing software into the hardware that you depend on every day.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPfQMVf4vwQ\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br /><b>The best of Google</b><br />Today we announced a new <a href=\"http://madeby.google/\">family of hardware</a>&nbsp;that’s a step toward making sure that no matter where you are, or what you’re doing, you can have the best of Google by your side. The <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/introducing-pixel-our-new-phone-made-by.html\">Pixel</a> is the first phone with the Google Assistant built in. With <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/make-yourself-at-home-with-google-home.html\">Google Home</a>, our voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant, just say “Ok Google” to get answers and help around the house. With <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/the-fastest-chromecast-yet-with-4k-and.html\">Chromecast Ultra</a> and <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/introducing-new-kind-of-wi-fi-system.html\">Google Wifi</a>, your home becomes even more connected. And our new <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/daydream-bringing-high-quality-vr-to.html\">Daydream View</a> headset and controller lets you explore new worlds in virtual reality with just your phone. These all do different things, serve different purposes — but they all deliver Google, the way we intended it.<br /><br />Great hardware is powered by great software. And a beautiful, intuitive device allows the underlying technology to shine. As the range of devices in our lives expands, we’re seeing unprecedented advances in software as a result of investing in technologies like search, machine learning and AI, which benefits things like translation, voice recognition, image recognition and natural language processing. It’s still early days, but when all of that works together, the Google Assistant allows you to get things done, bringing you the information you need, when you need it, wherever you are.<br /><br />Of course, we know we can’t do it alone. We’re building with partners in mind, so when you talk to your Assistant, you’re able to better connect with developers, publishers, and businesses. <br /><br />While we are at the beginning of this journey, I can already see the tremendous strides we’re making with machine learning and AI, which gives me confidence that we’re going to do some amazing things for users over the next 10 years.<br /><br /><span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Sundar Pichai, CEO</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">  <br /><br /><span class=\"post-image\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pqufxycGcZE/V_SbaMNe3aI/AAAAAAAATJY/4dIjDAmK7TcnC29pqxSWL8GUUYs-c9oBACLcB/s1600/whyopa_HiAimee_alt_160929a.png</span> <span class=\"post-author-name\">Sundar Pichai</span> <span class=\"post-author-title\">CEO</span> <span class=\"post-author-team\"></span> </span>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Oct 2016 18:35:00 +0000","feedId":7370,"bgimg":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FPfQMVf4vwQ/default.jpg","linkMd5":"c48d923982379c204612fa86458f39a3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn41@2020_4/2020/08/24/23-29-13-537_9df8ecda411d7b0c.webp","destWidth":120,"destHeight":90,"sourceBytes":1651,"destBytes":840,"author":"Google Blogs","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311741336},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:29:01","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:29:01","title":"Saving Magic Cat Academy from catastrophe!","link":"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/saving-magic-cat-academy-from.html","description":"Hi, I’m Momo, a student at the illustrious Magic Cat Academy. Heading to class this morning, I thought it would be just like any other day: learn a few new spells, drink some milk, and hang out with my awesome animal and vegetable pals. To my Halloween horror, hundreds of angry ghosts have invaded the halls of my beloved school — fur real! And now, I ask you to join me to try your hand (or paw!) at fending off these ghastly ghosts with today’s Halloween Google Doodle.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VxEKML2M9SI/WBgZYAsdeeI/AAAAAAAATOA/5Fo1UPTzCBwy2SLzPCDp6h8D9dY8n4O9wCLcB/s1600/10-31-Halloween-HP2x.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VxEKML2M9SI/WBgZYAsdeeI/AAAAAAAATOA/5Fo1UPTzCBwy2SLzPCDp6h8D9dY8n4O9wCLcB/s640/10-31-Halloween-HP2x.gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"328\" /></a></div><br />With a swipe of your paw (or should I say wave of your wand), you can help turn these Halloween tricks into a real treat.

From practicing Mexican folk dances with classmates to introducing neighbors to our favorite traditional foods, my family is always grateful to share our experiences as Latinos in the U.S. That's why I've been excited to help with Google's celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month — a time to reflect on and celebrate the contributions Latinos make to our company and our country. <br /><br /><b>Latino Heritage and Cultures collection</b><br />To kick off Hispanic Heritage Month, Google Arts & Culture published a dedicated <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/project/latino-cultures\">collection</a> of artifacts, archives and stories of Latino Heritage and Cultures from across the Americas. You can explore influences of Latino art and expression from ancient civilizations like the Aztec and the Inca from today’s modern street art in Puerto Rico, Argentina, and the United States. In total, the collection includes <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/search/partner?project=latino-cultures\">55 institutions</a> from 11 countries, <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/search/asset?project=latino-cultures\">14K artifacts and artworks</a>, <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/search/exhibit?project=latino-cultures\">117 expertly curated exhibits</a>, and <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/search/streetview?project=latino-cultures\">180+ virtual tours of heritage and cultural sites</a>. See some highlights in our video:<br /><br /><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/axINeiFeFQM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br /><b>HOLA celebrations at Google</b><br />We also celebrated Hispanic Heritage Month across Google’s campuses, where members and allies of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/diversity/at-google.html\">HOLA, the Hispanic Googler Network</a>, promoted Latino culture, leadership and civic engagement. On September 16, 50 Googlers from across the globe gathered in Washington, D.C., for a three-day Leadership Summit. There, we met with organizations like <a href=\"http://votolatino.org/\">Voto Latino</a>, brainstorming ideas on how to get out the vote; advised local organizations like the <a href=\"http://www.laycca.org/\">Latin American Youth Career Center</a> and the <a href=\"http://hispanicheritage.org/\">Hispanic Heritage Foundation</a> using digital tools in the classroom; and mentored students from the <a href=\"http://gsp.georgetown.edu/\">Georgetown Scholarship Program</a> pursuing careers in technology.<br /><br />HOLA members continued the HHM festivities in their home offices. Googlers in Mountain View hosted the rock band Maná, who spoke about their interest in social good and music. And just earlier this week, we welcomed Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, who discussed the importance of access to Latino mentors, the value of immigrants in the American workforce, and the necessity of technology for 21st century careers. You can meet <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLRU1PKDpnJ/\">some</a> of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLeeVzpD7T8/\">our HOLA</a> members on our Instagram account.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N2jnDpF2ET0/WBOTh7ssSwI/AAAAAAAATKs/_YsAM1zaHBUaZtvALGcZmfkHAty_gETJQCLcB/s1600/Members_of_HOLA_host_Secretary_of_Labor_Thoma.width-1080.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N2jnDpF2ET0/WBOTh7ssSwI/AAAAAAAATKs/_YsAM1zaHBUaZtvALGcZmfkHAty_gETJQCLcB/s400/Members_of_HOLA_host_Secretary_of_Labor_Thoma.width-1080.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" /></a></div><i>Members of HOLA host Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month<br /></i><br /><br /><b>Support for Latino students and families</b><br />At Google, we understand that diverse and inclusive environments are essential to building products and solutions that work for everyone. That’s why we invest in increasing educational opportunities for students of all backgrounds to pursue futures in technology. This month Google.org is committing $1 million to local Silicon Valley organizations to help close these gaps in educational success for Latino students and families.<br /><br />Across the U.S., Latino students aren’t being adequately prepared for college experiences or college level math. In our own backyard, Mountain View-Los Altos Union High School District, <a href=\"http://caaspp.cde.ca.gov/SB2015/ViewReport?ps=true&lstTestYear=2015&lstTestType=B&lstCounty=43&lstDistrict=69609-000&lstSchool=&lstGroup=1&lstSubGroup=1\">73 percent of Hispanic high school juniors</a> do not meet math standards — compared to 34 percent overall. So we’re providing <a href=\"http://svefoundation.org/\">Silicon Valley Education Foundation (SVEF)</a> $750,000 to support its work narrowing the achievement gap through its student-focused programs, school district policy support, and collaborations with business communities to bring innovation into the classroom. Googlers are already active volunteers with SVEF’s summer intervention program, <a href=\"http://svefoundation.org/programs/elevate/\">Elevate Math</a>.<br /><br />Google.org has also committed $250,000 to the <a href=\"http://www.hfsv.org/\">Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley (HFSV)</a>, which aims to increase high school and college graduation rates for Latino students. Over the course of the next two years, HFSV will conduct Spanish-speaking Parent Education Academies that will reach parents of low-income, Latino students who are at-risk of falling off track. These workshops will ensure Latino parents are knowledgeable about the local education system and how best to support their children to achieve academic results and fulfilling careers.<br /><br />As Hispanic Heritage Month 2016 comes to a close, we look forward to continuing our support of the Latino community — at Google and beyond!<br /><br /><span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Suzanna Bobadilla, Social Impact Team</span>  <span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">  <span class=\"post-image\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-no2YLY5x8lI/WBOWEWwgjWI/AAAAAAAATK4/Pb9p__tKBU0d0FwuyYvnbwdUxWE4KwRqgCLcB/s1600/gweb-uniblog-author-prod-int.googleplex.jpg</span>   <span class=\"post-author-name\">Suzanna Bobadillan</span>  <span class=\"post-author-team\">Google</span><!--   INSTRUCTIONS   Enter info below to be used in google.com/about site blog syndication.

Rowling’s Wizarding World, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” Taking place decades before Harry Potter first arrives at Hogwarts, “Fantastic Beasts” follows the adventures of magizoologist Newt Scamander in a whole new era of the wizarding world — New York in 1926.\n<br />\n<br />If you want to try being a wizard, try casting spells on your Android phone: Just say “Ok Google” followed by “Lumos” or “Nox” to turn your flashlight on and off.

Whether you’re video chatting with mom, binge-watching the latest series, or simply getting work done, strong and reliable Wi-Fi is key to staying connected.<br /><br />Today, we’re excited to introduce Google Wifi, a new connected Wi-Fi system designed to give you a fast signal in every room, on every device. <br /><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dfa1vyMM2DE\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br />Most of us get Wi-Fi in our homes through a centralized router, but using a single router to spread signal throughout your whole home is like expecting one light bulb to light up every room. Walls and distance make it difficult for a single device to send a strong signal to every corner of your home, resulting in slow Wi-Fi and dead zones.<br /><br />Last year, we <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/meet-onhub-new-router-for-new-way-to-wi.html\">introduced OnHub</a> with partners TP-LINK and ASUS to create a better Wi-Fi experience, focusing on design and simplicity. Google Wifi, built on the strengths of OnHub, is our next step towards ensuring that our homes can have great Wi-Fi everywhere we need it.<br /><b><br /></b> <b>Fast Wi-Fi throughout your home</b><br />Google Wifi was designed from the ground up to support the new ways we use Wi-Fi. These days, Wi-Fi has to be able to support lots of devices at the same time, and stand up to high-bandwidth activities like streaming video or gaming — in every room of your house. Google Wifi is an expandable system, so for larger homes, you can simply add Google Wifi points. They connect to one another and spread a strong network signal to every room.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m977MmlS_70/V_QcLIrn27I/AAAAAAAATIQ/A8X7SqUz6rwAFx41nBXl2K-BeyRENpBFgCLcB/s1600/home-coverage%2B%25281%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m977MmlS_70/V_QcLIrn27I/AAAAAAAATIQ/A8X7SqUz6rwAFx41nBXl2K-BeyRENpBFgCLcB/s640/home-coverage%2B%25281%2529.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br />The system uses a technology called mesh Wi-Fi (something usually only seen in expensive commercial installations). Within our mesh network, each Google Wifi point creates a high-powered connection, and the different points work together to determine the best path for your data. The result is fast Wi-Fi everywhere in your house, not just right next to the router. <br /><br /><b>Keeps itself fast</b><br />Most of us don’t want to spend time tweaking complex settings or managing our Wi-Fi network. Google Wifi comes with Network Assist technology, which works behind the scenes to keep your Wi-Fi fast so you don’t have to figure out how to adjust your router. Network Assist automatically places you on the clearest channel and optimal Wi-Fi band for your device. And as you roam around your house, Network Assist will seamlessly transition your device between the Google Wifi system points in real time, so you avoid dead spots or delays. <br /><br /><b>A simple way to control your network</b><br />For those times when you do want more control over your network, Google Wifi makes it simple through a companion app, available on Android or iOS. The app lets you do things like pause Wi-Fi on kids’ devices (like when it’s time to come to the dinner table). It also shows you which devices are connected and how much bandwidth they’re using and lets you prioritize devices within your network so you can stream that latest episode uninterrupted. Google Wifi was designed with user privacy as a top priority. For example, it has settings for easily controlling cloud management and industry-leading security features such as wireless encryption, verified boot, and auto updates to keep your network safe and secure.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EHscWUPPZaE/V_QcLJfxxII/AAAAAAAATIM/JHWIHPKnangQznAEH15OYDII136z_f-ZACLcB/s1600/Google%2BWifi%2Bblog%2Bpost%2Bimage.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EHscWUPPZaE/V_QcLJfxxII/AAAAAAAATIM/JHWIHPKnangQznAEH15OYDII136z_f-ZACLcB/s640/Google%2BWifi%2Bblog%2Bpost%2Bimage.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><a href=\"http://madeby.google.com/wifi?utm_source=blog_googlewifi&amp;utm_medium=blog_post&amp;utm_campaign=10_4_launch\">Google Wifi</a> will be available for pre-order in the U.S. in November.

Wouldn’t it be great to get some extra help there? You could start up your favorite song while you’re washing dishes, turn off the lights without getting out of bed, or check the traffic when you’re running out the door. Today we’re unveiling a new product that helps you in the place you need it most: your home. With Google Home, it’s as simple as using your voice to turn up the music, get answers to a myriad of questions, manage tasks around the house, and even adjust the thermostat or lights. It allows you to bring the <a href=\"http://assistant.google.com/\">Google Assistant</a> into your kitchen, living room or anywhere else around the house.<br /><br /><b>Your voice speaks volumes</b><br />With a simple “Ok Google” you can play songs, artists, radio stations, your favorite playlists and more from Google Play Music, Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn and YouTube Music with additional services like iHeartRadio coming soon. You can also play a podcast while making pasta or listen to today’s news while tying your shoes. And if you just want to stream audio directly from your phone, you can cast music to Google Home from 100+ Chromecast-enabled apps on your Android or iOS device.<br /><br />Google Home’s smart audio design integrates a high-excursion driver with a dual passive radiator design that delivers crystal-clear highs and deep lows for Hi-Fi sound that streams over WiFi. That means a lot of big sound from a small package. Even while you jam out to music, it can easily hear you from across the room, thanks to two omnidirectional microphones and neural beamforming.<br /><br /><b>Get answers big and small</b><br />Google Home taps into the power of Google Search to give you real-time answers to things you want to know. Ask Google Home to translate phrases and do simple math calculations. Kneading pizza dough and need to change ounces to grams? Ask and get unit conversions and nutritional info, too. Getting ready for the day? Get real-time info on the weather, the stock market, the traffic, or your favorite sports team. Google Home can also help you find answers to more obscure questions directly on the web. It’s all the power of Google with a simple voice command.<br /><br /><b>An extra pair of hands </b><br />With your permission, Google Home makes helpful information easily accessible. Check your calendar or even pull up your flight information. You can also say, “Tell me about my day” to hear curated personal information that helps you navigate your day. We know there’s no shortage of tasks at home, and Google Home can help with those too.

Thousands of women at Google are building tools and products that organize the world’s information, help businesses get online and prosper, and forge connections across a growing digital community of 3.5 billion people. So it only makes sense that Google would be part of the world's largest gathering of women technologists. We see GHC as a critical way to connect women in tech and help clear hurdles to their professional development.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x1AMdiTm9ZU/WBOZFNBQ5_I/AAAAAAAATLg/70sMqVoCD0soUeu-yKf7q-LFg6Yijec7gCLcB/s1600/GHC2016_COLOR_REV1.width-800.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x1AMdiTm9ZU/WBOZFNBQ5_I/AAAAAAAATLg/70sMqVoCD0soUeu-yKf7q-LFg6Yijec7gCLcB/s640/GHC2016_COLOR_REV1.width-800.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"514\" /></a></div><br />We know that there’s much more work to do to help level the playing field — and that’s why the mission of the Grace Hopper Celebration is so important. Just yesterday we reported new U.S. research from Gallup and Google that suggests girls are less likely than boys to be told by parents and teachers that they would be good at computer science. We also found that girls are less likely than boys to be aware of computer science learning opportunities outside of school.<br /><br />We’ve worked hard to recruit and support amazing women leaders since the very beginning of Google, but we also want to support efforts to improve women’s representation across the entire tech ecosystem. That's why we've been part of of GHC since 2004. For the past 12 years, we’ve also worked with the Anita Borg Institute (ABI), which produces GHC, to bring more women into computer science careers. Google’s Alan Eustace is a founding member of the ABI Board of Trustees, and his friendship with Anita Borg herself gave rise to the Women Techmakers Scholars Program (formerly known as the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship Program). To date, the program has awarded more than 1,000 scholarships globally, and we've been very happy to hire many of them to come work here.<br /><br />If you’re planning to attend the conference, don’t be a stranger. If you see one of us sporting a Google T-shirt, we’d love to meet you. Stop by our booth (#1730), or come to one of our 25 presentations. Some of the highlights include our VP of Engineering and Machine Learning Anna Patterson, who will deliver a keynote on entrepreneurism and receive the 2016 ABI Excellence Award; and Captain of Moonshots Astro Teller, who will discuss how to embrace failure in the name of breakthrough.

A museum 100 years in the making, the NMAAHC is much more than just a collection of artifacts. Within its walls, visitors will take part in an immersive journey into the important contributions of African Americans in the United States. It’s a mosaic of stories — stories from our history that are core to who we are as a nation. And we’re proud to help bring these stories to life with a first-of-its-kind 3D interactive exhibit and a $1 million grant from Google.org, part of our <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/02/strengthening-our-commitment-to-racial.html\">ongoing work on racial and social justice issues</a>.<br /><br /><b>A new way to explore artifacts </b><br />A few years ago, <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/about/leadership\">Dr. Lonnie Bunch, the NMAAHC’s director</a>, came to Google’s headquarters and shared his vision to make the museum the most technologically advanced in the world. I immediately knew I wanted to be involved, and pulled together people from across the company: designers who focus on user interaction, members of the Cultural Institute, engineers who work on everything from Google Maps to YouTube, and members of the Black Googler Network. For the past year, we’ve been working to deliver on Dr. Bunch’s vision. <br /><br />Our team quickly learned that museums are often only able to showcase a fraction of their content and archives to visitors. So we asked ourselves: what technology do we have at Google that could help enrich the museum experience? We worked closely with the museum to build an interactive exhibit to house artifacts from decades of African American history and let visitors explore and learn about them. With 3D scanning, 360 video, multiple screens and other technologies, visitors can see artifacts like a powder horn or handmade dish from all angles by rotating them with a mobile device. The interactive exhibit will open in spring 2017.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8ULGbMOnBmQ/V9jW05KISlI/AAAAAAAAS-Q/RiHlc-G1Rq47PcT-myq9m2rCJSnmOgMIQCLcB/s1600/outside-nmaahc.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8ULGbMOnBmQ/V9jW05KISlI/AAAAAAAAS-Q/RiHlc-G1Rq47PcT-myq9m2rCJSnmOgMIQCLcB/s320/outside-nmaahc.png\" width=\"239\" /></a></div><i>Travis McPhail in front of the National Museum of African American History and Culture on one of many site visits to the museum in Washington, DC</i><br /><br /><b>Taking an Expedition through African American history </b><br />In addition to the interactive exhibit, we’re also launching two new <a href=\"https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/\">Google Expeditions</a> that take students on a digital journey through African American history. Earlier this year, we formed the African American Expeditions Council — a group of top minds in Black culture, academia and curation — to help develop Expeditions that tell the story of Africans in America. The Google Cultural Institute has also worked to preserve and share <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/02/preserving-celebrating-black-history.html\">important artworks, artifacts and archives from African American history</a>. With participation from the National Park Service, the Expeditions and Cultural Institute teams captured images of the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, which commemorates the events, people and route of the 1965 Voting Rights March. A second Expedition, from the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, takes you around Dr. King's childhood home and the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he preached.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bUYAfcOo-xE/V9jW0w8pupI/AAAAAAAAS-M/ssDVPcZr-2cz569XMze7pw_fKHzAypNhwCLcB/s1600/Screenshot_20160913-192108.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bUYAfcOo-xE/V9jW0w8pupI/AAAAAAAAS-M/ssDVPcZr-2cz569XMze7pw_fKHzAypNhwCLcB/s640/Screenshot_20160913-192108.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><i>Screenshot from the new Google Expedition highlighting the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, which commemorates the events, people and route of the 1965 Voting Rights March</i><br /><br /><b>Discovering and sharing new stories</b><br />At the end of this week, we're celebrating the opening of the NMAAHC during one of the most important weeks for African Americans in D.C., the week of the Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative Conference (ALC). On Friday night of ALC, we’ll salute NMAAHC Founding Director, Dr. Bunch, and the Congressional Black Caucus. The iconic Congressman John Lewis will be on hand to talk about the impact of Expeditions in telling the story that the NMAAHC will bring to life in so many important ways. <br /><br />Day to day, I work on Google Maps, where we help people around the world find and discover new places. Working on this exhibit has given me a chance to help people discover something else — the ways African American history is vitally intertwined with our history as a nation. I’m proud of the role Google has played a role in taking people on that journey. <br /><br /><span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Travis McPhail, Software Engineer, Google Maps, and Team Lead, Project <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=griot+definition\">Griot</a></span><br /><span data-about-syndication=\"\" style=\"display: none; font-size: 0; line-height: 0; max-height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"> <span class=\"post-image\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZlrEtjkoHm0/V9jtY68-BNI/AAAAAAAAS-g/AxeOln_ZJ0w7ZAMXP8UoHDdDi3kQtMJHwCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-09-13%2Bat%2B11.24.25%2BPM.png</span> <span class=\"post-author-name\">Travis McPhail</span> <span class=\"post-author-title\"> Software Engineer, Google Maps</span> <span class=\"post-author-team\">Team Lead, Project <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=griot+definition\">Griot</a></span> </span>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":7370,"bgimg":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8ULGbMOnBmQ/V9jW05KISlI/AAAAAAAAS-Q/RiHlc-G1Rq47PcT-myq9m2rCJSnmOgMIQCLcB/s320/outside-nmaahc.png","linkMd5":"a1d36e5c2ff3097535c834d49f7f86a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-29-01-928_1bbbee86d317331f.webp","destWidth":239,"destHeight":320,"sourceBytes":124863,"destBytes":13186,"author":"Google Blogs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8ULGbMOnBmQ/V9jW05KISlI/AAAAAAAAS-Q/RiHlc-G1Rq47PcT-myq9m2rCJSnmOgMIQCLcB/s320/outside-nmaahc.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn3@2020_3/2020/08/24/23-29-01-928_1bbbee86d317331f.webp","https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bUYAfcOo-xE/V9jW0w8pupI/AAAAAAAAS-M/ssDVPcZr-2cz569XMze7pw_fKHzAypNhwCLcB/s640/Screenshot_20160913-192108.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/24/23-29-13-198_3d01ed25ddfd16f4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598311741336},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 07:29:01","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 07:29:01","title":"Live the Day of the Dead","link":"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/10/live-day-of-dead.html","description":"Mexican poet Octavio Paz once wrote, \"Our cult of death is also our cult of life.\" Those words capture the spirit with which Mexicans celebrate Día de Muertos. On November 1 and 2, families in Mexico honor those who have departed, setting up colorful altars at home and in public places with the images of loved ones. These ancestors are greeted with their favorite foods, drinks, sugar skulls, colored paper, marigold flowers, candles and incense. It’s a true celebration of culture and family — and has even been declared <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/indigenous-festivity-dedicated-to-the-dead-00054\">“Intangible Cultural Heritage” by UNESCO</a>. <br /><br /><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j44yUsIzUks\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Today, we want to invite everyone to experience Mexico’s tradition of paying tribute to life, through the Day of the Dead exhibition on Google Arts & Culture. The content is curated by 10 cultural organizations from Mexico, Peru and the United States and explores the Pre-Columbian roots of this festivity, its many transformations through history and its contemporary manifestations as told by pieces of archaeology, folk art, prints, paintings, sculptures, street art and many other artforms.

If your friends are on Google Photos, they’ll get a notification. If you share via phone number, they’ll get a link to the photos and videos via SMS. And email addresses will get an email with a link from Google Photos. So you can spend less time toggling from app to app to share photos — dealing with failed texts or email attachment limits along the way — and more time enjoying life’s photo-worthy moments.<br /><br /><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCjLw_-RE7c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />We’re also upping our game when it comes to automatic creations. Google Photos has always made movies for you using your recently uploaded photos. Now we’re going further, with new movies that are based on creative concepts — the kinds of movies you might make yourself, if you just had the time. And they’re not only limited to your most recent uploads.<br /><br />One of the first concepts is designed to show your child growing up right before your eyes. Here’s an example:<br /><br /><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEmAAVOs8XA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />We’re rolling out a couple more concepts this week, with more coming soon.

That’s why we’ll have an all-star group of judges including our very own Google Doodlers help select the National Winner. In addition to the homepage showcase, the winner will receive $30,000 towards a college scholarship, and the opportunity to work with the Doodle team at the Googleplex in Mountain View. As an added bonus: Their home school will get to spend $50,000 on technology to help foster the next generation of professionals (and who knows, maybe future Googlers, too!).<br /><br /><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-ZDMRoxkxI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /><br />Submissions are open until December 2, 2016.

I was fascinated by the peculiar ways cancer cells process energy and wondered if we might be able to target those processes. So, the idea behind my project was to study AMP kinase, an energy protein, to understand its importance in the way ovarian cancer cells develop resistance to drugs. I was 17 when I won the Grand Prize, and my life hasn’t been the same since.<br /><br />Today <a href=\"http://googleforeducation.blogspot.com/2016/08/sixteen-science-and-engineering.html\">20 of the world’s brightest young scientists</a> have that same chance ahead of them, and I am so excited and grateful to be here with them in Mountain View to re-live that experience. <br /><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5I7Z7BGQJdE/V-rPXSEiJxI/AAAAAAAAF4o/i6V4ufemwDA1kQwlYZseAq1x8Li4CEl9gCLcB/s1600/image05.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"424\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5I7Z7BGQJdE/V-rPXSEiJxI/AAAAAAAAF4o/i6V4ufemwDA1kQwlYZseAq1x8Li4CEl9gCLcB/s640/image05.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>The 2016 Google Science Fair finalists&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lif7DvEEtQo/V-rPgle-JWI/AAAAAAAAF4s/zmQFa_Svn9UbiiaLO5_L-oOyzENfRxKigCLcB/s1600/image01.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lif7DvEEtQo/V-rPgle-JWI/AAAAAAAAF4s/zmQFa_Svn9UbiiaLO5_L-oOyzENfRxKigCLcB/s320/image01.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Meeting President Obama(!)<br />Official White House photo by Pete Souza</i></td></tr></tbody></table>For me, the Google Science Fair took my passion for science and gave me a global platform to share it with the world. I went on to do my undergraduate studies at Harvard University, majoring in Molecular and Cellular Biology with a minor in Global Health and Health Policy. My interest in using new metabolic tools to study cancer has led me to Duke University School of Medicine, where I’m currently pursuing an MD/PhD and looking forward to a career that brings together clinical medicine and basic science. But five years ago, it was the Google Science Fair that first provided me with the platform to share my ideas, unlocking doors to some incredible, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities: meeting President Obama, speaking at TEDx events all over the world and being included on <a href=\"http://www.glamour.com/story/shree-bose-top-10-college-women-2015\">Glamour magazine’s list of Top 10 College Women</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />Back at Google today, I witnessed more than 500 students from local Bay Area schools — a majority that qualified for Title I funding — as they asked questions, found inspiration, and saw science and engineering in new, unexpected ways. <br />Those students had a chance to talk to the finalists, from 9 countries, who are working on things like better diagnosing cancer, fighting drought with fruit, training robotic hands, developing compostable feminine sanitary products and so much more. (I also have to point out, this is the first year a majority of the finalists are female, which makes me especially proud!) <br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZafU3VpNNCg/V-rQFah3QHI/AAAAAAAAF4w/lRfIvOWxEVMEl1TrKFBQqZEAjFk0LQyCgCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-09-27%2Bat%2B1.01.08%2BPM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"156\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZafU3VpNNCg/V-rQFah3QHI/AAAAAAAAF4w/lRfIvOWxEVMEl1TrKFBQqZEAjFk0LQyCgCLcB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-09-27%2Bat%2B1.01.08%2BPM.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>My sincere congratulations to all of this year’s Google Science Fair finalists and winners. You might “just” be teenagers, but you’re also amazing researchers, entrepreneurs, technologists and explorers who are challenging themselves — and all of the rest of us — to make things better. To <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/02/google-science-fair-2016-howcanwe-make.html\">quote</a> last year’s Google Science Fair winner (and my friend) Olivia Hallisey who is also back here this week as a judge: <br /><br /><i>\"Every one of us, no matter our age or background, can make a difference. But change doesn’t happen overnight, and it often starts with a question. So look at the world around you, and challenge yourself to make something better.\"</i><br /><br />As for me, the Science Fair gave me the confidence to continue asking questions, developing a passion for science and engineering, and even to co-found <a href=\"http://playpiper.com/\">Piper</a>, a company focused on developing electrical engineering kits for kids to learn the basics of building hardware.

You might get recommendations from friends, professional travel guides, or online reviews — but figuring out how to squeeze everything you want to do into a finite window of time can be stressful, especially when you’re in a new place, often with limited access to the web. In fact, a <a href=\"http://goodthinkinc.com/huffpo-do-vacations-make-us-happier/\">GoodThink study</a> showed that 74% of travelers feel the most stressful aspect of travel is figuring out the details. <br /><br />We wanted to reduce the hassle and help travelers enjoy their hard-earned vacations. So today, we’re introducing a new mobile app to help you instantly plan each day of your trip with just a few taps of your finger: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/trips\">Google Trips</a>.  <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ign2GmVEflw\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br /><br />Google Trips is a personalized tour guide in your pocket. Each trip contains key categories of information, including day plans, reservations, things to do, food &amp; drink, and more, so you have everything you need at your fingertips. The entire app is available offline — simply tap the “Download” button under each trip to save it to your phone.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W4HCfoBp7No/V9x9tAhkiXI/AAAAAAAAS-8/D5UAPiWJTo4hPV-hG0ic2PGc5xJox9RzQCLcB/s1600/02_3_combo.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W4HCfoBp7No/V9x9tAhkiXI/AAAAAAAAS-8/D5UAPiWJTo4hPV-hG0ic2PGc5xJox9RzQCLcB/s640/02_3_combo.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><b>Choose your own adventure</b><br />For the top 200 cities in the world, Google Trips shows you a variety of day plans featuring the most popular daily itineraries. We’ve automatically assembled the most popular sights, attractions, and local gems into a full day’s tour — all based on historic visits by other travelers. Say you’re visiting Barcelona. You can choose from multiple day plans, like “Eixample District,” which maps out the can’t-miss buildings by Antoni Gaudi, the famous Spanish architect.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ck_mwUQmsY4/V9x944vTcxI/AAAAAAAAS_A/gJDda7S3r1MNvpc6ipdcaYTULiu_Pf1vQCLcB/s1600/06_61_combo.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ck_mwUQmsY4/V9x944vTcxI/AAAAAAAAS_A/gJDda7S3r1MNvpc6ipdcaYTULiu_Pf1vQCLcB/s640/06_61_combo.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><b>Plan each day of your trip like magic</b><br />Everyone has different interests and time constraints. No matter how popular an itinerary is, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for the perfect day or the perfect trip. Google Trips can help you build your day around places you already know you want to visit. <br /><br />Say your friends told you that you have to see the Sagrada Familia — and you’re looking for suggestions on things to do around that spot. Press the “+” button in the day plans tile to jump into a map view containing all the top attractions in your destination. If you’re time constrained, you can specify above the map whether you have just the morning or afternoon, versus a full day. Then simply tap and pin the Sagrada Familia to build your itinerary around it. Google Trips automatically fills in the day for you. If you want more options, tap the “magic wand” button for more nearby sights. You can pin any new spots you like, and if you want even more, each tap of the “magic wand” instantly gives you a new itinerary with updated nearby attractions like Palau Macaya or Parc del Guinardo, so you can build your own custom itinerary in minutes while munching on your morning churro.<br /><br />For more details on how this works on our <a href=\"http://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/the-280-year-old-algorithm-inside.html\">Research Blog</a>.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L6kA18j6qnM/V9x-AqFUK1I/AAAAAAAAS_E/iYEjOBI756EVd-rNV47wRlIhKgYfK-s4QCLcB/s1600/07_71_combo.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L6kA18j6qnM/V9x-AqFUK1I/AAAAAAAAS_E/iYEjOBI756EVd-rNV47wRlIhKgYfK-s4QCLcB/s640/07_71_combo.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><b>All your travel info, all in one place</b><br />Keeping track of all your flight, hotel, car and restaurant reservations when you travel can be tough.

Unlike any other technology or screen, VR can make you feel like you're somewhere else. Without a ticket, you can get <a href=\"https://youtube.googleblog.com/2016/04/one-step-closer-to-reality-introducing.html\">front row seats at Coachella</a> and visit a world-renowned museum to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH1AvqYXwHQ\">see extinct animals come back to life</a>. You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MQ9yG_QfDA\">take field trips to almost anywhere</a> and <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/09/cardboard-camera-ios.html\">capture vivid moments</a> you can revisit anytime. It’s transporting. <br /><br />At I/O this May, we announced <a href=\"https://vr.google.com/daydream/\">Daydream</a>, our platform for high-quality mobile VR. Our goal for Daydream is to simplify the complexity behind virtual reality. It should be mobile so you can easily carry it with you, and it should be friendly and accessible so everyone can enjoy using it. <br /><br />We’ve been working with developers, smartphone companies and content creators to make the dream a reality — and now, we’re excited to share updates across the three key elements of Daydream: smartphones, headsets and VR experiences. <br /><br /><b>Pixel, the first Daydream-ready phones</b><br />With Daydream, you simply pop a Daydream-ready phone in the headset to start exploring. Powered by Android 7.0 Nougat, Daydream-ready phones are built with high-resolution displays, powerful mobile processors and high-fidelity sensors—all tuned to support great VR experiences. Google’s newest <a href=\"https://madeby.google.com/phone\">Pixel and Pixel XL</a> are the first Daydream-ready phones, and there are a lot more on the way from leading Android smartphone makers.<br /><br /><b>Daydream View, the first Daydream-ready headset and controller</b><br />Today, we’re announcing <a href=\"https://madeby.google.com/daydreamview\">Daydream View</a>. Designed and developed by Google, it’s the first Daydream-ready headset and controller.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rLLAA4ENIP4\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br />Daydream View is:<br /><ul><li><b>Comfortable. </b>Inspired by the clothes we enjoy wearing, the headset is made with soft, breathable fabric. It is 30% lighter than similar devices and is designed to fit over eyeglasses.<br /></li><li><b>Easy to use.</b> Just drop in your Daydream-ready phone and you’ll be ready to go. The phone and headset have an auto-alignment system so you don’t have to worry about cables or connectors. <br /><br />A big part of what makes Daydream View special is the Daydream controller. This small yet powerful controller lets you interact with the virtual world the same way you do in the real world. It points where you point, and is packed with sensors to understand your movements and gestures. You can swing it like a bat or wave it like a wand. And it’s so precise that you can draw with it. The controller slides right inside the headset when not in use, so you don’t have to worry about losing it in your bag or between couch cushions.</li></ul><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n7jHLc4iPbQ/V_Q12_o328I/AAAAAAAATJI/3fbK2T9yYEoc8vXFD8kQwA-tO5j8YU-HACLcB/s1600/Headset-and-Controller-Knock-Knock.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n7jHLc4iPbQ/V_Q12_o328I/AAAAAAAATJI/3fbK2T9yYEoc8vXFD8kQwA-tO5j8YU-HACLcB/s640/Headset-and-Controller-Knock-Knock.gif\" width=\"640\" /></a><br /><ul><li><b>Yours. </b>Daydream View is designed with choice in mind.

Now both Spanish and English speakers will be able to get custom, state-by-state information on key registration deadlines, when to get to the polls, and even steps on how to vote early or by mail.
