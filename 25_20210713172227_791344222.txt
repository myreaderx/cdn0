I'll answer that question throughout this article, but it's something that's always factored into my thoughts, given my passion for design and now my career. I wonder if having “normal” vision would have made me a better artist growing up. Would it make me better at my job now? Would I have pursued a more design-oriented career, as opposed to one that’s more dev-focused? These are just some of the things that pop into my head.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>As to my job and my color vision, no, colorblindness doesn’t affect my work as much as you’d think. During design meetings, I can quickly point out areas where we need to reconsider our color palette. While reviewing layouts, I’m able to explain why we need to evaluate how—and if—we’re only conveying information with color. I like that I can bring a singular perspective to the table and a voice for others like me; I am able to offer insights that others don’t necessarily have. </p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>When you can see a larger set of colors, it’s easy to gloss over those issues because they’re functionally invisible in the moment. If a design team doesn’t have a member who sees color differently, it’s important they find a way to test with actual users who do. There is no substitute for the real thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Between workarounds anyone can use when color-sensitive situations crop up, and knowing how to separate myth from actual, smart usability practices for vision differences (and which design tools to use)—I want to set the record straight on a few things about designing with color and designing for color accessibility.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>What it means to be color blind</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The term <a href=\"https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/color-deficiency\"><em>color vision deficiency</em></a>,<em> </em>or CVD, more accurately reflects the type of impairment I have.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>When someone hears that I’m color blind, most immediately think that I can’t see colors whatsoever—that my entire field of vision is in grayscale, that I’m truly color <em>blind</em>. The term is very misleading and confusing because most people living with CVD are able to see many colors. (There <em>are</em> people who have a type of CVD called “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromacy\">monochromacy</a>,” which is complete color blindness. About 1 in 30,000 people are affected, and they see the world in shades of gray.) &nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Red-green color blindness is the most culturally-familiar type, but CVD is a lot more interesting and varies far more in definition.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>So what colors <em>can’t</em> you see?</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I have been asked this question more times than I can count. My answer is always the same: it’s practically impossible for me to say. For me personally, colors become harder to distinguish the less bold they are. I can attest with absolute certainty that the sky is blue, a stop sign is red, the grass is green, and Big Bird is yellow. I can <em>see</em> those colors because—whether by design or by mother nature—they’re bold. But start placing certain colors adjacent to each other, and it becomes more difficult for me. There are no colors that I <em>can’t</em> see, rather, certain colors become muddied and start blending together. It’s not the same for everyone; that’s just my version of CVD.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>As light sensors go, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20150727-what-are-the-limits-of-human-vision\">humans don’t have the best eyes for color</a>. Truth be told, they’re subpar compared to most species. WE are dismally color blind—as a species.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>On top of that, normal, “accurate” color vision varies from person to person; only minor anatomical differences determine whether your eyes are normal, “color blind,” or have extra (!) color vision powers. Let’s unpack all of that.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Without getting too technical, what I can tell you is that our retinas are responsible for our color vision. <a href=\"https://www.colour-blindness.com/general/how-it-works-science/\">Retinas have two main types of cells</a>: rods and cones. Rods are primarily responsible for reading brightness/intensity levels, while cones are more specialized for detail and for picking up a particular range of light wavelengths. A person considered to have normal color vision has three types of cones, one each for bandwidths of short, medium, and long wavelengths of light. The bandwidth each cone can perceive is shaped like a bell curve and is unique to <em>that</em> cone inside <em>your</em> eye, and there are overlaps between cones. Cones also don’t actually correspond to specific colors, but because long wavelengths fall more toward the red part of the spectrum, medium wavelengths hover closer to green, and short wavelengths tend toward blue, you’ll hear them called red, green, and blue cones, due to sheer convenience (Fig. 1).</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172396,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\"} --> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/light-spectrum-cone-wavelength-response-600x423-4.jpg\" alt=\"Spectral diagram of three bell curves (one each for short-, medium-, and long-wavelength cones), indicating their typical ranges and peak response points.\" class=\"wp-image-7172396\" /></a>\n <figcaption>\n  <br><b>Fig. 1.</b> Normalized cone response spectra in humans for short (S), medium (M), and long (L) wavelengths. Notice the overlapping nature of the bell curves, and that the peak sensitivity for each cone doesn’t neatly match up with red, green, and blue.</br>\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<!-- /wp:image --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Color vision deficiencies occur because one or more of these cones is missing or has limited sensitivity (such as a narrow range), or when color perception in the brain is influenced by various <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/a-designers-life-with-color-vision-deficiency/#colorperception\">other phenomena</a>. This means that those colors in the spectrum effectively “drop out,” but since the light is still there, the brain translates it into <em>a</em> color based on peripheral data picked up by the other cones, combined with its brightness level.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Since color vision is based on how our eyes and brain perceive light, and since our eyes have different genetic sensitivities to light, we can say that “accurate” color vision is somewhat subjective. Even people with “accurate” color vision don’t see things exactly the same way.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Some people even have a fourth cone cell in their retinas; \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy\">tetrachromats</a>\" have enhanced color differentiation due to extra sensitivity between red and green. The extra cone actually <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781854/\">came standard for most mammals in the past</a>, but ongoing studies have suggested that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140905-the-women-with-super-human-vision\">12% of the world's women</a> might still have this fourth type of cone.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>There are some colors and wavelengths we can’t see because our eyes don’t have the right sensors, but for others, it’s due to anatomical make-up. The lens and cornea physically block very short wavelengths; it's why we can’t see ultraviolet light directly, even though we have the sensor capability. For people with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/may/30/medicalscience.research\">aphakia</a> (lack of a lens in one or both eyes, whether congenital or due to surgical removal), that’s not a problem; they see the color variations in near ultraviolet light naturally.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>Inside look at living with CVDs</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I think each person who has a CVD has their own set of challenges. There are also a lot of commonly-experienced situations, social and professional obstacles, and forms of discrimination and bullying we’re expected to just quietly put up with.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Vision disabilities and color vision differences are often treated as quirky, entertaining phenomena on some mysterious map between normal vision and “blind.” People with CVDs encounter condescending remarks and dismissive treatment as part of daily life. It’s an invisible and misunderstood struggle that doesn’t have to be that way. I want to make a difference, and it fuels my desire to educate people on this topic.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Insults and passive-aggressive comments</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I’ve heard my fair share of passive-aggressive comments about my career choice. Also about my passion for art and design. Because <em>how could I possibly be a designer if I can’t see colors?</em>&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>A question like that is condescending on two levels. One, it’s as if no one should be allowed to be an artist unless they can see colors accurately. And two, it shows a complete insularity or misconstrued awareness about color vision deficiencies.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Nowadays, I work primarily as a front-end developer, but early on in my career, I designed web layouts in Photoshop. I didn’t code anything. I didn’t even write HTML. I never had an issue with colors because I was typically starting with a client’s corporate branding guidelines, so I was able to take those colors and use color palette generators to help me build out the look of my designs. I was never called out for making poor color choices, so I felt like I was doing a good job. It wasn’t until I was having a conversation with my boss, a man I looked up to as a professional, when I dropped my guard and mentioned that I was color blind. He then proceeded to question my entire decision to pursue the career I love. For a new professional, it was a pretty rough and demoralizing encounter to sit through and try to process, to say the least.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Justifying my skill set</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>It feels as though I have had to justify my career decisions and my skill set on a regular basis over the years—as if CVD prevents me from being good at my job. By and large, it’s truthfully not something that comes up most of the time in my day-to-day work.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>At this point, most coworkers only find out that I have a CVD if I talk about it. Sometimes I even get a kick out of seeing how many months can stretch out before a situation comes along where I can mention it. It’s become an increasingly minor issue over the years, what with updated software and web technologies I can put to use when needed.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Life via form factor (or winging it)</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Think for a moment about ways that color is used to convey information in the world around you. One thing that comes to my mind would be traffic lights. Color is used to let drivers know how they should proceed. No additional information is provided in case a driver is color blind. Traffic lights also use two of the colors most commonly associated with color blindness: red and green. Thankfully, most traffic lights have a common form factor. The top light is red, the middle light is yellow, and the bottom light is green. Even if I couldn’t tell the color, as long as I can tell which light is lit, then I’m able to get the necessary information.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Unfortunately, not all designs are created equal; there may be no secondary or supplemental indicator to go by. When something is only conveyed with color, that’s a gap where information can get lost on a large group of people.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Everyday social interactions</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Exchanging stories with others who grew up color blind sounds unfailingly familiar. Most of us have had similar experiences when it comes to people first finding out. As in part Q&amp;A, part dog and pony show.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>We’re <em>constantly</em> asked, “What color is this?” <em>(points to a nearby object)</em> and “What color does this look like?” Then we watch as the person who asked us the question has their MIND BLOWN because we can’t see the correct color. Meanwhile, getting the color correct can sometimes be worse. First, there’s a look of confusion on the asker’s face. They can’t comprehend how we can both be color blind <em>and</em> see color at the same time, which leads to even more questions and “tests.” It turns what could have been a brief exchange into a lengthy and technical conversation, maybe at a bad time or inconvenient location.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>What I ended up learning is that these encounters will never go away, since most people I come into contact with have no knowledge about color blindness. I can either get annoyed by getting asked so many questions, or I can use it as an opportunity to educate.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Getting passed over for jobs</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The first time I was passed over for a job specifically due to my CVD was when I was a teenager. It was a part-time job after school, and I was told—point-blank—it was because I’m color blind. A position had opened up in the frame shop at a big-box crafts store I’d been working at for over a year. After having been told I was getting the position, my boss somehow found out I’m color blind, then informed me that I wasn’t qualified to work in the frames department for that very reason. That was it, no discussion. I had to watch the position go to one of my coworkers.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>That may have been a minor blip on my teenage radar at the time, but little did I realize it was the first of many. Between the discrimination and frustration I dealt with at various jobs over the years, I eventually convinced myself to not tell new employers or coworkers about my color vision deficiency. I wasn’t going to lie about it if I got asked, but I wasn’t going to offer up that information unsolicited.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>After working in the web industry for many years, I eventually transitioned to a new approach. At this point, I have successfully proven to myself that my color vision deficiency doesn’t negatively impact my job, and that bringing it up via the lens of accessibility makes it more of a natural thing I can discuss with coworkers so we can put it to constructive use on projects.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>Inside look at how I do my job</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Relying on tools for help</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Being a professional front-end developer and designer with a CVD is easier than ever because there are so many tools and resources out there. Professionally, I have relied on color picker tools, websites that offer predefined color combinations, image editing software, and the mere fact that all colors can be represented by a hexadecimal value.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>In front-end tasks, I’m able to modify my code editor to suit my needs, for instance. I can use light or dark mode and a wide variety of color themes. I often use high-contrast themes that have been thoughtfully designed for developers with color vision deficiencies.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Tools and resources I use regularly:</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:list --> \n<ul>\n <li><strong>Trello — </strong>Trello has a nice item labelling feature that takes CVDs into consideration. Not only can users label cards based on color, they can also use stripes, zigzags, polka dots, squiggly lines, and other shapes.</li>\n <li><strong>VSCode — </strong>Visual Studio Code is my preferred code editor. I’m able to customize the interface with pre-built themes, and I can further modify those themes if I need to. I’m currently using one called Vue Theme, which I feel works really well for me. I choose themes based on what feels like the appropriate color contrast for my specific color vision deficiency. I lean toward dark backgrounds with brighter, higher-contrasting text colors that stand out against the background color. Another one of my favorites is <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl\">Sarah Drasner</a>’<a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl\">s Night Owl theme</a>.</li>\n <li><strong>Dev Tools — </strong>Whether it’s Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, I am constantly in the browser’s dev tools. There’s an ever-increasing number of features in dev tools that I can use to get the color information I need. Something I find handy is being able to Shift + click on a color value to cycle through various color formats (3 digit and 6 digit hexadecimal, RGB, HSL, and color name).</li>\n <li><strong>Color Pickers</strong> — I installed a color picker Chrome browser extension called <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka?hl=en\">Eye Dropper</a> to help me quickly grab colors from web pages. It allows me to sample colors from any web page, and provides me with the color in every format. This provides me with a secondary reassurance that the color I wrote in my CSS is truly being rendered. I wish I could trust the code as I see it in dev tools, but occasionally my eyes play tricks on me—I would swear that the color I’m seeing rendered on the screen isn’t the color value in dev tools. When I think that’s the issue, I can just grab the eye dropper and triple-check.</li>\n <li><strong>Contrast Checker — </strong>I use the <a href=\"https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a> to make sure that the colors I’m using are in compliance with the guidelines.</li>\n</ul> \n<!-- /wp:list --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>Accessibility and inclusion</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Statistically, 1 out of every 12 men and 1 out of every 200 women have a color vision deficiency. Across the world, <a href=\"http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/\">approximately 300 million people are color blind</a>. Those are significant numbers to factor in, especially if all those users are hampered by usability issues. Color alone can prevent them from completing interactions, receiving pertinent information, and from having the same experience as users with better color vision. That last fact alone is reason enough to pay attention to the concerns outlined here.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Color disabilities and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ada.gov/\">ADA</a> doesn’t specifically call out color blindness; it simply refers to visual disabilities. However, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color\">(WCAG) does specifically mention color</a>. Compliance with the WCAG helps as a first step toward ensuring your site is usable by everyone, regardless of disabilities, but keep in mind that there could be additional factors at play with your site which may be “compliant” but still create difficulties for users.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Color contrast</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>For those of us who have a CVD, one of the more prevalent issues is a site’s color <em>contrast</em>; trouble with specific colors doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll have trouble with the site.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>If a site doesn’t have the proper color contrast ratio (text color on top of background color), then the site’s information may be more difficult to see or understand. WebAIM, a non-profit organization, published reports in 2019 and 2020 outlining <a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/\">accessibility issues in the top one million home pages</a>. As of February 2020, 86.3% of home pages tested had insufficient contrast.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>So, what does that mean? It means that the information on those sites is not being conveyed equally, to everyone. That’s <a href=\"https://majestic.com/reports/majestic-million\">863,000 of the most influential and high-traffic sites</a> on the web delivering an unequal user experience to billions of users worldwide on a daily basis.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Data visualization</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Color contrast is not the only issue when it comes to color blindness and accessibility. Data visualization is one area in particular that often relies heavily on color to convey information. It is also a prime example of what the WCAG mentions in their success criteria:&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:quote {\"className\":\"is-style-default\"} --> \n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\">\n <p>Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. </p>\n <cite>– Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 - Success Criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color</cite>\n</blockquote> \n<!-- /wp:quote --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I follow a few accounts on Twitter that bring attention to improper use of color in data visualizations. I would recommend getting started with these—they provide a lot of useful information and raise awareness surrounding issues that those of us with a CVD face:</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:list --> \n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/colourblindorg\">@colourblindorg</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeAreColorblind\">@wearecolorblind</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeTheColorBlind\">@WeTheColorBlind</a>.</li>\n</ul> \n<!-- /wp:list --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Thankfully, making charts, graphs, and other visual aids color accessible isn’t that difficult. There is no need to remove colors altogether. Just try to use colorblind-friendly color palettes and don’t use problematic color combinations. Make sure all the data in your charts is labeled appropriately so that your readers can get the information in multiple ways. <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\">Our World in Data</a>—a scientific online publication that focuses on large global problems such as poverty, disease, climate change, war, and inequality—has great examples of data visualizations of all types that I would consider to be colorblind-friendly.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Whenever possible, I try to provide feedback from the perspective of someone who has a CVD, but I don’t make recommendations for specific color changes; I leave the color choices to those who aren’t color blind. Instead, I describe which elements I find difficult to interpret, and why. I tell them which information is getting lost on someone like me. The hope is that my feedback informs other designers of the need to make charts, tables, graphs, and maps more inclusive.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>Adding people with a CVD to your team</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>As far as those of us who do have a CVD and work in the web industry: we are just as skilled and knowledgeable about our professions as anyone else, and there are plenty of ways that we can contribute to the visual aspects of projects—<em>especially</em> regarding color. We have the ability to review designs and report back whether any information is getting lost due to poor color contrast. We can inform designers if the chosen color palette is problematic. We can be the test subjects for our fellow UX designers during their usability research.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>There is also another point I’d like to get across here. There is a common misconception that a designer with a CVD doesn’t have the ability to do their job effectively. Hiring managers and other coworkers often make this assumption. Much to the contrary, people with CVDs have ways they work smart to work around their limitations. I mentioned earlier about the different tools I personally use to help me in my job. There are plenty of web industry professionals like me who use features in the tools at their disposal, getting the job done right, and so seamlessly that no one would guess they are color blind.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>That brings me to a broader point—the importance of hiring people with disabilities. I won’t go into the many, many, <em>many</em> reasons why companies should do that. Rather, I’ll mention some of the benefits from a design perspective.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>First and foremost, if you don’t have a disability, then how can you say conclusively that you know your product will work for those who do?&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The answer is, you can’t. Not without proper testing. Sure, there are companies out there that can help designers and developers conduct usability tests. But how amazing would it be if you had team members who could provide you with that invaluable feedback throughout the duration of each project? Think about all the knowledge you’ve accumulated about your profession. Think about all of the wisdom you can teach others. Now think about all the knowledge and wisdom that could be passed on to you by teammates living with a disability. Together, you can make your products truly inclusive. Trying to do it separately will always produce and reinforce limitations.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2>Critical CVD tips for your projects</h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Color can enhance the message, but shouldn’t be the messenger. UX and UI designers have within their power the ability to take color blindness into consideration—or to ignore it. You can make sure information is conveyed to everyone, not just people who see color “normally.” That is a great responsibility, with real life-or-death repercussions at stake for many users.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>For those of us in the web industry, there are specific action items I’d like you to take away from all this.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Design color palettes for “everyone”</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Carefully plan your color palette—not for those who are color blind, but for <em>everyone</em>. Always keep in mind that ALL the information you provide in your product needs to be easy to recognize and easy to understand by anyone who touches it. We can get too familiar with what we’re doing and forget that information is delivered in multifaceted ways, so we need to be mindful of what’s specifically being conveyed by color.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I highly recommend Geri Coady’s book, <a href=\"https://abookapart.com/products/color-accessibility-workflows\"><em>Color Accessibility Workflows</em></a>; it’s a fantastic resource. In it, she discusses color blindness, choosing appropriate color, compliance and testing, implementation, providing alternatives, and she includes some tips and tricks.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Don’t assume, and be careful what you ask&nbsp;</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Do not assume which colors are difficult to see—actually do the research and testing. At minimum, please <a href=\"https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\">check the color contrast in your layout</a>.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The reason I say that is because although the ADA doesn’t call out color blindness specifically, it does call out visual disabilities. In the U.S., it is illegal in the workplace (not to mention insulting and unwise) to ask people if they have a disability. In my book, that also applies to color blindness, and while it may not be illegal to ask in non-work contexts, it is definitely personally intrusive.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>However, if people volunteer to help you with your testing and they offer up that information about themselves, that’s a different matter. It may also be a good idea to reach out to some companies that specialize in user testing with people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.levelaccess.com/\">Level Access</a> help organizations incorporate accessibility into their daily workflows. They offer tailored training, auditing services, document remediation, and other services to help organizations achieve—and maintain—compliance with <a href=\"https://section508.gov\">Section 508</a> and the WCAG.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --> \n<h3>Test with colorblind simulators AND colorblind users</h3> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Don’t rely on colorblind simulators alone. I could write an essay about this topic.

But here’s the cold, hard truth, friend: if you want to work on design systems, you don’t have a choice. Someone has to pay for your time, and that means someone has to sell what you do to an audience that speaks value in an entirely different language.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s not exactly easy to connect the benefits of a design system directly to revenue. With an ecomm site, you can add a feature and measure the impact. With other conversion-based digital experiences, if your work is good, your customers will convert more. But because a design system is (usually) an internal tool, it’s just harder to connect those dots.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This article boils down the methods I’ve put into practice convincing executives not just to fund the initial push of design system work, but to <em>keep funding it</em>. I’ll share how I’ve adjusted the language I use to describe common design system benefits, allowing me to more clearly communicate with decision makers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Know your audience</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In my experience, design systems can be owned by information technology teams, marketing and communications departments, or (best case scenario) cross-disciplinary teams that bring many specialists together. The first thing you need to do is determine where the system lives, as in which department owns and cares for it.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If it’s part of IT, for example, you need to think like a CIO or an IT Director and speak to their objectives and values. These leaders are typically more <em>internally</em> focused; they’ll filter the value of the design system in terms of the employees of the company. In contrast, if the system belongs to Marketing, put on your CMO or Marketing Director hat. Marketing teams are often <em>externally</em> focused; they think in terms of B2B audiences and end users.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The way organizations structure the ownership of a design system can be more complex, but let’s use these two paths (internal vs external) as frameworks for building a persuasive case for those owners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Internal-orientation motivators</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2020/\">Based on the research we’ve done since 2018</a>, there are three very specific internal motivators for having a design system:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Efficiency</li><li>Onboarding</li><li>Scale.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Efficiency benefit</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Design systems allow for the rapid prototyping of new ideas using existing, production-ready components. They allow teams to reuse design and code, and they allow individuals to focus their creative energy on new problems instead of wasting it on old ones. Executives and decision-makers may abstractly understand all that, but you need to be able to tell them what it will take to realize the efficiency benefit.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s a theoretical maximum to how productive a team can be. When you talk about a design system creating more efficiency in your processes, you’re really talking about raising the ceiling on that max. As happens with so many things in life, though, that comes with a trade-off. Early on, while a team is actually building the system, they won’t be as productive on the rest of their work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The efficiency curve looks like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172722,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ala-ds-efficiency-1-e1612891151253.png?w=960\" alt=\"The Design System Efficiency Curve.

Starting at 0,0 productivity dips down as the team diverts resources to set up the system, but eventually surpasses standard productivity once the system is in place.\" class=\"wp-image-7172722\" /><figcaption><em><strong>Figure 1.</strong> With Productivity on the y-axis and Time on the x-axis, the Design System Efficiency Curve dips down at the start as the team ramps up on the system, but eventually surpasses standard productivity once the system is in place.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re talking to an executive, it’s important to acknowledge this dip in productivity.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spend some time working out these specific calculations for your organization. For example, you might need four team members for three months to reach a point where the system will save everyone on the team approximately two hours per week. You’re candidly acknowledging the necessary investment while demonstrating the eventual benefits. And make sure to mention that the productivity benefits will continue indefinitely! The math will almost always end up on your side.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another critical point to raise is that simply having a design system has a cumulative effect on the efficiency of your teams. Since the system is an internal tool that can be used 1) across multiple products or experiences, 2) by many teams throughout the organization, and 3) in many phases of the product design and development process, you are gaining efficiencies on many levels.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The team working on in-store kiosks can build their interface with a well-tested set of components. Your UX people can use the system to prototype and test with production-ready code. The people responsible for grooming the backlog know there is a stable pattern library upon which they are building new features or fixing old ones. Anyone looking for answers to what, why, or how your organization designs and builds products will find those answers in the living system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The efficiency at each of these (and many other) decision points is how we can raise the ceiling on our <em>total</em> possible efficiency. How this plays out is very different in each organization. I’m here to tell you that part of the work is thinking about how a design system will impact <em>every</em> part of your process—not just design or development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What to measure</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Action: Measure the cost of productivity with and without a design system.</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you aren’t already, start measuring how productive your team is now. The easiest way to do this is to break your team’s work down into measurable cycles. Once you have a rough idea of how much you can get done in a cycle of work, you’ll be able to compare your efficiency before the system was in place with your efficiency after. This kind of measurable benefit will speak volumes to your executive team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Onboarding benefits</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Growth is expensive. When you hire a new team member, you don’t just supply a salary and benefits. You need a computer, a desk, a chair, accounts to all the software/services…the list goes on. And all these expenses hit before your new employee is a fully contributing member of the team. You won’t start to recoup your investment for a few months, at least.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Design systems can reduce the time it takes your new hire to become a productive contributor. Once you have a healthy design system in place, you’re able to provide an employee with a clearly-defined and effective toolset that is well-documented and can be applied across multiple initiatives. More specifically, assigning new hires to start out working on the design system team will allow them to quickly learn how your organization designs and builds digital products.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172723,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ala-ds-onboarding-e1612891563971.png?w=960\" alt=\"Onboarding Model.

As you hire individuals, you can bring them into the design system team, where they’ll gain a deep understanding of how your organization builds digital products. Once they’re up to speed, you can seamlessly move them to another product, discipline, or feature-based team where they’ll take this knowledge and hit the ground running. Additionally, your organization can benefit from having all team members (even those who have been around for a while) periodically work a rotation with the design system team. This continuously spreads the design system<em> </em>expertise around the organization and makes it part of the fabric of how you work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And don’t think this approach is only valuable for designers or developers. A healthy design system team comprises people from many disciplines. In addition to team member rotation, building in time to mentor folks from many different disciplines can prove tremendously valuable in the long run. A highly functional design system team can serve as an ideal model of workflow and can educate many team members dispersed throughout the organization about how to approach their work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Believe me, executives’ eyes will light up when you share how a design system can ensure high productivity in record time. As a caution, though, rotating people in and out of any team <em>too</em> often can leave them feeling exhausted and can make it hard for them to be productive. Remember, you have the flexibility to scale this to a level that makes sense for your team. Be smart and use this approach as it works in your context.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What to measure</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Action: Measure the time it takes for teams to become productive.</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As new people are added, a team typically returns to the “forming” stage of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development\">Tuckman’s stages of group development</a>. This is part of the reason that growth is expensive. But with a design system in place and a healthy culture, you can reduce the time it takes the team to get back to “performing.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Scale benefits</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Traditionally, you have to hire more people to scale productivity. A design system enables a team to accomplish more with less. <a href=\"https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/2019/#table3a\">Reusability is a major reason</a> teams choose to work in a more systematic way. Small teams with an effective system can design, build, and maintain hundreds of sites each year. They’d never come close without a design system to work with.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>UX Pin has a <a href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/create-design-system-guide/\">design system guide</a> that starts by acknowledging something that most of us ignore.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Scaling design through hiring, without putting standards in place, is a myth. With every new hire, new ideas for color palettes, typography and patterns appear in the product, growing the inconsistency and increasing the maintenance cost. Every new hire increases the design entropy<em>.</em></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A well-executed system allows a team to scale while keeping design entropy at bay.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What to measure</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Action: Compare the amount of people on your team to the amount of work they are accomplishing.</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Adding people to a team doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll get more work done faster. This is well-documented in historical software books like Fred Brooks’ <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#The_mythical_man-month\"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></a>. Eventually, you will have to investigate changing other factors (besides just adding more people) to increase productivity. A good design system can be one of these factors that increases the productivity of the team members you already have. It’s this change in productivity over scale that you need to measure and compare in order to prove value for this benefit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>External-orientation motivators</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s shift to thinking about the benefits that a design system offers to end-users. The four primary external motivators are:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Consistency</li><li>Trust</li><li>Accessibility</li><li>Usability.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Consistency and Trust benefits</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consistency is widely assumed to be the primary benefit of a design system. We identify dozens of button designs, color variations, and inconsistent typefaces in hopes of convincing higher-ups to allow us to build a system to bring it all in line. After working on design systems for the last five or six years, I can say with confidence that a design system will not make your product more consistent.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You see, us web designers and developers are very scrappy. We can create the most inconsistent experiences within even the most rigid systems. It’s not the system itself that creates consistency, it’s the culture of an organization. It’s all of the unspoken expectations—the filters through which we make decisions—that give us the confidence to pause and ask if the work we’re doing fits <em>culturally</em> with the product we’re building. A good CMO knows this, and they won’t buy the oversimplified idea that a design system will solve the rampant inconsistencies in our work.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because of this, these executives often have a different (and easier to measure) question: “Does it convert?” This perspective and line of conversation is not an ideal approach. Believe me, we can create experiences that convert but are not good for our users or our brands. Given this, a conversation with your CMO might go better if you <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/being-real-builds-trust/\">shift the language to talk about trust</a> instead.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With inconsistent experiences, your <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/omnichannel-consistency/\">users subconsciously lose trust</a> in your brand. They’ve been conditioned to expect a certain kind of user experience, and that’s what they should be given, even across multiple websites or products. Vanessa Mitchell wrote about <a href=\"https://www.cmo.com.au/article/642102/why-customer-trust-more-vital-brand-survival-than-it-ever-been/\">why brand trust is more vital to survival now</a> than it’s ever been:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Brand trust as an ‘“insurance policy”’ against future issues is not a new concept. Most organizations know trust bestowed by the consumer can not only make or break a business, it can also ensure you survive a problem in the future. But few achieve brand trust adequately, preferring to pay lip service rather than delve into what it really means: Authentically caring about customers and their needs.”</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When your customer is using your product to accomplish a very specific task, <em>that one task is the only thing that matters to them.</em> Creating a consistent experience that works for everyone and allows them to accomplish their goals <em>is</em> building trust. CMOs need to understand how design systems empower trusted relationships so those relationships contribute to your bottom line.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What to measure</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Action: Measure the engagement of your customers.</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Customer engagement can be measured with web analytics platforms. What you’re looking for will vary depending on the context for your organization, but trends in things like time on site, visit frequency, subscription rates, and bounce rates will give you meaningful data to work with. It’s also very common to track customer engagement with metrics like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter\">Net Promoter Score</a> (NPS) by asking simple questions of customers repeatedly over time. There are so many ways to structure tests of the usability of your work, so I’d encourage you to loop in the UX team to help you find tests that will demonstrate the user engagement success of the design system effort.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Accessibility benefits</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Accessibility can be a tremendous benefit of a design system. Do the work properly the first time, then allow that beautifully accessible component to serve your customers each time it is used. Certainly, it’s not a fail-safe measure—there is still integration-level testing to ensure component accessibility translates to the larger experience—but ensuring the accessibility of individual components will result in more accessible experiences. And integrating good accessibility practices into your system means more folks within your organization are aligned with this important work.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You might find at first that marketers aren’t all that interested in accessibility, but they should be. Did you know that there were 814 <a href=\"https://blog.usablenet.com/2018-ada-web-accessibility-lawsuit-recap-report\">web accessibility related lawsuits</a> (just in the US!) in 2017? Did you know that there were almost 2,300 in 2018? That’s a <strong>181% increase</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html\">This must be a priority</a>. First, because it’s the right thing to do. Second, because it’s important to the sustainability of the business. A design system can help you address this issue, <em>and</em> it can help you maintain compliance as you grow. This is the kind of message that resonates with leadership.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What to Measure</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Action: Measure your compliance to accessibility guidelines over time.</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many organizations have a regular cadence of accessibility audits across their digital properties. While some of this can be automated, there’s always a manual aspect needed to truly evaluate the accessibility of a site or application. Tracking how often regressions occur in the properties served by your design system can be a great way to demonstrate the value that system is bringing to the organization.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Usability benefits</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As with so many aspects of a design system, usability benefits come from repetition. Design system pros often hope to focus energy on solving a usability challenge <em>only once</em> before moving on to the next problem. This absolutely is a benefit of a well-constructed system. It’s also very true that “familiarity breeds usability.” Your customers will learn to use your products and begin to subconsciously rely on that familiarity with the experience to lower their cognitive load. This should be just as important to our executive leadership as it is to those of us who are practitioners.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can also reframe this benefit in the context of conversion. Helping our users accomplish their goals is helping them convert. They are there to use your product. So make it easy to do, and they’ll do it more. This is what businesses need and what executives want to see—improving the business by helping customers. As mentioned above, we want to make sure we’re doing this in healthy ways for both our users and our brands.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What to Measure</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Action: This might be the easiest one—measure conversion!</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Running usability studies will help to validate and measure the success of your work with the system, which many organizations are already doing. Your goal should be to validate that components are usable, which will allow you to build a culture of user-centered design. Setting the bar for what it takes to evolve the system—such as requiring that changes are tested with real users—introduces this idea into the core of all your processes, where it should be.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Sell investment, not cost</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Knowing how and which internal and external motivators to touch on during conversations is significant, but there’s one last thing I’d like to mention, and it has to do with your way of thinking. A major factor in many of these conversations lies simply in how we frame things: move the conversation about the cost of building a design system into a conversation about the present and residual benefits of the investment you’re making. It’s easy to view the time and effort required to build a system as an investment in ultimately delivering high-quality digital products. But leadership will be more willing to consider realistic budgets and timelines if you talk about it like a long-term investment that has benefits on multiple levels throughout the business.

Structuring your conversation around topics most familiar to the other person and reflecting their core values can help us be more successful in improving their product.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Ask with values in mind, close with opportunities (Element 3)</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I recently attended an excellent event on “Speaking Truth to Power,” presented by the Canada School of Public Service. The keynote speaker, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/takisarantakis?lang=en\">Taki Sarantakis</a>, shared his strategies for how to be an effective expert and advisor, such as:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Be credible and build trust</li><li>Have humility and empathy</li><li>Make sure that the person you are advising understands that the advice they do not want to hear is for their benefit.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He also broke down a few concepts that could be a barrier to implementing this advice. If we see ourselves as “speaking truth to power” we are likely making a values judgement. We believe and project to others that <strong>we have all truth and no power</strong>, while the person on the other end <strong>has all the power, and no truth</strong>. It’s an arrogant position that weakens our ability to make any productive progress. Framing our interactions as a battle will likely result in a lose-lose situation.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sarantakis then presents an example conversation that is rooted in credibility and humility, and comes from a place of care. He underscores that any advice you choose to share has to absolutely come from a place of concern for the person making a final decision, and not from a desire to show off and say so on record. It roughly looks like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Here is what you need to know...</li><li>You know X, but you may not know Y and Z.</li><li>I know this is something you may not want to hear, but I need to say it because<strong> it is important that you know this</strong>.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As part of the panel discussion that followed the keynote, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/relishing?lang=en\">Kym Shumsky</a>, who has lots of experience advising senior leaders, reinforced Sarantakis points by stating that valuing truth, knowledge, and accuracy over relationship-building can be detrimental. Thinking back on my personal experiences, I fully agree.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So how do we build trust, credibility, and share from a place of care? Steve Bryant, Head of Content at <a href=\"https://articlegroup.com/\">Article Group</a>, has some thought-provoking words on this in his article “<a href=\"https://medium.com/article-group/make-relationships-not-things-4c20df2fb249\">Make relationships, not things</a>”:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Relationships are based on trust.

Beginning with questions allows you to set aside the expert hat, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/09/curiosity\">be curious</a>, and let the client share their experiences.

They also are not able to browse all activities by type of recreation, like “nature” activities, which might include hiking, city tours, birdwatching, garden events, and festivals. They often do not know what terminology to use to search for events and activities, so they say it is difficult to find things they already do not know about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>You:</strong> <em>How do you think this makes them feel?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Partner:</strong> They say this frustrates them, as information on other websites might differ from the information in our system and they end up wasting their time guessing which one is correct and up-to-date.

But we’ll get back to Rails in a bit...</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>This all started with web frameworks...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Web frameworks burst onto the scene around 2005 amidst a sea of mostly figure-it-out-for-yourself scripting language libraries glued together and thrown onto hand-maintained Apache servers. This new architecture promised developers a more holistic approach that wrapped up all the fiddly stuff in no-touch conventions, freeing developers to focus on programming ergonomics, code readability, and fast-to-market features. All a developer had to do was learn the framework’s core language, get up to speed on the framework itself and its conventions, and then start churning out sophisticated web apps while their friends were still writing XML configuration files for all those <em>other</em> approaches.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the early criticisms that always plague new approaches, these server-rendered frameworks became tools of choice, especially for fast-moving startups—strapped for resources—that needed an attractive, feature-rich app up <em>yesterday</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>But then the <em>JavaScript everything</em> notion took hold...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the web development world pushed deeper into the 2010s, the tides began to turn, and server-rendered frameworks took something of a backseat to the Single Page Application, wholly built in JavaScript and run entirely on the client’s computer. At many companies, the “server” became relegated to hosting an API data service only, with most of the business logic and all of the HTML rendering happening on the client, courtesy of the big ’ol package of JavaScript that visitors were forced to download when they first hit the site.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is where things started to get ugly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fast-forward to 2020 and the <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/\">web isn’t getting any faster</a>, as we were promised it would with SPAs. Shoving megabytes of JavaScript down an iPhone 4’s throat doesn’t make for a great user experience. And if you thought building a professional web app took serious resources, what about building a web app <em>and</em> an API service <em>and</em> a communication layer between them? Do we really believe that every one of our users is going to have a device capable of digesting 100 kB of JSON and rendering a complicated HTML table <em>faster</em> than a server-side app could on even a mid-grade server?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Developing and hosting these JavaScript-forward apps didn’t get any cheaper either. In many cases we’re now doing twice the work, and maybe even paying twice the developers, to achieve the same results we had before with server-side app development.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2005, app frameworks blew everyone’s minds with “build a blog app in 15 minutes” videos. Fifteen years <em>later</em>, doing the same thing with an SPA approach can require two codebases, a JSON serialization layer, and dozens of spinners all over the place so we can still claim a 50ms First Contentful Paint. Meanwhile, the user watches some blank gray boxes, hoping for HTML to finally render from all the JSON their browser is requesting and digesting.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How did we get here? This is not my beautiful house! Were we smart in giving up all of that server-rendered <em>developer happiness</em> and doubling down on staff and the time to implement in order to chase the promise of providing our users some fancier user interfaces?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well. Yes. Sort of.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’re not building web software for <em>us</em>. We’re building it for <em>them</em>. The users of our software have expectations of how it’s going to work for <em>them</em>. We have to meet them where they are. Our users are no longer excited about full-page refreshes and ugly Rube Goldberg-ian multi-form workflows. The SPA approach was the next logical leap from piles of unorganized spaghetti JavaScript living on the server. The problem, though: it was a 5% improvement, not a 500% improvement.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Is 5% better worth twice the work? What about the developer cost?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bedazzling the web app certainly makes things <em>fancier</em> from the user’s perspective. Done well, it can make the app feel slicker and more interactive, and it opens up a wealth of new non-native interaction elements. Canonizing those elements as <em>components</em> was the next natural evolution. Gone are the days of thinking through how an entire HTML document could be mutated to give the <em>illusion</em> of the user interacting with an atomic widget on the page—now, that can be implemented directly, and we can think about our UX in terms of component breakdowns. But, alas, the costs begin to bite us almost immediately.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go ahead, write that slick little rating stars component. Add some cool animations, make the mouseover and click area feel good, give some endorphin-generating feedback when a selection is made. But now what? In a real app, we need to <em>persist</em> that change, right? The database has to be changed to reflect this new state, and the app in front of the user’s eyes needs to reflect that new reality too.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the old days, we’d give the user a couple star GIFs, each a link that hit the same server endpoint with a different param value. Server-side, we’d save that change to the database, then send back a whole new HTML page for their browser to re-render; maybe we’d even get fancy and use AJAX to do it <em>behind the scenes</em>, obviating the need for the full HTML and render. Let’s say the former costs <em>x</em> in developer time and salary (and we won’t even talk about lost opportunity cost for features rolled out too late for the market). In that case, the fancy AJAX-based approach costs <em>x</em> + <em>n (you know, some “extra JavaScript sprinkles”)</em>, but the cost of lots and lots of <em>n</em> grows as our app becomes more and more of a JavaScript spaghetti sprinkles mess.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over in the SPA world, we’re now writing JavaScript in the client-side app and using JSX or Handlebars templates to render the component, then code to persist that change to the front-end data store, then a PUT request to the API, where we’re also writing an API endpoint to handle the request, a JSON serializer (probably with its own pseudo-template) to package up our successful response, and then front-end code to ensure we re-render the component (and some branching logic to maybe rollback and re-render the client-side state change if the backend failed on us). This costs a lot more than even <em>x + n </em>in developer time and salary. And if you’ve split your team into “front-end” and “back-end” people, you might as well go ahead and double <em>that</em> cost (both time and money) for many non-trivial components where you need two different people to finish the implementation. Sure, the SPA mitigates some of the ever-growing spaghetti problem, but at what cost for a business racing to be relevant in the market or get something important out to the people who need it?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the other arguments we hear in support of the SPA is the reduction in cost of cyber infrastructure. As if pushing that hosting burden onto the client (without their consent, for the most part, but that’s another topic) is somehow saving us on our cloud bills. But that’s ridiculous. For any non-trivial application, you’re still paying for a server to host the API and maybe another for the database, not to mention load balancers, DNS, etc. And here’s the thing: <em>none of that cost even comes close to what a software company pays its developers!</em> Seriously, think about it. I’ve yet to work at any business where our technical infrastructure was anything more than a fraction of our salary overhead. And good developers expect raises. Cloud servers generally just get <em>cheaper</em> over time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want to be efficient with your money—especially as a cash-strapped startup—you don’t need to cheap out on cloud servers; you need to get <em>more features faster out of your existing high-performance team</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the old, old days, before the web frameworks, you’d pay a developer for six weeks to finally unveil…the log-in page. Cue the sad trombone. Then frameworks made that log-in page an hour of work, total, and people were launching web startups overnight. The trumpets sound! Now, with our SPA approach, we’re back to a bunch of extra work. <em>It’s costing us more money because we’re writing two apps at once</em>. There’s that trombone again...</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’re paying a lot of money for that 5% user experience improvement.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But what if we could take the best client-side JavaScript ideas and libraries from that 5% improvement and reconnect them with the developer ergonomics and salary savings of a single codebase? What if components and organized JavaScript could all live in one rock-solid app framework optimized for server-side rendering? What if there <em>is</em> a path to a 500% jump?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sound impossible? It’s not. I’ve seen it, like C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. I’ve built that 500% app, in my free time, with my kids running around behind me barking like dogs. Push broadcasts to logged-in users. Instant updates to the client-side DOM in milliseconds. JavaScript-driven 3D animations that interact with real-time chat windows. All in a single codebase, running on the same server hardware I’d use for a “classic” server-rendered app (and maybe I can even scale that hardware down since I’m rendering HTML fragments more often than full-page documents). No separate front-end app. Clean, componentized JavaScript and server-side code, married like peanut butter and jelly. It’s real, I tell you!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Socket to me! (Get it? Get it? Ah, nevermind...)</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finalized in 2011, support for WebSockets in modern browsers ramped up throughout the 2010s and is now fully supported in all modern browsers. With the help of a small bit of client-side JavaScript, you get a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_(telecommunications)#FULL-DUPLEX\">full-duplex</a> socket connection between browser and server. Data can pass both ways, and can be pushed from either side at any time, no user-initiated request needed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like the game industry’s ever-expanding moves into cloud-based gaming, the future of web apps is not going to be about pushing even heavier obligations onto the user/client, but rather the opposite: let the client act as a thin terminal that renders the state of things for the human. WebSockets provide the communication layer, seamless and fast; a direct shot from the server to the human.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this wasn’t terribly easy for many developers to grok at first. I sure didn’t. And the benefits weren’t exactly clear either. After years (decades, even) of wrapping our heads around the HTTP request cycle, to which all server-handled features must conform, adopting this WebSocket tech layer required a lot of head scratching. As with many clever new technologies or protocols, we needed a higher-level abstraction that provided something really effective for getting a new feature in front of a user, fast.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Enter HTML-over-WebSockets...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Want a hyper-responsive datalist typeahead that is perfectly synced with the database? On every keystroke, send a query down the WebSocket and get back <em>precisely</em> the changed set of <strong>option</strong> tags, nothing more, nothing less.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How about client-side validations? Easy. On every input change, round up the form values and send ’em down the WebSocket. Let your server framework validate and send back changes to the HTML of the form, including any errors that need to be rendered. No need for JSON or complicated error objects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>User presence indicators? Dead simple. Just check who has an active socket connection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What about multi-user chat? Or document collaboration? In classic frameworks and SPAs, these are the features we put off because of their difficulty and the code acrobatics needed to keep everyone’s states aligned. With HTML-over-the-wire, we’re just pushing tiny bits of HTML based on one user’s changes to <em>every other</em> <em>user</em> currently subscribed to the channel. They’ll see <em>exactly</em> the same thing as if they hit refresh and asked the server for the entire HTML page anew. And you can get those bits to every user in under 30ms.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’re not throwing away the promise of components either. Where this WebSockets-based approach can be seen as a thick server/thin client, so too can our components. It’s fractal, baby! Make that component <em>do</em> delightful things for the user with smart JavaScript, and then just ask the server for updated HTML, and mutate the DOM. No need for a client-side data store to manage the component’s state since it’ll render itself to look <em>exactly like what the server knows it should look like now</em>. The HTML comes from the server, so no need for JSX or Handlebars or &#60;insert other JavaScript templating library here&#62;. The server is always in control: rendering the initial component’s appearance <em>and</em> updating it in response to any state change, all through the socket.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And there’s nothing saying you have to use those socket channels to send <em>only</em> HTML. Send a tiny bit of text, and have the client do something smart. Send a chat message from one user to every other user, and have their individual clients render that message in whatever app theme they’re currently using. Imagine the possibilities!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>But it’s complex/expensive/requires a bunch of new infrastructure, right?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nope. Prominent open-source web servers support it natively, generally without needing any kind of extra configuration or setup. Many server-side frameworks will automatically ship the JS code to the client for native support in communicating over the socket. In Rails, for example, setting up your app to use WebSockets is as easy as configuring the built-in ActionCable and then deploying as usual on the same hardware you would have used otherwise. Anecdotally, the typical single Rails server process seems to be perfectly happy supporting nearly 4,000 active connections. And you can easily swap in the excellent <a href=\"https://docs.anycable.io\">AnyCable</a> to bump that up to around 10,000+ connections per node by not relying on the built-in Ruby WebSocket server. Again, this is on the usual hardware you’d be running your web server on in the first place. You don’t need to set up any extra hardware or increase your cloud infrastructure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This new approach is quickly appearing as extensions, libraries, or alternative configurations in a variety of languages and web frameworks, from Django’s <a href=\"https://sockpuppet.argpar.se\">Sockpuppet</a> to Phoenix’s <a href=\"https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript\">LiveView</a> and beyond. Seriously, go dig around for WebSockets-based libraries for your favorite app framework and then step into a new way of thinking about your app architectures. Build something amazing and marvel at the glorious HTML bits zipping along on the socket, like jet fighters passing in the night. It’s more than a new technical approach; it’s a new mindset, and maybe even a new wellspring of key app features that will drive your startup success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I’d be remiss if I didn’t highlight for the reader <em>my </em>contender for Best Framework in a Leading Role. Sure, any app framework can adopt this approach, but for my money, there’s a strong case to be made that the vanguard could be Ruby on Rails.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>So we come back around to Rails, 15 years on from its launch...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Set up a Rails 6 app with the latest versions of <a href=\"https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks\">Turbolinks</a>, <a href=\"https://stimulus.hotwire.dev\">Stimulus</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.stimulusreflex.com\">StimulusReflex</a>, <a href=\"https://cableready.stimulusreflex.com\">CableReady</a>, and GitHub’s <a href=\"https://github.com/github/view_component\">ViewComponent</a> gem, and you can be working with Reactive Rails in a way that simultaneously feels like building a classic Rails app <em>and </em>like building a modern, componentized SPA, in a single codebase, with all the benefits of server-side rendering, HTML fragment caching, easy SEO, rock-solid security, and the like.

But where Rails has always shined is in its ability to make rapid prototyping, well…<em>rapid</em>, and in its deep ecosystem of well-polished gems.

Black and Asian women MPs got 35% more abusive tweets than white women MPs. The abuse directed at Dianne Abott amounted to 10 times as much as was received by any other female MP, according to an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@AmnestyInsights/unsocial-media-tracking-twitter-abuse-against-women-mps-fc28aeca498a\">Amnesty International study</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mermaids is a charity that supports transgender children and their parents in the UK.

The rise in abusive and threatening comments led to Mermaids’ Twitter account having to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/27/police-investigate-online-abuse-charity-transgender-children-mermaids\">block up to 20 accounts a day</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trolling isn’t an easy problem to fix.

Yet in schools, words relating to LGBT issues are <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/helping-the-lgbt-community-access-the-internet/\">often blocked</a>. On YouTube, v<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17424472/youtube-lgbt-demonetization-ads-algorithm\">ideos relating to LGBT issues are demonetized, age-restricted, or even removed</a>. This isn’t because the content is sexually explicit or not safe for work. It’s just discrimination. TikTok recently admitted it actively discriminates against certain kinds of users—namely the <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/12/tiktok-disabled-users-videos-suppressed.html\">fat, queer, disabled</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/17/tiktok-tried-to-filter-out-videos-from-ugly-poor-or-disabled-users\">low-income, and “ugly”</a>—in certain feeds, under the guise of paternalistic protection from bullying.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Exclusionary design</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<figure class=\"quote\"><blockquote><p><em>People with disabilities are the original life hackers because our motivation is so high.

Screen readers can be prohibitively expensive; while there are free options, one of the most popular screen readers at the time of writing <a href=\"https://abilitynet.org.uk/factsheets/introduction-screen-readers\">costs nearly $1200</a> for a professional license. Even with <a href=\"https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/\">incredible innovation coming from within the disabled community</a>, there’s more that everyone else can do. In their February 2020 evaluation, WebAIM found that <a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag\">98.1% of the top million websites</a> had detectable WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2 errors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most common WCAG 2 failures—such as missing alt text for images, having empty links, and missing form labels—would be relatively simple to fix. Because they’re shared among most websites, concentrating on fixing them would have a huge overall benefit for the internet. But as long as web accessibility standards are applied without rigor, aspects of a vast number of sites remain inaccessible even once users have a screen reader or other assistive technology.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Hostile conditions</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Inclusion is just as pertinent as accessibility, and tackling only one side of the equation will leave some people just as locked out.

They make it more difficult to access life-saving spaces, social spaces, and civic spaces—both on and offline. Thorough accessibility and real inclusion are the solutions to these problems. To survive, marginalized people must work both against and through the abuse and accessibility issues they face on online platforms, whereas everyone else gets to use the internet as they wish. This replicates the injustices of offline in the online world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>An incomplete list of solutions</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Center the voices and experiences of the marginalized</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There isn’t one easy solution but to start finding the solutions that are possible we need to center <a href=\"https://whoseknowledge.org/\">the voices and experiences of the marginalized</a>. Marginalized people with insights to share aren’t hard to find when you start listening. They are your next users, your future developers, your fledgling marketing team. Excluding them reduces your options, your appeal, and your breadth of ideas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Hire teams that are diverse on every axis</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hiring inclusively creates teams full of people who aren’t like you or each other. And those kinds of teams build better products, bring better ideas to the table, and better reflect the user base of the majority of products. It is important to remember that diversity isn’t just about race or hiring women; there are neurodiverse people, people with physical disabilities, people of other genders, people from various backgrounds, and many other marginalizations than could be listed here.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Proactively promote inclusion and harness your team’s diversity</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Help disabled and otherwise marginalized people both develop and enforce policies and practices that protect them and allow them to thrive. If there are no disabled people, or otherwise marginalized or underrepresented people on your team, take a hard look at your hiring practices, your work culture, even the layout of your office. If you can’t find these problems, hire experts. Pay specialist consultants and recruiters to root out the problems. This is an investment that makes moral, logical, and business sense. The inclusive team you build will be able to spot potential issues in a way that a squad of people who pattern match to narrow ideas of what a tech worker should look and behave like never would. Create a culture where the marginalized members of your team feel supported, feel heard, and are buoyed through their work with a sense of safety in their workplace.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Avoid legal issues preemptively</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/skbaer/blind-woman-sues-beyonce-website-accessibility\">Beyonce</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90414147/dominos-pizza-dealt-scotus-blow-that-could-affect-ada\">Domino’s Pizza</a> were both sued under the <a href=\"https://www.ada.gov/\">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>, which contains provisions to force the companies involved to change their websites. Beyonce’s case is still in progress, but Domino’s both lost their suit and had their appeal tossed out. Both cases were about visually impaired people being unable to access their sites and complete purchases. Accessibility is often seen as a costly detour from the “real work” of building projects, but that has never and will never be true. You want users, and users of all stripes want to use your products.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The banks HSBC, Metro Bank, and Halifax made it hard for visually impaired users to access all of their services online. When HSBC was told they had made it difficult for a user with visual impairments to access bank statements, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43968736\">they replied, “don’t worry, we’ll send you a video.”</a> The <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents\">Equality Act 2010</a> in the UK means that these users can sue.<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43968736\"> </a>In addition to serving the far more important goal of providing people with disabilities equal access, embracing inclusive design from the outset would have saved these companies time while enhancing their trust among the public rather than putting it at risk. Fixing the content is usually much <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/accessibility-the-future-and-why-dominos-matters/\">cheaper for the organization than fighting the matter in court</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Advocate for accessibility and inclusivity in any way you can, be it big or small</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Caption your videos, Instagram content, Facebook photos, Twitter photos, conference and meetup talks, etc<strong>.</strong> Make information needed to access your product or service available in multiple formats. Speak up against problems in your workplace; if an internal hiring tool is hard for you to use, it is hard for others. If one of your websites has errors from WCAG 2’s list, advocate for taking time to fix it. If the gender options available on forms are “man,” “woman,” and “other,” speak up yourself, tell your manager, question whether you need to collect gender information at all. Don’t stay silent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Test your website with tools, devices, and real end users</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Run tools like <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\">axe</a>, <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromelens/idikgljglpfilbhaboonnpnnincjhjkd?hl=en\">ChromeLens</a>, and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\">Lighthouse</a> during your build processes. Do manual testing with the actual devices that are used by your end-users, and test with real users with access requirements. If you’re a team of one or a few, ensure that you run these tools from MVP to finished product—the errors that are the easiest to catch and fix will mostly be caught by automated tools, and they are a great start for learning more about accessibility. Websites such as <a href=\"https://a11yproject.com/resources/\">The A11y Project compile resources</a>, and there are <a href=\"https://inclusive-components.design/\">other websites</a>, Slack groups, Twitter accounts, and newsletters that are also incredibly helpful for answering any questions.

What inclusion looks like in practice will depend on your products, your users, and what you intend to achieve, but for it to be real and meaningful in any context, it cannot be an afterthought. Engineering that makes inclusion an afterthought is engineering that operates without morality and in doing so actively enacts harm. The fact that this kind of engineering is commonplace on the internet doesn’t make it OK. It just highlights that the way we have built the web is fundamentally broken. We can do better.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Wokeness,” at least as conceived by those divorced from the black experience and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English\">AAVE</a>, isn’t a great concept. The way it is used in popular culture makes it sound as if being a good person is a switch you flip on and off; you’re woke or ’sleep. But wokeness is not the end state, it’s the beginning of a journey. All the tenets of intersectional feminism, web accessibility, and diversity and inclusion are inextricably tied up in making the web a better place, for all and by all. Access to the internet is essential. Staying woke, and acting on that wokeness, is what will lead us to a better internet for everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:30:00 +0000","feedId":25,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"c59aec337abb31b89d3797af9ff5cdbc","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"\n\t\t\t\tby \t\t\t\t\t","publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196922305},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:22:08","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:22:08","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\tWebwaste\t\t\t\t","link":"https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Web is obese</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 1994, there were 3,000 websites. In 2019, there were estimated to be 1.7 billion, almost one website for every three people on the planet. Not only has the number of websites exploded, the weight of each page has also skyrocketed. Between 2003 and 2019, the average webpage weight grew from about 100&#160;KB to about 4&#160;MB. The results?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“In our analysis of 5.2 million pages,” Brian Dean reported for Backlinko in October 2019, “the average time it takes to fully load a webpage is 10.3 seconds on desktop and 27.3 seconds on mobile.” In 2013, Radware calculated that the average load time for a webpage on mobile was 4.3 seconds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Study after study shows that people absolutely hate slow webpages. In 2018, Google research found that 53% of mobile site visitors left a page that took longer than three seconds to load. A 2015 study by Radware found that “a site that loads in 3 seconds experiences 22% fewer page views, a 50% higher bounce rate, and a 22% fewer conversions than a site that loads in 1 second, while a site that loads in 5 seconds experiences 35% fewer page views, a 105% higher bounce rate, and 38% fewer conversions.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The causes of webpage bloat? Images and videos are mainly to blame. By 2022, it’s estimated that online videos will make up more than 82% of all consumer Internet traffic—15 times more than in 2017. However, from the code to the content, everything about Web design has become super-bloated and super-polluting. Consider that if a typical webpage that weighs 4&#160;MB is downloaded 600,000 times, one tree will need to be planted in order to deal with the resulting pollution.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They say a picture paints a thousand words. Well, 1,000 words of text takes up roughly two A4 (210 mm wide and 297 mm long) pages and weighs about 6&#160;KB. You’d place about four images that are 9 cm x 16 cm on two A4 pages. Let’s say these images are well optimized and weigh 40&#160;KB each. (A poorly optimized image could weigh several megabytes.) Even with such high optimization, two A4 pages of images will weigh around 160&#160;KB. That’s 27 times more than the two A4 pages of text. A 30-second video, on the other hand, could easily weigh 3&#160;MB. Videos create massively more pollution than text. Text is the ultimate compression technique. It is by far the most environmentally friendly way to communicate. If you want to save the planet, use more text. Think about digital weight.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From an energy point of view, it’s not simply about page weight. Some pages may have very heavy processing demands once they are downloaded. Other pages, particularly those that are ad-driven, will download with lots of third-party websites hanging off them, either feeding them content, or else demanding to be fed data, often personal data on the site’s visitor. It’s like a type of Trojan Horse. You think you’re accessing one website or app, but then all these other third parties start accessing you. According to Trent Walton, the top 50 most visited websites had an average of 22 third-party websites hanging off them. The New York Times had 64, while Washington Post had 63. All these third-party websites create pollution and invade privacy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a tremendous amount of out-of-date content on websites. I have worked with hundreds of websites where we had to delete up to 90% of the pages in order to start seeing improvements. Poorly written, out-of-date code is also a major problem. By cleaning up its JavaScript code, Wikipedia estimated that they saved 4.3 terabytes a day of data bandwidth for their visitors. By saving those terabytes, we saved having to plant almost 700 trees to deal with the yearly pollution that would have been caused.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want to help save the planet, reduce digital weight. Clean up your website. Before you add an image, make sure that it does something useful and it’s the most optimized image possible. Every time you add code, make sure it does something useful and it’s the leanest code possible. Always be on the lookout for waste images, waste code, waste content. Get into the habit of removing something every time you add something.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Publishing is an addiction. Giving a website to an organization is like giving a pub to an alcoholic. You remember the saying, “There’s a book inside everyone”? Well, the Web let the book out. It’s happy days for a while as we all publish, publish, publish. Then…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Hi, I’m Gerry.

It was one more page, one more page… What harm could one more page do?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Redesign is rehab for websites. Every two to three years some manager either gets bored with the design or some other manager meets a customer who tells them about how horrible it is to find anything on the website. The design team rounds up a new bunch of fake images and fake content for the top-level pages, while carefully avoiding going near the heaving mess at the lower levels. After the launch, everyone is happy for a while (except the customers, of course) because in many organizations what is important is to be seen to be doing things and producing and launching things, rather than to do something useful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you must do something, do something useful.

In any environment we’ve carried it out in—and we’ve done it more than 500 times—there are no more than 100 things that could potentially matter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a health environment, these might include symptoms, treatment, prevention, costs, waiting times, etc. When buying a car they might include price, engine type, warranties, service costs, etc. We’ve carried out Top Tasks surveys in some 40 countries and 30 languages, with upwards of 400,000 people voting. In every single survey the same patterns emerge. Let’s say there are 100 potential tasks. People are asked to vote on the tasks that are most important to them. When the results come in, we will find that five of the tasks will get the first 25% of the vote. 50 tasks will get the final 25% of the vote. The top five tasks get as much of the vote as the bottom 50. It’s the same pattern in Norway, New Zealand, Israel, USA, Canada, UK, Brazil, wherever.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The bottom 50 are what I call the tiny tasks. When a tiny task goes to sleep at night it dreams of being a top task. These tiny tasks—the true waste generators—are highly ambitious and enthusiastic.

One suggestion was for a website in a language I don’t speak. When I visited it, I saw one of those typical big images that you see on so many websites. I thought to myself: I’m going to try and understand this website based on its images.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The big image was of a well-dressed, middle-aged woman walking down the street while talking on her phone. I put on my Sherlock Holmes hat. Hmm… Something to do with telecommunications, perhaps? Why would they choose a woman instead of a man, or a group of women and men? She’s married, I deduced by looking at the ring on her finger. What is that telling me? And what about her age? Why isn’t she younger or older? And why is she alone? Questions, questions, but I’m no Sherlock Holmes. I couldn’t figure out anything useful from this image.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I scrolled down the page. Ah, three more images. The first one is a cartoon-like image of a family on vacation. Hmm… The next one is of two men and one woman in a room. One of them has reached their hand out and placed it on something, but I can’t see what that something is, because the other two have placed their hands on top of that hand. It’s a type of pledge or something, a secret society, perhaps? Two of them are smiling and the third is trying to smile. What could that mean? And then the final picture is of a middle-aged man staring into the camera, neither smiling nor unsmiling, with a somewhat kind, thoughtful look. What is happening?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I must admit that after examining all the visual evidence I had absolutely no clue what this government website was about. So, I translated it. It was about the employment conditions and legal status of government employees. Now, why didn’t I deduce that from the images?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Web is smothering us in useless images that create lots of pollution. These clichéd, stock images communicate absolutely nothing of value, interest or use. They are one of the worst forms of digital pollution and waste, as they cause page bloat, making it slower for pages to download, while pumping out wholly unnecessary pollution. They take up space on the page, forcing more useful content out of sight, making people scroll for no good reason.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Interpublic is a very large global advertising agency. As with all advertising agencies they stress how “creative” they are, which means they love huge, meaningless, happy-clappy polluting images. When I tested their homepage, it emitted almost 8 grams of CO2 as it downloaded, putting Interpublic in the worst 10% of website polluters, according to the Website Carbon Calculator. (For comparison, the Google homepage emits 0.23 grams.) One single image on its homepage weighed 3.2&#160;MB. This image could easily have been 10 times smaller, while losing nothing in visual appeal. The Interpublic website is like a filthy, rusty 25-year-old diesel truck, belching fumes as it trundles down the Web.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead of optimizing images so that they’ll download faster, the opposite is often happening. High-resolution images are a major cost to the environment. If, for example, you move from a 4K resolution image to an 8K one, the file size doesn’t double, it trebles. For example, I saved an image at 4K and it was 6.9&#160;MB. At 8K it was 18&#160;MB.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Digital “progress” and “innovation” often means an increasing stress on the environment. Everything is more. Everything is higher. Everything is faster. And everything is exponentially more demanding of the environment. Digital is greedy for energy and the more it grows the greedier it gets. We need digital innovation that reduces environmental stress, that reduces the digital footprint. We need digital designers who think about the weight of every design decision they make.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We must start by trying to use the option that damages the environment least, and that is text.

It’s also quite limited to about a dozen, distinguishable colors. It’s a potent visual element, but one fraught with accessibility and perceptual problems. A general rule of thumb:<em> Save color for things you want to draw people’s attention to</em>. Start with grayscale representations. Add in color only later, where it might be really, really useful. That’s it. We can move along.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Except…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We need to dispel some popular beliefs about colors, beliefs that are often held up as truth, when, in fact, this is not the case. What’s presented in this short chapter is more foundational knowledge than tips for immediate application. But also, this understanding of color is—we found in retrospect—a powerful lens for understanding the concepts shared throughout this book. We see in our exploration of color this pattern: while many of the absolutes we cling to are social constructs (varying across cultures and over time), behind these changing constructs we also find some universal human constants.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How Many Colors Are in the Rainbow?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s begin by unpacking the statement above, suggesting that we only see about a dozen colors. Actually, the human eye can perceive many more colors, perhaps a million or so. Of this million, it’s estimated that each of us—individually—can distinguish somewhere between 130 to 300 colors.<sup>[1]</sup> But within a cultural group, we can only share about a dozen such colors. These limitations have little to do with personal visual acuity, but rather with language: a group’s ability to see and perceive a specific color is determined by language. Do we—as a society—share the same named color value associations?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We can talk about something being “<em>red</em>” and feel confident in what we all see. From both a developmental perspective and an anthropological perspective, red is the first color (after white and black) that most cultures are aware of. But if I describe something as <em>magenta</em>, do we have a shared agreement as to what that named concept refers to? Perhaps you see hot pink where I see a vibrant, purply-reddish color? Another example of this language-color dependency: the Russian language has a specific word for the color that we (English speakers) perceive as light blue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To put this shared vocabulary into perspective, let’s start with something that is constant and beyond our language: the visible spectrum of light that is a rainbow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>When Colors Are Constant</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Around the world, the meteorological phenomenon we describe as a rainbow is a constant thing. Light refracts across water droplets to create a spectrum visible to humans. What we see as colors are the wavelengths of light visible to the human eye (see <strong>Figure 8.1</strong>). On either end of this visible spectrum are ultraviolet and infrared waves, which while invisible to human eyes, we know they <em>are</em> visible—that is, seen—by cameras and some nonhuman creatures (cats can see certain infrared frequencies, for example). Beyond this visible spectrum, we have things like gamma rays, X-rays, and radio waves, which all make up the entire spectrum of white light from the sun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172366,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.01.jpg?w=569\" alt=\"A diagram showing the spectrum of light\" class=\"wp-image-7172366\"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 8.1</strong> The visible light spectrum is a small part of the broader electromagnetic spectrum.

Within this spectrum, the rainbow possesses millions of color combinations, as there are no clearly defined boundaries between the colors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why then, should diverse cultures over thousands of years arrive at the same set of color language definitions? Are colors an absolute thing? Not exactly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Subjectivity of Color Identification</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consider “ROYGBIV,” which is the acronym we all learned to name the colors of the rainbow. How did we conclude, at least in Western cultures, that a rainbow has seven colors? Why not five, or six, or eleven? We have Sir Isaac Newton to thank for this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These seven colors—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—were not the result of any serious scientific inquiry. Rather, Newton was fond of the number seven. Just as there are seven musical notes in a scale, Newton believed that colors should follow a similar pattern. He might have connected this with seven days in the week or the seven known planets (at the time) in our universe. In other words, ROYGBIV was an arbitrary choice based on mystical superstition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Understanding how we arrived at these seven colors sheds light on the subjective nature of color identification. This may also explain a bit about the challenge that so many people have with indigo—that odd color that sits somewhere between blue and violet—as a separate color!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But here is where we have to be careful, as we are stepping into a decades old debate: Do the number of basic color terms and the location of color category boundaries vary across languages? Or might there be a universal pattern to the color naming systems of all cultures?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This Wikipedia entry sums up the debate rather nicely:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"className\":\"quote\"} -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote quote\"><p>There are two formal sides to the color debate, the universalist and the relativist. The universalist side claims that the biology of all human beings is all the same, so the development of color terminology has absolute universal constraints. The relativist side claims that the variability of color terms cross-linguistically (from language to language) points to more culture-specific phenomena. Because color exhibits both biological and linguistic aspects, it has become a deeply studied domain that addresses the relationship between language and thought.<sup> [2]</sup></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>An Argument for Relative Linguistics</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We can characterize what Newton did as imposing an arbitrary number of colors upon the color spectrum. And we might conclude the same thing has happened throughout history as different people groups formed words to describe the world around them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Indeed, various studies of diverse cultures reveal that “although the physiological basis of color vision is essentially the same for all humans with normal trichromatic color vision, there is considerable diversity in the way that different languages segment the continuum of visible colors.”<sup>[3]</sup> In other words, the rainbow has no natural boundaries; how we slice it up into colors is a subjective thing that varies across different cultures and time. (See <strong>Figure 8.2</strong> for an illustration of this concept.) From one research paper, we learned that “some languages have been reported to use as few as two terms to describe all visible colors (Rosch Heider, 1972). Others have been reported to use between three and eleven (Berlin &#38; Kay, 1969), while some (e.g., Russian; Davies and Corbett, 1997) may have twelve.”<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Specific examples in support of this argument:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>&#160;In Russian culture, there is no generic concept of blue. Rather, Russian makes an obligatory distinction between lighter blues (<em>goluboy</em>) and darker blues (<em>siniy</em>).</li><li>The Japanese language (before the modern period) had just one word,<em> Ao</em>, for both blue and green. It wouldn’t be until the year 1,000 that the word <em>midori</em> would be introduced to distinguish a greenish shade of blue</li><li>The Himba tribe from Namibia recognizes five basic colors.</li><li>The Berinmo of Papua New Guinea has also reached a different conclusion as to the number of colors they recognize. While they draw no distinction between blue and green, they do “draw a distinction within what English speakers would consider yellow, with the word <em>nol</em> on one side and <em>wor</em> on the other.”</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From this, we might conclude that the colors of the rainbow do seem to be arbitrary and dependent upon language. (Connect this with earlier points we made about thoughts and cognition as layers upon layers of prior associations.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172367,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.02.jpg?w=960\" alt=\"A webcomic from XKCD, reading 'This chart shows the dominant color names over the three fully-saturated faces of the RGB cube (colors where one of the RGB values is zero)\" class=\"wp-image-7172367\"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 8.2</strong> This comic from Randall Munroe of xkcd nicely illustrates the subjectivity of the shared color language for English speakers.[5]</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But surely, you may be thinking, color identification isn’t entirely subjective? Here’s where the research gets interesting: despite these regional differences, a fascinating and consistent pattern begins to emerge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>An Argument for the Universal</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the late 1960s, after studying color terms across many different languages, researchers Berlin and Kay introduced the idea that there were eleven possible basic color categories: white, black, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, and gray. They argued a universalist theory: that color cognition is <em>an innate, physiological process rather than a cultural one.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While their research has been challenged on different grounds, what has since followed is some agreement that for all noted language differences, there is a fixed order in which color names arise. The ways in which color language evolves across cultures suggest maybe there is a universal pattern governing the direction of patterns in the evolution of colors. All cultures start with the ability to distinguish dark things from light things. This is followed by the recognition of red. After that, it might be the addition of yellow or green. And blue always seems to come last. Not every language follows the exact same path, but they adhere to this same general pattern.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the broader debate is not necessarily concluded, the general consensus seems to be that “in color, relativism appears to overlay a universalist foundation.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Why All the Fuss over Color?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While this is certainly fascinating, how is this useful? We include this as a mirror to challenge assumptions. If we turn a critical eye to the commonly accepted color wheel, this was likely influenced by Newton’s original color wheel sketch. But is this the “right” way to think about colors? <em>Primary colors combine to make secondary colors, which in turn allow us to describe tertiary colors.</em> We learn this from an early age and accept this way of thinking about color as absolute. But this is just one frame. This is just <em>a way</em> of thinking about visible light. And this singular perspective has limitations, especially when used in medical, scientific, and engineering visualizations. Research papers such as “Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful”<sup>[6]</sup> question the value of the rainbow color spectrum in data visualization applications. The point is simple: there are other ways we might think about color. We can look at alternatives such as perceptually ordered color spectrums, an <em>isoluminant</em> color map, or simply use representations of color that aren’t derived from a wheel. Tools such as ColorBrewer 2.0<sup>[7]</sup> or the NASA Ames Color Tool<sup>[8]</sup> are incredibly useful for choosing a palette more suitable for visualizing data.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since this book is concerned with how human creatures understand information, and because we so often use color to clarify, we felt it worth calling out that color and color recognition are not necessarily universal things, but are dependent on cognition, language, and biology. Understanding this allows us to challenge common assumptions about what is “true” about color and perception.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Which leads us to…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Color, Cultures, and Universal Associations</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Red means stop. Green means go. These concepts are universal, right? Not so fast. Across cultures, colors do not necessarily convey the same concept. And where we may have the same ability to identify a color, the associated meaning is just that—a learned association. Concluding that red means passion, vitality, or energy, because blood and fire are red things is <em>not</em> a universal idea. Neither is associating green with growth, just because nature involves so much green. (In some Chinese cultures, green can be associated with death.) At this point, please throw away those blog posts and posters about colors to choose for different cultures. While we’re keen to seek out human universals, color has proven to be something that does not have consistent meaning across cultures, or even within a culture group. Rather, the concepts we associate with particular colors are highly contextual and local, not just to a particular culture, but sometimes to smaller social groups. The meanings we point to—blue as a safe, corporate color, for example—are highly generalized assumptions, highly contextual, and mostly learned associations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The Color Purple</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s take purple, as an example. For many centuries, purple dye was expensive and rare. Procuring purple dye was labor intensive and required collecting a secretion from sea snails. Historian David Jacoby remarked that “twelve thousand snails of Murex brandaris yield no more than 1.4 g of pure dye, enough to colour only the trim of a single garment.”<sup>[9]</sup> As a result of this laborious process, the high cost of producing purple clothing made this color a status symbol among kings, queens, and other rulers. If you could afford to wear purple, you were quite wealthy. The conceptual association then is one of scarcity (in this case of a particular dye), signaling something to be valued above other things. While we may still see the lingering effects of this history (the Purple Heart is among the highest honors awarded for U.S. military service), the constraint of purple as a scarce color is no longer true. As such, this color is able to take on new meanings.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>“Pink Is for Girls, Blue Is for Boys”</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To put this into perspective, let’s investigate the idea that “pink is for girls, blue is for boys.” From clothing choices to marketing toys to how we decorate bedrooms, most of us grow up believing there’s some inherent gender association built into the colors pink and blue. But, were we to travel back in time—just over 100 years—we’d find no such distinction. Or we might find the opposite association.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>According to University of Maryland historian Jo B. Paoletti, author of <em>Pink and Blue: Telling the Girls from the Boys in America</em>, pink and blue weren't always gender-specific colors. For centuries, young children mostly wore a functional white dress, and then in the early 20th century, things began to change. Consider this quote, pulled from the June 1918 issue of Earnshaw's Infants’ Department, a trade publication:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"className\":\"quote\"} -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote quote\"><p>The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A Smithsonian review of Paoletti’s book,<sup>[10]</sup> goes on to add:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.</p><p>In 1927, <em>Time</em> magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene's told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best &#38; Co. in New York City, Halle's in Cleveland, and Marshall Field in Chicago.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the 1940s, this association had flipped. Manufacturers had settled on pink for girls and blue for boys (see <strong>Figure 8.3</strong> as an example of this association). Baby Boomers were raised with wearing the two colors. The point of this narrative? Color associations are learned things and can change over time. Even something as seemingly strong as the pink/blue binary was a manufactured association. To be clear, this doesn’t mean a color association is any less powerful in the moment, at a particular point in history, but these color associations do not represent any universal truths.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.03a.jpg?w=960\" alt=\"A box of 'It's a boy!' baby announcement candy cigars in blue\" class=\"wp-image-7172368\"><br><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.03b.jpg?w=547\" alt=\"A box of 'It's a girl!' baby announcement candy cigars in pink\" class=\"wp-image-7172369\"><figcaption><b>Figure 8.3</b> - The “blue is for boys and pink is for girls” concept was a manufactured one, originating in the first half of the 20th century.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Accordingly, it’s good to be wary of generalizations such as “blue is a safe, corporate color.” In the case of corporate associations, one generation’s “safe” may—depending on the media and actions—signal stuffy, inauthentic, or distrustful to the next generation.

We tend to look at color charts like this one and assume that the extreme ends of red, green, and blue are on equal footing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172372,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ill08.01a.jpg?w=551\" alt=\"Two gradients, one going from black to red, one going from black to gray\" class=\"wp-image-7172372\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172373,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ill08.01b.jpg?w=551\" alt=\"Two gradients, one going from black to green, one going from black to gray\" class=\"wp-image-7172373\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172374,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ill08.01c.jpg?w=551\" alt=\"Two gradients, one going from black to blue, one going from black to gray\" class=\"wp-image-7172374\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, because of the wavelengths of these colors and how our eyes perceive color, we see green as brighter than red, which itself is brighter than blue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How Is This Knowledge Useful?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While it’s nice to think that precise color values are interchangeable (setting aside any cultural associations), your perception doesn’t work that way. In the same way that certain frequencies on the radio come in clearer than others, certain colors do the same. You need to account for, or at least consider, the unevenness of color perception.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the example in <strong>Figure 8.5</strong>, you see the same eight-segment pie chart. The example on the right uses all high-saturation colors while the example on the left mixes high- and low- saturation colors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172371,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.05.jpg?w=960\" alt=\"Two equal pie charts with differing levels of saturation in the colors\" class=\"wp-image-7172371\"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 8.5</strong> Two pie charts showing identical information. The chart on the left uses colors of mixed saturation, meaning some colors will naturally stand out more than others, making this an uneven representation.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Functionally, these both communicate the same thing. But consider how you <em>perceive</em> each. With the example on the right, use of high saturation is consistent; no color should be more prominent than another. But when you mix high and low saturation, as with the example on the left, the higher saturation colors tend to “pop” more—drawing you to these segments. While this chart is more aesthetically pleasing (as it uses half as many colors), it’s also a bit misleading—notice how your eye is drawn to the orange segment in the upper right. The lesson? Assuming the goal is objectivity and truthfulness, you’d want to avoid mixing saturations and hues that are unevenly perceived. If the goal were the opposite, to draw attention away from or toward a particular bit of data, you could manipulate perception by adjusting saturation and hue (not that this is being recommended!). This ability to direct attention by using bolder colors is something that everyone should be aware of and intentional about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 21 May 2020 14:30:00 +0000","feedId":25,"bgimg":"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.01.jpg?w=569","linkMd5":"d92438280eb0bc40f5041fdebcc6030c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn19@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-20-702_1ac4a242889ca4e8.webp","destWidth":569,"destHeight":327,"sourceBytes":25880,"destBytes":25880,"author":"\n\t\t\t\tby , \t\t\t\t\t","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.01.jpg?w=569":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn19@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-20-702_1ac4a242889ca4e8.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.02.jpg?w=960":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn87@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-24-476_ed936ef9d20a4fde.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.03a.jpg?w=960":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn51@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-23-409_d4b7b812f2c0c048.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.03b.jpg?w=547":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn79@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-186_69657b0fab6ca3c5.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.04.jpg?w=572":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn55@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-23-146_d45316a5796abca9.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ill08.01a.jpg?w=551":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn70@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-24-313_38dca75a77481bbe.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ill08.01b.jpg?w=551":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn77@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-140_8a38f06be0ae8a09.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ill08.01c.jpg?w=551":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn44@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-173_917f566275140208.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/08.05.jpg?w=960":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn63@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-24-334_e746c13a5777dbe2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914103},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:22:08","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:22:08","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\tThat’s Not My Burnout\t\t\t\t","link":"https://alistapart.com/article/thats-not-my-burnout/","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Are you like me, reading about people fading away as they burn out, and feeling unable to relate? Do you feel like your feelings are invisible to the world because you’re experiencing burnout differently? When burnout starts to push down on us, our core comes through more. Beautiful, peaceful souls get quieter and fade into that distant and distracted burnout we’ve all read about. But some of us, those with fires always burning on the edges of our core, get hotter. In my heart I am fire. When I face burnout I double down, triple down, burning hotter and hotter to try to best the challenge. I don’t fade—I am engulfed in a <em>zealous burnout</em>.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>So what on earth is a zealous burnout?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Imagine a woman determined to do it all. She has two amazing children whom she, along with her husband who is also working remotely, is homeschooling during a pandemic. She has a demanding client load at work—all of whom she loves. She gets up early to get some movement in (or often catch up on work), does dinner prep as the kids are eating breakfast, and gets to work while positioning herself near “fourth grade” to listen in as she juggles clients, tasks, and budgets. Sound like a lot? Even with a supportive team both at home and at work, it is.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sounds like this woman has too much on her plate and needs self-care. But no, she doesn’t have time for that. In fact, she starts to feel like she’s dropping balls. Not accomplishing enough. There’s not enough of her to be here and there; she is trying to divide her mind in two all the time, all day, every day. She starts to doubt herself. And as those feelings creep in more and more, her internal narrative becomes more and more critical.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Suddenly she KNOWS what she needs to do! She should DO MORE.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a hard and dangerous cycle. Know why? Because once she doesn’t finish that new goal, that narrative will get worse. Suddenly she’s failing. She isn’t doing enough. SHE is <em>not enough</em>. She might fail, she might fail her family...so she’ll find more she should do. She doesn’t sleep as much, move as much, all in the efforts to do more. Caught in this cycle of trying to prove herself to herself, never reaching any goal. Never feeling “enough.”&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, yeah, that’s what zealous burnout looks like for me. It doesn’t happen overnight in some grand gesture but instead slowly builds over weeks and months. My burning out process looks like speeding up, not a person losing focus. I speed up and up and up...and then I just stop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>I am the one who could</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s funny the things that shape us. Through the lens of childhood, I viewed the fears, struggles, and sacrifices of someone who had to make it all work without having enough. I was lucky that my mother was so resourceful and my father supportive; I never went without and even got an extra here or there.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Growing up, I did not feel shame when my mother paid with food stamps; in fact, I’d have likely taken on any debate on the topic, verbally eviscerating anyone who dared to criticize the disabled woman trying to make sure all our needs were met with so little. As a child, I watched the way the fear of not making those ends meet impacted people I love. As the non-disabled person in my home, I would take on many of the physical tasks because I was “the one who could” make our lives a little easier. I learned early to associate fears or uncertainty with putting more of myself into it—I am the one who can. I learned early that when something frightens me, I can double down and work harder to make it better. I can own the challenge. When people have seen this in me as an adult, I’ve been told I seem fearless, but make no mistake, I’m not. If I seem fearless, it’s because this behavior was forged from other people’s fears.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And here I am, more than 30 years later still feeling the urge to mindlessly push myself forward when faced with overwhelming tasks ahead of me, assuming that I am the one who can and therefore should. I find myself driven to prove that I can make things happen if I work longer hours, take on more responsibility, and do <em>more</em>.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I do not see people who struggle financially as failures, because I have seen how strong that tide can be—it pulls you along the way. I truly get that I have been privileged to be able to avoid many of the challenges that were present in my youth. That said, I am still “the one who can” who feels she should, so if I were faced with not having enough to make ends meet for my own family, I would see myself as having failed. Though I am supported and educated, most of this is due to good fortune. I will, however, allow myself the arrogance of saying I have been careful with my choices to have encouraged that luck. My identity stems from the idea that I am “the one who can” so therefore feel obligated to do the most. I can choose to stop, and with some quite literal cold water splashed in my face, I’ve made the choice to before. But that choosing to stop is not my go-to; I move forward, driven by a fear that is so a part of me that I barely notice it’s there until I’m feeling utterly worn away.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So why all the history? You see, burnout is a fickle thing. I have heard and read a lot about burnout over the years. Burnout is real. Especially now, with COVID, many of us are balancing more than we ever have before—all at once! It’s hard, and the procrastinating, the avoidance, the shutting down impacts so many amazing professionals. There are important articles that relate to what I imagine must be the majority of people out there, but not me. That’s not what my burnout looks like.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The dangerous invisibility of zealous burnout</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A lot of work environments see the extra hours, extra effort, and overall focused commitment as an asset (and sometimes that’s all it is). They see someone trying to rise to challenges, not someone stuck in their fear. Many well-meaning organizations have safeguards in place to protect their teams from burnout. But in cases like this, those alarms are not always tripped, and then when the inevitable stop comes, some members of the organization feel surprised and disappointed. And sometimes maybe even betrayed.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Parents—more so mothers, statistically speaking—are praised as being so on top of it all when they can work, be involved in the after-school activities, practice self-care in the form of diet and exercise, and still meet friends for coffee or wine. During COVID many of us have binged countless streaming episodes showing how it’s so hard for the female protagonist, but she is strong and funny and can do it. It’s a “very special episode” when she breaks down, cries in the bathroom, woefully admits she needs help, and just stops for a bit. Truth is, countless people are hiding their tears or are doom-scrolling to escape. We know that the media is a lie to amuse us, but often the perception that it’s what we should strive for has penetrated much of society.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Women and burnout</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love men. And though I don’t love every man (heads up, I don’t love every woman or nonbinary person either), I think there is a beautiful spectrum of individuals who represent that particular binary gender.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That said, women are still more often at risk of burnout than their male counterparts, especially in these COVID stressed times. Mothers in the workplace feel the pressure to do all the “mom” things while giving 110%. Mothers not in the workplace feel they need to do more to “justify” their lack of traditional employment. Women who are not mothers often feel the need to do even more because they don’t have that extra pressure at home. It’s vicious and systemic and so a part of our culture that we’re often not even aware of the enormity of the pressures we put on ourselves and each other.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And there are prices beyond happiness too. <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/job-strain-and-heart-disease-risk-in-women\">Harvard Health Publishing released a study</a> a decade ago that “uncovered strong links between women’s job stress and cardiovascular disease.” <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/women.htm\">The CDC noted,</a> “Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States, killing 299,578 women in 2017—or about 1 in every 5 female deaths.”&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This relationship between work stress and health, from what I have read, is more dangerous for women than it is for their non-female counterparts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>But what if your burnout isn’t like that either?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That might not be you either. After all, each of us is so different and how we respond to stressors is too. It’s part of what makes us human. <strong>Don’t stress what burnout looks like</strong>,<strong> just learn to recognize it in yourself.</strong> Here are a few questions I sometimes ask friends if I am concerned about them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p style=\"margin-left: 1.5em\"><em>Are you happy?</em> This simple question should be the first thing you ask yourself. Chances are, even if you’re burning out doing all the things you love, as you approach burnout you’ll just stop taking as much joy from it all.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p style=\"margin-left: 1.5em\"><em>Do you feel empowered to say no?</em> I have observed in myself and others that when someone is burning out, they no longer feel they can say no to things. Even those who don’t “speed up” feel pressure to say yes to not disappoint the people around them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p style=\"margin-left: 1.5em\"><em>What are three things you’ve done for yourself?</em> Another observance is that we all tend to stop doing things for ourselves. Anything from skipping showers and eating poorly to avoiding talking to friends. These can be red flags.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p style=\"margin-left: 1.5em\"><em>Are you making excuses?</em> Many of us try to disregard feelings of burnout. Over and over I have heard, “It’s just crunch time,” “As soon as I do this one thing, it will all be better,” and “Well I should be able to handle this, so I’ll figure it out.” And it <em>might </em>really be crunch time, a single goal, and/or a skill set you need to learn. That happens—life happens. BUT if this doesn’t stop, be honest with yourself. If you’ve worked more 50-hour weeks since January than not, maybe it’s not crunch time—maybe it’s a bad situation that you’re burning out from.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p style=\"margin-left: 1.5em\"><em>Do you have a plan to stop feeling this way?</em> If something is truly temporary and you do need to just push through, then it has an exit route with a<br>defined end.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take the time to listen to yourself as you would a friend. Be honest, allow yourself to be uncomfortable, and break the thought cycles that prevent you from healing.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>So now what?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I just described is a different path to burnout, but it’s still burnout. There are well-established approaches to working through burnout:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Get enough sleep.</li><li>Eat healthy.</li><li>Work out.</li><li>Get outside.</li><li>Take a break.</li><li>Overall, practice self-care.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Those are hard for me because they feel like more tasks. If I’m in the burnout cycle, doing any of the above <em>for me </em>feels like a waste. The narrative is that if I’m already failing, why would I take care of myself when I’m dropping all those other balls? People need me, right?&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re deep in the cycle, your inner voice might be pretty awful by now. If you need to, tell yourself you need to take care of the person your people depend on. If your roles are pushing you toward burnout, use them to help make healing easier by justifying the time spent working on you.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To help remind myself of the airline attendant message about putting the mask on yourself first, I have come up with a few things that I do when I start feeling myself going into a zealous burnout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Cook an elaborate meal for someone!&#160;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>OK, I am a “food-focused” individual so cooking for someone is always my go-to. There are countless tales in my home of someone walking into the kitchen and turning right around and walking out when they noticed I was “chopping angrily.” But it’s more than that, and you should give it a try. Seriously. It’s the perfect go-to if you don’t feel worthy of taking time for yourself—do it for someone else. Most of us work in a digital world, so cooking can fill all of your senses and force you to be in the moment with all the ways you perceive the world. It can break you out of your head and help you gain a better perspective. In my house, I’ve been known to pick a place on the map and cook food that comes from wherever that is (thank you, Pinterest). I love cooking Indian food, as the smells are warm, the bread needs just enough kneading to keep my hands busy, and the process takes real attention for me because it’s not what I was brought up making. And in the end, we all win!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Vent like a foul-mouthed fool</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Be careful with this one!&#160;</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have been making an effort to practice more gratitude over the past few years, and I recognize the true benefits of that. That said, sometimes you just gotta let it all out—even the ugly. Hell, I’m a big fan of not sugarcoating our lives, and that sometimes means that to get past the big pile of poop, you’re gonna wanna complain about it a bit.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When that is what’s needed, turn to a trusted friend and allow yourself some pure verbal diarrhea, saying all the things that are bothering you. You need to trust this friend not to judge, to see your pain, and, most importantly, to tell you to remove your cranium from your own rectal cavity. Seriously, it’s about getting a reality check here! One of the things I admire the most about my husband (though often after the fact) is his ability to break things down to their simplest. “We’re spending our lives together, of course you’re going to disappoint me from time to time, so get over it” has been his way of speaking his dedication, love, and acceptance of me—and I could not be more grateful. It also, of course, has meant that I needed to remove my head from that rectal cavity. So, again, usually those moments are appreciated in hindsight.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Pick up a book!&#160;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many books out there that aren’t so much self-help as they are people just like you sharing their stories and how they’ve come to find greater balance. Maybe you’ll find something that speaks to you. Titles that have stood out to me include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><em>Thrive</em> by Arianna Huffington</li><li><em>Tools of Titans</em> by Tim Ferriss</li><li><em>Girl, Stop Apologizing</em> by Rachel Hollis</li><li><em>Dare to Lead</em> by Brené Brown</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or, another tactic I love to employ is to read or listen to a book that has NOTHING to do with my work-life balance. I’ve read the following books and found they helped balance me out because my mind was pondering their interesting topics instead of running in circles:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><em>The Drunken Botanist</em> by Amy Stewart</li><li><em>Superlife</em> by Darin Olien</li><li><em>A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived</em> by Adam Rutherford</li><li><em>Gaia’s Garden</em> by Toby Hemenway&#160;</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re not into reading, pick up a topic on YouTube or choose a podcast to subscribe to. I’ve watched countless permaculture and gardening topics in addition to how to raise chickens and ducks. For the record, I do not have a particularly large food garden, nor do I own livestock of any kind...yet. I just find the topic interesting, and it has nothing to do with any aspect of my life that <em>needs</em> anything from me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Forgive yourself<strong>&#160;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You are never going to be perfect—hell, it would be boring if you were. It’s OK to be broken and flawed. It’s human to be tired and sad and worried. It’s OK to not do it all. It’s scary to be imperfect, but you cannot be brave if nothing were scary.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This last one is the most important: <strong>allow yourself permission to NOT do it all. </strong>You never promised to be everything to everyone at all times. We are more powerful than the fears that drive us.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is hard. It is hard for me. It’s what’s driven me to write this—that it’s OK to stop. It’s OK that your unhealthy habit that might even benefit those around you needs to end. You can still be successful in life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I recently read that we are all writing our eulogy in how we live. Knowing that your professional accomplishments won’t be mentioned in that speech, what will yours say? What do you want it to say?&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Look, I get that none of these ideas will “fix it,” and that’s not their purpose. None of us are in control of our surroundings, only how we respond to them. These suggestions are to help stop the spiral effect so that you are empowered to address the underlying issues and choose your response. They are things that work for me most of the time. Maybe they’ll work for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Does this sound familiar?&#160;</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If this sounds familiar, it’s not just you. Don’t let your negative self-talk tell you that you “even burn out wrong.” It’s not wrong. Even if rooted in fear like my own drivers, I believe that this need to do more comes from a place of love, determination, motivation, and other wonderful attributes that make you the amazing person you are. We’re going to be OK, ya know. The lives that unfold before us might never look like that story in our head—that idea of “perfect” or “done” we’re looking for, but that’s OK.

This is not the first time I have experienced this type of feeling.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My commute — New York to New Jersey — is what folks in my area call the reverse commute.While going to the office, my days began to look the same: riding the subway to a bus to a shuttle to get to my job. Have you ever arrived at a destination and not even realized how you got there? This is how I began to experience the world everyday. I stopped paying attention to my surroundings.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because I worked a lot, the only time I would take off was for the holidays. During this time, I was a consultant and was coming to the end of an existing contract. For six years straight, I did this, until I decided to take six weeks off work to travel to Europe and visit places I had not seen before.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A family friend let me stay with her in Munich, Germany; I did not speak German, and so began my adventure. I was in a new place, where I did not know anyone, and I got lost every single day. My eyes were opened to the fact that every day is an opportunity. It just took me going on a trip and traveling halfway around the world to realize it. There are new things to experience each and every day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I returned to the U.S. and went back to work, I made a conscious decision to make each day different. Sometimes I would walk a new route. Some days I would take another train. Each change meant I saw something new: new clothing, new buildings, and new faces. It really impacted the way I viewed myself in the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But what do you do when you cannot travel? Seeing a situation with new eyes takes practice, and you can still create the opportunity to see something by not taking your surroundings for granted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How do we do this? For me, I adopted a new philosophy of being WOQE: watching, observing, questioning, and exploring.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172776,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/woqe.jpg?resize=1024,1024\" alt=\"Two people sit on a bench, one in a suit with arms crossed and the other wearing a backpack while looking through a camera.

This takes looking at yourself and understanding your beliefs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I am looking to design something, I always have to tell myself that I am not the user. I don’t know where they come from, and I don’t know their reason for making the decisions they do. I begin the work to understand where they are coming from. It all starts with why.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Observing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>View the situation from different angles. Architects think about the details of a building and look at different viewpoints and perspectives (i.e., outside the building, different sides of the building, etc.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How can you apply this approach to your designs? Here’s an example. I sketched something once as part of an augmented reality experience. Using my mobile device, I was able to walk around the sketch and see it from all sides, including the top and bottom. As a UX Designer, I have had to view items from both a user’s perspective and the business’ perspective. If I am giving a talk at a conference, I look at the talk from an audience perspective and my own.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Questioning</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Use the “5 Why Technique” to get to the root of the problem. This involves asking “why” 5 times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You know how kids keep asking “why” when you answer a question from them? This approach is how you can get to the root of problems. For example, a friend of mine who is blind expressed interest in playing a popular augmented reality game. This intrigued me and I used a whiteboard as I worked through the 5 Whys with my friend. Here is the process we took:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“Why can’t someone who is blind play Pokémon Go?” I asked.</em></p><p><em>“Because the game is visual and requires someone to see what is on the screen.”</em></p><p><em>“Why is the game only a visual perspective?”</em></p><p><em>“Because this is the way it was designed.”</em></p><p><em>“Why was it designed this way?”</em></p><p><em>“Because frequently designers are creating for themselves and may not think about who they might be excluding.”</em></p><p><em>“Why are designers excluding people?”</em></p><p><em>“Because they were never taught to include them.”</em></p><p><em>“Why were they never taught?”</em></p><p><em>“Design programs often do not include an inclusive and accessible curriculum.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This may not be a scientific way of approaching a problem, but it is a starting point. My friend could not play this augmented reality game because designers were not taught to make this game for someone who is blind. After this exercise, I was able to work with a group of students who worked with my friend to create an augmented reality concept and ultimately a game using audio and haptic feedback.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It all started with why.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Exploring</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Collaborate with others to learn from others and teach others what you know. Let your friends and colleagues know what you are working on, and perhaps talk it through with them.<br><br>When I was a freelance designer, I worked on my own and found it challenging when I would get stuck on a design. I searched online and found a group of designers who would come and share their work with each other for feedback. Through this group, I was able to get some insightful comments on my designs and explain some of my decisions. I began to collaborate with the folks in the group and found it very helpful. When talking to clients, this made me feel more confident explaining my designs because I had already been through the process with my online group.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With all of our days blending into each other in this pandemic, we as designers have an unprecedented opportunity to really shake things up. Furthermore, we are problem solvers.

But what does that even mean? Over the years I’ve seen two types of people who are referred to as “experts.” Expert 1 is someone who knows every tool in the language and makes sure to use every bit of it, whether it helps or not. Expert 2 also knows every piece of syntax, but they’re pickier about what they employ to solve problems, considering a number of factors, both code-related and not.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Can you take a guess at which expert we want working on our team? If you said Expert 2, you’d be right. They’re a developer focused on delivering readable code—lines of JavaScript others can understand and maintain. Someone who can make the complex simple. But “readable” is rarely definitive—in fact, it’s largely based on the eyes of the beholder. So where does that leave us? What should experts aim for when writing readable code? Are there clear right and wrong choices? The answer is, it depends.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The obvious choice</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to improve developer experience, TC39 has been adding lots of new features to ECMAScript in recent years, including many proven patterns borrowed from other languages. One such addition, added in ES2019, is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat\"><code>Array.prototype.flat()</code></a> It takes an argument of depth or <code>Infinity</code>, and flattens an array. If no argument is given, the depth defaults to 1.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Prior to this addition, we needed the following syntax to flatten an array to a single level.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let arr = [1, 2, [3, 4]];\n\n[].concat.apply([], arr);\n// [1, 2, 3, 4]</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we added <code>flat()</code>, that same functionality could be expressed using a single, descriptive function.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">arr.flat();\n// [1, 2, 3, 4]</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Is the second line of code more readable? The answer is emphatically yes. In fact, both experts would agree.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not every developer is going to be aware that <code>flat()</code> exists. But they don’t need to because <code>flat()</code> is a descriptive verb that conveys the meaning of what is happening. It’s a lot more intuitive than <code>concat.apply()</code>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is the rare case where there is a definitive answer to the question of whether new syntax is better than old. Both experts, each of whom is familiar with the two syntax options, will choose the second. They’ll choose the shorter, clearer, more easily maintained line of code.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But choices and trade-offs aren’t always so decisive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The gut check</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The wonder of JavaScript is that it’s incredibly versatile. There is a reason it’s all over the web. Whether you think that’s a good or <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/responsible-javascript-part-1/\">bad</a> thing is another story.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But with that versatility comes the paradox of choice. You can write the same code in many different ways. How do you determine which way is “right”? You can’t even begin to make a decision unless you understand the available options and their limitations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s use functional programming with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\"><code>map()</code></a> as the example. I’ll walk through various iterations that all yield the same result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is the tersest version of our <code>map()</code> examples. It uses the fewest characters, all fit into one line. This is our baseline.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const arr = [1, 2, 3];\nlet multipliedByTwo = arr.map(el =&#62; el * 2);\n// multipliedByTwo is [2, 4, 6]</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This next example adds only two characters: parentheses. Is anything lost? How about gained? Does it make a difference that a function with more than one parameter will always need to use the parentheses? I’d argue that it does. There is little to no detriment&#160; in adding them here, and it improves consistency when you inevitably write a function with multiple parameters. In fact, when I wrote this, <a href=\"https://prettier.io\">Prettier</a> enforced that constraint; it didn’t want me to create an arrow function without the parentheses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let multipliedByTwo = arr.map((el) =&#62; el * 2);</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s take it a step further. We’ve added curly braces and a return. Now this is starting to look more like a traditional function definition. Right now, it may seem like overkill to have a keyword as long as the function logic. Yet, if the function is more than one line, this extra syntax is again required. Do we presume that we will not have any other functions that go beyond a single line? That seems dubious.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let multipliedByTwo = arr.map((el) =&#62; {\n  return el * 2;\n});</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next we’ve removed the arrow function altogether. We’re using the same syntax as before, but we’ve swapped out for the <code>function</code> keyword. This is interesting because there is no scenario in which this syntax won’t work; no number of parameters or lines will cause problems, so consistency is on our side. It’s more verbose than our initial definition, but is that a bad thing? How does this hit a new coder, or someone who is well versed in something other than JavaScript? Is someone who knows JavaScript well going to be frustrated by this syntax in comparison?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let multipliedByTwo = arr.map(function(el) {\n  return el * 2;\n});</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally we get to the last option: passing just the function. And <code>timesTwo</code> can be written using any syntax we like. Again, there is no scenario in which passing the function name causes a problem. But step back for a moment and think about whether or not this could be confusing. If you’re new to this codebase, is it clear that <code>timesTwo</code> is a function and not an object? Sure, <code>map()</code> is there to give you a hint, but it’s not unreasonable to miss that detail. How about the location of where <code>timesTwo</code> is declared and initialized? Is it easy to find? Is it clear what it’s doing and how it’s affecting this result? All of these are important considerations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const timesTwo = (el) =&#62; el * 2;\nlet multipliedByTwo = arr.map(timesTwo);</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you can see, there is no obvious answer here. But making the right choice for your codebase means understanding all the options and their limitations. And knowing that consistency requires parentheses and curly braces and <code>return</code> keywords.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a number of questions you have to ask yourself when writing code. Questions of <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/responsible-javascript-part-2/#section9\">performance</a> are typically the most common. But when you’re looking at code that is functionally identical, your determination should be based on humans—how humans consume code.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Maybe newer isn’t always better</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So far we’ve found a clear-cut example of where both experts would reach for the newest syntax, even if it’s not universally known. We’ve also looked at an example that poses a lot of questions but not as many answers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it’s time to dive into code that I’ve written before...and removed. This is code that made me the first expert, using a little-known piece of syntax to solve a problem to the detriment of my colleagues and the maintainability of our codebase.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment\">Destructuring assignment</a> lets you unpack values from objects (or arrays). It typically looks something like this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const {node} = exampleObject;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It initializes a variable and assigns it a value all in one line. But it doesn’t have to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let node\n;({node} = exampleObject)</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The last line of code assigns a variable to a value using destructuring, but the variable declaration takes place one line before it. It’s not an uncommon thing to want to do, but many people don’t realize you can do it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But look at that code closely. It forces an awkward semicolon for code that doesn’t use semicolons to terminate lines. It wraps the command in parentheses and adds the curly braces; it’s entirely unclear what this is doing. It’s not easy to read, and, as an expert, it shouldn’t be in code that I write.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let node\nnode = exampleObject.node</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This code solves the problem. It works, it’s clear what it does, and my colleagues will understand it without having to look it up. With the destructuring syntax, just because I <em>can</em> doesn’t mean I <em>should</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Code isn’t everything</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we’ve seen, the Expert 2 solution is rarely obvious based on code alone; yet there are still clear distinctions between which code each expert would write. That’s because code is for machines to read and humans to interpret. So there are non-code factors to consider!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The syntax choices you make for a team of JavaScript developers is different than those you should make for a team of polyglots who aren’t steeped in the minutiae.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s take spread vs. <code>concat()</code> as an example.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spread was added to ECMAScript a few years ago, and it’s enjoyed wide adoption. It’s sort of a utility syntax in that it can do a lot of different things. One of them is concatenating a number of arrays.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];\nconst arr2 = [9, 11, 13];\nconst nums = [...arr1, ...arr2];</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As powerful as spread is, it isn’t a very intuitive symbol. So unless you already know what it does, it’s not super helpful. While both experts <em>may</em> safely assume a team of JavaScript specialists are familiar with this syntax, Expert 2 will probably question whether that’s true of a team of polyglot programmers. Instead, Expert 2 may select the <code>concat()</code> method instead, as it’s a descriptive verb that you can probably understand from the context of the code.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This code snippet gives us the same nums result as the spread example above.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];\nconst arr2 = [9, 11, 13];\nconst nums = arr1.concat(arr2);</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that’s but one example of how human factors influence code choices. A codebase that’s touched by a lot of different teams, for example, may have to hold more stringent standards that don’t necessarily keep up with the latest and greatest syntax. Then you move beyond the main source code and consider other factors in your tooling chain that make life easier, or harder, for the humans who work on that code. There is code that can be structured in a way that’s <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-testable-code/\">hostile to testing</a>. There is code that backs you into a corner for <a href=\"https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/701862/How-Not-to-Back-Yourself-into-a-Corner\">future scaling or feature addition</a>. There is code that’s <a href=\"https://laurieontech.com/posts/performance-diagnosis/\">less performant</a>, doesn’t <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/fromswitchestotargets/\">handle different browsers</a>, or <a href=\"https://a11y.coffee/\">isn’t accessible</a>. All of these factor into the recommendations Expert 2 makes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Expert 2 also considers the impact of naming. But let’s be honest, even <em>they</em> can’t get that right most of the time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Experts don’t prove themselves by using every piece of the spec; they prove themselves by knowing the spec well enough to deploy syntax judiciously and make well-reasoned decisions. This is how experts become multipliers—how they make new experts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So what does this mean for those of us who consider ourselves experts or aspiring experts? It means that writing code involves asking yourself a lot of questions. It means considering your developer audience in a real way. The best code you can write is code that accomplishes something complex, but is inherently understood by those who examine your codebase.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And no, it’s not easy. And there often isn’t a clear-cut answer. But it’s something you should consider with every function you write.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":25,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6964d2fef80efee6b89d501b0b749499","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"\n\t\t\t\tby \t\t\t\t\t","publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914133},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\tAsynchronous Design Critique: Giving Feedback\t\t\t\t","link":"https://alistapart.com/article/async-design-critique-giving-feedback/","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Feedback, in whichever form it takes, and whatever it may be called, is one of the most effective soft skills that we have at our disposal to collaboratively get our designs to a better place while growing our own skills and perspectives.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Feedback is also one of the most underestimated tools, and often by assuming that we’re already good at it, we settle, forgetting that it’s a skill that can be trained, grown, and improved.

The one that I personally like best—because it’s clear and actionable—is this one from <a href=\"https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/\">Lara Hogan</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7173014,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/async-critique-feedback-equation.png?resize=1024,293\" alt=\"An equation: Observation plus impact plus question equals actionable feedback.\" class=\"wp-image-7173014\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While this equation is generally used to give feedback to people, it also fits really well in a design critique because it ultimately answers some of the core questions that we work on: What? Where? Why? How? Imagine that you’re giving some feedback about some design work that spans multiple screens, like an onboarding flow: there are some pages shown, a flow blueprint, and an outline of the decisions made. You spot something that could be improved. If you keep the three elements of the equation in mind, you’ll have a mental model that can help you be more precise and effective.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here is a comment that could be given as a part of some feedback, and it might look reasonable at a first glance: it seems to superficially fulfill the elements in the equation. But does it?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Not sure about the buttons’ styles and hierarchy—it feels off. Can you change them?</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Observation</strong> for design feedback doesn’t just mean pointing out which part of the interface your feedback refers to, but it also refers to offering a perspective that’s as specific as possible. Are you providing the user’s perspective? Your expert perspective? A business perspective? The project manager’s perspective? A first-time user’s perspective?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Impact</strong> is about the <em>why</em>. Just pointing out a UI element might sometimes be enough if the issue may be obvious, but more often than not, you should add an explanation of what you’re pointing out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back.

This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong>question</strong> approach is meant to provide open guidance by eliciting the critical thinking in the designer receiving the feedback. Notably, in Lara’s equation she provides a second approach: <strong>request</strong>, which instead provides guidance toward a specific solution. While that’s a viable option for feedback in general, for design critiques, in my experience, defaulting to the <em>question</em> approach usually reaches the best solutions because designers are generally more comfortable in being given an open space to explore.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The difference between the two can be exemplified with, for the <em>question </em>approach:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back. But this is the only screen where this happens, as before we just used a single button and an “×” to close. This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow. Would it make sense to unify them?</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or, for the <em>request </em>approach:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back. But this is the only screen where this happens, as before we just used a single button and an “×” to close. This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow. Let’s make sure that all screens have the same pair of forward and back buttons.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At this point in some situations, it might be useful to integrate with an extra <em>why</em>: why you consider the given suggestion to be better.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back. But this is the only screen where this happens, as before we just used a single button and an “×” to close. This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow. Let’s make sure that all screens have the same two forward and back buttons so that users don’t get confused.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Choosing the <em>question</em> approach or the <em>request</em> approach can also at times be a matter of personal preference. A while ago, I was putting a lot of effort into improving my feedback: I did rounds of anonymous feedback, and I reviewed feedback with other people. After a few rounds of this work and a year later, I got a positive response: my feedback came across as effective and grounded. Until I changed teams. To my shock, my next round of feedback from one specific person wasn’t that great. The reason is that I had previously tried not to be prescriptive in my advice—because the people who I was previously working with preferred the open-ended <em>question</em> format over the <em>request</em> style of suggestions. But now in this other team, there was one person who instead preferred specific guidance. So I adapted my feedback for them to include requests.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One comment that I heard come up a few times is that this kind of feedback is quite long, and it doesn’t seem very efficient. No… but also yes. Let’s explore both sides.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No, this style of feedback is actually <strong>efficient</strong> because the length here is a byproduct of clarity, and spending time giving this kind of feedback can provide exactly enough information for a good fix. Also if we zoom out, it can reduce future back-and-forth conversations and misunderstandings, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of collaboration beyond the single comment. Imagine that in the example above the feedback were instead just, “Let’s make sure that all screens have the same two forward and back buttons.” The designer receiving this feedback wouldn’t have much to go by, so they might just apply the change. In later iterations, the interface might change or they might introduce new features—and maybe that change might not make sense anymore. Without the <em>why</em>, the designer might imagine that the change is about consistency… but what if it wasn’t? So there could now be an underlying concern that changing the buttons would be perceived as a regression.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, this style of feedback is <strong>not always efficient</strong> because the points in some comments don’t always need to be exhaustive, sometimes because certain changes may be obvious (“The font used doesn’t follow our guidelines”) and sometimes because the team may have a lot of internal knowledge such that some of the <em>whys</em> may be implied.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So the equation above isn’t meant to suggest a strict template for feedback but a mnemonic to reflect and improve the practice. Even after years of active work on my critiques, I still from time to time go back to this formula and reflect on whether what I just wrote is effective.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The tone</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well-grounded content is the foundation of feedback, but that’s not really enough. The soft skills of the person who’s providing the critique can multiply the likelihood that the feedback will be well received and understood. Tone alone can make the difference between content that’s rejected or welcomed, and it’s been demonstrated that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23802125/\">only positive feedback creates sustained change</a> in people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since our goal is to be understood and to have a positive working environment, tone is essential to work on. Over the years, I’ve tried to summarize the required soft skills in a formula that mirrors the one for content: the <strong>receptivity equation</strong>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7173015,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/async-critique-receptivity-equation.png?resize=1024,293\" alt=\"Another equation: Timing plus attitude plus form equals respectful feedback.\" class=\"wp-image-7173015\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Respectful feedback comes across as grounded, solid, and constructive. It’s the kind of feedback that, whether it’s positive or negative, is perceived as useful and fair.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Timing</strong> refers to when the feedback happens. To-the-point feedback doesn’t have much hope of being well received if it’s given at the wrong time. Questioning the entire high-level information architecture of a new feature when it’s about to ship might still be relevant if that questioning highlights a major blocker that nobody saw, but it’s way more likely that those concerns will have to wait for a later rework. So in general, attune your feedback to the stage of the project. Early iteration? Late iteration? Polishing work in progress? These all have different needs. The right timing will make it more likely that your feedback will be well received.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Attitude</strong> is the equivalent of intent, and in the context of person-to-person feedback, it can be referred to as <a href=\"https://www.radicalcandor.com/radical-candor-not-brutal-honesty/\">radical candor</a>. That means checking before we write to see whether what we have in mind will truly help the person and make the project better overall. This might be a hard reflection at times because maybe we don’t want to admit that we don’t really appreciate that person. Hopefully that’s not the case, but that can happen, and that’s okay. Acknowledging and owning that can help you make up for that: how would I write if I really cared about them? How can I avoid being passive aggressive? How can I be more constructive?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Form</strong> is relevant especially in a diverse and cross-cultural work environments because having great content, perfect timing, and the right attitude might not come across if the way that we write creates misunderstandings. There might be many reasons for this: sometimes certain words might trigger specific reactions; sometimes nonnative speakers might not understand all the nuances of some sentences; sometimes our brains might just be different and we might perceive the world differently—neurodiversity must be taken into consideration. Whatever the reason, it’s important to review not just what we write but how.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A few years back, I was asking for some feedback on how I give feedback. I received some good advice but also a comment that surprised me. They pointed out that when I wrote “Oh, […],” I made them feel stupid. That wasn’t my intent! I felt really bad, and I just realized that I provided feedback to them for months, and every time I might have made them feel stupid. I was horrified… but also thankful. I made a quick fix: I added “oh” in my list of replaced words (your choice between: macOS’s text replacement, aText, TextExpander, or others) so that when I typed “oh,” it was instantly deleted.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Something to highlight because it’s quite frequent—especially in teams that have a strong group spirit—is that people tend to beat around the bush. It’s important to remember here that <strong>a positive attitude doesn’t mean going light on the feedback</strong>—it just means that even when you provide hard, difficult, or challenging feedback, you do so in a way that’s respectful and constructive. The nicest thing that you can do for someone is to help them grow.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have a great advantage in giving feedback in written form: it can be <strong>reviewed by another person</strong> who isn’t directly involved, which can help to reduce or remove any bias that might be there. I found that the best, most insightful moments for me have happened when I’ve shared a comment and I’ve asked someone who I highly trusted, “How does this sound?,” “How can I do it better,” and even “How would you have written it?”—and I’ve learned a lot by seeing the two versions side by side.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The format</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Asynchronous feedback also has a major inherent advantage: we can take more time to refine what we’ve written to make sure that it fulfills two main goals: the <em>clarity</em> of communication and the <em>actionability</em> of the suggestions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7173016,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/async-critique-format.png?resize=1024,293\" alt=\"Clarity plus Actionability\" class=\"wp-image-7173016\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s imagine that someone shared a design iteration for a project. You are reviewing it and leaving a comment. There are many ways to do this, and of course context matters, but let’s try to think about some elements that may be useful to consider.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In terms of <em>clarity</em>, start by grounding the critique that you’re about to give by providing <strong>context</strong>. Specifically, this means describing where you’re coming from: do you have a deep knowledge of the project, or is this the first time that you’re seeing it? Are you coming from a high-level perspective, or are you figuring out the details? Are there regressions? Which user’s perspective are you taking when providing your feedback? Is the design iteration at a point where it would be okay to ship this, or are there major things that need to be addressed first?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Providing context is helpful even if you’re sharing feedback within a team that already has some information on the project. And context is absolutely essential when giving cross-team feedback. If I were to review a design that might be indirectly related to my work, and if I had no knowledge about how the project arrived at that point, I would say so, highlighting my take as external.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We often focus on the negatives, trying to outline all the things that could be done better. That’s of course important, but it’s just as important—if not more—to focus on the <strong>positives</strong>, especially if you saw progress from the previous iteration. This might seem superfluous, but it’s important to keep in mind that design is a discipline where there are hundreds of possible solutions for every problem. So pointing out that the design solution that was chosen is good and explaining why it’s good has two major benefits: it confirms that the approach taken was solid, and it helps to ground your negative feedback. In the longer term, sharing positive feedback can help prevent regressions on things that are going well because those things will have been highlighted as important. As a bonus, positive feedback can also help reduce impostor syndrome.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s one powerful approach that combines both <em>context</em> and <em>a focus on the positives</em>: <strong>frame how the design is better than the status quo</strong> (compared to a previous iteration, competitors, or benchmarks) and why, and then on that foundation, you can add what could be improved. This is powerful because there’s a big difference between a critique that’s for a design that’s already in good shape and a critique that’s for a design that isn’t quite there yet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another way that you can improve your feedback is to <strong>depersonalize the feedback</strong>: the comments should always be about the work, never about the person who made it. It’s “This button isn’t well aligned” versus “You haven’t aligned this button well.” This is very easy to change in your writing by reviewing it just before sending.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In terms of <em>actionability</em>, one of the best approaches to help the designer who’s reading through your feedback is to <strong>split</strong> it into bullet points or paragraphs, which are easier to review and analyze one by one. For longer pieces of feedback, you might also consider splitting it into sections or even across multiple comments. Of course, adding screenshots or signifying markers of the specific part of the interface you’re referring to can also be especially useful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One approach that I’ve personally used effectively in some contexts is to enhance the bullet points with four markers using emojis. So a red square 🟥 means that it’s something that I consider blocking; a yellow diamond 🔶 is something that I can be convinced otherwise, but it seems to me that it should be changed; and a green circle 🟢 is a detailed, positive confirmation. I also use a blue spiral 🌀 for either something that I’m not sure about, an exploration, an open alternative, or just a note. But I’d use this approach only on teams where I’ve already established a good level of trust because if it happens that I have to deliver a lot of red squares, the impact could be quite demoralizing, and I’d reframe how I’d communicate that a bit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s see how this would work by reusing the example that we used earlier as the first bullet point in this list:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>🔶 Navigation—When I see these two buttons, I expect one to go forward and one to go back. But this is the only screen where this happens, as before we just used a single button and an “×” to close. This seems to be breaking the consistency in the flow. Let’s make sure that all screens have the same two forward and back buttons so that users don’t get confused.</li><li>🟢 Overall—I think the page is solid, and this is good enough to be our release candidate for a version 1.0.</li><li>🟢 Metrics—Good improvement in the buttons on the metrics area; the improved contrast and new focus style make them more accessible.</li><li>&#160;🟥&#160; Button Style—Using the green accent in this context creates the impression that it’s a positive action because green is usually perceived as a confirmation color. Do we need to explore a different color?</li><li>🔶Tiles—Given the number of items on the page, and the overall page hierarchy, it seems to me that the tiles shouldn’t be using the Subtitle 1 style but the Subtitle 2 style. This will keep the visual hierarchy more consistent.</li><li>🌀 Background—Using a light texture works well, but I wonder whether it adds too much noise in this kind of page. What is the thinking in using that?</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What about giving feedback directly in <strong>Figma</strong> or another design tool that allows in-place feedback? In general, I find these difficult to use because they hide discussions and they’re harder to track, but in the right context, they can be very effective. Just make sure that each of the comments is separate so that it’s easier to match each discussion to a single task, similar to the idea of splitting mentioned above.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One final note: <strong>say the obvious</strong>. Sometimes we might feel that something is obviously good or obviously wrong, and so we don’t say it. Or sometimes we might have a doubt that we don’t express because the question might sound stupid. Say it—that’s okay. You might have to reword it a little bit to make the reader feel more comfortable, but don’t hold it back. Good feedback is transparent, even when it may be obvious.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s another advantage of asynchronous feedback: <strong>written feedback automatically tracks decisions</strong>. Especially in large projects, “Why did we do this?” could be a question that pops up from time to time, and there’s nothing better than open, transparent discussions that can be reviewed at any time. For this reason, I recommend using software that saves these discussions, without hiding them once they are resolved.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Content, tone, and format. Each one of these subjects provides a useful model, but working to improve eight areas—<em>observation, impact, question, timing, attitude, form, clarity, and actionability</em>—is a lot of work to put in all at once. One effective approach is to take them one by one: first identify the area that you lack the most (either from your perspective or from feedback from others) and start there. Then the second, then the third, and so on. At first you’ll have to put in extra time for every piece of feedback that you give, but after a while, it’ll become second nature, and your impact on the work will multiply.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Thanks to Brie Anne Demkiw and Mike Shelton for reviewing the first draft of this article.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":25,"bgimg":"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/async-critique-feedback-equation.png?resize=1024,293","linkMd5":"4c1e9a233af3ec5a0c68396187725d4e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn64@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-08-579_1ab962259b6fe6dd.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":293,"sourceBytes":28622,"destBytes":28622,"author":"\n\t\t\t\tby \t\t\t\t\t","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/async-critique-feedback-equation.png?resize=1024,293":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn64@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-08-579_1ab962259b6fe6dd.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/async-critique-receptivity-equation.png?resize=1024,293":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn71@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-298_6841a32f0218c399.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/async-critique-format.png?resize=1024,293":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn15@2020_6/2021/07/13/17-22-23-126_da0801396f4a2cef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914097},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\tDo You Need to Localize Your Website?\t\t\t\t","link":"https://alistapart.com/article/do-you-need-to-localize-your-website/","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Global markets give you access to new customers.

Maybe you want to set up a workshop or a meetup in India. Or a bootcamp retreat in the country.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can achieve this by focusing on the similarities you have with your audience.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The same rule applies to other countries where English language is commonly used by IT professionals.

You may wonder how, <a href=\"https://www.ef.com/wwen/epi/regions/asia/indonesia/\">despite their lack of English skill</a>, they can learn programming.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s an explanation for it.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two types of language skills: <a href=\"https://www.languagesoftware.net/blog/developing-passive-skills-in-language-learning/\"><em>passive</em> (listening, reading) and <em>active</em> (speaking, writing)</a>. Passive language skills are usually learned first. Active language skills are developed later. You learn to speak by listening, and learn to write by reading. You go through this process as a child and, again, when you learn a new language as an adult. (This is not to confuse <a href=\"https://www.utesinternationallounge.com/language-acquisition-versus-language-learning/\">language acquisition with language learning</a>, but to note that the process is relatively the same.)&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As most free IT course materials are available online in English, some programmers may have to adapt and <a href=\"https://jlptbootcamp.com/2012/10/passive-language-skills/\">study English (passively) as they go</a>. They may not be considered “fluent” in a formal way, but it doesn’t mean they lack the ability to grasp the language. They may not be able to speak or write perfectly, but they can understand technical texts.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In short, passive and active language skills can grow at different speeds. This fact leads you to <em>a new group of potential audience</em>: those who can understand English, but only passively.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your product is in a text format, translation won’t be necessary for this type of audience. If it’s an audio or video format, you may need to add subtitles, since native English speakers speak in so many different accents and at various speeds. Captioning will also help the hard of hearing. It may be required by regional or national accessibility legislation too. And it’s the right thing to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One might argue that if these people can understand English, they will understand the text better in their native tongue.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well, if all the programs you’re using or referring to are available in their native language version, it may not be a problem. But in reality, this is often not the case.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Linguistic consistency helps programmers work faster.

So, it was the right decision to target Indonesian SMEs using Indonesian language.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The company had the budget to target Indonesia’s market of 58 million SMEs, and there weren’t too many competitors yet. I think the localization plan was justified. But even with this generally well-thought-out plan, there were some problems in its execution.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The materials were filled with jargon and annoying outlinks. You could not just read an instruction until it was completed, because after a few words, you would be confronted with a “smart term.” Now to understand this smart term, you would have to follow a link that would take you to a separate page that was supposed to explain everything, but in that page you would find more smart terms that you’d need to click. At this point, the scent of information would have grown cold, and you’d likely have forgotten what you were reading or why.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Small business owners are among the busiest folks you can find. They do almost everything by themselves. They would not waste their time trying to read pages of instructions that throw them right and left.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Language-wise, the instructions could have been simplified. Design-wise, a hover/focus pop-up containing a brief definition or description could have been used to explain special terms.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I agree pop-ups can be distracting, but in terms of ease, for this use case, they would have worked far better than outlinks. There are <a href=\"https://accessuse.eu/en/Content-hover-focus.html\">some ways to improve hover/focus pop-ups</a> to make them more readable.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, if the content of those pop-ups (definition, description, etc.) cannot be brief, it is wiser to write it down as a separate paragraph.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In my client’s case, they could have started each instruction by describing the definitions of those special terms. Those definitions ought to be written in one page so as to reduce the amount of time spent on clicking and returning to the intended page. This solution can also be applied when a definition is too long to be put inside a hover/focus bubble.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The text problem, in my client’s case, came with the source language. It was later transferred to the target language thanks to localization. They could have solved the problem at the source language level, but I think it would have been too late at that point.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Transcreation</em>, i.e., “<a href=\"https://www.articulatemarketing.com/blog/translation-vs-transcreation\">taking a concept in one language and completely recreating it in another language</a>,” doesn’t solve a problem like this because the issue is more technical than linguistic. Translators would still have to adjust their work to the given environment. They’d still have to retain all the links and translate all jargon-laden content.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The company should have hired a local writer to rewrite the content in the target language. It would have worked better. They didn’t take this route for a reason: namely, those “smart terms” were used as keywords. So as much as we hated them, we had to keep them there.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>How to prepare a web localization project</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s say you have considered everything. You’ve learned about your target audience, how your product will solve their problem, and that you have the budget to reach out to them. Naturally, you want to reach them now before your competitors do.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now you can proceed with your web localization project plan.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing I want to repeat is that localization will transfer any errors you have in your original content to the translated pages. So you’ll need to do some content pre-checks before starting a web translation project. It will be cheaper to fix the problems <em>before</em> the translation project commences.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pre-localization checks should include assessing the text you intend to translate. Ask someone outside the team to read the text and ask them to give their feedback. It’s even better if that someone represents the target audience.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then make corrections, if need be. Use as little jargon as possible. Let readers focus on one article with no interruption.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some companies like to coin new terms to create keywords that will lead people to their sites. This can be a smart move, and it is arguably good for search engine optimization. But if you want to <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/turning-point/201504/how-build-rapport-powerful-technique\">build rapport with your audience</a>, you must make your message clear and understandable. Clear communication, not the invention of new words, should be your priority.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Following this course of action might mean sacrificing keywords for clarity, but <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/13-ways-to-reduce-bounce-rate-and-increase-your-conversions/\">it also promises a lower bounce rate</a> since visitors will stay longer on your site. After all, people are more likely to read your writing to the end if they are not being frustrated by difficult terms.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once your text is ready, you can start your localization project. You can hire a language agency or build your own team.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have a lot of content, it may be wise to outsource your project to a language agency. Doing so can save you time and money. An outside specialist consultancy will have the technology and skills to work on various types of localization projects. They can also translate your website to different languages at once.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As an alternative, you might directly hire freelance editors and translators to work on your project. Depending on many factors, this might end up less or more expensive than hiring an agency.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make sure that the translators you hire, whether directly or through an agency, have relevant experience. If your text is about marketing, for instance, the translators and editors must be experts in this field. This is to make sure they can get your message across.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most translation tools used today can retain sentence formatting, links, and HTML code, so you don’t need to worry about these.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Focus on the message you want to carry to your target audience. Be sensitive about cultural remarks and be careful about any potential misunderstanding caused by your translation. Consult with your language team about certain phrases that may become problematic when translated. Pick your words carefully. Choose the right expressions.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you localize a website, you must be sure to provide customer service support in target-friendly language. This allows you to reply to customers immediately, rather than having to wait for a translator to become involved.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In summary, don’t be hasty when doing a web localization/translation project. There are a lot of things to consider beforehand. A well prepared plan will yield a better result. A good quality translation will not only bridge the language gap but it can also build trust and solidify your brand image in the mind of your target audience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":25,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e2470fd97a8b387a864c94a21b4fc17f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"\n\t\t\t\tby \t\t\t\t\t","publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914238},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\tNow THAT&#8217;S What I Call Service Worker!\t\t\t\t","link":"https://alistapart.com/article/now-thats-what-i-call-service-worker/","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API\">Service Worker</a> API is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dremel\">Dremel</a> of the web platform.

One reason for this is that in order to avoid the Service Worker startup penalty, we’ll need to set up navigation preload.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Implementing navigation preload</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Navigation preload addresses the problem of Service Worker startup time, which delays navigation requests to the network. The last thing you want to do with a Service Worker is hold up the show.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Navigation preload must be explicitly enabled. Once enabled, the Service Worker won’t hold up navigation requests during startup. Navigation preload is enabled in the Service Worker’s <code>activate</code> event:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>self.addEventListener(\"activate\", event =&#62; {\n  const cacheName = \"fancy_cache_name_here\";\n  const preloadAvailable = \"navigationPreload\" in self.registration;\n\n  event.waitUntil(caches.keys().then(keys =&#62; {\n    return Promise.all(&#091;\n      keys.filter(key =&#62; {\n        return key !== cacheName;\n      }).map(key =&#62; {\n        return caches.delete(key);\n      }),\n      self.clients.claim(),\n      preloadAvailable ? self.registration.navigationPreload.enable() : true\n    ]);\n  }));\n});</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_navigationpreloadmanager\">Because navigation preload isn’t supported everywhere</a>, we have to do the usual feature check, which we store in the above example in the <code>preloadAvailable</code> variable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Additionally, we need to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all\"><code>Promise.all()</code></a> to resolve multiple asynchronous operations before the Service Worker activates. This includes pruning those old caches, as well as waiting for both <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clients/claim\"><code>clients.claim()</code></a> (which tells the Service Worker to assert control immediately rather than waiting until the next navigation) and navigation preload to be enabled.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A ternary operator is used to enable navigation preload in supporting browsers and avoid throwing errors in browsers that don’t. If <code>preloadAvailable</code> is <code>true</code>, we enable navigation preload. If it isn’t, we pass a Boolean that won’t affect how <code>Promise.all()</code> resolves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With navigation preload enabled, we need to write code in our Service Worker’s <code>fetch()</code> event handler to make use of the preloaded response:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>self.addEventListener(\"fetch\", event =&#62; {\n  const { request } = event;\n\n  // Static asset handling code omitted for brevity\n  // ...\n\n  // Check if this is a request for a document\n  if (request.mode === \"navigate\") {\n    const networkContent = Promise.resolve(event.preloadResponse).then(response =&#62; {\n      if (response) {\n        addResponseToCache(request, response.clone());\n\n        return response;\n      }\n\n      return fetch(request.url, {\n        headers: {\n          \"X-Content-Mode\": \"partial\"\n        }\n      }).then(response =&#62; {\n        addResponseToCache(request, response.clone());\n\n        return response;\n      });\n    }).catch(() =&#62; {\n      return caches.match(request.url);\n    });\n\n    // More to come...\n  }\n});</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though this isn’t the entirety of the Service Worker’s <code>fetch()</code> event code, there’s a lot that needs explaining:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>The preloaded response is available in <code>event.preloadResponse</code>.

It also means you’ll need to update the navigation state in JavaScript to reflect the current page if that’s something you do on your website. Note that this shouldn’t cause indexing issues, as Googlebot crawls pages with an unprimed cache.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There may also be some challenges on sites with authentication. For example, if your site’s header displays the current authenticated user on log in, you may have to update the header partial markup provided by <code>CacheStorage</code> in JavaScript on each navigation to reflect who is authenticated. You may be able to do this by storing basic user data in <code>localStorage</code> and updating the UI from there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are certainly other challenges, but it’ll be up to you to weigh the user-facing benefits versus the development costs.

Personally, I prefer to work as close to the metal as I can so I can gain a better understanding of what lies beneath abstractions like Workbox. Even so, Service Worker is hard.

The deep emotional bonds many people have with their pets proves this. (So might the popularity of the Pet Rock in the 1970s but that’s just speculation.) Even Link in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> had an inanimate companion: his trusty sword (see Figure 9.1).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172418,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.1.jpg?fit=960%2C600\" alt=\"A screen from The Legend of Zelda where Link receives his sword from an old man saying 'It's Dangerous To Go Alone! Take This.'\" class=\"wp-image-7172418\" /><figcaption><strong>Fig 9.1</strong> Even the company of a wooden sword is better than venturing into Hyrule alone.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s also possible for people to feel that sense of connection in the context of behavior change without having direct relationships with others. By building your product in a way that mimics some of the characteristics of a person-to-person relationship, you can make it possible for your users to feel connected to it. It is possible to coax your users to fall at least a little bit in love with your products; if you don’t believe me, try to get an iPhone user to switch operating systems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s not just about really liking a product (although you definitely want users to really like your product). With the right design elements, your users might embark on a meaningful bond with your technology, where they feel engaged in an ongoing, two-way relationship with an entity that understands something important about them, yet is recognizably non<s>-</s>human. This is a true emotional attachment that supplies at least some of the benefits of a human-to-human relationship. This type of connection can help your users engage more deeply and for a longer period of time with your product. And that should ultimately help them get closer to their behavior change goals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Amp Up the Anthropomorphization</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People can forge relationships with non<s>-</s>humans easily because of a process called <em>anthropomorphization</em>. To anthropomorphize something means to impose human characteristics on it. It’s what happens when you see a face in the array of shapes on the right side in Figure 9.2, or when you carry on an extended conversation with your cat.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172419,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.2.jpg?fit=960%2C576\" alt=\"An assortment of the same four shapes side by side. The grouping on the right looks like a face based on the shape positions.\" class=\"wp-image-7172419\" /><figcaption><strong>Fig 9.2</strong> The brain is built to seek and recognize human characteristics whenever a pattern suggests they might be there. That means people interpret the array of shapes on the right as face-like, but not the one on the left.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People will find the human qualities in shapes that slightly resemble a face, but you can help speed that process along by deliberately imbuing your product with physical or personality features that resemble people. Voice assistants like Siri, Cortana, and Alexa, for example, are easily perceived as human-like by users thanks to their ability to carry on a conversation much like a (somewhat single-minded) person.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Granted, almost nobody would mistake Alexa for a real person, but her human characteristics are pretty convincing. Some research suggests that children who grow up around these voice assistants may be less polite when asking for help, because they hear adults make demands of their devices without saying please or thank you. If you’re asking Siri for the weather report and there are little ones in earshot, consider adding the <em>other</em> magic words to your request.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, if you want people to anthropomorphize your product, give it some human characteristics. Think names, avatars, a voice, or even something like a catchphrase. These details will put your users’ natural anthropomorphization tendencies into hyperdrive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Everything Is Personal</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing humans do well is personalization. You don’t treat your parent the same way you treat your spouse the same way you treat your boss. Each interaction is different based on the identity of the person you’re interacting with and the history you have with them. Technology can offer that same kind of individualized experience as another way to mimic people, with lots of other benefits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Personalization is the Swiss Army Knife of the behavior change design toolkit. It can help you craft appropriate goals and milestones, deliver the right feedback at the right time, and offer users meaningful choices in context. It can also help forge an emotional connection between users and technology when it’s applied in a way that helps users feel seen and understood.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some apps have lovely interfaces that let users select colors or background images or button placements for a “personalized” experience. While these types of features are nice, they don’t scratch the itch of belonging that true personalization does. When personalization works, it’s because it reflects something essential about the user back to them. That doesn’t mean it has to be incredibly deep, but it does need to be somewhat more meaningful than whether the user has a pink or green background on their home screen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Personalized Preferences</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During onboarding or early in your users’ product experience, allow them to personalize preferences that will shape their experiences in meaningful ways (<em>not</em> just color schemes and dashboard configurations). For example, Fitbit asks people their preferred names, and then greets them periodically using their selection. Similarly, LoseIt asks users during setup if they enjoy using data and technology as part of their weight loss process (Figure 9.3). Users who say yes are given an opportunity to integrate trackers and other devices with the app; users who say no are funneled to a manual entry experience. The user experience changes to honor something individual about the user.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172421,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.3-1.jpg?fit=960%2C889\" alt=\"Screenshots of the LoseIt app showing it asking whether a user enjoys looking at data and using technology then acknowledging their choice.\" class=\"wp-image-7172421\" /><figcaption><strong>Fig 9.3</strong> LoseIt gives users an opportunity to share their technology preferences during onboarding and then uses that choice to shape their future experience.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you can, recall back to ancient times when Facebook introduced an algorithmic sort of posts in the newsfeed. Facebook users tend to be upset anytime there’s a dramatic change to the interface, but their frustration with this one has persisted, for one core reason: Facebook to this day reverts to its own sorting algorithm as a default, even if a user has selected to organize content by date instead. This repeated insistence on their preference over users’ makes it less likely that users will feel “seen” by Facebook.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Personalized Recommendations</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’ve ever shopped online, you’ve probably received personalized recommendations. Amazon is the quintessential example of a recommendation engine. Other commonly encountered personalized recommendations include Facebook’s “People You May Know” and Netflix’s “Top Picks for [Your Name Here].” These tools use algorithms that suggest new items based on data about what people have done in the past.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Recommendation engines can follow two basic models of personalization. The first one is based on products or items. Each item is tagged with certain attributes. For example, if you were building a workout recommendation engine, you might tag the item of “bicep curls” with “arm exercise,” “upper arm,” and “uses weights.” An algorithm might then select “triceps pulldowns” as a similar item to recommend, since it matches on those attributes. This type of recommendation algorithm says, “If you liked this item, you will like this similar item.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second personalization model is based on people. People who have attributes in common are identified by a similarity index. These similarity indices can include tens or hundreds of variables to precisely match people to others who are like them in key ways. Then the algorithm makes recommendations based on items that lookalike users have chosen. This recommendation algorithm says, “People like you liked these items.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In reality, many of the more sophisticated recommendation engines (like Amazon’s) blend the two types of algorithms in a hybrid approach. And they’re effective. McKinsey estimates that 35% of what Amazon sells and 75% of what Netflix users watch are recommended by these engines.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Don’t Overwhelm</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes what appear to be personalized recommendations can come from a much simpler sort of algorithm that doesn’t take an individual user’s preferences into account at all. These algorithms might just surface the suggestions that are most popular among <em>all</em> users, which isn’t always a terrible strategy. Some things are popular for a reason. Or recommendations could be made in a set order that doesn’t depend on user characteristics at all. This appears to be the case with the Fabulous behavior change app that offers users a series of challenges like “drink water,” “eat a healthy breakfast,” and “get morning exercise,” regardless of whether these behaviors are already part of their routine or not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When recommendation algorithms work well, they can help people on the receiving end feel like their preferences and needs are understood. When I browse the playlists Spotify creates for me, I see several aspects of myself reflected. There’s a playlist with my favorite 90s alt-rock, one with current artists I like, and a third with some of my favorite 80s music (Figure 9.4). Amazon has a similar ability to successfully extrapolate what a person might like from their browsing and purchasing history. I was always amazed that even though I didn’t buy any of my kitchen utensils from Amazon, they somehow figured out that I have the red KitchenAid line.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172422,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.4.jpg?fit=960%2C524\" alt=\"Spotify's Daily Mixes showcasing three distinct sets of musical styles based on the user's listening habits.\" class=\"wp-image-7172422\" /><figcaption><strong>Fig 9.4</strong> Spotify picks up on the details of users’ musical selections to construct playlists that reflect multiple aspects of their tastes.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A risk to this approach is that recommendations might become redundant as the database of items grows. Retail products are an easy example; for many items, once people have bought one, they likely don’t need another, but algorithms aren’t always smart enough to stop recommending similar purchases (see Figure 9.5). The same sort of repetition can happen with behavior change programs. There are only so many different ways to set reminders, for example, so at some point it’s a good idea to stop bombarding a user with suggestions on the topic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172423,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.5.jpg\" alt=\"A tweet from Andy Richter saying 'I ordered a toilet seat from Amazon and now based on the ads I see they must think I have an insatiable toilet seat addiction'\" class=\"wp-image-7172423\" /><figcaption><strong>Fig 9.5</strong> When a user only needs a finite number of something, or has already satisfied a need, it’s easy for recommendations to become redundant.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Don’t Be Afraid to Learn</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Data-driven personalization comes with another set of risks. The more you know about users, the more they expect you to provide relevant and accurate suggestions. Even the smartest technology will get things wrong sometimes. Give your users opportunities to point out if your product is off-base, and adjust accordingly. Not only will this improve your accuracy over time, but it will also reinforce your users’ feelings of being cared for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Alfred was a recommendation app developed by Clever Sense to help people find new restaurants based on their own preferences, as well as input from their social networks. One of Alfred’s mechanisms for gathering data was to ask users to confirm which restaurants they liked from a list of possibilities (see Figure 9.6). Explicitly including training in the experience helped Alfred make better and better recommendations while also giving users the opportunity to chalk errors up to a need for more training.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172425,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.6-1.jpg?fit=731%2C1024\" alt=\"The Alfred app takes a guess at places the user might enjoy for dinner and asks if any of them are right.\" class=\"wp-image-7172425\" /><figcaption><strong>Fig 9.6</strong> Alfred included a learning mode where users would indicate places they already enjoyed eating. That data helped improve Alfred’s subsequent recommendations.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having a mechanism for users to exclude some of their data from an algorithm can also be helpful. Amazon allows users to indicate which items in their purchase history should be ignored when making recommendations—a feature that comes in handy if you buy gifts for loved ones whose tastes are very different from yours.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the flip side, deliberately throwing users a curve ball is a great way to learn more about their tastes and preferences. Over time, algorithms are likely to become more consistent as they get better at pattern matching. Adding the occasional mold-breaking suggestion can prevent boredom and better account for users’ quirks. Just because someone loves meditative yoga doesn’t mean they don’t also like going mountain biking once in a while, but most recommendation engines won’t learn that because they’ll be too busy recommending yoga videos and mindfulness exercises. Every now and then add something into the mix that users won’t expect. They’ll either reject it or give it a whirl; either way, your recommendation engine gets smarter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Personalized Coaching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At some point, recommendations in the context of behavior change may become something more robust: an actual personalized plan of action. When recommendations grow out of the “you might also like” phase into “here’s a series of steps that should work for you,” they become a little more complicated. Once a group of personalized recommendations have some sort of cohesiveness to systematically guide a person toward a goal, it becomes <em>coaching</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>More deeply personalized coaching leads to more effective behavior change. One study by Dr. Vic Strecher, whom you met in Chapter 3, showed that the more a smoking cessation coaching plan was personalized, the more likely people were to successfully quit smoking. A follow-up study by Dr. Strecher’s team used fMRI technology to discover that when people read personalized information, it activates areas of their brain associated with the self (see Figure 9.7). That is, people perceive personalized information as self-relevant on a neurological level.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172426,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.7.jpg?fit=960%2C485\" alt=\"A front and side scan from an MRI showing activation (in yellow) in the prefrontal cortex.\" class=\"wp-image-7172426\" /><figcaption><strong>Fig 9.7</strong> This is an fMRI image showing activation in a person’s medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area of the brain associated with the self. The brain activity was recorded after showing people personalized health information.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is important because people are more likely to remember and act on relevant information. If you want people to <em>do</em> something, personalize the experience that shows them how.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From a practical perspective, personalized coaching also helps overcome a common barrier: People do not want to spend a lot of time reading content. If your program can provide only the most relevant items while leaving the generic stuff on the cutting room floor, you’ll offer more concise content that people may actually read.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":25,"bgimg":"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.1.jpg?fit=960%2C600","linkMd5":"8ebf2effbee6917e62f8caca9583a623","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn23@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-22-643_5c951826bcd54004.webp","destWidth":960,"destHeight":600,"sourceBytes":31062,"destBytes":31062,"author":"\n\t\t\t\tby \t\t\t\t\t","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.1.jpg?fit=960%2C600":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn23@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-22-643_5c951826bcd54004.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.2.jpg?fit=960%2C576":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn22@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-23-457_8f2da14c19a9d68c.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.3-1.jpg?fit=960%2C889":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn4@2020_5/2021/07/13/17-22-23-709_eb48e0469f843793.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.4.jpg?fit=960%2C524":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn95@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-153_eed9870ab74d9d84.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn5@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-323_2fbd809ee06f7df6.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.6-1.jpg?fit=731%2C1024":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn67@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-170_95acc98bdba43625.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/engaged-9.7.jpg?fit=960%2C485":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn76@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-138_7bd194b1ad1f368c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914082},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:22:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:22:06","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\tConnecting the Dots\t\t\t\t","link":"https://alistapart.com/article/creative-culture-excerpt/","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two plans: one for design, one for culture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I’ve found is that the DNA between both dynamics must be inextricable from one another.

Via the “Inspiration” portion of the day and venturing away from the&#160;office, we gain insight into a new team member as an individual&#160;that transcends what folio work can yield. What physical aspects of their selected location have impacted who they are? How did it inspire their way of creating, or approaching problems? Understanding the impact of spatial dynamics on an individual is vital toward an individualistic, yet ultimately holistic, view.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ethnographic research provides an environmental context to&#160;human interaction that a video-conference interview could never yield. Through direct observation, ethnography is the qualitative study of human beings in their native environment.

Are they a field worker primarily utilizing a mobile device in direct sunlight, yielding paramountcolor contrast needs?

Their business is located within the Logan Share, a co- working space they also founded in Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I reached out to the Studio to ask if I could stop by their space and observe a “morning in the life” view of their process: culture and design, organically, as both unfolded. Without hesitation, Sara (a former Northwestern University instructor) extended me&#160;an offer to join the team for observation. After signing a non-&#160;disclosure agreement, we agreed on a date for my visit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I arrived on a Monday morning, George (formerly of&#160;IDEO) greeted me with a cup of coffee and walked me up the stairs&#160;into the naturally well-lit Logan Share space. I noticed the open seating in the co-working section was already nearly full, as he gave&#160;me a tour of the “configuration by human need and intent”-based&#160;layout and active-project areas. On long single sheets of cardboard suspended by custom-built fasteners, entire lifecycles of project- centric human-centered design artifacts were on display. Once a project is deployed, George explained, the cardboard is detached and saved for forthcoming iteration, with fresh sheets re-fastened to form the partitions of a new project space thereafter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The six core steps of the Studio’s HCD process manifest themselves in the following way:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li><strong>Framing</strong><br>Defining questions to answer and people to engage</li><li><strong>Research</strong><br>Learning from people about their needs and values</li><li><strong>Synthesis</strong><br>Finding patterns of behavior and areas of opportunity</li><li><strong>Concepting</strong><br>Creating a high volume of new ideas</li><li><strong>Prototyping</strong><br>Making tangible mock-ups and gathering feedback</li><li><strong>Piloting</strong><br>Testing solutions in real time with real people</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a team, GGS functions via a working method called ROWE (Results Only Work Environment), a concept leveraged from Cali&#160;Ressler and Jody Thompson’s book&#160;<em>Why Work Sucks and How to Fix It: The Results-Only Revolution.&#160;</em>Taken from an article on the Studio’s blog, they describe the practice within GGS like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“The basic principle behind ROWE is that staff doesn’t need to be supervised, when given the tools, clear expectations, and deadlines&#160;people will not only do their work, but do it better than if they were&#160;trying to fit into a mold. Within GGS, this practice is exercised by very diligent calendar management, clear deadlines, expectations on deliverables, and Cookie Rewards (little treats we give each other if we have to move something on the calendar).”</em></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once a month the entire team pauses for a five-hour, non-client&#160;project block of time called “internal day.” This time is reserved for studio-centric things: team members sharing learnings from conferences they’ve attended, how to improve internal practices, past project debriefs, etc. It’s the act of pausing with intent, in full&#160;effect.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sara arrived a few minutes into my tour of the space, and the GGS team’s “BD charrette” was the first employee gathering&#160;(remote and in-person) of the morning. “BD” stands for “business&#160;development,” and in a cozy seating area, everyone had a seat at&#160;the table in all senses of the phrase. Sara and George ran through the status of a current request for proposal, then each team member had the opportunity to voice their opinion about whether the RFP should be pursued based on how it aligned with GGS’s&#160;(and their employees’) personal, values. Everyone was heard; every&#160;voice was respected.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The dialogue eventually shifted to another potential new client,&#160;this time with GGS at the presentation stage. Again, everyone at the table gave their feedback on Sara and George’s presentation plan of attack and, again, every team member’s voice carried equal value and weight. The studio-wide inclusion in the business&#160;owners’ decision making was genuine, effortless, and natural.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Forty-five minutes later, the group made a physical transition&#160;to a few nearby couches; less than a three-foot walk, as I eyed it. I inquired about the very minor spatial change for this next leg of the meeting and was told, “There’s a difference in purpose, so we transition to a different space.” Each member of the team then&#160;took their turn describing their weekend in three words:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“Sunshine, beach, baking.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I got my turn as well. Changing the energy on those couches, from new business to being focused on the individual, made for a palpable climate change. In a few words everyone had a sense of what their teammates got up to over the weekend, eliciting smiles and planting the seeds for future dialogues throughout the pauses- with-intent over the rest of the day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next: “validations.” In this final portion of the meeting (pre-&#160;project status), anyone who wanted to articulate their appreciation for a team member over the previous week did so. One person&#160;recognized their co-worker for their selfless collaboration, taking&#160;time from their own project work to help theirs get client-ready on time. Similar-but-unique “thanks” emerged from varied people; no one was required to speak up, but everyone did.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After project updates I sat with Sara for a one-on-one to chat over coffee. I asked her about the synergies between their HCD process and how she interacts with her team in the office:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“I think where it’s actually become more intentional and obvious has&#160;been with our staff who are not trained designers. Operations folks, or our community manager, etc. I’ve had to say, ‘I want you to be a designer about this’ (whatever ‘this’ is). ‘We are your users, you’re trying to get us to do our timesheets, or clean up the kitchen, etc. Observe. Talk to people. Figure out our motivations. Summarize everything you’ve learned, and then have ideas.’</em></p><p><em>As a designer, I am constantly designing at every level. I’m designing&#160;deliverables in many cases for clients, or coaching our teams to design deliverables.

Where decisions were not made transparently, everything financial was completely opaque. Lots of lack of trust with other employees. It’s been so critical that I’ve had bad experiences so I can now clearly say: let’s not do that.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The tactics, mindsets, organizational shifts, and operational flexibility discussed in this book are predicated upon a simple truth: a company presently supports and operates as a creative culture, or it’s genuinely willing to evolve to become one.

But what about when you’re not in a position to be heard, or the position to help facilitate change?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Reality isn’t always unicorns and rainbows. Bad experiences can impact us all. For example, the fabric of a company’s creative culture can become irreparably frayed thanks to management changes, acquisition, or it can lack sustainability.

And that person might be you.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2><strong>You’re not alone</strong></h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The first thing to understand is that you’re not the only person to ever encounter problems. Things like this happen all the time at work, but there are simple steps you can take and habits you can form to ease the situation and even dig yourself (and your team) out of the hole. I’ll share some techniques that have helped me, and maybe they can work for you, too.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>So let me tell you a story about a hot mess I found myself in and how we turned it around. Names and details have been changed to protect the innocent.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2><strong>It always starts out great</strong></h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>An engineer called Jen was working with me on a new feature on our product that lets people create new meal recipes themselves. I was the Project Manager. We were working in six-week cycles.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>She had to rely on an API that was managed by Tom (who was in another team) to allow her to get and set the new recipe information on a central database. Before we kicked off, everyone knew the overall objective and everyone was all smiles and ready to go.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The system architecture was a legacy mishmash of different parts of local databases and API endpoints. And, no prizes for guessing what’s coming next, the API documentation was like Swiss cheese.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Two weeks into a six-week cycle, Jen hit Tom up with a list of her dream API calls that she wanted to use to build her feature. She asked him to confirm or deny they would work—or even if they existed at all—because once she started digging into the docs, it wasn’t clear to her if the API could support her plans.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>However, Tom had form for sticking his head in the sand and not responding to requests he didn’t like. Tom went to ground and didn’t respond. Tom’s manager, Frankie, was stretched too thin, and hence wasn’t paying attention to this until I was persistently asking about it, in increasingly fraught tones.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>In the meantime, Jen tried to do as much as she could. Every day she built a bit more based on her as-yet unapproved design, hoping it would all work out.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>With two weeks left to go, Tom eventually responded with a short answer—which boiled down to “The API doesn’t support these calls and I don’t see why I should build something that does. Why don’t you get the data from the other part of the system? And by the way, if I’m forced to do this, it will take at least six weeks.”</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>And as we know, six weeks into two weeks doesn’t go. Problem.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>How did we sort it?</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2><strong>Step 1 —&nbsp;Accept</strong></h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>When things go south, what do you do?</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Accept it.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Acknowledge whatever has happened to get you into this predicament. Take some notes about it to use in team appraisals and retrospectives. Take a long hard look at yourself, too.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Write a concise, impersonal summary of where you are. Try not to write it from your point of view. Imagine that you’re in your boss’ seat and just give them the facts as they are. Don’t dress things up to make them sound better. Don’t over-exaggerate the bad. Leave the emotions to the side.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>When you can see your situation clearly, you’ll make better decisions.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Now, pointing out the importance of taking some time to cool down and gather your thoughts seems obvious, but it’s based on the study of some of the most basic circuitry in our brains. Daniel Goleman’s 1995 book, <em>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</em>, introduces the concept of <em>emotional hijacking</em>; the idea that the part of our brain that deals with emotion—the limbic system—can biologically interrupt rational thinking when it is overstimulated. For instance, experiments show that <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.220.4820&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">the angrier men get, the poorer are the decisions they make</a> at the casino. And another study found that people in a negative emotional state are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4050437/\">more likely to deviate from logical norms</a>. To put it another way, if you’re pissed off, you can’t think straight.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>So when you are facing up to the facts, avoid the temptation to keep it off-the-record and only discuss it on the telephone or in person with your colleagues. There’s nothing to be scared of by writing it down. If it turns out that you’re wrong about something, you can always admit it and update your notes. If you don’t write it down, then there’s always scope for misunderstanding or misremembering in future.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>In our case, we summarized how we’d ended up at that juncture; the salient points were:</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:list --> \n<ul>\n <li>I hadn’t checked to ensure we had scoped it properly before committing to the work. It wasn’t a surprise that the API coverage was patchy, but I turned a blind eye because we were excited about the new feature.</li>\n <li>Jen should have looked for the hard problem first rather than do a couple of weeks’ worth of nice, easy work around the edges. That’s why we lost two weeks off the top.</li>\n <li>Tom and Frankie’s communication was poor. The reasons for that don’t form part of this discussion, but something wasn’t right in that team.</li>\n</ul> \n<!-- /wp:list --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>And that’s step one.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2><strong>Step 2 — Rejoice</strong></h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Few people like to make mistakes, but everyone <em>will</em> make one at some point in their life. Big ones, small ones, important ones, silly ones—we all do it. Don’t beat yourself up.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172758,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n <img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/people-who-make-mistakes.jpg\" alt=\"A Venn diagram with one circle showing the set of people who make mistakes.

He was good, but what I learned from him was that he spread that confidence around the team. If something was looking shaky, he insisted that if we could “smell smoke,” that he had to be the first to know so he could do something about it. If we made a mistake, there was no hiding from it. We learned how to face up to it and accept responsibility, but what was more important was learning from him the feeling we were the best people to fix it.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>There was no holding of grudges. What was done, was done. It was all about putting it behind us.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>He would tell us that we were only in this team because he had handpicked us because we were the best and he only wanted the best around him. Now, that might all have been manipulative nonsense, but it worked.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The only thing you can control is what you do now, so try not to fret about what happened in the past or get anxious about what might happen in the future.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>With that in mind, once you’ve written the summary of your sticky situation, set it aside!</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I’ll let you in on a secret. No one else is interested in how you got here. They might be asking you about it (probably because they are scared that someone will ask them), but they’re always going to be more interested in how you’re going to sort the problem out.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>So don’t waste time pointing fingers. Don’t prepare slide decks to throw someone under the bus. Tag that advice with a more general “don’t be an asshole” rule.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>If you’re getting consistent heat about the past, it’s because you’re not doing a good enough job filling the bandwidth with a solid, robust, and realistic plan for getting out of the mess.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>So focus on the future.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Sometimes it’s not easy to do that, but remember that none of this is permanent. Trust in the fact that if you pull it together, you’ll be in a much more powerful position to decide what to do next.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Maybe the team will hold together with a new culture or, if it is irretrievably broken, once you’re out of the hole then you can do something about it and switch teams or even switch jobs. But be the person who sorted it out, or at the very least, be part of the gang who sorted it out. That will be obvious to outsiders and makes for a much better interview question response.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>In our story with Jen, we had a short ten-minute call with everyone involved on the line. We read out the summary and asked if anyone had anything to add.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Tom spoke up and said that he never gets time to update the API documentation because he always has to work on emergencies. We added that to our summary:</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:list --> \n<ul>\n <li>Tom has an ongoing time management problem. He doesn’t have enough time allocated to maintain and improve the API documentation.</li>\n</ul> \n<!-- /wp:list --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>After that was added, everyone agreed that the summary was accurate.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I explained that the worst thing that could now happen was that we had to report back to the wider business that we’d messed up and couldn’t hit our deadline.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>If we did that, we’d lose face. There would be real financial consequences. It would show up on our appraisals. It wouldn’t be good. It wouldn’t be the end of the world, but it wasn’t something that we wanted. Everyone probably knew all that already, but there’s a power in saying it out loud. Suddenly, it doesn’t seem so scary.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Jen spoke up to say that she was new here and really didn’t want to start out like this. There was some murmuring in general support. I wrapped up that part of the discussion.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I purposefully didn’t enter into a discussion about the solution yet. We had all come together to admit the circumstances we were in. We’d done that. It was enough for now.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:heading --> \n<h2><strong>Step 3 — Move on</strong></h2> \n<!-- /wp:heading --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Stepping back for a second, as the person who is going to lead the team out of the wilderness, you may want to start getting in everyone’s face. You’ll be tempted to rely on your unlimited reserves of personal charm or enthusiasm to vibe everyone up. Resist the urge! Don’t do it!</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Your job is to give people the space to let them do their best work.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>I learned this the hard way. I’m lucky enough that I can bounce back quickly, but when someone is under pressure, funnily enough, a super-positive person who wants to throw the curtains open and talk about what a wonderful day it is might not be the most motivational person to be around. I’ve unwittingly walked into some short-tempered conversations that way.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Don’t micromanage. In fact, scrap all of your management tricks. Your job is to listen to what people are telling you—even if they’re telling you things by not talking.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Reframe the current problem. Break it up into manageable chunks.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>The first task to add to your list of things to do is simply to “Decide what we’re going to do about [the thing].”</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>It’s likely that there’s a nasty old JIRA ticket that everyone has been avoiding or has been bounced back and forth between different team members. Set that aside. There’s too much emotional content invested in that ticket now.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Create a new task that’s entirely centered on making a decision. Now, break it down into subtasks for each member of the team, like “Submit a proposal for what to do next.” Put your own suggestions in the mix but do your best to dissociate yourself from them.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Once you start getting some suggestions back and can tick those tasks off the list, you start to generate positive momentum. Nurture that.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>If a plan emerges, champion it. Be wary of naysayers. Challenge them respectfully with “How do you think we should…?” questions. If they have a better idea, champion that instead; if they don’t respond at all, then gently suggest “Maybe we should go with this if no one else has a better idea.”</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Avoid words like “need,” “just,” “one,” or “small.” Basically, anything that imposes a view of other people’s work. It seems trivial, but try to see it from the other side.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Saying, “I just need you to change that one small thing” hits the morale-killing jackpot. It unthinkingly diminishes someone else’s efforts. An engineer or a designer could reasonably react by thinking “What do you know about how to do this?!” Your job is to help everyone drop their guard and feel safe enough to contribute.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Instead, try “We’re all looking at you here because you’re good at this and this is a nasty problem. Maybe you know a way to make this part work?”</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>More often than not, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200603144334.htm\">people want to help</a>.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>So I asked Jen, Tom, and Frankie to submit their proposals for a way through the mess.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>It wasn’t straightforward. Just because we’d all agreed how we got here didn’t just magically make all the problems disappear. Tom was still digging his heels in about not wanting to write more code, and kept pushing back on Jen.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>There was a certain amount of back and forth. Although, with some constant reminders that we should maybe focus on what will move us forward, we eventually settled on a plan.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>Like most compromises, it wasn’t pretty or simple. Jen was going to have to rely on using the local database for a certain amount of the lower-priority features. Tom was going to have to create some additional API functions and would end up with some unnecessary traffic that might create too much load on the API.</p> \n<!-- /wp:paragraph --> \n<!-- wp:paragraph --> \n<p>And even with the compromise, Tom wouldn’t be finished in time.

It’s vague and open ended, and it doesn’t provide any indication of what we’re looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a <strong>question</strong>, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Design critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design work continues <strong>iteration</strong> after iteration, from a high level to the finest details. Each level needs its own set of questions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And finally, as with any good research, we need to <strong>review</strong> what we got back, get to the core of its insights, and take action. <em>Question</em>, <em>iteration</em>, and <em>review</em>. Let’s look at each of those.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The question</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Being open to feedback is essential, but we need to be precise about what we’re looking for. Just saying “Any comment?”, “What do you think?”, or “I’d love to get your opinion” at the end of a presentation—whether it’s in person, over video, or through a written post—is likely to get a number of varied opinions or, even worse, get everyone to follow the direction of the first person who speaks up. And then... we get frustrated because vague questions like those can turn a high-level flows review into people instead commenting on the borders of buttons. Which might be a hearty topic, so it might be hard at that point to redirect the team to the subject that you had wanted to focus on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But how do we get into this situation? It’s a mix of factors. One is that we don’t usually consider <em>asking</em> as a part of the feedback process. Another is how natural it is to just leave the question implied, expecting the others to be on the same page. Another is that in nonprofessional discussions, there’s often no need to be that precise. In short, we tend to underestimate the importance of the questions, so we don’t work on improving them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The act of asking good questions guides and focuses the critique</strong>. It’s also a form of consent: it makes it clear that you’re open to comments and what kind of comments you’d like to get. It puts people in the right mental state, especially in situations when they weren’t expecting to give feedback.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There isn’t a single best way to ask for feedback. It just needs to be<strong> specific</strong>, and specificity can take many shapes. A model for design critique that I’ve found particularly useful in my coaching is the one of <strong>stage versus depth</strong>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7173027,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fig1.png?resize=1024,453\" alt=\"A chart showing Depth on one axis and Stage on another axis, with Depth decreasing as Stage increases\" class=\"wp-image-7173027\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“<strong>Stage</strong>” refers to each of the steps of the process—in our case, the design process. In progressing from user research to the final design, the kind of feedback evolves. But within a single step, one might still review whether some assumptions are correct and whether there’s been a proper translation of the amassed feedback into updated designs as the project has evolved. A starting point for potential questions could derive from the <a href=\"http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements_ch02.pdf\">layers of user experience</a>. What do you want to know: Project objectives? User needs? Functionality? Content? Interaction design? Information architecture? UI design? Navigation design? Visual design? Branding?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here’re a few example questions that are precise and to the point that refer to different layers:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Functionality: Is automating account creation desirable?</li><li>Interaction design: Take a look through the updated flow and let me know whether you see any steps or error states that I might’ve missed.</li><li>Information architecture: We have two competing bits of information on this page. Is the structure effective in communicating them both?</li><li>UI design: What are your thoughts on the error counter at the top of the page that makes sure that you see the next error, even if the error is out of the viewport?&#160;</li><li>Navigation design: From research, we identified these second-level navigation items, but once you’re on the page, the list feels too long and hard to navigate. Are there any suggestions to address this?</li><li>Visual design: Are the sticky notifications in the bottom-right corner visible enough?</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other axis of specificity is about how <strong>deep</strong> you’d like to go on what’s being presented. For example, we might have introduced a new end-to-end flow, but there was a specific view that you found particularly challenging and you’d like a detailed review of that. This can be especially useful from one iteration to the next where it’s important to <strong>highlight the parts that have changed</strong>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are other things that we can consider when we want to achieve more specific—and more effective—questions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A simple trick is to remove <strong>generic qualifiers</strong> from your questions like “good,” “well,” “nice,” “bad,” “okay,” and “cool.” For example, asking, “When the block opens and the buttons appear, is this interaction good?” might look specific, but you can spot the “good” qualifier, and convert it to an even better question: “When the block opens and the buttons appear, is it clear what the next action is?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes <strong>we actually do want broad feedback</strong>. That’s rare, but it can happen. In that sense, you might still make it explicit that you’re looking for a wide range of opinions, whether at a high level or with details. Or maybe just say, “At first glance, what do you think?” so that it’s clear that what you’re asking is open ended but focused on someone’s impression after their first five seconds of looking at it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes the <strong>project is particularly expansive</strong>, and some areas may have already been explored in detail. In these situations, it might be useful to explicitly say that some parts are already locked in and aren’t open to feedback. It’s not something that I’d recommend in general, but I’ve found it useful to avoid falling again into rabbit holes of the sort that might lead to further refinement but aren’t what’s most important right now.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Asking specific questions can completely change the quality of the feedback that you receive. People with less refined critique skills will now be able to offer more actionable feedback, and even expert designers will welcome the clarity and efficiency that comes from focusing only on what’s needed. It can save a lot of time and frustration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The iteration</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Design iterations are probably the most visible part of the design work, and they provide a natural checkpoint for feedback. Yet a lot of design tools with inline commenting tend to show changes as a single fluid stream in the same file, and those types of design tools make conversations disappear once they’re resolved, update shared UI components automatically, and compel designs to always show the latest version—unless these would-be helpful features were to be manually turned off. The implied goal that these design tools seem to have is to arrive at just one final copy with all discussions closed, probably because they inherited patterns from how written documents are collaboratively edited. That’s probably not the best way to approach design critiques, but even if I don’t want to be too prescriptive here: that could work for some teams.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The asynchronous design-critique approach that I find most effective is to create explicit checkpoints for discussion. I’m going to use the term <strong>iteration post</strong> for this. It refers to a <em>write-up or presentation</em> of the design iteration followed by a <em>discussion thread</em> of some kind. Any platform that can accommodate this structure can use this. By the way, when I refer to a “write-up or presentation,” I’m including video recordings or other media too: as long as it’s asynchronous, it works.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using iteration posts has many advantages:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>It creates a <strong>rhythm</strong> in the design work so that the designer can review feedback from each iteration and prepare for the next.</li><li>It makes <strong>decisions visible</strong> for future review, and conversations are likewise always available.</li><li>It creates a <strong>record</strong> of how the design changed over time.</li><li>Depending on the tool, it might also make it easier to collect feedback and <strong>act</strong> on it.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These posts of course don’t mean that no other feedback approach should be used, just that iteration posts could be the primary rhythm for a remote design team to use. And other feedback approaches (such as live critique, pair designing, or inline comments) can build from there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don’t think there’s a standard format for iteration posts. But there are a few high-level elements that make sense to include as a baseline:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>The goal</li><li>The design</li><li>The list of changes</li><li>The questions</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each project is likely to have a <strong>goal</strong>, and hopefully it’s something that’s already been summarized in a single sentence somewhere else, such as the client brief, the product manager’s outline, or the project owner’s request. So this is something that I’d repeat in every iteration post—literally copy and pasting it. The idea is to provide context and to repeat what’s essential to make each iteration post <strong>complete</strong> so that there’s no need to find information spread across multiple posts. If I want to know about the latest design, the latest iteration post will have all that I need.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This copy-and-paste part introduces another relevant concept: <em>alignment comes from repetition</em>. So having posts that repeat information is actually very effective toward making sure that everyone is on the same page.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong>design</strong> is then the actual series of information-architecture outlines, diagrams, flows, maps, wireframes, screens, visuals, and any other kind of design work that’s been done. In short, it’s any design artifact. For the final stages of work, I prefer the term <em>blueprint</em> to emphasize that I’ll be showing full flows instead of individual screens to make it easier to understand the bigger picture.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It can also be useful to label the artifacts with clear <em>titles</em> because that can make it easier to refer to them. Write the post in a way that helps people understand the work. It’s not too different from organizing a good live presentation.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For an efficient discussion, you should also include a bullet list of the<strong> changes</strong> from the previous iteration to let people focus on what’s new, which can be especially useful for larger pieces of work where keeping track, iteration after iteration, could become a challenge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And finally, as noted earlier, it’s essential that you include a list of the <strong>questions</strong> to drive the design critique in the direction you want. Doing this as a numbered list can also help make it easier to refer to each question by its number.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not all iterations are the same. <strong>Earlier iterations don’t need to be as tightly focused</strong>—they can be more exploratory and experimental, maybe even breaking some of the design-language guidelines to see what’s possible. Then later, the iterations start settling on a solution and refining it until the design process reaches its end and the feature ships.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I want to highlight that even if these iteration posts are written and conceived as checkpoints, <strong>by no means do they need to be exhaustive</strong>. A post might be a draft—just a concept to get a conversation going—or it could be a cumulative list of each feature that was added over the course of each iteration until the full picture is done.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over time, I also started using <strong>specific labels for incremental iterations: i1, i2, i3</strong>, and so on. This might look like a minor labelling tip, but it can help in multiple ways:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Unique—It’s a clear unique marker. Within each project, one can easily say, “This was discussed in i4,” and everyone knows where they can go to review things.</li><li>Unassuming—It works like versions (such as v1, v2, and v3) but in contrast, versions create the impression of something that’s big, exhaustive, and complete. Iterations must be able to be exploratory, incomplete, partial.</li><li>Future proof—It resolves the “final” naming problem that you can run into with versions. No more files named “final final complete no-really-its-done.” Within each project, the largest number always represents the latest iteration.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To mark when a design is complete enough to be worked on, even if there might be some bits still in need of attention and in turn more iterations needed, the wording <strong>release candidate</strong> (RC) could be used to describe it: “with i8, we reached RC” or “i12 is an RC.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The review</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What usually happens during a design critique is an open <em>discussion</em>, with a back and forth between people that can be very productive. This approach is particularly effective during live, synchronous feedback. But when we work asynchronously, it’s more effective to use a different approach: <strong>we can shift to a user-research mindset</strong>. Written feedback from teammates, stakeholders, or others can be treated as if it were the result of user interviews and surveys, and we can analyze it accordingly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This shift has some major benefits that make asynchronous feedback particularly effective, especially around these friction points:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>It removes the <em>pressure to reply</em> to everyone.</li><li>It reduces the frustration from <em>swoop-by comments</em>.</li><li>It lessens our <em>personal stake</em>.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first friction point is feeling a <strong>pressure to reply</strong> to every single comment. Sometimes we write the iteration post, and we get replies from our team. It’s just a few of them, it’s easy, and it doesn’t feel like a problem. But other times, some solutions might require more in-depth discussions, and the amount of replies can quickly increase, which can create a tension between trying to be a good team player by replying to everyone and doing the next design iteration. This might be especially true if the person who’s replying is a stakeholder or someone directly involved in the project who we feel that we need to listen to. We need to accept that this pressure is absolutely normal, and it’s human nature to try to accommodate people who we care about. Sometimes replying to all comments can be effective, but if we treat a design critique more like user research, we realize that we don’t have to reply to every comment, and in asynchronous spaces, there are alternatives:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>One is to <strong>let the next iteration speak for itself</strong>. When the design evolves and we post a follow-up iteration, that’s the reply. You might tag all the people who were involved in the previous discussion, but even that’s a choice, not a requirement.&#160;</li><li>Another is to <strong>briefly reply</strong> to acknowledge each comment, such as “Understood. Thank you,” “Good points—I’ll review,” or “Thanks. I’ll include these in the next iteration.” In some cases, this could also be just a single top-level comment along the lines of “Thanks for all the feedback everyone—the next iteration is coming soon!”</li><li>Another is to provide a <strong>quick summary</strong> of the comments before moving on. Depending on your workflow, this can be particularly useful as it can provide a simplified checklist that you can then use for the next iteration.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second friction point is the <strong>swoop-by comment</strong>, which is the kind of feedback that comes from someone outside the project or team who might not be aware of the context, restrictions, decisions, or requirements—or of the previous iterations’ discussions. On their side, there’s something that one can hope that they might learn: they could start to acknowledge that they’re doing this and they could be more conscious in outlining where they’re coming from. Swoop-by comments often trigger the simple thought “We’ve already discussed this…”, and it can be frustrating to have to repeat the same reply over and over.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s begin by acknowledging again that there’s no need to reply to every comment. If, however, replying to a previously litigated point might be useful, a <strong>short reply with a link</strong> to the previous discussion for extra details is usually enough. Remember, <em>alignment comes from repetition</em>, so it’s okay to repeat things sometimes!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Swoop-by commenting can still be useful for two reasons: they might point out something that still isn’t clear, and they also have the potential to stand in for the point of view of a user who’s seeing the design for the first time. Sure, you’ll still be frustrated, but that might at least help in dealing with it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The third friction point is the <strong>personal stake</strong> we could have with the design, which could make us feel defensive if the <em>review</em> were to feel more like a <em>discussion</em>. Treating feedback as user research helps us create a healthy distance between the people giving us feedback and our ego (because yes, even if we don’t want to admit it, it’s there). And ultimately, treating everything in aggregated form allows us to better prioritize our work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Always remember that while you need to listen to stakeholders, project owners, and specific advice, you don’t have to accept every piece of feedback. You have to analyze it and make a decision that you can justify, but sometimes “no” is the right answer.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the designer leading the project, you’re in charge of that decision. Ultimately, everyone has their specialty, and as the designer, you’re the one who has the most knowledge and the most context to make the right decision. And <strong>by listening to the feedback that you’ve received, you’re making sure that it’s also the best and most balanced decision</strong>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Thanks to Brie Anne Demkiw and Mike Shelton for reviewing the first draft of this article.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":25,"bgimg":"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fig1.png?resize=1024,453","linkMd5":"9a33006599da2ba9370ac8573ecec1f7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn26@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-10-473_9f03f96112f5eae5.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":453,"sourceBytes":10940,"destBytes":10940,"author":"\n\t\t\t\tby \t\t\t\t\t","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fig1.png?resize=1024,453":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn26@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-10-473_9f03f96112f5eae5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914096},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\tImmersive Content Strategy\t\t\t\t","link":"https://alistapart.com/article/immersive-content-strategy/","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beyond the severe toll of the coronavirus pandemic, perhaps no other disruption has transformed user experiences quite like how the tethers to our formerly web-biased era of content have frayed.

Sales of immersive equipment like gaming and VR headsets <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/virtual-reality-pandemic-leads-to-rise-in-headset-sales-to-escape-lockdown-jhhn8wghn\">have skyrocketed during the pandemic</a>, and content strategists are increasingly attuned to the kaleidoscope of devices and interfaces users now interact with on a daily basis to acquire information.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Immersive user experiences are becoming commonplace, and, more importantly, <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/using-webxr-with-babylonjs/\">new tools and frameworks are emerging</a> for designers and developers looking to get their hands dirty. But that doesn’t mean our content is ready for prime time in settings unbound from the web like physical spaces, digital signage, or extended reality. Recasting your fixed web content in more immersive ways will enable more than just newfangled user experiences; it’ll prepare you for flexibility in an unpredictable future as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Agnostic content for immersive experiences</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These days, we interact with content through a slew of devices. It’s no longer the case that we navigate information on a single desktop computer screen. In my upcoming book <a href=\"https://preston.so/books/voice-content\"><em>Voice Content and Usability</em></a> (A Book Apart, coming June 2021), I draw a distinction between what I call <em>macrocontent</em>—the unwieldy long-form copy plastered across browser viewports—and <a href=\"https://anildash.com/2002/11/13/introducing-microcontent-client/\">Anil Dash’s definition of <em>microcontent</em></a>: the kind of brisk, contextless bursts of content that we find nowadays on Apple Watches, Samsung TVs, and Amazon Alexas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, content also has to be ready for contextless situations—not only in truncated form when we struggle to make out tiny text on our smartwatches or scroll through new television series on Roku but also in places it’s never ended up before. As the twenty-first century continues apace, our clients and our teams are beginning to come to terms with the fact that the way copy is consumed in just a few decades will bear no resemblance whatsoever to the prosaic browsers and even smartphones of today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What do we mean by immersive content?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Immersive experiences</em> are those that, <a href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/immersive-experiences-be-there-or-be-left-behind/\">according to Forrester</a>, blur “the boundaries between the human, digital, physical, and virtual realms” to facilitate smarter, more interactive user experiences. But what do we mean by immersive content? I define <em>immersive content </em>as content that plays in the sandbox of physical and virtual space—copy and media that are situationally or locationally aware rather than rooted in a static, unmoving computer screen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether a space is real or virtual, immersive content (or <em>spatialcontent</em>) will be a key way in which our customers and users deal with information in the coming years. Unlike voice content, which deals with time and sound, immersive content works with space and sight. Immersive content operates not along the axis of links and page changes but rather along <em>situational changes</em>, as the following figure illustrates.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":7172894,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/situational-change-diagram.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7172894\" /><figcaption><em>In this illustration, each rectangle represents different displays that appear based on situational changes such as movement in space or adjustment of perspective that result in the delivery of different content from the previous context.

This illustration thus demonstrates two forms of navigation: traditional link navigation and immersive situational navigation.</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Acknowledging the actual or imagined surroundings of where we are as human beings will have vast implications for content strategy, omnichannel marketing, usability testing, and accessibility. Before we dig deeper, let’s define a few clear categories of immersive content:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Digital signage content.</strong> Though it may seem a misnomer, digital signage is one of the most widespread examples of immersive content already in use today. For example, you may have seen it used to display a guide of stores at a mall or to aid wayfinding in an airport. While still largely bound to flat screens, it’s an example of <em>content in space</em>.</li><li><strong>Locational content.</strong> Locational content involves copy that is delivered to a user on a personal device based on their current location in the world or within an identified physical space. Most often mediated through Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacon technology or GPS location services, it’s an example of <em>content at a point in space.</em></li><li><strong>Augmented reality content.</strong> Unlike locational content, which doesn’t usually adjust itself seamlessly based on how users move in real-world space, AR content is now common in museums and other environments—typically as overlays that are superimposed over actual physical surroundings and adjust dynamically according to the user’s position and perspective. It’s <em>content projected into real-world space</em>.</li><li><strong>Virtual reality content.</strong> Like AR content, VR content is dependent on its imagined surroundings in terms of how it displays, but it’s part of a nonexistent space that is fully immersive, an example of <em>content projected into virtual space</em>.</li><li><strong>Navigable content.</strong> Long a gimmicky playground for designers and developers interested in pushing the envelope, navigable content is copy that users can move across and sift through as if it were a physical space itself: true <em>content as space</em>.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following illustration depicts these types of immersive content in their typical habitats.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172895,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/types-of-immersive-content.jpg?resize=1024,682\" alt=\"Digital signage content typically appears to everyone within a space.

Finally, navigable content is content as the space itself.\" class=\"wp-image-7172895\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Why auditing immersive content is important</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Alongside conversational and voice content, immersive content is a compelling example of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1Chq_E8uBM\">breaking content out of the limiting box</a> where it has long lived: the browser viewport, the computer screen, and the 8.5”x11” or broadsheet borders of print media. For centuries, our written copy has been affixed to the staid standards of whatever bookbinders, newspaper printing presses, and screen manufacturers decided. Today, however, for the first time, we’re surmounting those arbitrary barriers and situating content in contexts that challenge all the assumptions we’ve made since the era of Gutenberg—and, arguably, since clay tablets, papyrus manuscripts, and ancient scrolls.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, it’s never been more pressing to implement an <a href=\"https://preston.so/writing/building-usable-conversations-conversational-content-strategy/\"><em>omnichannel content strategy</em></a><em> </em>that centers the reality our customers increasingly live in: a world in which information can end up on any device, even if it has no tether to a clickable or scrollable setting. One of the most important elements of such a future-proof content strategy is an <em>omnichannel content audit</em> that evaluates your content from a variety of standpoints so you can manage and plan it effectively. These audits generally consist of several steps:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Write a questionnaire.</strong> Each content item needs to be examined from the perspective of each channel through a series of channel-relevant questions, like whether content is <em>legible</em> or <em>discoverable</em> on every conduit through which it travels.</li><li><strong>Settle the criteria. </strong>No questionnaire is complete for a content audit without <em>evaluation criteria</em> that measure how the content performs and <em>recommendation criteria</em> that determine necessary steps to improve its efficacy.</li><li><strong>Discuss with stakeholders.</strong> At the end of any content audit, it’s important to leaf through the results and any recommendations in a frank discussion with stakeholders, including content strategists, editors, designers, and others.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/usability-testing-for-voice-content/\">my previous article for <em>A List Apart</em></a>, I shared the work we did on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAy6AP-MZ4o\">a conversational content audit for Ask GeorgiaGov</a>, the first (but now decommissioned) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evHeWxeznUg\">Alexa skill for residents of the state of Georgia</a>. Such a content audit is just one facet of the multifaceted omnichannel content strategy along various dimensions you’ll need to consider. Nonetheless, there are a few things all content audits share in terms of foundational evaluation criteria across all content delivery channels:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Content legibility.</strong> Is the content readable or easily consumable from a variety of vantage points and perspectives? In the case of immersive content, this can include examining <em>verbosity tolerance</em> (how long content can be before users zone out, a big factor in digital signage) and <em>phantom references</em> (like links and calls to action that make sense on the web but not on a VR headset).</li><li><strong>Content discoverability.</strong> It’s no longer guaranteed in immersive content experiences that every piece of content can be accessed from other content items, and content loses almost all of its context when displayed unmoored from other content in digital signs or AR overlays. For discoverability’s sake, avoid relegating content to unreachable siloes, whether content is inaccessible due to physical conditions (like walls or other obstacles) or technical ones (like a finicky VR headset).</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like voice content, immersive content requires ample attention to the ways in which users approach and interact with content in physical and virtual spaces. And as I write in <em>Voice Content and Usability</em>, it’s also the case that <em>cross-channel interactions</em> can influence how we work with copy and media. After all, how often do subway and rail commuters glance up while scrolling through service advisories on their smartphones to consult a potentially more up-to-date alert on a digital sign?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Digital signage content: Content in space</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Signage has long been a fixture of how we find our way through physical spaces, ever since the earliest roads crisscrossed civilizations. Today, digital signs are becoming ubiquitous across shopping centers, university campuses, and especially transit systems, with the New York City subway recently introducing countdown clocks that display service advisories on a ticker along the bottom of the screen, just below train arrival times.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Digital signs can deliver critical content at important times, such as during emergencies, without the limitations imposed by the static nature of analog signs. News tickers on digital signs, for instance, can stretch for however long they need to, though succinctness is still highly prized. But digital signage’s rich potential to deliver immersive content also presents challenges when it comes to content modeling and governance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Are news items delivered to digital signs simply teaser or summary versions of full articles? Without a fully functional and configurable digital sign in your office, how will you preview them in context before they go live? To solve this problem for the New York City subway, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) <a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/resources/case-studies/metropolitan-transportation-authority\">manages all digital signage content across all signs</a> within a central Drupal content management system (CMS), which synthesizes data such as train arrival times from real-time feeds and transit messages administered in the CMS for arbitrary delivery to any platform across the network.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How to present content items in digital signs also poses problems. As the following figure illustrates, do you overtake the entire screen at the risk of obscuring other information, do you leave it in a ticker that may be ignored, or do you use both depending on the priority or urgency of the content you’re presenting?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":7172896,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/digital-signage-info-priority.png\" alt=\"On the left are examples of digital signage where informational messages obscure important data. On the right are examples of digital signage where informational messages are constricted to a small scrolling ticker at the bottom of the screen.\" class=\"wp-image-7172896\" /></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While some digital signs have the benefit of touch screens and occupying entire digital kiosks, many are tasked with providing key information in as little space as possible, where users don’t have the luxury of manipulating the interface to customize the content they wish to view. The New York City subway makes a deliberate choice to allow urgent alerts to spill across the entire screen, which limits the sign’s usefulness for those who simply need to know when the next train is arriving in the interest of more important information that is relevant to all passengers—and those who need captions for loudspeaker announcements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Auditing for digital signage content</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because digital signs value brevity and efficiency, digital signage content often isn’t the main focus of what’s displayed. Digital signs on the São Paulo metro, for instance, juggle service alerts, breaking news, and health advisories. For this reason, auditing digital signage content for legibility and discoverability is key to ensuring users can interact with it gracefully, regardless of how often it appears, how highly prioritized it is, or what it covers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to legibility, ask yourself these questions and consider the digital sign content you’re authoring based on these concerns:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Font size and typography.</strong> Many digital signs use sans-serif typefaces, which are easier to read from a distance, and many also employ uppercase for all text, especially in tickers. Consider which typefaces advance rather than obscure legibility, even when the digital sign content overtakes the entire screen.</li><li><strong>Angles and perspective.</strong> Is your digital sign content readily readable from various angles and various vantage points? Does the reflectivity of the screen impact your content’s legibility when standing just below the sign? How does your content look when it’s displayed to a user craning their neck and peering at it askew?</li><li><strong>Color contrast and lighting.</strong> Digital signs are no longer just fixtures of subterranean worlds; they’re above-ground and in well-lit spaces too. Color contrast and lighting strongly influence how legible your digital sign content can be.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As for discoverability, digital signs present challenges of both physical discoverability (can the sign itself be easily found and consulted?) and content discoverability (how long does a reader have to stare at the sign for the content they need to show up?):</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Physical discoverability. </strong>Are signs placed in prominent locations where users will come across them? The MTA was criticized for <a href=\"https://www.amny.com/transit/subway-countdown-clocks-at-some-stations-are-difficult-to-see-riders-say-1-14115447/\">the poor placement of many of its digital countdown clocks</a> in the New York City subway, something that can block a user from ever accessing content they need.</li><li><strong>Content discoverability. </strong>Because digital signs can only display so much content at once, even if there’s a large amount of copy to deliver eventually, users of digital signs may need to wait too long for their desired content to appear, or the content they seek may be too deprioritized for it to show up while they’re looking at the sign.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Both legibility and discoverability of digital sign content require thorough approaches when authoring, designing, and implementing content for digital signs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Usability and accessibility in digital signage content</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to audits, in any physical environment, immersive content on digital signs requires a careful and bespoke approach to consider not only how content will be consumed on the sign itself but also all the ways in which users move around and refer to digital signage as they consult it for information. After all, our content is no longer couched in a web page or recited by a screen reader, both objects we can control ourselves; instead, it’s flashed and displayed on flat screens and kiosks in physical spaces.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consider how the digital sign and the content it presents appear to people who use mobility aids such as wheelchairs or walkers. Is the surrounding physical environment accessible enough so that wheelchair users can easily read and discover the content they seek on a digital sign, which may be positioned too high for a seated reader? By the same token, can colorblind and dyslexic people read the chosen typeface in the color scheme it’s rendered in? Is there an aural equivalent of the content for Blind people navigating your digital signage, in close proximity to the sign itself, serving as synchronized captions?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Locational content: Content at a point in space</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unlike digital signage content, which is copy or media displayed in a space, <em>locational</em> (or <em>geolocational</em>) <em>content</em> is copy or media delivered to a device—usually a phone or watch—based on a point in space (if precise location is acquired through GPS location services) or a swath of space (typically driven by Bluetooth Low Energy beacons that have certain ranges). For smartphone and smartwatch users, GPS location services can often pinpoint a relatively accurate sense of where a person is, while Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons can triangulate their position based on devices that have Bluetooth enabled.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":7172897,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/locational-content.png\" alt=\"Examples of locational content might include links to more detailed information online, coupons, and sales relevant to merchandise or objects near the person viewing it.\" class=\"wp-image-7172897\" /></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Though BLE beacons remain a fairly finicky and untested realm of spatial technology, they’ve quickly gained traction in large shopping centers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2MuPdt5anI\">public spaces such as airports</a> where users agree to receive content relevant to their current location, most often in the form of push notifications that whisk users away into a separate view with more comprehensive information. But because these tiny chunks of copy are often tightly contained and contextless, teams designing for locational content need to focus on how users interact with their devices as they move through physical spaces.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Auditing for locational content</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately, because locational content is often delivered to the same visual devices that we use on a regular basis—smartphones, smartwatches, and tablets—auditing for content legibility can embrace many of the same principles we employ to evaluate other content. For discoverability, some of the most important considerations include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Locational discoverability.</strong> BLE beacons are notorious for their imprecision, though they continue to improve in quality. GPS location, too, can be an inaccurate measure of where someone is at any given time. The last thing you want your customers to experience is an incorrect triangulation of where they are leading to embarrassing mistakes and bewilderment when unexpected content travels down the wire.</li><li><strong>Proximity.</strong> Because of the relative lack of precision when it comes to BLE beacons and GPS location services, placing content items too close together in a coordinate map may trigger too many notifications or resource deliveries to a user, thus overwhelming them, or a certain content item may inadvertently supersede another because they’re spaced too closely together.</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As push notifications and location sharing become more common, locational content is rapidly becoming an important way to funnel users toward somewhat longer-form content that might otherwise go unnoticed when a customer is in a brick-and-mortar store.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Usability and accessibility in locational content</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because locational content requires users to move around physical spaces and trigger triangulation, consider how different types of users will move and also whether unforeseen issues can arise. For example, researchers in Japan found that users who walk while staring at their phones are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/science/distracted-walking-phone.html\">highly disruptive to the flow and movement of those around them</a>. Is your locational content possibly creating a situation where users bump into others, or worse, get into accidents? For instance, writing copy that’s quick and to the point or preventing notifications from being prematurely dismissed could allow users to ignore their devices until they have time to safely glance at them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Limited mobility and cognitive disabilities can place many disabled users of locational content at a deep disadvantage. While gamification may encourage users to seek as many items of locational content as possible in a given span of time for promotional purposes, consider whether it excludes wheelchair users or people who encounter obstacles when switching between contexts rapidly. There are good use cases for locational content, but what’s compelling for some users might be confounding for others.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>AR and VR content: Content projected into space</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Augmented reality, once the stuff of science fiction holograms and futuristic cityscapes, is becoming more available to the masses thanks to wearable AR devices, high-performing smartphones and tablets, and innovation in machine vision capabilities, though the utopian future of true “holographic” content remains as yet unrealized. Meanwhile, virtual reality has seen incredible growth over the pandemic as homebound users—by interacting with copy and media in fictional worlds—increasingly seek escapist ways to access content normally spread across flat screens.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While AR and VR content is still in its infancy, the vast majority is currently couched in <em>overlays</em> that are superimposed over real-world environments or objects and can be opaque (<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Augmented_reality_at_Museu_de_Matar%C3%B3_linking_to_Catalan_Wikipedia_%2818%29.JPG\">occupying some of a device’s field of vision</a>) or semi-transparent (creating an eerie, shimmery film on which text or media is displayed). Thanks to advancements in machine vision, these content overlays can track the motion of perceived objects in the physical or virtual world, bamboozling us into thinking these overlays are traveling in our fields of vision just like the things we see around us do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Formerly restricted to realms like museums, expensive video games, and gimmicky prototypes, AR and VR content is now becoming much more popular among companies that are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/02/06/augmented-reality-in-business-how-ar-may-change-the-way-we-work/\">interested in more immersive experiences</a> capable of <a href=\"https://www.information-age.com/augmented-reality-revolutionising-way-people-shop-123469739/\">delivering content alongside objects</a> in real-life brick-and-mortar environments, as well as virtual or imagined landscapes, like fully immersive brand experiences that transport customers to a pop-up store in their living room.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To demonstrate this, my former team at Acquia Labs built an experimental proof of concept that examines <a href=\"https://dri.es/virtual-reality-on-campus-with-drupal\">how VR content can be administered within a CMS</a> and a pilot project for grocery stores that explores what can happen when <a href=\"https://dri.es/shopping-with-augmented-reality\">product information is displayed as AR content</a> next to consumer goods in supermarket aisles.

The potential risks for AR and VR content are in many regards a fusion of the problems found in both digital signage and locational content, encompassing both physical placement and visual perspective, especially when it comes to legibility:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Content visibility.</strong> Is the AR or VR overlay too transparent to comfortably read the copy or view the image contained therein, or is it so opaque that it obscures its surroundings? AR and VR content must coexist gracefully with its exterior, and the two must enhance rather than obfuscate each other. Does the way your content is delivered compromise a user’s feeling of immersion in the environment behind it?</li><li><strong>Content perspective.</strong> Unless you’re limited to a smartphone or similar handheld device, many AR and VR overlays, especially in immersive headsets, don’t display content or media as an immobile rectangular box, as it defeats the purpose of the illusion and can be jarring to users as they adjust their field of vision, breaking them out of the fantasy you’re hoping to create. For this reason, your AR or VR experience must not only dictate how environments and objects are angled and lit but also how the content associated with them is perceived. Is your content readable from various angles and points in the AR view or VR world?</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to discoverability of your AR and VR content, issues like accuracy in machine vision and triangulation of your user’s location and orientation become much more important:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Machine vision.</strong> Most relevantly for AR content, if your copy or media is predicated on machine vision that perceives an object by identifying it according to certain characteristics, how accurate is that prediction? Does some content go undiscovered because certain objects go undetected in your AR-enabled device?</li><li><strong>Location accuracy.</strong> If your content relies on the user’s current location and orientation in relation to some point in space, as is common in both AR and VR content use cases, how accurately do devices dictate correct delivery at just the right time and place? Are the ranges within which content is accessible too limited, leading to flashes of content as you take a step to the left or right? Are there locations that simply can’t be reached, leading to forever-siloed copy or media?</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Due to the intersection of technical considerations and design concerns, AR and VR content, like voice content and indeed other forms of immersive content, requires a concerted effort across multiple teams to ensure resources are delivered not just legibly but also discoverably.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Usability and accessibility in AR and VR content</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Out of all the forms of immersive content we’ve covered so far, AR and VR content is possibly the medium that demands the most assiduously crafted solutions in accessibility testing and usability testing. Because AR and VR content, especially in headsets or wearable devices, requires motion through real or imagined space, its impact on accessibility cannot be overstated. Adding a third dimension—and arguably, a fourth: time—to our perception of content requires attention not only to how content is accessed but also all the other elements that comprise a fully immersive visual experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>VR headsets commonly induce <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/feel-motion-sickness-virtual-reality/story?id=65153805\"><em>virtual reality motion sickness</em></a> in many individuals. Poorly implemented transitions between states occurring in quick succession where content is visible and then invisible, and then visible again, can lead to epileptic seizures if not built with the utmost care.

Increasingly, we’re also toying with ideas that seemed harebrained even a few decades ago, like <em>navigable content</em>—copy and media that can be traversed as if the content <em>itself</em> were a navigable space. Imagine zooming in and out of tracts of text and stepping across glyphs like hopping between islands in a Super Mario game. Ambitious designers and developers are exploring this emerging concept of navigable content in exciting ways, both in and out of AR and VR. In many ways, truly navigable content is the endgame of how virtual reality presents information.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Imagining an encyclopedia that we can browse like the classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR0vRuZkxdw\">1990s opening sequence of the BBC’s <em>Eyewitness</em> television episodes</a> is no longer as far-fetched as we think. Consider, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/\">Robby Leonardi’s interactive résumé</a>, which invites you to play a character as you learn about his career, or <a href=\"https://bruno-simon.com/\">Bruno Simon’s ambitious portfolio</a>, where you drive an animated truck around his website. For navigable content, the risks and rewards for user experience and accessibility remain largely unexplored, just like the hazy fringes of the infinite maps VR worlds make possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The story of immersive content is in its early stages. As newly emerging channels for content see greater adoption, requiring us to relay resources like text and media to never-before-seen destinations like digital signage, location-enabled devices, and AR and VR overlays, the demands on our content strategy and design approaches will become both fascinating and frustrating. As seemingly fantastical new interfaces continue to emerge over the horizon, we’ll need an omnichannel content strategy to guide our own journeys as creatives and to orient the voyages of our users into the immersive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Content audits and effective content strategies aren’t just the domain of staid websites and boxy mobile or tablet interfaces—or even <a href=\"https://preston.so/books/voice-content\">aurally rooted voice interfaces</a>. They’re a key component of our increasingly digitized spaces, too, cornerstones of immersive experiences that beckon us to consume content where we are at any moment, unmoored from a workstation or a handheld. Because it lacks long-standing motifs of the web like context and clickable links, immersive content invites us to revisit our content with a fresh perspective. How will immersive content reinvent how we deliver information like the web did only a few decades ago, like voice has done in the past ten years?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Only the test of time, and the allure of immersion, will tell.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":25,"bgimg":"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/situational-change-diagram.png","linkMd5":"ea2f0181aff93b38191de5e1801d2992","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn48@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-08-415_e3ffa9fdeb04f460.webp","destWidth":623,"destHeight":383,"sourceBytes":10947,"destBytes":13588,"author":"\n\t\t\t\tby \t\t\t\t\t","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/situational-change-diagram.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn48@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-08-415_e3ffa9fdeb04f460.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/types-of-immersive-content.jpg?resize=1024,682":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-169_e0e8a1049d184c98.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/digital-signage-info-priority.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn60@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-195_98d776cd172986fc.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/locational-content.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn31@2020_1/2021/07/13/17-22-23-172_fa7e9e894a80a854.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ar-cms-example.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn73@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-27-182_366cb0f9c5002bae.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914082},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\tBeware the Cut ‘n’ Paste Persona\t\t\t\t","link":"https://alistapart.com/article/beware-the-cut-n-paste-persona/","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/\">This Person Does Not Exist</a> is a website that generates human faces with a machine learning algorithm. It takes real portraits and recombines them into fake human faces. We recently scrolled past a LinkedIn post stating that this website could be useful “if you are developing a persona and looking for a photo.”&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We agree: the computer-generated faces could be a great match for personas—but not for the reason you might think. Ironically, the website highlights the core issue of this very common design method: <em>the person(a) does not exist</em>. Like the pictures, personas are artificially made. Information is taken out of natural context and recombined into an isolated snapshot that’s detached from reality.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But strangely enough, designers use personas to inspire their design for the real world.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Personas: A step back</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most designers have created, used, or come across personas at least once in their career. In their article “<a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/personas-why-and-how-you-should-use-them\">Personas - A Simple Introduction</a>,” the Interaction Design Foundation defines personas as “fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand.” In their most complete expression, personas typically consist of a name, profile picture, quotes, demographics, goals, needs, behavior in relation to a certain service/product, emotions, and motivations (for example, see Creative Companion’s <a href=\"https://creativecompanion.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/the-persona-core-poster/\">Persona Core Poster</a>). The purpose of personas, as <a href=\"https://medium.designit.com/mindset-over-matter-a-new-design-trick-for-your-toolbox-part-one-91bc5f82360f\">stated by</a> design agency Designit, is “to make the research relatable, [and] easy to communicate, digest, reference, and apply to product and service development.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The decontextualization of personas</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Personas are popular because they make “dry” research data more relatable, more human. However, this method constrains the researcher’s data analysis in such a way that the investigated users are removed from their unique contexts. As a result, personas don’t portray key factors that make you understand their decision-making process or allow you to relate to users’ thoughts and behavior; they lack <em>stories</em>. You understand <em>what</em> the persona did, but you don’t have the background to understand <em>why</em>. You end up with representations of users that are actually <em>less</em> human.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This “decontextualization” we see in personas happens in four ways, which we’ll explain below.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Personas assume people are static&#160;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although many companies still try to box in their employees and customers with outdated personality tests (referring to you, Myers-Briggs), here’s a painfully obvious truth: people are not a fixed set of features. You act, think, and feel differently according to the situations you experience. You appear different to different people; you might act friendly to some, rough to others. And you change your mind all the time about decisions you’ve taken.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person%E2%80%93situation_debate#Current_directions\">Modern psychologists agree</a> that while people generally behave according to certain patterns, it’s actually a combination of background and environment that determines how people act and take decisions. The context—the environment, the influence of other people, your mood, the entire history that led up to a situation—determines the kind of person you are in each specific moment.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In their attempt to simplify reality, personas do not take this variability into account; they present a user as a fixed set of features. Like personality tests, personas snatch people away from real life. Even worse, people are reduced to a label and categorized as “that kind of person” with no means to exercise their innate flexibility. This practice reinforces stereotypes, lowers diversity, and doesn’t reflect reality.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Personas focus on individuals, not the environment</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the real world, you’re designing for a context, not for an individual. Each person lives in a family, a community, an ecosystem, where there are environmental, political, and social factors you need to consider. A design is never meant for a single user. Rather, you design for one or more particular contexts in which many people might use that product. Personas, however, show the user <em>alone</em> rather than describe how the user relates to the environment.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would you always make the same decision over and over again? Maybe you’re a committed vegan but still decide to buy some meat when your relatives are coming over. As they depend on different situations and variables, your decisions—and behavior, opinions, and statements—are not absolute but highly contextual. The persona that “represents” you wouldn’t take into account this dependency, because it doesn’t specify the premises of your decisions. It doesn’t provide a justification of why you act the way you do. Personas enact the well-known bias called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error\"><em>fundamental attribution error</em></a>: explaining others’ behavior too much by their personality and too little by the situation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As mentioned by the Interaction Design Foundation, personas are usually placed in a scenario that’s a “specific context with a problem they want to or have to solve”—does that mean context actually <em>is</em> considered? Unfortunately, what often happens is that you take a fictional character and based on that fiction determine how this character might deal with a certain situation. This is made worse by the fact that you haven’t even fully investigated and understood the <em>current</em> context of the people your persona seeks to represent; so how could you possibly understand how they would act in <em>new</em> situations?&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Personas are meaningless averages</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As mentioned in Shlomo Goltz’s <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/\">introductory article</a> on <em>Smashing Magazine</em>, “a persona is depicted as a specific person but is not a real individual; rather, it is synthesized from observations of many people.” A well-known critique to this aspect of personas is that <em>the average person does not exist</em>, as per the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24186666-the-end-of-average\">famous example</a> of the USA Air Force designing planes based on the average of 140 of their pilots’ physical dimensions and not a single pilot actually fitting within that average seat.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The same limitation applies to mental aspects of people. Have you ever heard a famous person say, “They took what I said out of context! They used my words, but I didn’t mean it like that.” The celebrity’s statement was reported literally, but the reporter failed to explain the context around the statement and didn’t describe the non-verbal expressions. As a result, the intended meaning was lost. You do the same when you create personas: you collect somebody’s statement (or goal, or need, or emotion), of which the meaning can only be understood if you provide its own specific context, yet report it as an isolated finding. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But personas go a step further, extracting a decontextualized finding and joining it with <em>another</em> decontextualized finding from somebody else. The resulting set of findings often does not make sense: it’s unclear, or even contrasting, because it lacks the underlying reasons on why and how that finding has arisen. It lacks <em>meaning</em>. And the persona doesn’t give you the full background of the person(s) to uncover this meaning: you would need to dive into the raw data for each single persona item to find it. What, then, is the usefulness of the persona?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172942,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cut-n-paste-persona-fig3.jpg?resize=1024,1024\" alt=\"Composite image of a man composed of many different photos\" class=\"wp-image-7172942\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The relatability of personas is deceiving</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To a certain extent, designers realize that a persona is a lifeless average. To overcome this, designers invent and add “relatable” details to personas to make them resemble real individuals. Nothing captures the absurdity of this better than a sentence by the Interaction Design Foundation: “Add a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character.” In other words, you add non-realism in an attempt to create more realism. You deliberately obscure the fact that “John Doe” is an abstract representation of research findings; but wouldn’t it be much more responsible to <em>emphasize</em> that John is only an abstraction? If something is artificial, let’s present it as such.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s the finishing touch of a persona’s decontextualization: after having assumed that people’s personalities are fixed, dismissed the importance of their environment, and hidden meaning by joining isolated, non-generalizable findings, designers <em>invent</em> new context to create (their own) meaning. In doing so, as with everything they create, they introduce a host of biases. As phrased by Designit, as designers we can “contextualize [the persona] based on our reality and experience. We create connections that are familiar to <em>us</em>.” This practice reinforces stereotypes, doesn’t reflect real-world diversity, and gets further away from people’s actual reality with every detail added.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To do good design research, we should report the reality “as-is” and make it relatable for our audience, so everyone can use their own empathy and develop their own interpretation and emotional response.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Dynamic Selves: The alternative to personas</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If we shouldn’t use personas, what should we do instead?&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Designit has proposed using <a href=\"https://medium.designit.com/mindset-over-matter-a-new-design-trick-for-your-toolbox-part-two-f56bd248319a\"><em>Mindsets</em></a> instead of personas. Each Mindset is a “spectrum of attitudes and emotional responses that different people have within the same context or life experience.” It challenges designers to not get fixated on a single user’s way of being. Unfortunately, while being a step in the right direction, this proposal doesn’t take into account that people are part of an environment that determines their personality, their behavior, and, yes, their mindset. Therefore, Mindsets are also not absolute but change in regard to the situation. The question remains, what determines a certain Mindset?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another alternative comes from Margaret P., author of the article “<a href=\"https://medium.com/microsoft-design/kill-your-personas-1c332d4908cc\">Kill Your Personas</a>,” who has argued for replacing personas with <em>persona spectrums</em> that consist of a <em>range</em> of user abilities. For example, a visual impairment could be permanent (blindness), temporary (recovery from eye surgery), or situational (screen glare). Persona spectrums are highly useful for more inclusive and <em>context-based</em> design, as they’re based on the understanding that the context is the pattern, not the personality. Their limitation, however, is that they have a very <em>functional</em> take on users that misses the relatability of a real person taken from within a spectrum.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In developing an alternative to personas, we aim to transform the standard design process to be context-based. Contexts are generalizable and have patterns that we can identify, just like we tried to do previously with people. So how do we identify these patterns? How do we ensure truly context-based design?&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Understand real individuals in multiple contexts</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nothing is more relatable and inspiring than reality. Therefore, we have to understand real individuals in their multi-faceted contexts, and use this understanding to fuel our design. We refer to this approach as <em>Dynamic Selves</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s take a look at what the approach looks like, based on an example of how one of us applied it in a recent project that researched habits of Italians around energy consumption. We drafted a design research plan aimed at investigating people’s attitudes toward energy consumption and sustainable behavior, with a focus on smart thermostats.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>1. Choose the right sample</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we argue against personas, we’re often challenged with <a href=\"https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/8647/why-not-use-a-real-person-as-a-persona\">quotes</a> such as “Where are you going to find a single person that encapsulates all the information from one of these advanced personas[?]” The answer is simple: <em>you don’t have to</em>. You don’t need to have information about many people for your insights to be deep and meaningful.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In qualitative research, validity does not derive from quantity but from accurate sampling. You select the people that best represent the “population” you’re designing for. If this sample is chosen well, and you have understood the sampled people in sufficient depth, you’re able to infer how the rest of the population thinks and behaves. There’s no need to study seven Susans and five Yuriys; one of each will do.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly, you don’t need to understand Susan in fifteen different contexts. Once you’ve seen her in a couple of diverse situations, you’ve understood the scheme of Susan’s response to different contexts. Not Susan as an atomic being but Susan in relation to the surrounding environment: how she might act, feel, and think in different situations.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Given that each person is representative of a part of the total population you’re researching, it becomes clear why each should be represented as an individual, as each already is an abstraction of a larger group of individuals in similar contexts. You don’t want abstractions of abstractions! These selected people need to be understood and shown in their full expression, remaining in their microcosmos—and if you want to identify patterns you can focus on identifying patterns in contexts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yet the question remains: how do you select a representative sample? First of all, you have to consider what’s the target audience of the product or service you are designing: it might be useful to look at the company’s goals and strategy, the current customer base, and/or a possible future target audience.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In our example project, we were designing an application for those who own a smart thermostat. In the future, everyone could have a smart thermostat in their house. Right now, though, only early adopters own one. To build a significant sample, we needed to understand the reason why these early adopters became such. We therefore recruited by asking people why they had a smart thermostat and how they got it. There were those who had <em>chosen</em> to buy it, those who had been <em>influenced</em> by others to buy it, and those who had <em>found</em> it in their house. So we selected representatives of these three situations, from different age groups and geographical locations, with an equal balance of tech savvy and non-tech savvy participants.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>2. Conduct your research</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After having chosen and recruited your sample, conduct your research using ethnographic methodologies. This will make your qualitative data rich with anecdotes and examples. In our example project, given COVID-19 restrictions, we converted an in-house ethnographic research effort into remote family interviews, conducted from home and accompanied by diary studies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To gain an in-depth understanding of attitudes and decision-making trade-offs, the research focus was not limited to the interviewee alone but deliberately included the whole family. Each interviewee would tell a story that would then become much more lively and precise with the corrections or additional details coming from wives, husbands, children, or sometimes even pets. We also focused on the relationships with other meaningful people (such as colleagues or distant family) and all the behaviors that resulted from those relationships. This wide research focus allowed us to shape a vivid mental image of dynamic situations with multiple actors.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s essential that the scope of the research remains broad enough to be able to include all possible actors. Therefore, it normally works best to define broad research areas with macro questions. Interviews are best set up in a semi-structured way, where follow-up questions will dive into topics mentioned spontaneously by the interviewee. This open-minded “plan to be surprised” will yield the most insightful findings. When we asked one of our participants how his family regulated the house temperature, he replied, “My wife has not installed the thermostat’s app—she uses WhatsApp instead. If she wants to turn on the heater and she is not home, she will text me. <em>I am her thermostat.”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>3. Analysis: Create the Dynamic Selves</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During the research analysis, you start representing each individual with <em>multiple</em> Dynamic Selves, each “Self” representing one of the contexts you have investigated. The core of each Dynamic Self is a quote, which comes supported by a photo and a few relevant demographics that illustrate the wider context. The research findings themselves will show which demographics are relevant to show. In our case, as our research focused on families and their lifestyle to understand their needs for thermal regulation, the important demographics were family type, number and nature of houses owned, economic status, and technological maturity. (We also included the individual’s name and age, but they’re optional—we included them to ease the stakeholders’ transition from personas and be able to connect multiple actions and contexts to the same person).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172943,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cut-n-paste-persona-fig1.png?resize=1024,554\" alt=\"Three cards, each showing a different lifestyle photo, a quote that correlates to that dynamic self's attitude about technology, and some basic demographic info\" class=\"wp-image-7172943\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To capture exact quotes, interviews need to be video-recorded and notes need to be taken <em>verbatim </em>as much as possible. This is essential to the truthfulness of the several Selves of each participant. In the case of real-life ethnographic research, photos of the context and anonymized actors are essential to build realistic Selves. Ideally, these photos should come directly from field research, but an evocative and representative image will work, too, as long as it’s realistic and depicts meaningful actions that you associate with your participants. For example, one of our interviewees told us about his mountain home where he used to spend every weekend with his family. Therefore, we portrayed him hiking with his little daughter.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the end of the research analysis, we displayed all of the Selves’ “cards” on a single canvas, categorized by activities. Each card displayed a situation, represented by a quote and a unique photo. All participants had multiple cards about themselves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172944,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cut-n-paste-persona-fig2.png?resize=1024,437\" alt=\"A collection of many cards representing many dynamic self personas\" class=\"wp-image-7172944\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>4. Identify design opportunities</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have collected all main quotes from the interview transcripts and diaries, and laid them all down as Self cards, you will see patterns emerge. These patterns will highlight the <em>opportunity areas</em> for new product creation, new functionalities, and new services—for new design.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In our example project, there was a particularly interesting insight around the concept of humidity. We realized that people don’t know what humidity is and why it is important to monitor it for health: an environment that’s too dry or too wet can cause respiratory problems or worsen existing ones. This highlighted a big opportunity for our client to educate users on this concept and become a health advisor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Benefits of Dynamic Selves</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you use the Dynamic Selves approach in your research, you start to notice unique social relations, peculiar situations real people face and the actions that follow, and that people are surrounded by changing environments. In our thermostat project, we have come to know one of the participants, Davide, as a boyfriend, dog-lover, and tech enthusiast.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Davide is an individual we might have once reduced to a persona called “tech enthusiast.” But we can have tech enthusiasts who have families or are single, who are rich or poor. Their motivations and priorities when deciding to purchase a new thermostat can be opposite according to these different frames.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have understood Davide in multiple situations, and for each situation have understood in sufficient depth the underlying reasons for his behavior, you’re able to generalize how he would act in another situation. You can use your understanding of him to infer what he would think and do in the contexts (or scenarios) that you design for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172945,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cut-n-paste-persona-fig4.png?resize=1024,576\" alt=\"A comparison. On one side, three people are fused into one to create a persona; in the second, the three people exist as separate dynamic selves.\" class=\"wp-image-7172945\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Dynamic Selves approach aims to dismiss the conflicted dual purpose of personas—to summarize and empathize at the same time—by separating your research summary from the people you’re seeking to empathize with. This is important because our empathy for people is <a href=\"https://www.epicpeople.org/commodified-empathy/\">affected by scale</a>: the bigger the group, the harder it is to feel empathy for others. We feel the strongest empathy for individuals we can personally relate to.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you take a <em>real</em> person as inspiration for your design, you no longer need to create an artificial character. No more inventing details to make the character more “realistic,” no more unnecessary additional bias. It’s simply how this person is in real life. In fact, in our experience, personas quickly become nothing more than a name in our <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/priority-guides-a-content-first-alternative-to-wireframes/\">priority guides</a> and prototype screens, as we all know that these characters don’t really exist.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another powerful benefit of the Dynamic Selves approach is that it raises the stakes of your work: if you mess up your design, someone real, a person you and the team know and have met, is going to feel the consequences. It might stop you from taking shortcuts and will remind you to conduct <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/daily-ethical-design/\">daily</a> checks on your designs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And finally, real people in their specific contexts are a better basis for anecdotal storytelling and therefore are more effective in persuasion. Documentation of real research is essential in achieving this result. It adds weight and urgency behind your design arguments: “When I met Alessandra, the conditions of her workplace struck me. Noise, bad ergonomics, lack of light, you name it. If we go for this functionality, I’m afraid we’re going to add complexity to her life.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Designit mentioned in their article on Mindsets that “design thinking tools offer a shortcut to deal with reality’s complexities, but this process of simplification can sometimes flatten out people’s lives into a few general characteristics.” Unfortunately, personas have been culprits in a crime of oversimplification. They are unsuited to represent the complex nature of our users’ decision-making processes and don’t account for the fact that humans are immersed in contexts.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Design needs simplification but not generalization. You have to look at the research elements that stand out: the sentences that captured your attention, the images that struck you, the sounds that linger. Portray those, use them to describe the person in their multiple contexts. Both insights and people come with a context; they cannot be cut from that context because it would remove meaning.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s high time for design to move away from fiction, and embrace reality—in its messy, surprising, and unquantifiable beauty—as our guide and inspiration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":25,"bgimg":"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cut-n-paste-persona-fig3.jpg?resize=1024,1024","linkMd5":"d84d6aa7657ad02ff91af7bbbeeb2b41","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-08-650_bc9eaee4c8ed7b8d.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":927014,"destBytes":927014,"author":"\n\t\t\t\tby , \t\t\t\t\t","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cut-n-paste-persona-fig3.jpg?resize=1024,1024":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/13/17-22-08-650_bc9eaee4c8ed7b8d.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cut-n-paste-persona-fig1.png?resize=1024,554":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn68@2020_2/2021/07/13/17-22-23-349_d3715ef8052e1b2b.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cut-n-paste-persona-fig2.png?resize=1024,437":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn76@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-152_b97a8b1e4854d1f7.webp","https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cut-n-paste-persona-fig4.png?resize=1024,576":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn71@2020_4/2021/07/13/17-22-23-141_e9890b55c1b250f1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626196914099},{"createdTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","updatedTime":"2021-07-14 01:21:54","title":"\n\t\t\t\t\tDesigning Inclusive Content Models\t\t\t\t","link":"https://alistapart.com/article/designing-inclusive-content-models/","description":"\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the 1920s, Robert Moses designed a system of parkways surrounding New York City. His designs, which included overpasses too low for public buses, have become an often-cited example of exclusionary design and are argued by biographer Robert A. Caro to represent a purposeful barrier between the city’s Black and Puerto Rican residents and nearby beaches.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-09/robert-moses-and-his-racist-parkway-explained\">Regardless of the details of Moses’s parkway project</a>, it’s a particularly memorable reminder of the political power of design and the ways that choices can exclude various groups based on abilities and resources. The growing interest in <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/building-the-woke-web/\">inclusive design</a> highlights questions of who can participate, and in relation to the web, this has often meant a focus on accessibility and user experience, as well as on questions related to team diversity and governance.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But principles of inclusive design should also play a role early in the design and development process, during content modeling. Modeling defines what content objects consist of and, by extension, who will be able to create them. So if web professionals are interested in inclusion, we need to go beyond asking who can access content and also think about how the design of content can install barriers that make it difficult for some people to participate in creation.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Currently, content models are primarily seen as mirrors that reflect inherent structures in the world. But if the world is biased or exclusionary, this means our content models will be too. Instead, we need to approach content modeling as an opportunity to filter out harmful structures and create systems in which more people can participate in making the web. Content models designed for inclusivity welcome a variety of voices and can ultimately increase products’ diversity and reach.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Content models as mirrors</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Content models are tools for describing the objects that will make up a project, their attributes, and the possible relations between them. A content model for an art museum, for example, would typically describe, among other things, artists (including attributes such as name, nationality, and perhaps styles or schools), and artists could then be associated with artworks, exhibitions, etc. (The content model would also likely include objects like blog posts, but in this article we’re interested in how we model and represent objects that are “out there” in the real world, rather than content objects like articles and quizzes that live natively on websites and in apps.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The common wisdom when designing content models is to go out and research the project’s subject domain by talking with subject matter experts and project stakeholders. As Mike Atherton and Carrie Hane describe the process in <em>Designing Connected Content</em>, talking with the people who know the most about a subject domain (like art in the museum example above) helps to reveal an “inherent” structure, and discovering or revealing that structure ensures that your content is complete and comprehensible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Additional research might go on to investigate how a project’s end users understand a domain, but Atherton and Hane describe this stage as mostly about terminology and level of detail. End users might use a different word than experts do or care less about the nuanced distinctions between Fauvism and neo-Expressionism, but ultimately, everybody is talking about the same thing. A good content model is just a mirror that reflects the structure you find.&#160;&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Cracks in the mirrors</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The mirror approach works well in many cases, but there are times when the structures that subject matter experts perceive as inherent are actually the products of biased systems that quietly exclude. Like machine learning algorithms trained on <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2020/12/14/u-texas-will-stop-using-controversial-algorithm-evaluate-phd\">past school admissions</a> or <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/05/all-the-ways-hiring-algorithms-can-introduce-bias\">hiring decisions</a>, existing structures tend to work for some people and harm others. Rather than recreating these structures, content modelers should consider ways to improve them.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A basic example is LinkedIn’s choice to require users to specify a company when creating a new work experience. Modeling experience in this way is obvious to HR managers, recruiters, and most people who participate in conventional career paths, but it assumes that valuable experience is only obtained through companies, and could potentially discourage people from entering other types of experiences that would allow them to represent alternative career paths and shape their own stories.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172736,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/fig1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7172736\"/><figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> LinkedIn’s current model for experience includes Company as a required attribute.\n</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These kinds of mismatches between required content attributes and people’s experiences either create explicit barriers (“I can’t participate because I don’t know how to fill in this field”) or increase the labor required to participate (“It’s not obvious what I should put here, so I’ll have to spend time thinking of a workaround”).&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Setting as optional fields that might not apply to everyone is one inclusive solution, as is increasing the available options for responses requiring a selection. However, while gender-inclusive choices provide <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/trans-inclusive-design/\">an inclusive way to handle form inputs</a>, it’s also worth considering when business objectives would be met just as well by providing open text inputs that allow users to describe themselves in their own terms.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead of LinkedIn’s highly prescribed content, for example, Twitter bios’ lack of structure lets people describe themselves in more inclusive ways. Some people use the space to list formal credentials, while others provide alternate forms of identification (e.g., mother, cyclist, or coffee enthusiast) or jokes. Because the content is unstructured, there are fewer expectations about its use, taking pressure off those who don’t have formal credentials and giving more flexibility to those who do.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Browsing the Twitter bios of designers, for example, reveals a range of identification strategies, from listing credentials and affiliations to providing broad descriptions.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172737,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/fig2.png?resize=1024,183\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7172737\"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Veerle Pieters’s Twitter bio uses credentials, affiliations, and personal interests.&#160;<br></figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172738,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/fig3.png?resize=1024,151\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7172738\"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Jason Santa Maria’s Twitter bio uses a broad description.&#160;<br></figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":7172739,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://alistapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/fig4.png?resize=1024,150\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7172739\"/><figcaption><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Erik Spiekermann’s Twitter bio uses a single word.<br></figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to considering where structured content might exclude, content modelers should also consider how length guidelines can implicitly create barriers for content creators. In the following section, we look at a project in which we chose to reduce the length of contributor bios as a way to ensure that our content model didn’t leave anyone out.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Live in America</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Live in America is a performing arts festival scheduled to take place in October 2021 in Bentonville, Arkansas. The goal of the project is to survey the diversity of live performance from across the United States, its territories, and Mexico, and bring together groups of artists that represent distinct local traditions. Groups of performers will come from Alabama, Las Vegas, Detroit, and the border city of El Paso<strong>–</strong>Juárez. Indigineous performers from Albuquerque are scheduled to put on a queer powwow. Performers from Puerto Rico will organize a cabaret.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An important part of the festival’s mission is that many of the performers involved aren’t integrated into the world of large art institutions, with their substantial fiscal resources and social connections. Indeed, the project’s purpose is to locate and showcase examples of live performance that fly under curators’ radars and that, as a result of their lack of exposure, reveal what makes different communities truly unique.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we began to think about content modeling for the festival’s website, these goals had two immediate consequences:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, the idea of exploring the subject domain of live performance doesn’t exactly work for this project because the experts we might have approached would have told us about a version of the performing arts world that festival organizers were specifically trying to avoid. Experts’ mental models of performers, for example, might include attributes like residencies, fellowships and grants, curricula vitae and awards, artist statements and long, detailed bios. All of these attributes might be perceived as inherent or natural within one, homogenous community—but outside that community they’re not only a sign of misalignment, they represent barriers to participation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Second, the purposeful diversity of festival participants meant that locating a shared mental model wasn’t the goal. Festival organizers want to preserve the diversity of the communities involved, not bring them all together or show how they’re the same. It’s important that people in Las Vegas think about performance differently than people in Alabama and that they structure their projects and working relationships in distinct ways.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Content modeling for Live in America involved defining what a community is, what a project is, and how these are related. But one of the most interesting challenges we faced was how to model a person—what attributes would stand in for the people that would make the event possible.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was important that we model participants in a way that preserved and highlighted diversity and also in a way that included everyone—that let everyone take part in their own way and that didn’t overburden some people or ask them to experience undue anxiety or perform extra work to make themselves fit within a model of performance that didn’t match their own.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Designing an inclusive content model for Live in America meant thinking hard about what a bio would look like. Some participants come from the institutionalized art world, where bios are long and detailed and often engage in intricate and esoteric forms of credentialing. Other participants create art but don’t have the same resources. Others are just people who were chosen to speak for and about their communities: writers, chefs, teachers, and musicians.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The point of the project is to highlight both performance that has not been recognized and the people who have not been recognized for making it. Asking for a written form that has historically been built around institutional recognition would only highlight the hierarchies that festival organizers want to leave behind.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first time we brought up the idea of limiting bios to five words, our immediate response was, “Can we get away with that?” Would some artists balk at not being allowed the space to list their awards? It’s a ridiculously simple idea, but it also gets at the heart of content modeling: what are the things and how do we describe them? What are the formats and limitations that we put on the content that would be submitted to us? What are we asking of the people who will write the content? How can we configure the rules so that everyone can participate?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Five-word bios place everyone on the same ground. They ask everyone to create something new but also manageable. They’re comparable. They set well-known artists next to small-town poets, and let them play together. They let in diverse languages, but keep out the historical structures that set people apart. They’re also fun:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Byron F. Aspaas of Albuquerque is “Diné. Táchii'nii nishłį́ Tódichii'nii bashishchiin.”</li><li>Danny R.W. Baskin of Northwest Arkansas is “Baroque AF but eating well.”</li><li>Brandi Dobney of New Orleans is “Small boobs, big dreams.”</li><li>Imani Mixon of Detroit is “best dresser, dream catcher, storyteller.”</li><li>Erika P. Rodríguez of Puerto Rico is “Anti-Colonialist Photographer. Caribeña. ♡ Ice Cream.”</li><li>David Dorado Romo of El Paso<strong>–</strong>Juárez is “Fonterizo historian wordsmith saxophonist glossolalian.”</li><li>Mikayla Whitmore of Las Vegas is “hold the mayo, thank you.”</li><li>Mary Zeno of Alabama is “a down home folk poet.”</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Modeling for inclusion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We tend to think of inclusive design in terms of removing barriers to access, but content modeling also has an important role to play in ensuring that the web is a place where there are fewer barriers to creating content, especially for people with diverse and underrepresented backgrounds. This might involve rethinking the use of structured content or asking how length guidelines might create burdens for some people. But regardless of the tactics, designing inclusive content models begins by acknowledging the political work that these models perform and asking whom they include or exclude from participation.&#160;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All modeling is, after all, the creation of a world. Modelers establish what things exist and how they relate to each other. They make some things impossible and others so difficult that they might as well be. They let some people in and keep others out. Like overpasses that prevent public buses from reaching the beach, exclusionary models can quietly shape the landscape of the web, exacerbating the existing lack of diversity and making it harder for those who are already underrepresented to gain entry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As discussions of inclusive design continue to gain momentum, content modeling should play a role precisely because of the world-building that is core to the process. If we’re building worlds, we should build worlds that let in as many people as possible. To do this, our discussions of content modeling need to include an expanded range of metaphors that go beyond just mirroring what we find in the world. We should also, when needed, filter out structures that are harmful or exclusionary. We should create spaces that ask the same of everyone and that use the generativity of everyone’s responses to create web products that emerge out of more diverse voices.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph
