This means you have until December 31, 2021 to spend FSA money earmarked for last year. The extension also applies for your 2021 FSA money - the credit will be available until the end of 2022. </p><p>We recommend checking your plan details to ensure you&#39;re making the most of your money.</p><p>If you still have FSA bucks to spend, consider <a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/TUJGR0lOSEJGSEhLR01CR0ZNRUVG?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffsastore.com%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpepperjam%26utm_medium%3Daffiliates%26utm_campaign%3D133628%26clickId%3D3368631638\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">FSAstore.com</a>. FSAstore.com has thousands of items that are guaranteed to be covered by your FSA. Below, we answer frequently asked questions about FSA dollars, and how you can avoid letting your money go to waste.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents-sticky\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents: Masthead Sticky</bi-shortcode><p> </p><h2><strong>What is FSA?</strong></h2><p>Many employers offer access to Flexible Spending Accounts, which let you put away pre-tax dollars for eligible healthcare products and services (think everything from surgery and medical bills to thermometers and first-aid kits). Storing money in an FSA account is a great deal, provided you spend it before the deadline.</p><h2>How does FSA work?</h2><p>FSA operates on a use-it-or-lose-it provision; you must spend the money in your FSA account by the end of the year or risk losing it for good. Typically, you&#39;d either have to spend it all by a deadline (either December 31 or March 15) or roll a portion of it over. </p><p>The COVID relief bill signed late last year changes things, though. </p><p>Now, you have an extra year to spend your FSA dollars, for both 2020 and 2021. Put plainly: the FSA money you accrued in 2020 will still be available to you until December 31, 2021; the money you accrue in 20201 will be available until December 31, 2022.</p><p>FSA Store estimates that <a href=\"https://fsastore.com/About/About-FSA-Store-PressReleases.aspx\">more than $400 million is forfeited every year</a> in FSA funds because employees either miss or forget their spending deadlines (based on estimates using data from the 2017 FSA and HSA Consumer Research conducted by VISA). It&#39;s your money and it&#39;s pre-tax - it doesn&#39;t make sense not to use it.</p><h2><strong>What can you buy with your FSA money?</strong></h2><p>You can use FSA dollars to pay for medical expenses that aren&#39;t covered by a health plan, like co-pays, deductibles, dental and vision care, or dependent daycare, though eligible expenses can vary based on the plan. But if it&#39;s nearing the end of the year and you haven&#39;t used your money to help meet your deductible or pay medical expenses, you have the option of spending it on supplies like over-the-counter medication.</p><p>The nitty-gritty details depend on the plan your employer has in place, but you can skip the burden of research by shopping the selection at the <a href=\"https://www.pjatr.com/t/TUJGR0lOSEJGSEhLR01CR0ZNRUVG?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffsastore.com%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpepperjam%26utm_medium%3Daffiliates%26utm_campaign%3D133628%26clickId%3D3368635414\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">FSA store</a>.

And after a year in which racial tension and political unrest gripped the nation and a pandemic disproportionately harmed Black and brown communities, the Chauvin murder trial is severely testing their stress levels. </p><p>Psychologists tell Insider that Black people might feel afraid to speak up in the workplace about what they&#39;re going through, for fear of retaliation. Against the backdrop of a murder trial that&#39;s seen as a referendum on racial justice, these highly charged emotions have important and far-reaching implications for managers, allies, and Black employees. </p><p>&#34;You already feel like a target and that the work environment is not a safe place,&#34; said Danielle Spearman-Camblard, a Connecticut-based psychologist and therapist who specializes in racial trauma.&#34;When a trial like this is affecting your emotional health and job performance, you feel like you can&#39;t go to your supervisor without risking a slap on the hand. You put up and shut up and go into survival mode.&#34;</p><h2>What Black professionals are feeling right now</h2><p>Watching or reading about the Chauvin murder trial, a veritable weekslong narrative of a traumatic event, is triggering for many Black people. In psychology, the effect is known as vicarious or secondary trauma, which is caused by exposure to survivors who have been traumatized themselves. This kind of trauma is associated with <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/what-is-burnout\">burnout</a>, emotional exhaustion, and lower levels of accomplishment, Farah Harris, a psychotherapist based in Illinois, told Insider. </p><p>&#34;There are layers of trauma Black Americans have to grapple with,&#34; Harris said.</p><p>The effects of intergenerational or historical trauma - trauma that a cultural or racial ethnic group experiences related to events or institutions that oppress that group, such as enslavement - compound the pain, she said.</p><p>Juggling the psychological weight of the trial with work obligations - catching up on coverage during a midmorning coffee break and viewing fragments of testimony between Zoom meetings - creates a sense of dissonance. Emotions are raw, and people feel fragile.</p><p>Briana Young, an MRI and CT technologist based in Georgia, said she can bear to watch the trial only in short clips at a time. Even then, she feels her blood pressure rise. </p><p>&#34;I&#39;m angry,&#34; she said. &#34;It&#39;s like watching a trainwreck. Derek Chauvin is a white supremacist who looked at George Floyd as less than human. It&#39;s infuriating.&#34; </p><p>Normally after her 40-minute drive to work, she spends a minute or two practicing deep breathing and meditation to help center herself and focus on the workday ahead. Now, during the Chauvin trial, she spends twice the time meditating. </p><p>&#34;I desensitize through meditation,&#34; she said. &#34;That&#39;s the only way I can continue to function without continuing to function in anger.&#34; </p><p>André Blackman, the founder and CEO of North Carolina-based Onboard Health, an executive recruiting firm focused on inclusivity in healthcare, echoed the sentiment. &#34;There are moments throughout the day where I look at the headlines to get a sense of how things are progressing,&#34; he said. &#34;But there&#39;s an emotional toll if I check in constantly.&#34; </p><p>He describes his psychic state as a burning, low-grade frustration mixed with feelings of emotional numbness. He worries that Chauvin will not be convicted, despite the haunting video of Floyd&#39;s death. An acquittal would repeat a history of past outcomes in which a Black man is killed by police on camera and officers suffer no legal consequences. </p><p>&#34;I feel like this is the moment: Society will have a conscience, and justice will be served,&#34; Blackman said. &#34;But I&#39;ve been let down time and time again</p><h2><strong>Don&#39;t put the burden on Black employees</strong></h2><p>Black employees are in need of support from their organizations, said Tina Opie, an associate professor in the management division at Babson College. &#34;Let&#39;s not put the burden on Black employees to be the arbiters of their own sanity in the workplace. Let&#39;s instead put the responsibility and burden on white leaders to demonstrate empathy for their workers and to put in place systems and processes that dismantle systemic racism.&#34;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Dr. Tina Opie  (@DrTinaOpie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1376572249029873665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 29, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p> </p><p>Managers need to open lines of communication with their employees and make clear that they care about their team members&#39; emotional and social well-being.

I need to either disconnect or pause regular work for a little bit.&#39;&#34; </p><p>Most importantly, Opie said, managers must not put Black employees in the position of having to serve as a resource to help others in the organization understand the trial as a teachable moment.  &#34;Don&#39;t request anything extra from them,&#34; she said. </p><p>Educate yourself on your own, Beverly Tatum, a nationally recognized scholar and author of multiple books on race in America, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-white-colleagues-can-be-allies-to-their-black-coworkers-2020-6\">told Insider</a>.

The President on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-to-announce-us-adults-eligible-covid-vaccine-april-19-2021-4\">moved up the timeline</a> for all American adults to be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine to April 19 from May 1. </p><p>The 10-year Treasury yield has held steady at 1.67% after climbing to the highest levels in over a year in March.</p><p>&#34;The fact that the bond yields barely changed last week despite a raft of strong economic numbers ... indicates that market has already gone a long way to pricing in the economic rebound,&#34; Kathy Jones, Charles Schwab chief fixed income strategist, said in a note. &#34;<u></u>Also, it is hard to see U.S. yields surge from here since they are so far above those in many other developed markets in both real and nominal terms.

flashing. But if you see the controller blinking, the Xbox One controller most likely has a pairing issue.</p><p>Here&#39;s how to troubleshoot issues with your Xbox One controller if it&#39;s blinking or flashing.  </p><h2>Make sure your Xbox One controller is paired and in range</h2><p>You might find that your Xbox One controller is blinking or flashing due to pairing issues. It may be paired to another console, be out of range of the console, or is attempting to be paired on a console that already has eight other paired controllers. </p><aside class=\"quick-tip headline-regular\"><p><strong>Quick tip:</strong> <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/controller/wireless-controller-solution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xbox says</a> the range for wireless controllers is 19 to 28 feet, but if your gaming setup is around walls, facing away from you, in a cabinet, or might experience interference from other nearby wireless devices, consider decreasing your range. </p></aside><p>If the controller doesn&#39;t seem to be reacting to your console at all, it may be connected to another Bluetooth device or console.

This is in our DNA, and we lived this every day growing up and working in our family businesses - farming for Tracy and cabinetry for Brian.&#34;</p><p>2. &#34;Great companies are not built in spreadsheets, and we create value through building enduring companies vs financial wizardry and loads of debt.&#34;</p><p>3. &#34;We stay away from macro predictions like foreign exchange or interest rates - our Magic 8 ball hasn&#39;t been helpful, and, despite years of searching, we have yet to find a crystal ball.&#34;</p><p>4. &#34;Based on our research and personal experience, we believe the combination of Purpose, People, and Performance drives results. This three-legged stool is rarer than a four-leaf clover - most companies only focus on one or two areas and few deliver on all three.&#34;</p><p>5. &#34;If setting out on a 100-mile road trip, then you&#39;d want more than 100 miles&#39; worth of gas (especially if you&#39;re traveling through western Kansas where gas stations are rarer than cows).&#34; - <em>describing how they apply a &#34;margin of safety&#34; to their annual plan.</em></p><p>6. &#34;The crucible of capitalism craves efficiency - customers always want better products faster and at lower prices - and the dust heap of history is littered with formerly iconic firms such as Polaroid and Blockbuster. COVID is another reminder that we can&#39;t predict the next crisis; however, we know dark clouds and stormy seas will appear again in the future.&#34;</p><p>7. &#34;While many investors look to run a three-year sprint, we are running a marathon and are comfortable leaving some gas in the tank (and giving up some short-term gains) to ensure we can finish mile 26 strong.&#34;</p><p>8. &#34;Moats and sources of competitive advantage evolve and erode over time. Newspapers used to have an enviable moat, but we all see how the water there has dried up.&#34;</p><p>9. &#34;The current low-rate, high-stimulus environment seems to have distorted incentives and market signals.&#34; - <em>Kanbrick and Humphrey warned that the long-term impacts of government aid for ailing businesses are unclear, and cautioned that low interest rates are boosting asset prices and &#34;numbing investors to potential risks.&#34;</em></p><p>10. &#34;Eventually each business&#39; value must be anchored in the cash it produces.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-former-deputy-tracy-britt-cool-first-annual-letter-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mkH6vLNwmBY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:58:37 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606dcb9070954f0019195a08?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5516019fc76a89490c534bbd31adc330","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn87@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-24-460_550727ad085de976.webp","destWidth":1103,"destHeight":827,"sourceBytes":44044,"destBytes":44044,"author":"tmohamed@businessinsider.com (Theron Mohamed)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606dcb6530004b0019b26663?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-28-019_93c6ee721411f4a1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-29-454_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn51@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-27-388_0526de60035a73e7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn67@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-29-776_aa8b06f15b835bca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-27-264_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkH6vLNwmBY:hIjYfeThzys:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn31@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-27-793_262669ce46720de4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mkH6vLNwmBY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn52@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-28-639_e0b0f7884fd78c65.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817067372},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","title":"Andrew Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani's son, is 'heavily considering' a run for New York governor","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-giuliani-is-heavily-considering-a-run-for-new-york-governor-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606dd88f30004b0019b266bd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Giuliani\" height=\"678\" width=\"1357\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Andrew Giuliani, a White House aide and son of President Donald Trump&#39;s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, attends a news conference with his father at the Republican National Committee headquarters on Capitol Hill in Washington, on November 19, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Andrew Giuliani, Rudy Giuliani&#39;s son, is &#34;heavily considering&#34;

I hardly used it, and it amassed a grand total of 50 followers. </p><p>When I returned to Twitter, nobody was engaging with me. I was speaking into the void.</p><p>Within 30 days, I grew my following to 2,500+, gaining 2.5 million impressions with just 30 minutes of usage per day. </p><p>Here is how you can do the same. </p><h2>Community focus</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/312492\">Building a community</a> is the best way to grow an active, engaged, real following on Twitter.</p><p>Followers are just a number at the end of the day. Would you rather have 10,000 followers, but still struggle to drive action, or 500 followers on the edge of their seats awaiting your content? </p><p>Lead your strategy with a community focus.</p><p>In other words: not just tweeting and expecting the <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/engagement\">engagement</a> to roll in. I flipped the script and started tweeting less, and engaging more. </p><p>I set a strict schedule to tweet two times per day of my best, most insightful work. Snippets from <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/online-content\">online content</a> I wrote, tips on how I grew my <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/business\">business</a>, lessons from being in the startup trenches. </p><p>You don&#39;t have to think of content ideas. Just be yourself and share your stories from real-life to business!</p><p>Once you have valuable content on your profile, start engaging in specific communities. </p><p>Do you want to tweet about startups? Don&#39;t follow startup companies, follow the employees of those companies. Then, look at who is replying, liking, and retweeting their content. </p><p>Engage with those people and build real relationships. </p><p>As you do this, those who you are engaging with will naturally click on your profile. When they see your valuable insights, they&#39;ll follow. </p><p>You&#39;ll quickly build a small community that supports your content as you support theirs. </p><h2>Utilize direct messages</h2><p>One of the most underrated aspects of Twitter is the DM functionality. </p><p>And no, it&#39;s nothing compared to <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/linkedin\">LinkedIn</a>. No spam, and definitely no sales pitches. </p><p>Twitter is about unique, interesting, <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/280701\">engaging content</a>. It&#39;s not about trying to make instant profits from a follower. </p><p>In direct messages, welcome new followers and ask them to talk about themselves. Learn about the projects they are working on and where you can help. </p><p>Doing so fosters a real bond and friendship. People engage with people who engage with them.</p><p>When growing a following, you have to understand that Tweeting is just a small portion of your strategy. </p><p>The biggest impacts for growing an engaged following happen in real conversations with people. </p><h2>Refine your content approach</h2><p>Content on Twitter has evolved dramatically from the early days of sharing your every random thought to insightful, detailed threads, one-liners that spark curiosity, and so much more. </p><p>The content you share on Twitter is a direct indicator to potential followers of how much <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/value\">value </a>you can deliver for them. </p><p>Growth via better content requires retweets. Retweets expand your reach infinitely, opening your ideas to new audiences and driving action on your profile. </p><p>The best ways to elicit more retweets and engagement are: </p><ul><li>Create detailed threads: be contrarian and hook people in with a hot-take thread on a popular subject</li><li>Tap into relevant news</li><li>Mention users with an existing following (but avoid those with millions of followers)</li><li>Share numbers and success stories</li><li>Describe failures and lessons learned</li></ul><p>For example, I wrote a thread curating some of the best threads I&#39;ve seen on Twitter. It received over one million impressions and 59,000+ engagements. </p><p>The most interesting content isn&#39;t copied, faked, or forced. It&#39;s from real experiences. Share yours and people will naturally gravitate. </p><p>Lastly, always remember: Twitter is about making friends and creating a like-minded community. </p><p>Be friendly, be supportive, and have fun with it. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/organically-grow-twitter-following-with-these-tips-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/lp0Y13YFlv4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:46:57 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/605399e6fe6a340019acf62d?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7a9bb6e2219f76ce8030ced937a937ac","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-37-47-918_b84a67b0e2227349.webp","destWidth":2064,"destHeight":1548,"sourceBytes":109648,"destBytes":109648,"author":"insider@insider.com (Jeremy Moser)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/605399e6fe6a340019acf62d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn15@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-37-47-918_b84a67b0e2227349.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-29-454_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-25-078_df99b0716edfcff1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn24@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-29-437_7e6a29ee0242542f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-27-264_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=lp0Y13YFlv4:xC7RNvgUGK8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn80@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-23-591_f172e6c0790fa313.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/lp0Y13YFlv4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn71@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-27-041_4b98314f4c9fdfa1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817067352},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","title":"The CDC director said the coronavirus variant first found in the UK is now the dominant strain in the US","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-director-says-uk-covid-19-variant-dominant-strain-us-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6039e1e987d37600190d03e4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Rochelle Walensky\" height=\"2010\" width=\"4021\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President-elect Joe Biden has nominated Dr. Rochelle Walensky to head up the CDC.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The coronavirus variant found in the UK <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-variant-uk-higher-mortality-studies-2021-3\">was discovered outside London last year</a>.</li>\n<li>The CDC director said it&#39;s now the dominant strain in the US. </li>\n<li>Research has suggested that it&#39;s likely associated with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-variant-uk-higher-mortality-studies-2021-3\">higher mortality than other variants.</a></li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>A variant of the coronavirus first detected in the UK is now the dominant strain of the virus in the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b9fRC8YrWI\">said at a press briefing on Wednesday.</a></p><p>The coronavirus variant found in the UK -

And while these are all positive steps, these efforts will not actually solve the broader problem of keeping kids safe online. Ultimately, the announced measures provide only the illusion of safety.</p><p>We absolutely need social platforms to play a vital role in children&#39;s online safety (reporting CSAM, removing bad actors, providing transparency around their data practices, etc.), but the core problem in the current narrative is the expectation that every social platform can - and will - independently build sufficient tools to actually keep children safe. Parents, rather than Big Tech, ultimately own that responsibility - they just need the access to empower them to do so.</p><h2><strong>Big Tech&#39;s #1 focus will never be on child safety</strong></h2><p>It&#39;s no secret that a large social platform&#39;s primary duty is to drive shareholder value by serving its users ads, accomplished by optimizing for user numbers and engagement metrics. Platforms are inherently disincentivized to expend any significant energy on child safety features that reduce usage from one of the largest groups on their platform. Updates made in the name of child safety are generally of the &#34;check-the-box&#34; variety, because social platforms aren&#39;t nonprofits, and they&#39;re not dedicated to providing safe online spaces for kids.</p><p>Some platforms do offer child-focused versions of their apps designed for younger children (i.e., users to whom they can&#39;t yet serve ads because of the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act, a law that protects the privacy of kids under 13). For example, Facebook Messenger Kids and the rumored upcoming Instagram for Kids. Putting aside the question of whether we want to encourage more social media usage at younger ages, these types of apps usually work reasonably well for kids six to 10.</p><p>But the kid versions simply aren&#39;t cool for a tween or teen to use, are limited in functionality, and are tied in awkward ways to their parent&#39;s account on that platform. To switch to the adult version of the app, all they have to do is fudge their birth date. With no age verification, they can start exploring the entire app or chatting with strangers.</p><p>Alternatively, some platforms provide &#34;parental controls&#34; for kids using the adult versions of their apps, but in most cases, kids can simply turn them off at any point without their parent&#39;s say-so. And even when enabled, parental controls are inherently blunt instruments, often dramatically limiting the usefulness of the app. While disabling specific features can certainly be useful when a (typically younger) child is solely consuming content, they have little impact on the biggest challenges that kids face once they&#39;ve graduated to using the platforms as tools to communicate with others. </p><h2><strong>The dangers kids face online are real</strong></h2><p>At online safety company Bark, we&#39;ve learned firsthand that when kids are online, the chances that they&#39;ll experience some sort of issue are incredibly likely. In Bark&#39;s <strong>2020 annual report</strong>, we analyzed more than 2.1 billion messages across SMS, email, and 30+ social media and messaging platforms, and we found: </p><ul><li>41.4% of tweens and 66.6% of teens were involved in a self-harm/suicidal situation.</li><li>70.9% of tweens and 87.9% of teens encountered nudity or content of a sexual nature. ● 76.7% of tweens and 82.0% of teens experienced bullying as a bully, victim, or witness. </li></ul><p>And a platform&#39;s parental controls - even if implemented well - would have helped with nearly zero of these. Parental controls simply don&#39;t help when a child is being bullied, pressured to send nude photographs of themselves, expressing suicidal thoughts, or being sent unwanted pornography via a DM/text message. </p><p>Granted, on a small handful of platforms, a parent could use the platform&#39;s built-in parental controls to turn off DMs altogether - but this has the side effect of rendering the app largely useless for older kids, and simply shifting the problematic communication to another platform with less restrictive controls. And, most importantly, this naïve &#34;block-or-allow&#34; approach erects a wall between the child and parent - there&#39;s no feedback loop for the parent to offer support. </p><h2><strong>Putting families in charge of their own data </strong></h2><p>Rates of teen/tween suicide, depression, bullying, and online predation have dramatically risen over the last decade, but parents are facing a massive awareness gap when these issues occur. It is too big a burden on our children to expect them to always know when and how to ask for help (statistically, they overwhelmingly don&#39;t), and history has shown that expecting platforms to independently and proactively implement sufficient tools for parents and kids is not a viable option. </p><p>So what is actually needed? While I certainly encourage platforms to continue to work to offer better tools, the number one thing needed is neither controversial nor difficult for platforms to provide: Let users truly own and access their data. Again, the biggest challenges our kids face - rising teen/tween suicide, mental health issues, online predators, and bullying - are all buried within the <strong>content </strong>of their messages.</p><p>Without the ability to move data out of a platform&#39;s walled garden, caregivers have neither awareness of major issues nor teachable moments to guide their kids with responsible usage of technology. </p><p>Just as we have the ability to choose to send our data to other services (e.g., your biometric data to FitBit, or your financial data to Mint), families need data access to utilize specialized online safety tools to gain the awareness needed to help with situations that kids face online. </p><p>While &#34;data portability&#34; may not sound as powerful as &#34;parental controls,&#34; it is the key to helping parents actually be parents in the digital age. Without it, a parent&#39;s only two options are A) don&#39;t let their kids use tech (i.e., the &#34;don&#39;t ride that bike, you might fall off&#34; approach), or B) give their kids access to an unlimited amount of dangers with zero guidance. </p><p>Ultimately the solution is not to demand more &#34;parental controls&#34; from tech companies who aren&#39;t incentivized to provide them in the first place. It is time for them to empower us to fully protect our children.</p><p><em>Brian Bason is a dad of two and the founder and CEO of Bark Technologies, Inc., an online safety company that helps protect more than 5 million kids across the US.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-apps-kids-children-parents-safety-youtube-facebook-instagram-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Um6OCWCue1o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:42:18 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606dd20c30004b0019b26697?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"0246ee58438095a6c54267cd1b9b7162","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn81@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-23-575_06e9a431892fe466.webp","destWidth":2222,"destHeight":1666,"sourceBytes":142140,"destBytes":142140,"author":"insider@insider.com (Brian Bason)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606dd21630004b0019b26698?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn83@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-26-675_0e52417fac53e291.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-29-454_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn47@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-29-252_88160ae221201d67.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn48@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-29-954_a6a87021595e1d0b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-27-264_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Um6OCWCue1o:1ai2AquuIxU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn52@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-26-970_2e9121fc3f62375a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Um6OCWCue1o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn59@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-26-469_9091a700b4eced3e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817067357},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","title":"Nearly 500 new billionaires joined the ranks of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk last year as the world's richest became $5 trillion richer","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-became-5-trillion-richer-during-pandemic-forbes-list-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606c8d5130004b0019b26339?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Bezos Musk Arnault Gates\" height=\"1280\" width=\"2560\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>From left: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos; Tesla CEO Elon Musk; LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault; and Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates.\n<p class=\"copyright\">MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images; Britta Pedersen-Pool/Getty Images; Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images; Elaine Thompson/AP Photo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The world&#39;s richest are $5 trillion richer than they were one year ago, according to Forbes.</li>\n<li>Executives like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bernard Arnault all saw massive gains amid the pandemic.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, 2020 was a period of economic uncertainty and job losses for millions of people.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>2020 was a great year for billionaires. </p><p>That&#39;s according to Forbes, which released its <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\">annual billionaires list</a> on Tuesday.

The video game retailer and the movie theaters operator this year have exploded in popularity, particularly among younger retail investors.</p><p>The increase in blue-chips buying points to behavior by older and more financially conservative investors who are &#34;a lot more wealthy than millennials,&#34; said Vanda, which noted that the average age of investors in platforms like Schwab or TD Ameritrade is close to 50.</p><p>Meanwhile, &#34;unusually large inflows into sovereign bond and credit ETFs,&#34; added to Vanda&#39;s view that Boomers were leading the retail activity. <br><br>&#34;While most Robinhooders tend to stay away from &#39;boring&#39; fixed-income products, Boomers, who are closer to retirement, often prefer them to equities,&#34; said Pierantoni, referring to the Robinhood trading app. He also pointed to monthly data from clients at Charles Schwab that showed inflows into bond ETFs and mutual funds have been twice as large as those into equities. <br><br>More than $416 million last week was pushed into the 30 largest fixed-income ETFs traded in the US, the largest amount on record, said Vanda.

It could have easily taken the top spot in our testing for the beauty and longevity of the arrangements, but because the design process is more involved and trends pricier, we ended up naming it the &#34;best for custom arrangements.&#34;</p><p>That said, this is now the first company I think of when I contemplate sending blooms to someone, and I already have a long list of people I can&#39;t wait to gift a stunning Floracracy bouquet to. Here&#39;s what I love about the service</p><h2>How it works</h2><p>The process starts with <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=100985&urllink=floracracy.com%2Fcracy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Floracracy&#39;s</a> design tool, which walks you through designing your custom arrangement with a quiz. You choose the occasion, your relationship to the recipient, the mood you most want to convey, and the style of flowers you want (whimsical, garden, Old World, etc). Since I was sending flowers to myself, I chose the &#34;strictly decor&#34; occasion, which then prompted me to fill in where in my house I expected to display the flowers; I chose &#34;coffee table,&#34; and selected the &#34;garden&#34; style. </p><p><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=100985&urllink=floracracy.com%2Fcracy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606dd9fd30004b0019b266c3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"floracracy flower delivery service review 2021 screenshot\" height=\"600\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A screenshot of the design tool, which lets you customize the shape, color palette, and specific flowers in your arrangement.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lauren Savoie/Insider via Floracracy website</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a>The tool then makes recommendations for a certain shape arrangement that fits your needs, or you can choose from other available styles that fit your criteria. Once you choose a shape and size, you can customize every detail of the arrangement - from the color palette down the individual types of flowers used. I loved this feature, since it let me choose peachy colors that I knew would work well with the warm hues in my living room decor, and I could choose flowers I was sure would be safe to have around my cat. When you hover over each flower in the arrangement, the tool shows you the flower&#39;s meaning and origin, so you can better craft a piece that sets the mood you wish to convey.</p><p>I ultimately chose the Juliette shape in the garden style, and customized it with ferns and three different types of roses. I chose delivery later that week, though next-day delivery is available. If you&#39;re sending the arrangement to someone, you&#39;ll be given the option to craft a letter or have the company write a letter based on information you provide.</p><p><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=100985&urllink=floracracy.com%2Fcracy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606db21470954f0019195979?format=jpeg\" alt=\"floracracy flower delivery service review 2021 screenshot arrangement\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A screenshot of the bouquet I designed and ordered.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lauren Savoie/Insider via Floracracy website</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>The process took me about 20 minutes, mostly because I wanted to browse through all the available options, which meant sometimes retaking the quiz. It&#39;s only been a few months since <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=100985&urllink=floracracy.com%2Fcracy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Floracracy</a> launched, but I would love to see better navigation in the design tool; it was hard to toggle back if I changed my mind about shape, style, or color. That said, I love being able to preview my custom bouquet, and the curation provided by the quiz format felt really unique.</p><p>According to the website, Floracracy will also be launching a &#34;design it for me&#34; option soon, for those who don&#39;t want to go through the design process themselves.</p><h2>Delivery options</h2><aside class=\"breakout-box headline-regular\"><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Price range:</strong> $155 to $350</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Delivery area:</strong> Lower 48 states</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Same-day delivery:</strong> No</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Next-day delivery:</strong> Yes</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Shipping:</strong> Included</li></ul></aside><p>One of the great things about Floracracy is that shipping is included with the price of your arrangement, which lowers the overall cost (shipping for flowers can get quite expensive). While there isn&#39;t currently an option for same-day delivery, you can choose next-day delivery for the lower 48 states. This is the option my coworker went with, while I opted for delivery a few days out. Both our arrangements arrived on time and in excellent condition.</p><h2>Review of Floracracy </h2><p>Since the arrangement I chose has a large, distinct shape, I was curious to see how it would ship and arrive. A few days later I got my answer when a large, almost 3-foot tall box arrived on my doorstep. </p><p><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=100985&urllink=floracracy.com%2Fcracy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606db68d30004b0019b265fb?format=jpeg\" alt=\"floracracy flower delivery service review 2021 delivery box\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lauren Savoie/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>There was a lot of packaging, and unboxing the arrangement required the help of my partner, but unboxing still felt special and exciting. Inside the shipping box, I was greeted by a gift box festooned with ribbon and adorned with my personalized letter and a small pair of gold-accented mini shears. Lifting the box lid uncovered the most lush, gorgeous floral arrangement I had ever seen: a whimsical array of garden roses in varying warm tones, each vibrant and perky and adorned by wild-looking ferns and foliage. </p><p>Every arrangement also comes with a coordinating vase, a handbound book for pressing petals, and an illustrated card with each of the flowers and their meaning. The total package felt like a stunning and special gift. </p><p><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=100985&urllink=floracracy.com%2Fcracy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606dc38830004b0019b2663a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"floracracy flower delivery service review 2021 flower arrangement 1\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>My arrangement I ordered. I chose the “Juliette” shape in the “garden” style and customized the flower colors and types.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lauren Savoie/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>The included materials on flower care were the most robust I&#39;ve seen from any service, but the instructions also include information on how to dry and preserve the flowers or petals. I love that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fshareasale.com%2Fr.cfm%3Fb%3D999%26u%3D1088116%26m%3D100985%26urllink%3Dfloracracy.com%252F%26afftrack%3Dxid%3Afr1617722855276hef&source=5a6f97de59d4326f038b46d2&sessionid=16177228512789lu2brzc&afftrack=1617722851617azo6tp2ne&xid=fr1617722855276hef1617722855276hef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Floracracy</a> acknowledges that fresh flowers are a fleeting gift, and still offers suggestions to enjoy your arrangement through all the stages of its life. The care instructions also noted that if you donate your empty vase to a women&#39;s shelter and let Floracracy know, the company will send them flowers, which I thought was a lovely touch. </p><p><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=100985&urllink=floracracy.com%2Fcracy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606db73e70954f0019195990?format=jpeg\" alt=\"floracracy flower delivery service review 2021 accessories\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Each arrangement comes with a vase, small shears, a personalized letter, a print of the flowers and their meanings, and a book for pressing petals.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lauren Savoie/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>I was incredibly impressed by the lifespan of the fresh flowers. Almost three weeks after receiving it, the arrangement still had many fresh blooms and foliage among the drying flowers, and it still looked artful and healthy enough to display. A colleague who ordered and received a smaller Floracracy arrangement reports her blooms have lasted just as long.</p><p><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=100985&urllink=floracracy.com%2Fcracy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606db80270954f0019195998?format=jpeg\" alt=\"floracracy flower delivery service review 2021 2 weeks later\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>My arrangement about two weeks later. The blooms drooped a bit and I had to weed out a few dying buds, but for the most part it was still very lively.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lauren Savoie/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><h2>Cons to consider</h2><p>While very fairly priced for what you&#39;re receiving, one downside is that Floracracy doesn&#39;t offer many options at more affordable price points. Expect to spend at least $155 on this service, with more impressive options costing up to $300. </p><p>It&#39;s also not the ideal choice if you&#39;re just looking to quickly pick out a bouquet and be done with the process - the service requires at least a little of your time and thought to get the most out of it, and the tool can be a bit tricky to navigate if you don&#39;t have your mind made up about what you want. </p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=100985&urllink=floracracy.com%2Fcracy.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606db85b70954f001919599b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"floracracy flower delivery service review 2021 alternate arrangement\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A smaller Floracracy arrangement ordered by my coworker.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Connie Chen/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>That said, the result is one of the most personalized and special bouquets your loved one will likely ever have been gifted.

Since then, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona has taken <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-biden-has-done-to-tackle-student-debt-crisis-2021-3\">three distinct steps</a> to confront student debt: he canceled debt for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-education-secretary-student-loan-debt-cancels-department-defrauded-borrowers-2021-3\">about 72,000 borrowers</a> defrauded by for-profit schools, he canceled debt for <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-education-department-cancels-student-debt-borrowers-disabilities-paperwork-cardona-2021-3\">over 41,000 borrowers</a> with disabilities, and most recently, he expanded the scope of the payment pause to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-education-department-expands-pause-student-loan-debt-payments-private-2021-3\">1.14 million borrowers</a> with private loans. </p><p>But as president, Biden has yet to follow through on two campaign promises he made to voters on cancelling student debt. The more than 81 million people who voted for him also voted for two promised actions on student-debt relief that haven&#39;t been enacted yet, if they ever will be.</p><p>Regarding further actions Biden might take on student debt cancelation, a DOE spokesperson told Insider that the department &#34;is working in partnership with colleagues at the Department of Justice and the White House to review options with respect to debt cancellation.&#34;</p><p>Here&#39;s what Biden said on the campaign trail about how he&#39;d tackle the student-debt crisis:</p><h1>Cancel $10,000 in student debt per person </h1><p>During his campaign, Biden promised to immediately cancel $10,000 in student debt per person. In a <a href=\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-speech-on-economic-recovery-plan-transcript-november-16\">speech</a> on November 16, Biden said that student loans are holding borrowers up, and forgiving $10,000 in student debt &#34;should be done immediately.&#34;</p><p>Biden&#39;s campaign <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf\">website</a> said the president would work with Democrats to &#34;authorize up to $10,000 in student debt relief per borrower&#34; as part of COVID-19 relief, but the $1.9 trillion stimulus package he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-biden-signs-trillion-covid-relief-package-checks-direct-payments-2021-3\">signed</a> in March didn&#39;t include that. He also said he would support legislation brought to him to cancel $10,000 in student debt, but Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-schumer-biden-cancel-student-debt-executive-order-keep-pressure-2021-3\">press call</a> last month that doing so is lengthy and expensive, and while she has legislation to do it, there&#39;s no reason Biden can&#39;t use executive action to provide the immediate relief he had promised.</p><p>Warren campaigned on a larger number, advocating the cancelation of $50,000 of debt per person, and she and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have been urging Biden to act on that. At a CNN town hall in February, Biden said he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-wont-cancel-student-debt-heres-why-go-big-economy-2021-2\">doesn&#39;t have the executive authority</a> to cancel up to $50,000 in student debt per person, but said he is prepared to cancel $10,000.</p><p>&#34;My point is: I understand the impact of debt, and it can be debilitating,&#34; Biden said at the town hall. &#34;I am prepared to write off the $10,000 debt but not $50 [thousand], because I don&#39;t think I have the authority to do it.&#34;</p><p>Biden has since asked the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/17/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-and-deputy-national-security-advisor-for-cyber-and-emerging-technology-anne-neuberger-february-17-2021/\">Justice Department</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-wants-to-cancel-student-loan-debt-ron-klain-says-2021-4\">Education Department</a> to review his authority to use executive action to cancel student debt, indicating he may act on this promise. He may go even further, as White House Press Secretary said in early April that the $50,000 cancelation figure <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwimprG8r-zvAhWhTd8KHcioBKwQxfQBCHIwCA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fbiden-student-debt-50k-executive-order-rule-out-psaki-2021-4&usg=AOvVaw1-bD7mMgY1mYPGDGiO-p6f1-4&#38;usg=AOvVaw1-bD7mMgY1mYPGDGiO-p6f\">hasn&#39;t been ruled out</a>. But nearly three months into his presidency, he hasn&#39;t acted on this yet.</p><h1>Cancel debt for undergraduates from public colleges and HBCUs</h1><p>Another plan Biden had to address student debt during his campaign was to <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf\">forgive</a> all undergraduate tuition-related federal student loan debt for borrowers from public colleges and universities earning up to $125,000 per year, and it would also apply to private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and minority-serving institutions.</p><p>Forgiving debt for borrowers who attended HBCUs would help address the racial wealth gap in the student debt crisis. Insider previously reported that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-americas-student-debt-crisis-impacts-black-students-2019-7\">86.6% of Black students</a> take out federal student loans, compared to just 59.9% of white students. </p><p>This plan was modeled after Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/college-for-all-act-introduced/\">College for All Act</a>, introduced in 2017, which would make public colleges and universities tuition-free and reduces student debt.</p><p>&#34;If we are to succeed in a highly competitive global economy and have the best-educated workforce in the world, public colleges and universities must become tuition-free for working families and we must substantially reduce student debt,&#34; Sanders said in a statement.</p><p>The Education Department has not yet released any information on this plan.</p><p>The department did not provide Insider with a timeline for when further cancellation measures will occur. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/student-debt-cancelation-biden-campaign-promise-public-college-hbcu-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/iHDPrGa6pwc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 15:01:16 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606dbc1830004b0019b26615?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b53136bc9f005e73ea2335614968ff27","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn9@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-21-668_2412a840b5515186.webp","destWidth":1777,"destHeight":1332,"sourceBytes":62650,"destBytes":62650,"author":"asheffey@businessinsider.com (Ayelet Sheffey)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606dbc1830004b0019b26615?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn9@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-21-668_2412a840b5515186.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-29-454_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn95@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-26-651_8b2db0bc2efbb7c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-29-159_8914d7d930d4ebe9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-27-264_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=iHDPrGa6pwc:Sf3U1cUB0Dc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn68@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-24-882_98adb195c4d8aab5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/iHDPrGa6pwc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn32@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-29-150_9babcf7e78d5a945.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817067364},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","title":"The best deals and sales happening on Amazon right now - save $50 on a Mac Mini","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-deals-on-amazon","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>If you buy through our links, we may earn money from affiliate partners. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/600eee2f1958200011554c2c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Amazon Best Deals and Sales 2x1\" height=\"1667\" width=\"3334\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alyssa Powell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>We update this list of Amazon deals every day with the new discounts as they crop up.</li>\n<li><strong>You can</strong> <strong>sign up for a free 30-day </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/31Q1AK6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>membership trial</strong></a><strong> to get Prime shipping along with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-benefits-what-is-included\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other perks</a>. </strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visit Insider Reviews&#39;

under-30s another vaccine instead</a>, though it said those who have already had one shot should get their second.</p><p>In a statement, the group said that under-30s should be &#34;offered an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if available.&#34;</p><p>Most people under 30 have not yet been offered vaccines in the UK, which concentrated on older demographics first.</p><p>The reason for the change is a small number of blood clots in people given the vaccine.

The United States, lagging in <a href=\"https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/the-royal-navy-is-testing-jet-pack-assault-teams/\">jet technology</a>, fielded their first combat-capable jet in 1945.</p><p>These and other first-generation aircraft were like their propeller-driven predecessors, except for their engines. They had little to no avionics, and their primary weapon was the gun.</p><p>Because jet engine technology was in its infancy, they had short lifespans and, if not delicately managed, were prone to flameouts - quickly turning them into gliders.</p><p>After the Korean War ended in 1953, second-generation fighters made their debut. One of the lessons learned during the war was that gunning a high-speed aircraft with a manual gunsight was incredibly difficult. Technology had also progressed to the point where missiles could be used to shoot down enemy aircraft.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606dcd9770954f0019195a1c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Air Force F-104A\" height=\"1185\" width=\"1800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Two US Air Force F-104A Starfighters around 1960.\n<p class=\"copyright\">National Museum of the US Air Force</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Combined with afterburning engines, this era gave rise to the interceptor: high-speed, high-altitude aircraft, like the F-104 Starfighter, that was designed to intercept Russian bomber formations and launch <a href=\"https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/americas-air-to-air-nuke-would-have-taken-out-entire-bomber-fleets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nuclear-tipped air-to-air missiles</a>.</p><p>Third-generation aircraft arrived in the early 1960s. These aircraft placed an emphasis on a multi-role capability.</p><p>Aircraft like the F-4 Phantom could carry a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, including the first laser-guided smart-bombs. The gun was de-emphasized and, in some cases, eliminated.</p><p>This, combined with subpar missile reliability, led to a lower-than-expected air-to-air kill ratio during the Vietnam War.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/56ec259c91058425008b74ba?format=jpeg\" alt=\"F 4 phantom camo\" height=\"1611\" width=\"2496\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>F-4 Phantom II fighters in formation during a heritage flight demonstration.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Aircraft_camouflage#/media/File:1997_F-4_Heritage_Flight_over_Florida-edit_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">USAF - MSgt Michael Ammons</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Fourth-generation aircraft addressed the missile-reliability issue by reemphasizing the importance of maneuverability and the within-visual-range dogfight.</p><p>Nimble aircraft based on fly-by-wire control systems (instead of traditional cables and pulleys) were developed, which allowed inherently unstable designs like the F-16 Viper to fly.</p><p>Avionics were also substantially improved, along with the pilot-to-aircraft interface. By placing the buttons on the stick and throttle, a pilot could execute thousands of commands without taking their hands off the controls, allowing for quicker reaction times and the ability to change settings under high G-forces.</p><p>Because several fourth-generation aircraft are still flying today, many include a fourth-and-a-half generation designation for aircraft that were upgraded or redesigned after the 1990s.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/604f7d9187891e0019850cc8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Air Force F-15EX fighter jet\" height=\"932\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The first F-15EX is delivered to its new home at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, March 11, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Air Force/Tech.

It's in between New York and New Hampshire, and is located above Massachusetts, running up to the Canadian border.</p><h2>What is there to do in Vermont?</h2><p>Vermont is an outdoors dream, renowned for its mountainous areas that are great for skiing in winter, hiking in spring and summer, and leaf-peeping in the fall when the lush foliage puts on a spectacular show of changing hues of yellow, burnt orange, and crimson red, drawing visitors from around the world. But it's not all woodsy; impressive lakes add to the ample scenery.</p><p>Come and sample homemade cheese and maple syrup from seasonal stalls at local farmer's markets, sip on craft ciders and brews, and shop in charming stores in small towns. Larger cities like Burlington are home to universities, buzzy dining, and great shopping.</p><h2>How far is Vermont from New York City?</h2><p>Southern Vermont ski areas such as Stratton, Mount Snow, Putney, and Okemo are about a 4-hour drive from New York City. Northern regions such as Stowe or Burlington are closer to 6 hours by car.</p><h2>Where is there to stay in Vermont?</h2><p>If you want to ski in winter but seek a shorter drive from major cities like New York, consider Southern Vermont towns such as Dover, Stratton, Brattleboro, Bennington, Putney, Ludlow, or Killington as your base. You'll find many Airbnb vacation rentals in these areas that cater to skiers and snowboarders. These homes also make great places to stay in warmer weather when many mountains open to hikers.</p><p>For more of a city vibe, you'll want to head north to Burlington, or the capital, Montpelier. For something woodsy and remote, you can pick from pretty much anywhere else.</p><h2>Is it safe to rent an Airbnb in Vermont?</h2><p>The CDC says <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-fully-vaccinated-travelers-can-now-travel-in-the-us-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">fully vaccinated people can safely travel in the US</a>.</p><p>Additionally, experts say&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-airbnbs-safe-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Airbnb is safe</a>, especially&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/which-is-safer-airbnb-hotels-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">compared to hotels</a>, because they eliminate interactions with others.

For winemakers, it&#39;s kind of like a &#34;Shark Tank&#34; for their industry: They propose a wine, it gets approved, and Nakedwines.com gives them an advance to make it happen. Part of how the company has the funds to operate this way is through over 100,000 voluntary &#34;Angel&#34; customers who act as investors.</p><p>Once accepted into the program (and I&#39;d wager every &#34;applicant&#34; is), Angel members invest $40 every month into their Naked Wine piggy bank. This pool of crowdfunded money helps Naked Wine invest in its winemakers, but it&#39;s also never lost to Angel members; the $40 in the virtual piggy bank can be used on their individual wine orders whenever they like - in other words, it&#39;s pretty much like a wine bank account.</p><p>If all goes to plan, it&#39;s good for the company, the consumers, and the winemakers - like <a href=\"https://us.nakedwines.com/producers/carmen-stevens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Carmen Stevens</a>, reportedly South Africa&#39;s first black woman to graduate in wine-making (funded by 2,000 Angel members and $200,000 in eight hours).</p><p>To be clear, what you&#39;re getting is not quite a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-wine-club\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wine subscription</a> in the traditional sense. You can just buy wine directly from the site as you would anywhere else (though you need to order six bottles to ship), but the site&#39;s Angel members get special perks. They save 40-60% on all their orders and get a ton of freebies and perks like samples of other wines included in their deliveries, a bottle of Angel-funded wine worth $20 or more each month they order a case of wine, access to Angel-only wines, invites to wine tastings to meet the winemakers, and access to an exclusive priority hotline for any needed support.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5efcb81ef34d05445d262773?format=jpeg\" alt=\"nakedwines.com review\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nakedwines.com sells affordable bottles that are what I&#39;d call &#34;easy drinking&#34; wines - perfect for casual drinking.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jada Wong/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I&#39;d wager most people wind up on the site thanks to a suspiciously generous $100 voucher for new customers - I received mine inside the box of a Bloomingdale&#39;s purchase. Using the voucher, I got a Discovery Case with 12 bottles of wine across a wide spectrum of offerings from the site. With the $100 voucher - which you can also get by <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=17197&awinaffid=257137&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fus.nakedwines.com%2FAWIN100FAWIN100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">clicking the top right-hand button that says &#34;voucher&#34; and entering your email</a> - the case was $79.99, instead of its current sale price of $179.99 (its traditional cost is listed at $264). This promo varies a bit depending on how many bottles are in the box - my colleague redeemed a $50 voucher for six bottles of wine.</p><p>In-person, the wines are good. I was satisfied and even a little surprised by their quality given the fact that I received $100 off lots of wine. The affordable bottles were what you&#39;d call &#34;easy drinking&#34; wines - none that were bold and weird and revelatory - but perfect for casual drinking. Nakedwines.com hit the &#34;weekday wine&#34; niche perfectly.</p><p>Shipping is also inexpensive. For orders under $100, Nakedwines.com typically charges $10. For orders $100 and more, delivery is free - except for New Jersey, Hawaii, and Alaska, (<a href=\"https://us.nakedwines.com/content/help-faqs.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow nofollow sponsored\">you can find rates for these states here</a>). Wines will be delivered in four to seven business days (Monday-Friday or Tuesday-Saturday) during regular business hours, but make sure that there is someone over 21 years old who can sign for the package.</p><p>One thing I would stress is that if you have any difficulty with your shipment, or you don&#39;t like a wine, you should contact Nakedwines.com for help. My experiences with them were as a consumer rather than a reporter, and I was impressed by their easygoing willingness to make sure I had a positive experience, even when it wasn&#39;t to their immediate advantage. This means that if you really hated a wine, they&#39;ll refund you. The site has a &#34;cast-iron, no questions asked, 100% guarantee.&#34;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=17197&awinaffid=257137&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fus.nakedwines.com%2FAWINANGELWINANGEL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e754c89671de0445535d414?format=jpeg\" alt=\"naked wines 2\" height=\"749\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Winemaker Jen Pfeiffer showcasing her Diamond Merlot: rich and complex with plummy mulberry fruit.

Winemakers and members interact with each other. Winemakers get feedback directly from customers, and customers can ask them questions. Indirectly, members can rate and recommend wines to each other. </p><p>This communication creates an optional whirlpool of discovery and self-improvement, which is baked into the business from the top down to the granular level of your account; if you don&#39;t like a wine, give it a thumbs down in your Naked Me account. From then on, they&#39;ll help steer you away from wines that taste similar to the ones you didn&#39;t enjoy. Nakedwines.com also uses this as an indirect polling system, helping them determine which winemakers are doing the best job of making wines people really love.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>All in all, Nakedwines.com has good wine for an accessible price, with the opportunity to be as involved as you want to be. It&#39;s also easy to cancel right in your online account if you change your mind as opposed to calling or emailing customer service.</p><p>If you use Naked as a casual wine drinker, you&#39;ll discover great and affordable wines (even if you don&#39;t take advantage of the $100 off coupon) through an interesting system that makes you feel more involved than just ordering another case of wine online. </p><h3><a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=17197&awinaffid=257137&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fus.nakedwines.com%2FAWIN100FAWIN100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow

AstraZeneca&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine,</a> regulators announced on Wednesday.</p><p>The benefits of AstraZeneca&#39;s vaccine still outweigh the risks, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said in a <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine-ema-finds-possible-link-very-rare-cases-unusual-blood-clots-low-blood\">press release</a>. Still, the agency&#39;s safety committee said it&#39;s important to know the signs of a possible clot.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/what-causes-blood-clots\">blood clot</a> occurs when the blood thickens and forms a semi-solid mass. It can be a helpful response to stop bleeding in the case of injury, but these blockages can cause problems if they cut off blood flow to a vital area.</p><p>Blood clots can cause blockages in the legs, abdomen, and lungs. Most of the blood clots associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine have occurred in veins in people&#39;s brains. These clots, known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), can lead to stroke, seizures, and death.</p><p>So far, most of the clots reported have occurred in women under 60 years of age within two weeks of vaccination. Since young people are more likely to experience this side effect, UK vaccine regulators recommend that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/under-30s-shouldnt-take-astrazeneca-vaccine-uk-regulator-2021-4\">people under 30 do not get the AstraZeneca shot</a> unless they&#39;ve already received their first dose.</p><h2><strong>Blood clot symptoms include shortness of breath and headaches</strong></h2><p>The EMA said patients who got the AstraZeneca vaccine should seek medical assistance immediately if they have the following symptoms:</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\">shortness of breath</li><li aria-level=\"1\">chest pain</li><li aria-level=\"1\">swelling in your leg</li><li aria-level=\"1\">persistent abdominal (belly) pain</li><li aria-level=\"1\">neurological symptoms, including severe and persistent headaches or blurred vision</li></ul><p>Some mild <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-long-it-takes-covid-19-vaccine-to-work-2021-1\">side effects</a>, like pain at the injection site or other body aches, are common in the days post-vaccine. But if you experience severe or persistent symptoms around four to 20 days after vaccination, you should seek medical attention, according to the <a href=\"https://worldhealthorganization.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/d/BF096066B984974F2540EF23F30FEDED/D0083294ADD52E090CC2E775D3CF5869\">World Health Organization</a>.</p><p>Blood clots are typically treated with anti-clotting medication. Complications can be avoided if the clot is caught early.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The carried-interest loophole treats that money as capital gains rather than income, meaning it&#39;s taxed at a much lower rate. </p><p>Loopholes in the tax code ultimately end up stymieing competition, according to Dimon. </p><p>&#34;Suffice it to say, industry gets its share of tax breaks and forms of protection from legitimate competition,&#34; he said.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-remote-work-return-office-shareholder-letter-2021-4\">JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says remote work can undermine the &#39;character&#39; of a company and lays out the bank&#39;s plans for the future of the office</a></em></p><p>Dimon called on lawmakers to create a &#34;proper and consistent tax and fiscal policy&#34; that would drive growth and improve income inequality. The government should have a fiscal policy that&#39;s simple and transparent, and one which allows it to collect all taxes owed, Dimon said. The federal government should also set a target for the amount it aims to collect in taxes over time, he said. </p><p>Dimon recommended raising taxes on the high earners and getting rid of a &#34;maze&#34; of unnecessary tax breaks that primarily benefit the wealthy. Tax breaks for race cars, private jets, and horse racing, along with a land conservation tax break for golf courses, should all be eliminated, Dimon said. </p><p>Democrats and Republicans should set aside partisanship to address what he considers the country&#39;s public policy failures, Dimon said. </p><p>&#34;We must remember that the concepts of free enterprise, rugged individualism and entrepreneurship are not incompatible with meaningful safety nets and the desire to lift up our disadvantaged citizens,&#34; he said. </p><p>Dimon&#39;s comments come as President Joe Biden pitches raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% to finance a sweeping <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-bidens-2-trillion-infrastructure-plan-means-for-you-2021-4\">$2 trillion infrastructure package</a> that would address an array of issues from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-plan-industry-experts-2030-2021-3\">electric-vehicle charging</a> to high-speed internet access. </p><p>The Business Roundtable, a consortium of CEOs of major US firms, <a href=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-calls-for-bipartisan-infrastructure-legislation-will-oppose-corporate-tax-increases\">decried</a> the proposed tax hike as creating &#34;new barriers to job creation and economic growth.&#34;

It&#39;s activating my fight or flight response.&#34; </p><p>The latest blow came on Tuesday, when the state legislature approved a ban on puberty blockers and hormones for trans minors, and cut off  access to any medical care or affirmation from mental health professionals or school employees until they turn 18. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.insider.com/arkansas-vetoes-historic-anti-trans-bill-2021-4\">Gov. Asa Hutchinson</a> vetoed the bill, calling it &#34;a vast government overreach,&#34; but the legislature had enough votes to push it through without him.</p><p>The governor, though, is hardly seen as a trans ally. He previously signed a bill banning trans girls from girl&#39;s scholastic sports, and a sweeping religious exemption for health care providers who can now turn away LGBTQ patients for non-emergencies. </p><p>Middleton, a 23 year old trans woman, transitioned while attending Southern Arkansas University, but had to drop out after several people in the small college town threatened her safety. She&#39;s struggled to find a job since, describing how she&#39;d show up for interviews and employers would realize she&#39;s trans and lose interest. Then, last September, Middleton caught Covid, which led to developing tenosynovitis, an inflammatory disease that affects her wrists and thumbs.</p><p>Now on Medicaid, she worries about losing access to the hormones keeping her dysphoria at bay. HB 1570, the law banning transition care for minors, bans state funds from being used to fund transition care for all trans people. So state funds towards Middleton&#39;s Medicaid will no longer cover the hormones she needs to survive.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1379511326062546946\">promised</a> to challenge the law in court, but trans people in the state are following the developments with dread. </p><p>For Middleton, the anti-trans health care bill was the last straw.</p><p>&#34;I have to go somewhere where there are people standing behind me and that&#39;s not here,&#34; she said. </p><p>&#34;I would be willing to endure this if it felt like there was any chance that I could overturn it. And if I can&#39;t overturn it here, I&#39;ll go somewhere else.&#34; </p><p>Insider spoke to several trans people living in Arkansas who said they were contemplating a move out of state. </p><p>Last week, while the governor was considering how to respond to the bill cutting off health care for trans kids, Evelyn Rios Stafford, a Justice of the Peace in Fayetteville and Arkansas&#39; only openly trans elected official, said she had a 40-minute meeting to discuss how the measure would impact trans people in the state. </p><p>&#34;Honestly, they&#39;re worried,&#34; she said of what she told the governor. &#34;They don&#39;t know what else is coming down the pipeline.&#34; </p><p>But finding a trans-friendly place to live could prove complicated, given that 19 states have taken up similar bills to the one passed in Arkansas. Middleton has considered Illinois, the nearest state not currently likely to pass new anti-trans laws. </p><p>&#34;It looks like a lot of other states are following suit,&#34; she said. &#34;There&#39;s not going to end up being a lot of places to run to, but a lot of places to run from.&#34;</p><h2>&#34;WHAT ELSE IS COMING?&#34; </h2><p>While the ACLU has led opposition to the anti-trans efforts across the country, in Arkansas, a group called Intransitive has been leading the fight locally. </p><p>&#34;The majority of trans people in the country live in the South,&#34; said Rumba Yambú, the group&#39;s director. &#34;There are a lot of trans people here who have been living, resisting, organizing here for years. We just needed help.&#34;</p><p>According to Rios Stafford, there&#39;s currently no one in the state performing gender reassignment surgery. There is only one clinic, the Gender Spectrum Clinic at Arkansas Children&#39;s Hospital in Little Rock, that serves trans adolescents.</p><p>At the state Senate hearing on the trans health care bill, Dr. Michele Hutchinson, the doctor in charge of the clinic, <a href=\"https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00284/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20210322/-1/21395?gefdesc=&startposition=202103221506030603\">testified</a> about the impact the legislature&#39;s work was having on patients. </p><p>&#34;I&#39;m doing everything I can to maintain my sanity here,&#34; Hutchinson <a href=\"https://sg001-harmony.sliq.net/00284/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20210322/-1/21395?gefdesc=&startposition=202103221506030603\">said</a>. </p><p>&#34;Just after this bill passed the House, these kids heard about it. I&#39;ve had multiple kids in our emergency room because of an attempted suicide. Just in the last week,&#34; she <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/161875/arkansas-transgender-law-hormones-doctors-youth\">told legislators</a>.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606dcccf70954f0019195a0d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Trans symbol\" height=\"4174\" width=\"6261\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A rally in support of transgender people at New York City Hall in 2018.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Drew Angerer/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Puberty blockers are widely considered to be standard care for trans adolescents and have been endorsed by every major medical association in the US, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the Endocrine Society, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.<strong> </strong></p><p>The only proven treatment for gender dysphoria, the term for a feeling of incongruence between a person&#39;s gender identity and assigned sex at birth, is transitioning. Before puberty, a child has no need for medical interventions, so a transition would be a different haircut, clothes, and maybe a new name and different pronouns.</p><p>It&#39;s not until puberty begins at around 11 or 12 that any sort of medical intervention comes into play. Puberty blockers <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/what-are-puberty-blockers-standard-treatment-transgender-youth-teenagers-2020-12\">are not permanent</a> and help trans kids put off the permanent effects of both their natal puberty, while hormone replacement therapy is typically given to older teens and triggers a puberty consistent with their gender identity. </p><p>The two step approach is meant to put off permanent body development until the person can make a more informed decision about the future. Genital surgery before age 18 is extremely rare. </p><p>&#34;We&#39;ve witnessed overall such a huge rise in the visibility of trans people in this country over the past decade,&#34; said trans historian Jules Gill-Peterson. And yet, she said, there&#39;s a common misperception that the existence of trans kids is a fairly new development. </p><p>While researching her book, &#34;Histories of the Transgender Child,&#34; Gill-Peterson found letters from trans youth to the earliest providers of hormone replacement therapy, in the 1930s, begging for help in stopping their natal pubertal development. </p><p>She realized that has long as there have been trans people, there have also been trans children. And, perhaps more importantly, as long as there has been transition-related care, trans adolescents have sought it out. </p><p>But, while the federal government has expanded access to trans medical care, conservatives on the state level have weaponized the ability of trans individuals to access care and equal rights. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s clear that right-wing politicians and an array of sort of extremist right-wing groups have been gravitating increasingly towards trans issues, taking advantage of that cultural visibility to try and turn it into a sort of wedge issue,&#34; Gill-Peterson said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/arkansas-3-anti-trans-bills-in-3-weeks-triggers-exodus-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/i3LIJIOX8pY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 16:49:45 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606de21130004b0019b2670b?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"6733aa0503e451bd992b07d974e9812d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn67@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-23-589_9b2d93271a544276.webp","destWidth":2135,"destHeight":1601,"sourceBytes":130884,"destBytes":130884,"author":"insider@insider.com (Katelyn Burns)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606de1a230004b0019b26704?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn12@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-25-489_e2744abcf3de2887.webp","https://i.insider.com/606dcccf70954f0019195a0d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn27@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-26-537_b9f0ce642cd2b2a1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-29-454_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-26-086_392b6e039d2b4b6a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn60@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-24-230_43c5e07841ec9b3a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-27-264_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i3LIJIOX8pY:Sd7kBuypmGE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn91@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-29-829_731adaddfbc54a48.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/i3LIJIOX8pY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn63@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-28-308_3806f341f27fd1f4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817067343},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","title":"Alabama is lifting its mask mandate on Friday as Governor Ivey encouraged residents to still voluntarily wear them","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/alabama-lifting-covid-19-mask-mandate-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606dd6c470954f0019195a5c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"kay ivey\" height=\"2000\" width=\"4000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Ivey is also known for signing the nation&#39;s strictest abortion ban into law.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brynn Anderson/AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Alabama Governor Kay Ivey says the state&#39;s mask mandate will end on Friday.</li>\n<li>She said people should still wear masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</li>\n<li>She called the new phase &#34;Safer Apart,&#34;

The service plans to obtain at least 144 of these fighters to replace the ageing fleet of C and D variant F-15s.</p><p>The F-15 is an exceptional fighter aircraft, having never been shot down in combat, but the average age of the F-15C/D fleet is almost 40 years old. Around 75% of the fleet is flying past its service life, and 10% of the fighters are grounded due to various structural issues.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/604f7d9287891e0019850cca?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Air Force F-15EX fighter jet\" height=\"1259\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The F-15EX, the Air Force&#39;s newest fighter aircraft, arrives to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, March 11, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Air Force/Samuel King Jr</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Though the Air Force prefers the fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters, the Pentagon determined that the fourth-generation F-15EX fighters were a much more cost-effective option for quickly modernizing the F-15 fleet to maintain capacity. The Air Force is buying both platforms as replacements for older fighters.</p><p>The new F-15EX is a two-seat aircraft, though it can be flown by a single pilot, that features fly-by-wire controls, advanced avionics, including some electronic warfare upgrades, and digital cockpit displays.</p><p>It also has an increased payload capacity, with the ability to carry up to around 30,000 pounds of air-to-air missiles and air-to-ground munitions. While the F-15 is touted as an air superiority fighter, the military has regularly used this aircraft for ground-attack missions in post-9/11 conflicts.</p><p>The Boeing fighter made its first flight on Feb. 2, 2021 with test pilot Matt Giese in the cockpit. The aircraft took off from Lambert International Airport in St. Louis, Missouri and flew for 90 minutes, <a href=\"https://boeing.mediaroom.com/news-releases-statements?item=130824\">according to the manufacturer</a>.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/604f7d9287891e0019850cc9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Air Force F-15EX fighter jet\" height=\"939\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The first F-15EX is delivered to its new home at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, March 11, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Air Force/Tech.

The aircraft has been going through developmental and operational testing on base.</p><p>Col. Sean Dorey, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Fighters and Advanced Aircraft Directorate&#39;s F-15EX program manager, called the receipt fo the first F-15EX a &#34;big moment for the Air Force.&#34;</p><p>&#34;With its large weapons capacity, digital backbone, and open architecture, the F-15EX will be a key element of our tactical fighter fleet and complement 5th-generation assets,&#34; he said. Additionally, &#34;it&#39;s capable of carrying hypersonic weapons, giving it a niche role in future near-peer conflicts.&#34;</p><p>Two F-15EX fighter aircraft are being delivered this year. The remaining six jets in the first lot will be delivered in 2023. Delivery of aircraft in lots two and three will take place in fiscal years 2024 and 2025.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

That means it starts with a minimal set of services and drivers. For example, you&#39;ll find that when in Safe Mode, your screen resolution is greatly reduced; the full video drivers are bypassed and instead, a simplified VGA driver is used regardless of the screen resolution. </p><p>Most or all networking and file sharing features are disabled in Safe Mode as well. In addition, no startup programs or third-party software is run at startup. The intention is to start the computer with the minimum configuration to give you the best chance of identifying and solving the problem you&#39;re experiencing. </p><p>Despite the limitations, you can get to all settings and control panels, uninstall software, and run most software, such as utilities and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-windows-defender-microsoft-defender-antivirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">antivirus programs</a>. </p><h2>How to start your computer in Safe Mode</h2><p>Both <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1734971899888345705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow noopener sponsored sponsored\">Windows</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F13-inch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Mac</a> have their own version of Safe Mode you can invoke if you&#39;re having a serious problem with your computer. </p><p>The method of starting Safe Mode has changed over the years with various versions of Windows. Through Windows 7, you would typically invoke Safe Mode by pressing the F8 key just as your computer starts to boot. In Windows 10, you don&#39;t have to time pressing a function key during startup. Instead, you can start Safe Mode from the Settings app - restart into Safe Mode from the Recovery section.

The developers intend to eventually move the system to a whole new way of verifying transactions, known as <a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/proof-of-stake-explained\">proof of stake</a>.</p><p>&#34;With proof of stake, you&#39;re going to be able to have... a significantly higher multiple in transactions per second, that&#39;s going to improve the utilization and the opportunities to create on Ethereum,&#34; Cuban told Unchained&#39;s Laura Shin.</p><p>The &#34;Shark Tank&#34; star said he was bullish about the Ethereum blockchain because of its numerous uses, including <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-does-nft-mean-crytpo-non-fungible-tokens-art-explained-2021-2#:~:text=Non%2Dfungible%20tokens%20account%20for,of%20Insider%20for%20more%20stories.?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestm=ingest\">non-fungible tokens</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-smart-contracts-can-work-2018-10\">smart contracts</a>, code that can create secure financial agreements without the need for third parties.</p><p>&#34;I think the applications leveraging smart contracts and extensions on Ethereum will dwarf bitcoin,&#34; he said. &#34;That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to sell my Bitcoin. I&#39;m not. But at the same time, let&#39;s just say I own a lot more Ethereums than I do bitcoins.&#34;</p><p>The Ethereum blockchain&#39;s native cryptocurrency <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/eth-usd\">ether</a> has soared in recent months to more than $2,000, and is up over 1,000% over the last year.</p><p>The network has been central to the boom in non-fungible tokens or NFTs, collectible digital assets that cannot be exchanged with one another for equal value, or broken down into smaller bits.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-vc-founder-investment-strategy-understanding-defi-for-beginners-pluto-2021-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A crypto founder breaks down how he secured $50 million in assets under management within 3 months of launching a VC firm - and shares how investors should approach understanding the DeFi space</a></em></p><p>Ethereum developers are planning to make major changes to the network to make it more efficient and predictable. The upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 will see the network more to a &#34;proof of stake&#34; system, which analysts say is quicker and more environmentally friendly, but which is likely to be painful for miners.</p><p>Cuban said the changes would add to the appeal of Ethereum relative to the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/btc-usd\">bitcoin</a> blockchain.</p><p>&#34;Bitcoin, right now, has evolved to be primarily a store value, and it&#39;s very difficult to use it for anything else,&#34; he said. &#34;You really have to work a lot harder on bitcoin than you do on ethereum.&#34;</p><p>He added: &#34;In a few years, I think Ethereum and maybe 2 or 3 other blockchains will have their place, and those will be the winners.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-cuban-praises-ethereum-network-upgrades-dwarf-bitcoin-ether-eth-2021-4'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/i01_ZFYwrRY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:43:42 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/606d96b230004b0019b265ac?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"020981884e7ef2024b3d9894bda126cb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn53@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-23-966_fce3356383de05d8.webp","destWidth":4565,"destHeight":3423,"sourceBytes":335730,"destBytes":335730,"author":"hrobertson@businessinsider.com (Harry Robertson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/606d96b730004b0019b265ad?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn80@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-28-437_5e68185ff5fd006d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn8@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-29-454_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-27-269_cbc16482b961dbe9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn36@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-29-430_3f94e97c80281c12.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-27-264_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i01_ZFYwrRY:Ed58nmxG1dI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn59@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-25-890_7aa5a64ce4c250e1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/i01_ZFYwrRY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn99@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-25-805_9ad77c3e6fdb6bc7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817067372},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:47","title":"Checking in on your friends and coworkers isn't enough - here are steps you can take at work to help fight racial discrimination","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/fight-racism-mental-health-check-ins-coworkers-2021-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606cc0fa70954f0019195825?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Stop Asian Hate Women\" height=\"2666\" width=\"3555\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A stop Asian hate rally following the violence in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Zhao Gang/Xinhua</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Diksha Kale is a criminal defense attorney who researches gender studies and criminal law.</li>\n<li>She says it&#39;s important to do more than just mental health check-ins on your friends during violent times.</li>\n<li>Take action by demanding better policies and donating to or volunteering at organizations working on the ground. </li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Recently, my friend and I were talking over the phone about <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-26/racist-attacks-inspire-asian-americans-to-fight-back\">the anti-Asian violence that has been taking place in the United States</a>. As a first-generation Filipino Canadian woman, my friend was particularly worried for elders and women in her community who are seen as <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/there-were-3-800-anti-asian-racist-incidents-mostly-against-n1261257\">easy targets for violent racist attacks</a>.</p><p>But that&#39;s not the only thing she was worried about:</p><p><em>&#34;I am dreading the messages and phone calls that are bound to come in any minute. The mental health check-ins, asking me if I am OK after what happened in Atlanta. I mean the violence did affect me as a person, but it did not affect me personally.&#34;</em></p><p>She went on to explain how her coworker, who happened to be a Black Canadian woman, had received similar check-in messages and calls after what happened to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\">Breonna Taylor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52861726\">George Floyd</a>.</p><p>People who she had gone to school with, people she had not talked to in years were sending messages asking if she was OK. And while <a href=\"https://idontmind.com/journal/just-checking-in-ten-minutes-ten-questions\">we both agree that mental health check-ins are important</a>, there have to be other things people can do to be responsible citizens.</p><p>As a researcher engaged in work related to gender studies and criminal law, with an interest in governance and regulation, I wonder how mental health discourses are employed in the aftermath of racist violence.</p><h2>An exercise in governmentality</h2><p>These mental health check-ins are an exercise in <a href=\"https://criticallegalthinking.com/2014/12/02/governmentality-notes-thought-michel-foucault/\">governmentality</a>. Governmentality is what French philosopher <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Foucault-Effect%3A-Studies-in-Governmentality-Burchell-Gordon/c2322f53910e4fb9eba57a6c2232fc0f493edae5?p2df\">Michel Foucault compared to the &#34;art of government&#34;</a>: it acknowledges that governance is not limited to the acts or decisions of a government alone, and that as a population, we govern each other as well.</p><p>An example of governmentality can be something as mundane as a professional dress code. If you were to show up at a formal event wearing ripped jeans and a tank top, other guests would likely give you a disapproving look. And while you have not broken the law, you have broken some code of conduct. It would not come as a surprise if you were asked to change into formal wear and come back.</p><p>There are three things that happened in the above example: there are rules you must follow; if you don&#39;t follow the rules, you have done something wrong; the people who follow the rules are keeping you in line by ensuring you do as they do.</p><p>These elements can be applied to mental health check-ins as well.</p><h2>Governmentality and mental health check-ins</h2><p>As a South Asian woman, I can put myself in the shoes of a well-meaning ally and check in on my friends. I have seen the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-03-17/atlanta-shooting-stop-asian-hate-celebrity-reactions\">numerous posts on social media</a> about how we <em>must</em> do mental health check-ins.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">-Lana Condor  (@lanacondor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1372063887554539524?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2021</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>So I listen, scroll through my contacts, friend lists and send <em>the</em> text:</p><p><em>&#34;Hey, I heard about what happened in Atlanta. I am so sorry. If you need to talk to someone about it, I&#39;m here, OK?&#34;</em></p><p>My work as a good ally is done, I go about my day with a sense of accomplishment - but should I?</p><p>This is governance. We do what we tell each other we are <em>supposed</em> to do. And this is where most people think their work as a good ally and responsible citizen is over, but it isn&#39;t.</p><h2>Striking a balance between mental health and justice</h2><p>The US, like many colonial-era countries, has a long <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/03/a-long-history-of-bigotry-against-asian-americans/\">history of racial violence against Asian people</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/politicians-businesses-advocates-speak-out-virtual-stopasianhate-day-n1262193\">#StopAsianHate movement</a> is about more than a mass shooting; it is about demanding accountability in the face of white supremacy and hatred.</p><p>Thanks to political leaders like former US president Donald Trump, who <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/trumps-chinese-virus-tweet-helped-lead-rise-racist/story?id=76530148\">racialized COVID-19</a>, Asian people have been attacked, abused, and murdered. The <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2021/03/22/objectifying-asian-women-racism\">objectification of Asian women</a> in entertainment media has also contributed to the anti-Asian violence we&#39;re witnessing today.</p><p>Studies suggest that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/713667453\">poor mental health among racial minorities is closely linked with their negative experiences related to racism</a>. Saying that we need to talk about mental health without addressing systemic racism and white supremacy is futile.</p><h2>Check in and demand better</h2><p>So what can one do if mental health check-ins are not enough?</p><p>Agitate and demand better policies. Facilitate healing for Asian communities without interjecting yourself in the process. Donate to, or volunteer with <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a35862857/stop-asian-hate-organizations-to-support/\">organizations that are working on the ground</a> to help those affected.</p><p>Keeping in mind that you can always do more, do check in with your Asian friends. Because mental health is important, and so is justice.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag. Please DO NOT REMOVE. --><!-- End of code.

rel=\"noopener\">modem</a> and your <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/router\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">router</a> may be similar in appearance, but they have distinct roles when it comes to delivering you an internet connection.</p><p>Even if you aren&#39;t running your own server, it&#39;s a good idea to have a basic grasp of how these two pieces of hardware work in tandem to deliver your internet. That way, you&#39;ll have an easier time determining the best router and modem setup for your local network, and troubleshooting any internet-related issues that may arise.</p><p>Here&#39;s a brief explainer on what you should know about your modem and router to keep them running optimally.</p><h2>Modem vs. router</h2><p>The essential difference between a modem and a router is that a modem connects you to the internet as a whole while the router manages and routes the internet to your devices.</p><h3>A modem is your gateway to internet access</h3><p>The modem authenticates and connects you to your chosen internet service provider (ISP), which might be a local provider or a national company like AT&#38;T or Comcast.</p><p>Generally, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077BL65HS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bitht_040521_modem-vs-router-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B077BL65HS&linkId=6b262ed1786ec83939cebf5dfee47320786ec83939cebf5dfee47320\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">modem</a> is black, with an appearance similar to a gaming console - flashing lights and a sleek, compact design. They can be as small as a smartphone or as large as a box of cereal. </p><p>The main thing you&#39;ll be concerned with as far as your modem though is its reliability and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-fast-is-my-internet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">speed connecting to the internet</a>.</p><p>Even if you have the newest, fastest type of modem, factors beyond your control can impact its connection. For instance, old or damaged cable lines that connect your modem to the ISP can cause slower speeds. But that&#39;s something your ISP is on the hook to fix, not you.</p><p>Another issue that can impact modem connectivity is provider availability. For instance, if you don&#39;t have access to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fiber-optic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fiber internet</a> or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-5g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5G</a>, it won&#39;t matter that your modem is top-notch. The modem will still be limited in its speed, and depending on the type of modem, may not even work at all.</p><p>There are also two important acronyms to know related to your modem: the ISP and IP address.</p><p>Your ISP, or internet service provider, is the company you&#39;re likely paying to get internet service. Your modem would be a hunk of useless hardware without the ISP to communicate with it.</p><p>If you&#39;ve ever received a copyright-related correspondence from your ISP, that&#39;s because of your ISP&#39;s knowledge of your computer&#39;s IP address: The ISP, using the modem, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-find-ip-address-of-router\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">assigns an IP address to your device</a> when you connect to the network.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YMFZ28Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_091217_best-routers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07YMFZ28Q&linkId=1bbcb4506129d21511f7bec84474faa46129d21511f7bec84474faa4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Routers</a> give multiple devices access to the internet </h3><p>A router will look similar to the modem: generally boxy and black, though some will have antennas to help broadcast a Wi-Fi signal. </p><p>In fact, both the router and modem might even be occupying the same piece of hardware. Yet they are still distinct devices with distinct functions.</p><p>While the modem provides the essential pipeline to the larger internet, the router acts as a sort of bouncer, manager, and traffic director for your local network. The router is a secure check point that routes internet to your devices as they simultaneously use the internet. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/606b5678856cd700198a3340?format=jpeg\" alt=\"internet modem and router\" height=\"1662\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Your modem and router work together to connect you to the internet through your internet service provider, or ISP.\n<p class=\"copyright\">bedo/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>One big factor that may affect the router&#39;s connectivity is if your device is wired or wireless. Wireless networks tend to suffer from disruptions related to the proximity between your devices and the router. </p><p>A few of the most ubiquitous router brands are Netgear and Linksys. Whichever brand you elect to use, your router will be the brains behind your local area network (LAN), routing all the traffic and assigning local IP addresses to any device that&#39;s using your internet.</p><h3>Modems and routers can be stored in one device</h3><p>Sometimes, you&#39;ll see one piece of hardware that houses both the modem and the router. If that&#39;s the case, the hardware is usually provided by your ISP. </p><p>There are some benefits to the two-in-one model. For starters, it&#39;s more compact and easier to set up for novice users.</p><p>However, the benefits of two separate components have an advantage over the convenience of a combo system. With a separate router and modem, there&#39;s more opportunity for hardware upgrades, and also better access to network ports, which are particularly handy if you want to hardwire your connection with an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethernet cable</a>.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/603fd38fb46d720018b04a17?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ethernet cable connected to laptop internet\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Connecting to the internet via an Ethernet cable will typically give you a faster connection than Wi-Fi.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chalongrat Chuvaree / EyeEm/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Having your router be separate from your modem also allows you to locate the router in its most ideal location for optimal wireless coverage. </p><p>And technically you don&#39;t even have to have a router - you can bypass a router in favor of plugging directly into the modem with an Ethernet cable. However, the practice would be more inconvenient than Wi-Fi. </p><h2>A mesh network doesn&#39;t replace the need for a router and modem</h2><p>You may have also heard of a &#34;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-mesh-wifi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mesh network</a>&#34; when looking into how to best wire your home.</p><p>However, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNY2WKG/ref=as_li_tl?ots=1&slotNum=5&imprToken=18bc51db-4079-8b8a-579&ie=UTF8&tag=biipgf_091217_best-routers-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07WNY2WKG&linkId=098ca6304d4f187fff1b60e34f8640f0kId=098ca6304d4f187fff1b60e34f8640f0\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">mesh network</a> is not to be confused with being a total substitute for a modem-router connection. Instead, a mesh network is a way to extend the reach of your wireless router. </p><p>Even with a device like the Google Wi-Fi system, which essentially does replace the traditional router in favor of mesh, you&#39;ll still ultimately need an ISP and a modem.</p><h2>Buying your own modem and router might be worth it </h2><p>There are a few factors to consider when it comes to whether or not to buy your own router and modem hardware, or &#34;rent&#34; the hardware from your ISP - and often, it is a rental agreement and not an outright purchase.</p><p>Obviously, you may save money over time by investing in your own hardware. However, there&#39;s no guarantee that the available internet service providers will be compatible with the hardware you own.</p><p>On the other hand, renting the modem and/or router means an additional monthly fee, and you also have the hassle of returning the hardware when your contract with the ISP ends.</p><h2>Ways to troubleshoot problems with the modem or router</h2><p>The most common catch-all fix for a range of modem issues, like glitches in the modem&#39;s firmware or other software malfunctions, is &#34;power cycling&#34; - which means turning your modem off and on again. The same fix applies to the router.</p><p>The next best <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-isnt-my-internet-working\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">troubleshooting method</a> is checking the cables. You&#39;ll want to make sure the Ethernet cable and power adapters are properly connected. </p><p>Other troubleshooting methods include repositioning your router to eliminate dead Wi-Fi spots in your residence, updating your firmware, and changing your <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-network-security-key\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">network security key</a> in case your connection has been accessed by someone else. </p><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"small\" data-pid=\"606b77b23d35010018fe113e\" data-purchase-option=\"\">MB7621 Modem (small)</bi-shortcode><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"small\" data-pid=\"604be9a3eeecfe0012687ca9\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Archer AX50 (small)</bi-shortcode><bi-shortcode id=\"commerce-link\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-cardtype=\"small\" data-pid=\"5f5149bf253b70016c675af8\" data-purchase-option=\"\">Orbi AX6000 Tri-band Mesh WiFi 6 System (2-Pack) (small)</bi-shortcode><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module-end-of-article\" class=\"mceNonEditable\"><a data-type=\"603fce25fec9aa70ba417682\" data-title=\"Is Ethernet faster than Wi-Fi?

He also claims that the Justice Department&#39;s investigation into him is part of an elaborate, multimillion dollar extortion scheme against his family.</p><p>The former president&#39;s statement Wednesday came more than a week after news of the Gaetz sex probe first broke, and as much of the Republican establishment stays mum on the matter. The Daily Beast reported that Trump had, until now, refrained from commenting on the allegations against Gaetz according to the advice of his lawyers.</p><p>Few people, if any, from within Trump&#39;s

circles, and more about the fact that he hasn&#39;t done a single thing to make people comfortable to defend him,&#34; a Trump confidant told Politico, adding that Gaetz&#39;s interview with Fox

\n</ul>\n<p>When JPMorgan Chase employees return to the office, it's likely to look a lot more empty than it did before the pandemic.</p>\n<p>That's because America's largest bank is making drastic changes to its office layout and capacity, CEO Jamie Dimon said <a href=\"https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/investor-relations/2020/ar-ceo-letters.htm\">in his annual letter</a>. </p>\n<p>\"We will quickly move to a more 'open seating' arrangement, in which digital tools will help manage seating arrangements, as well as needed amenities, such as conference room space,\" Dimon said. \"As a result, for every 100 employees, we may need seats for only 60 on average.\"</p>\n<p>As a result, the banking giant is expecting a major reduction in required office real estate (though it remains committed to a new Manhattan headquarters that's in the works for <a

tech talent exodus: How Goldman Sachs' Marcus is struggling to live up to its lofty consumer banking ambitions</a></em></p>\n<p>That doesn't mean the company is embracing remote work in the long term: Just 10% of the bank's roughly 250,000 worldwide employees are expected to work remote on a full-time basis, Dimon said.</p>\n<p>Most employees will still work in an office or banking branch location on a full time basis, with some employees \"working under a hybrid model\" - a mix of remote and in-office work.</p>\n<p>Dimon highlighted the struggles his company has faced across the last year with so many employees working remote: From difficulty onboarding new employees to a lack of \"spontaneous learning and creativity\" that comes from interacting with other people in person.</p>\n<p>JPMorgan was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-jpmorgan-employees-work-from-home-contingency-plan-test-report-2020-3\">among the first companies to test remote work</a> as reports of coronavirus spreading in the US began in early 2020. The company initially sent home just 10% of its workforce before the onset of the pandemic forced companies and schools to go fully remote.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Got a tip?</strong> Contact Insider senior correspondent Ben Gilbert via email (<a href=\"mailto:bgilbert@insider.com\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">bgilbert@insider.com</a>),</em><em> or Twitter DM (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealBenGilbert\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">@realbengilbert</a>).
