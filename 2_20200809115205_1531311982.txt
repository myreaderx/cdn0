But an investigation by one Taiwanese security firm has revealed just how deeply a single group of Chinese hackers was able to penetrate an industry at the core of the Taiwanese economy, pillaging practically its entire semiconductor industry.</p>\n<p>At the Black Hat security conference today, researchers from the Taiwanese cybersecurity firm CyCraft plan to present new details of a hacking campaign that compromised at least seven Taiwanese chip firms over the past two years. The series of deep intrusions—called Operation Skeleton Key due to the attackers' use of a \"skeleton key injector\" technique—appeared aimed at stealing as much intellectual property as possible, including source code, software development kits, and chip designs. And while CyCraft has previously given this group of hackers the name Chimera, the company's new findings include evidence that ties them to mainland China and loosely links them to the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/barium-supply-chain-hackers/\">notorious Chinese state-sponsored hacker group Winnti, also sometimes known as Barium, or Axiom</a>.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697573#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1697573&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gqnr9kQYWCE:xnFHTVXx0GY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gqnr9kQYWCE:xnFHTVXx0GY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gqnr9kQYWCE:xnFHTVXx0GY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gqnr9kQYWCE:xnFHTVXx0GY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gqnr9kQYWCE:xnFHTVXx0GY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gqnr9kQYWCE:xnFHTVXx0GY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 10:56:27 +0000","feedId":2,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/security_semiconductor_1188397346-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"65b8eb79040160ca7d060705f49a568b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn3@2020_5/2020-08-09/1596973874282_fc3b015809dbee62.webp","author":"WIRED","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/security_semiconductor_1188397346-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn3@2020_5/2020-08-09/1596973874282_fc3b015809dbee62.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gqnr9kQYWCE:xnFHTVXx0GY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn11@2020_1/2020-08-09/1596973909451_2a9f67c9324a6a67.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gqnr9kQYWCE:xnFHTVXx0GY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn19@2020_6/2020-08-09/1596973892111_3452ae0819077445.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_1/2020-08-09/1596973900376_24b37a558f772a43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_6/2020-08-09/1596973890060_f9fb6170e557e50a.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-09 19:50:57","updatedTime":"2020-08-09 19:50:57","feedId":2,"fetchDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 11:50:57 +0000","fetchMs":28,"handleMs":1192,"totalMs":54874,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"52.214.171.64","hostName":"europe-001.herokuapp.com","requestId":"01f0444516c844daaeb37759fee10b00_2","bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":5,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":5},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-09 15:33:22","id":2,"name":"Ars Technica","url":"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn5@2020_3/2020-08-09/1596973856507_5d81b97433efbdc7.png","description":"Serving the Technologist for more than a decade.
