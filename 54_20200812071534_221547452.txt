Hold on -- let me just click around the internet like a maniac to find something for the morning tweet.\"&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sound familiar? Scrambling for social content is nothing new. We have meetings. We run late. Things come up. And it's really hard to get any meaningful amount of work done when you have the next social media update looming over your head every 30, 60, or 90 minutes.&nbsp;It all&nbsp;moves so fast that you might periodically feel a case of the vapors coming on, which is why pre-scheduled social media content should be your new best friend.<strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p>To make social media content easier for companies to plan and schedule across the accounts they manage, we created a <strong><a title=\"templated schedule\" href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\">social&nbsp;media&nbsp;content calendar template</a></strong><a title=\"templated schedule\" href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\"></a>.

However, in this one, you'll find a general schedule tab, your monthly planning calendar, a repository for website content, and updates for each of the top social media platforms:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#twitter\">Twitter</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#facebook\">Facebook</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#linkedin\">LinkedIn</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#instagram\">Instagram</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33415/the-social-media-publishing-schedule-every-marketer-needs-template.aspx#pinterest\">Pinterest</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>This blog post will walk you through exactly how to use the template to stay on top of your social media content planning for each one.</p> \n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> HubSpot customers can also schedule content through <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/social-inbox\">Social Inbox</a>, or use this spreadsheet to organize their content and subsequently upload it to Social Inbox. Detailed instructions for doing this exist in <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\">the cover sheet of the template</a>.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<h2>How to Use the Social Media&nbsp;Calendar Template to Plan Your&nbsp;Content Schedule</h2> \n<p>When&nbsp;you <a title=\"open up the social media publishing template\" href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar\">open up the social media content calendar&nbsp;template</a>, you'll notice the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet has several different tabs, most of which are dedicated to a specific social network.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-calendar-excel-tabs.jpg?width=1362&amp;name=content-calendar-excel-tabs.jpg\" alt=\"content calendar excel tabs: schedule, monthly planning calendar, content repository, twitter updates, facebook updates, linkedin updates, instagram updates, pinterest updates\" width=\"1362\" style=\"width: 1362px;\" /></p> \n<p>The reason you'll want a different worksheet for every social network is simply that every social network is a little bit different.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-perfect-social-media-posts-slideshare\">You can't just craft one, single social media update</a> and use it across LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest.</p> \n<p>You can certainly promote the same piece of content across those networks, but that doesn't mean you'll craft your update in the same way for every single one of them. (In fact, you may even want to add additional tabs if you're active on other networks, like Quora or YouTube.)</p> \n<p>This following sub-sections will walk you through how to fill out each of the tabs you see in this template -- the updates for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Pinterest. But before we get to that, let's just walk through the \"Monthly Planning Calendar\" so you know what that's for.</p> \n<h3>Monthly Social Media&nbsp;Schedule&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>The tab \"Monthly Planning Calendar\" provides an overall snapshot of your monthly social media campaigns. It'll help you coordinate better with other stakeholders, not to mention keep all the moving parts straight in your own mind. Here's what it looks like:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-month-view.png?width=669&amp;height=388&amp;name=social-media-calendar-month-view.png\" title=\"social-media-calendar-month-view.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"388\" alt=\"social media content calendar month view with colored cells for each content type\" /></p> \n<p>There are three sections to take note of when you edit this template for your own purposes. First, the color-coding key: These are the types of content or campaigns around which you might coordinate, like ebooks, webinars, blog posts, product launches, and so on. Though only some of these might be relevant to you, they're there to indicate what you may want to put in there -- so be sure to edit these categories to align with your own campaigns.</p> \n<p>The other two sections you'll need to edit are the Month and Year at the top of the calendar (duh), as well as the cells below each day of the week. In those cells, you should&nbsp;enter&nbsp;the type of content you'll be promoting that day and color-code it to align with the campaign it's supporting.</p> \n<p>Instead of deleting all the content in this spreadsheet each month, I recommend copying this worksheet twelve times over, and creating a separate sheet for each month. (If that gets to be too overwhelming, you can always save those tabs as a separate file.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Twitter Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>Alright, now let's get to the social media content. This section will be the lengthiest, because all subsequent sections will draw on the instructions we go through here. So if you read one section in this whole post, make it&nbsp;this one.</p> \n<p>Let's say you want to add some tweets&nbsp;to your scheduling template.&nbsp;Skip over to the \"Twitter Updates\" tab, where you'll see this:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=296&amp;name=social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Twitter content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-twitter-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"296\" /></p> \n<p>The first four columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" \"Time,\" and \"Date &amp; Time\" are there for your convenience, and if you choose to use a third-party app for pre-scheduling your tweets (like <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/social-inbox\">HubSpot's Social Inbox</a>), then these columns will be useful.&nbsp;For now, just fill in the date on which you'd like your updates to publish to Twitter, and the time at which you'd like them to go out. The \"Date &amp; Time\" column will automatically change based on what you input in the previous two columns.</p> \n<p>Now, let's move over to the \"Message\" column. Here,&nbsp;input the copy you'd like to appear in your tweet, bearing in mind you should<strong>&nbsp;cap it at 116 characters to allow enough room for a link, and at 115 characters to allow room for an image.</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/character-limit-social-media-blog-posts\">Read this blog post for a full character count guide</a>.) This spreadsheet will auto-calculate the number of characters you've entered to keep you on-point, turning yellow when you've reached 95 characters, and red when you've reached 116 characters.</p> \n<p>After you've composed your tweet, paste the URL you'd like to include in your tweet in the \"Link\" column. Be sure to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">include UTM parameters</a>&nbsp;so&nbsp;you'll know whether all of these tweets are actually driving traffic, leads, and customers. This is an important step to remember if you'd like to be able to demonstrate ROI from social. You can also use the \"Campaign\" column to add an associated campaign, which helps which more robust tracking and reporting.</p> \n<p>Finally, in the \"Image\" column, attach the tweet's image (if you have one). For Twitter, we recommend images that are 1024&nbsp;x 512 pixels. (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">Click here for a full cheat sheet of social media image sizes</a>.) If you're having trouble attaching your image to the spreadsheet, follow these steps:</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right-click the cell in which you'd like your image.</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click \"Hyperlink,\" then click the \"Document\" button, and finally, click \"Select\" to choose your image.</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the \"Choose a File\" window, select the image from your computer and click \"Open.\"</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Step 4:</strong> You'll now see the image attached to the \"Insert Hyperlink\" screen. Feel free to edit the \"Display\" text to change the file name, then click \"OK.\"</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This process is simply for organizational purposes. If you decide to upload the spreadsheet to your social media publishing&nbsp;software, it will not attach -- you'll have to do that with your marketing software. If you're a HubSpot customer, details for <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social-media-user-guide-v2/how-to-upload-social-media-messages-in-bulk-for-schedule-publishing\">how to bulk upload your Twitter content to Social Inbox</a> can be found within the downloaded template.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Facebook Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>Now, let's talk about how to plan your <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/facebook-marketing\">Facebook marketing</a>&nbsp;in advance with the template. Navigate on over to the tab&nbsp;in your template labeled \"Facebook Updates.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=304&amp;name=social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Facebook content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-facebook-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"304\" /></p> \n<p>Facebook updates work similarly to Twitter updates, with the exception being bulk uploading your content is not possible in Social Inbox.</p> \n<p>The first three columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" and \"Time\" are there for your convenience. Head on over to the column labeled \"Message\" and input&nbsp;the copy you'd like to appear in your status update, corresponding to the days and times you'd like those updates to run.&nbsp;Then, move to the \"Link\" column and input the link you'll be, you know, linking to in the update. (Don't forget <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">that tracking token</a>.) If you'd like the update to be tagged to a certain campaign, include this in the \"Campaigns\" column. Finally, attach an image just like you did with your Twitter updates -- if you're using one, we suggest you edit it to be 1200 x 900 pixels.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">Click here for a full cheat sheet of social media image sizes</a>.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your LinkedIn Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>LinkedIn updates are the most unique, because you have both Company Pages and Groups to consider. To demonstrate the difference between Company Page updates and Group updates, let's navigate over to the column labeled \"Title (For Group Discussions Only).\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=227&amp;name=social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for LinkedIn content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-linkedin-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"227\" /></p> \n<p>LinkedIn Groups let you post a few kinds of updates, one of which is called a \"Discussion.\" You will only fill out the \"Title (For Group Discussions Only)\" column if you're looking to post a Discussion to your LinkedIn Group -- because Discussions are the only update you'll be posting that requires a title. If you're not posting a Discussion to a LinkedIn Group, you don't need to fill out this field, because your update will not have a title.</p> \n<p>You'll fill out the next column, \"Message,\" for every type of update you post, whether it's for a Company Page or a Group. Simply input your copy into this column, and then navigate to the next two columns, \"Link\" and \"Campaign\" to input the URL to which you're directing readers with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">the tracking token</a> you'll use to track&nbsp;activity, and the associated campaign if one exists. If you'd like to use an image for an update, attach it per the instructions laid out in the \"Twitter\" section. We recommend editing the image to 700 x 520 pixels.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Instagram Posting Calendar</h3> \n<p>Now, let's move on to&nbsp;how to set up your Instagram&nbsp;photos and videos&nbsp;in advance with the template. Navigate on over to the tab&nbsp;in your template labeled \"Instagram&nbsp;Updates.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=187&amp;name=social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Instagram content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-instagram-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"187\" /></p> \n<p>Instagram&nbsp;updates work similarly to Facebook&nbsp;updates, in that content can't be uploaded in bulk to&nbsp;Social Inbox&nbsp;like it can with Twitter.</p> \n<p>The first three columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" and \"Time\" are there for your convenience. Head on over to the column labeled \"Message,\" and input&nbsp;the copy you'd like to appear in your post's caption, corresponding to the days and times you'd like those updates to run. Keep in mind that although Instagram captions can be up to&nbsp;2,200 characters long, they&nbsp;cut off in users' feeds after three lines of text. The exact length of these three lines depends on the length of your Instagram handle.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/character-limit-social-media-blog-posts\">Read this blog post for a full character count guide</a>.)</p> \n<p>Next, move to the \"Link for Bio\" column and input whichever link you plan to put in the bio when you publish the accompanying Instagram post. (The reason you'd put a link in your bio and not the photo caption itself is because clickable URLs aren't allowed anywhere except the single \"website\" box in your bio.) Oh, and&nbsp;don't forget <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">that tracking token</a>.</p> \n<p>If you'd like the update to be tagged to a certain campaign, include this in the \"Campaigns\" column. Finally, attach an image just like you did with your other social media&nbsp;updates -- we suggest you edit it to be 1080 pixels x 1080 pixels.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-guide-social-media-image-dimensions-infographic\">Click here for a full cheat sheet of social media image sizes</a>.)</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Pinterest Content Calendar</h3> \n<p>Alright, now let's go over&nbsp;how to set up your Pinterest pins&nbsp;in advance with the template. Navigate on over to the tab&nbsp;in your template labeled \"Pinterest Updates.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png?width=669&amp;height=246&amp;name=social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png\" alt=\"Social media calendar template for Pinterest content\" title=\"social-media-calendar-pinterest-updates.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"246\" /></p> \n<p>Pinterest&nbsp;updates work similarly to Facebook and Instagram updates, in that content can't be uploaded in bulk to&nbsp;Social Inbox&nbsp;like it can with Twitter.</p> \n<p>The first three columns, \"Day,\" \"Date,\" and \"Time\" are there for your convenience. Go to&nbsp;the column labeled \"Message,\" and input&nbsp;the copy you'd like to appear in your pin's description, corresponding to the days and times you'd like those updates to run. Then, move to the \"Link\" column and input the link you'll be, you know, linking to in the update. (Don't forget <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">that tracking token</a>.)</p> \n<p>If you'd like the update to be tagged to a certain campaign, include this in the \"Campaigns\" column. Finally, attach an image like you did with your other social media&nbsp;updates -- we suggest you edit it to be&nbsp;735 pixels x 1102 pixels.</p> \n<h3>Content Repository (Or, Where to Source Social Media Content)<strong><br /></strong></h3> \n<p>This template also provides you with a tab&nbsp;called \"Content Repository,\" which should help you keep track of all your content and maintain a healthy backlog of fodder&nbsp;to make sourcing social media content easier.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/social-media-calendar-content-repository.png?width=669&amp;height=146&amp;name=social-media-calendar-content-repository.png\" alt=\"social media content calendar's content repository\" title=\"social-media-calendar-content-repository.png\" width=\"669\" height=\"146\" /></p> \n<p>As you create more assets, you'll likely want to resurface and re-promote those pieces down the line, too.&nbsp;To ensure you don't lose track of all of that content, record it on this tab so you're never at a loss for what to publish on social. If the content you're promoting isn't evergreen, be sure to include an expiration date in the column marked \"Expiration\" so you don't promote it when it's&nbsp;jumped the shark.</p> \n<p>This tab will also help&nbsp;you maintain&nbsp;a healthy balance of content: A mix of your own content and others', a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-social-media-popularity\">mix of content formats and types</a>, and mix of lead generation content vs. MQL-generating content vs. traffic-friendly content.</p> \n<h2>Don't Forget to Interact With Your Followers</h2> \n<p>Whether you use this spreadsheet to plan your content out in advance or upload to a third-party app, you'll still need to supplement these updates with one the fly content. Breaking news hits? Whip up a quick update to share it with your network. Someone in your network tweets something interesting? Give it <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/27675/How-to-Retweet-the-Right-Way-in-4-Easy-Steps.aspx\">a retweet with some commentary</a>. Got a fascinating comment on one of your updates? Respond with a \"thank you\" for their interaction or an additional follow-up comment.</p> \n<p>Coming up with and scheduling your social media content in advance is a huge time-saver, but it should go without saying that you still need to monitor and add to your social presence throughout the day.</p> \n<p>Finally, we encourage you to experiment with your social media publishing.

This kicks off their buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg?width=600&amp;name=buyers-journey-3-stages.jpg\" alt=\"buyer's journey showing progression through the awareness stage, consideration stage, and decision stage\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When you don't have a complete understanding your audience, a disconnect is created between your business and your potential customers. For content marketers, this usually means you're putting out content that your readers don't really relate with, which can cause you to lose them.</p> \n<p>As is the case in all marketing disciplines, it’s <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">important to understand your audience</a>:&nbsp;how they think, the answers they seek, and the path they tend to take to find a solution. From that research, you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\">begin crafting a documented content strategy</a> that maps your content to the various stages of the buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>Developing the buyer’s journey for your business is the first step to creating content that resonates with your buyer and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33711/The-Steps-You-Need-to-Define-the-Stages-of-Your-Sales-Marketing-Funnel.aspx?&amp;_ga=2.183949606.1430126461.1594683485-303082430.1584047107#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">building out your marketing funnel</a> so that you can meet them at each stage of their journey.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What Is a Marketing Funnel?&nbsp;</h2> \n<p>A marketing funnel — more commonly known as a sales funnel since its output is revenue — describes the different stages a customer goes through leading up to their purchase, from looking at your website for the first time and subscribing to your email list to reading your emails and talking to a sales associate.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-engage-delight.jpg?width=787&amp;name=attract-engage-delight.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of marketing funnel with marketing at the top, sales in the middle, and customers at the end. Also shows corresponds to the attract, engage, and delight strategy.\" width=\"787\" style=\"width: 787px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>How the funnel works is simple. The top of the funnel indicates they are further away from a purchasing decision while those who make it to the bottom of the funnel are closer to a purchasing decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Often, it’s a marketer’s job to <strong>attract</strong> your buyer persona in the early stages of their journey and hand off qualified prospects to the sales team to <strong>engage</strong> them. Once they become a customer, your service team <strong>delights</strong> them so that they buy from you again and again and tell all their friends.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The funnel is a useful tool when used in the context of the buyer’s journey. However, keep in mind that the funnel has one issue: It puts customers as the output. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QC2SHjBiag\">INBOUND 18</a>, HubSpot officially <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/our-flywheel\">retires the funnel in favor of the flywheel</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif?width=450&amp;name=Funnel-To-Flywheel-Morph.gif\" alt=\"an animation of the funnel morphing into a flywheel, a circle with marketing, sales, and service surrounded by growth (or customers) at the center\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">The result puts customers at the center, which creates a more unified and less linear approach to all your marketing, sales, and service activities.</img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif?width=400&amp;name=Flywheel-Continuous-Spin.gif\" alt=\"flywheel with attract, engage, and delight, spinning and feeding into each other as it shows strangers becoming prospects, customers, and promoters\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<h3>Marketing Funnel Stages</h3> \n<p>Even so, the funnel is still a good starting point before you begin moving to your flywheel strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>All you have to do take the buyer’s journey and ask the question: “How do we attract and engage this person so they become a customer?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whether you subscribe to the funnel or the flywheel methodology, earning business from your prospects comes down to three simple things:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Attracting strangers</li> \n <li>Engaging prospects</li> \n <li>Delighting customers</li> \n</ul> \n<p>As you create create content that performs these functions, you'll consider the stage they're at in their journey and the best channels to put the content in front of them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The internet has made it easier for marketers (and salespeople) to engage customers at the various stages of their journey&nbsp;using content marketing.&nbsp;That’s one of the main reasons that<strong><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\"> 60% of marketers</a> consider content as 'very important' or 'extremely important' to their overall strategy.</strong></p> \n<p>However, it can be challenging to create the right content, for the right people, at the right time.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Channels for Each Stage of the Funnel</h2> \n<p>Building a content strategy starts with identifying the channels in which you’ll reach your audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=marketing-channels-per-stage.jpg\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"marketing channels for each stage of your strategy: attract, engage, delight\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Attract Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/attract-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=attract-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Attract Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you use your expertise to create content and conversations that start meaningful relationships with the right people.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Remember, a large majority of your prospects may even be in the awareness stage of their buyer’s journey when you begin to attract them. That means your goal is to solve for their pains/problems by creating content they can easily discover and consume.</img></p> \n<p>At this point, a buyer is trying to solve problems, get an answer, or meet a need. They’re looking for top-level educational content to help direct them to a solution, like blog posts, social content, and ebooks.&nbsp;Their&nbsp;value as a lead is low because there’s no guarantee that they’ll buy from you. But those who find your content helpful and interesting may journey on to the middle of the funnel.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your attract stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Blogging</li> \n <li>Search Engine Marketing</li> \n <li>Social Media Marketing</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Engage Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/engage-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=engage-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Engage Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you build lasting relationships with people by providing insights and solutions that align with their pain points and goals\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>When someone moves into the middle of your funnel, it means you’ve captured their attention. They know they have a problem that has to be solved, and now they’re trying to discover the best solution. The need for a future purchase commitment creeps up as they’re evaluation their options.</p> \n<p>While the top of the funnel is designed to educate a prospect, this is the stage where you want to show why your solutions in particular are the best fit.</p> \n<p>(You also want to help people determine if they're <em>not&nbsp;</em>a good fit, which will be very important later for healthy customer retention. If you convince customers to buy who aren't a good fit for your business in the long run, you could be shooting yourself in the foot in the form of high churn rate later.)</p> \n<p>The middle of the funnel is typically a point of extended engagement where you’re nurturing a lead, building a relationship, and establishing trust between the audience and your brand.</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your engage stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Social Media</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You also need to engage prospects at the bottom of your funnel.</p> \n<p>The bottom of the funnel is where someone is making the actual purchase decision. They're ready to&nbsp;buy, but that&nbsp;still doesn’t guarantee that they’re going to buy from <em>you.</em> That’s the last choice they have to make: Where do they get the solution they’re seeking?</p> \n<p>In most cases, leads at the bottom of your funnel just need that final nudge and that compelling call-to-action to get them to make a purchase decision. The right offer and content at this stage can have a dramatic impact on lifting your conversions.</p> \n<p>You might also consider sales outreach to engage qualified prospects and continue to engage them through personalization and contextual marketing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Channels for the Delight Stage</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/delight-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=delight-stage.jpg\" alt=\"Delight Stage: The stage of the inbound methodology where you provide an outstanding experience that adds real value, and empowers people to reach their goals and become promoters of your company.\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Marketing shouldn’t stop once someone becomes a customer. Cultivating a relationship with your customer beyond the sale can lead to higher customer lifetime value as well as word-of-mouth referrals and more.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The key here is to go above and beyond their expectations and provide a customer experience that’s easy and frictionless.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ideal channels for your delight stage may include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Email Marketing</li> \n <li>Retargeting/Remarketing</li> \n <li>Self-Service Channels Such as Knowledge Bases</li> \n <li>Live Chat and Chatbots for Service</li> \n <li>Loyalty Programs</li> \n</ul> \n<p>On the surface, this process seems really linear, but you can also target multiple stages of the buyer’s journey across channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For example, you may still be able to attract someone in the consideration stage or delight someone who isn’t a customer yet. Your knowledge base might convince someone in the consideration stage to buy since they perceive that you have great service, or someone in the awareness stage could engage your chatbot to find the content they need.</p> \n<p>One of the joys of content marketing is thinking outside the box.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Creating Content for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Once you have an idea of who your buyer persona is and what channels will work best for your business, you can begin creating content for your buyer at different stages and tailor that content per channel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Doing so can help you <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/customer-journey-map-template\">map your content to the relevant stages of the buyer’s journey</a> to make your funnel.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Top of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"awareness\" stage, where people looking for answers, resources, education, research data, opinions, and insight.</li> \n <li><strong>Middle of the Funnel:&nbsp;</strong>The \"evaluation\" stage, where people are doing heavy research on whether or not your product or service is a good fit for them.</li> \n <li><strong>Bottom of the Funnel:</strong>&nbsp;The \"purchase\" stage, where people are figuring out exactly what it would take to become a customer.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Your funnel may look very different depending on factors like your industry, business model, product, pricing, and audience.&nbsp;Some B2C customers, for example, spend very little time in the middle of the funnel compared to B2B customers that require far more nurturing, engagement, and relationship development before a purchase is made. A $50 pair of sneakers, for instance, requires a lot less handholding when it comes to making purchase decisions than a $10,000 business software investment.</p> \n<h2>Content Ideas for Each Stage of the Buyer's Journey</h2> \n<p>Because audiences can vary so widely based on industry and intent, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">persona research is of the utmost importance</a>. Only by understanding their unique process for awareness and evaluation will you be able to create a truly effective content marketing strategy, packed with custom content that best supports their journey toward making a purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=content-buyer-journey-stage.jpg\" alt=\"content ideas for each stage of the buyer's journey: awareness, consideration, decision\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Blog Post&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A blog post is an ideal piece of content targeting the awareness stage. By targeting a pain, problem, or other topic your target audience wants to discover and then posting it to your website, you’re creating a brand asset that’s crawlable by Google and discoverable by search engine users. You can also promote your blog content across other channels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg?width=600&amp;name=blog-post-example-ahrefs.jpg\" alt=\"blog post example from ahrefs's blog that reads 'how long should blog posts be?'\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/blog-post-length/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Ahrefs is a great example of a brand that does blog content right. They include original data and informational advice to create long-form articles that serve their audience.</p> \n<h3>Social Media Post</h3> \n<p>Social media is a channel that can be used to promote your other content, and you can also create content specifically for the channel. According to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/\">Pew Research</a>, 72% of the public uses some form of social media, so it’s likely that your audience is native to this channel. Unlike blog posts, social media posts are likely shorter form, and <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/video-marketing-statistics\">video consumption is also on the rise</a>.</p> \n<iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6672147901583642624\" width=\"504\" height=\"653\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n<p>In the above example, HubSpot Agency Partner <a href=\"https://www.yokellocal.com/\">Yokel Local</a> shares attractive customer marketing tips on the LinkedIn platform. SlideShare formats are popular on LinkedIn, so the content is created to be snackable with short-form take-aways.</p> \n<h3>Whitepaper&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A whitepaper is an organization’s report or guide on a particular topic. Whitepapers are especially useful as downloadable offers when a reader wants to go more in-depth on a particular subject they’re reading about. For whitepapers, it’s important to provide information that can’t be found elsewhere so that your audience understands the value of the report and is compelled to get it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg?width=518&amp;name=whitepaper-example-hubspot.jpg\" alt=\"whitepaper example from hubspot that reads: &quot;not another state of marketing report&quot;\" width=\"518\" style=\"width: 518px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Every year, HubSpot publishes a survey on the state of marketing to provide helpful guidance based on thought leadership to marketers, sales professionals, and business owners. Inside, readers find statistics from a broad survey as well as industry experts’ opinions on what the data means and where the industry is going.</p> \n<h3>Checklist&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>For tasks that are complicated and have a lot of moving parts, individuals may simply want a blueprint that spells out what they’re supposed to do to achieve their end goal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/checklist-example-opendoor.jpg?width=600&amp;name=checklist-example-opendoor.jpg\" alt=\"checklist example from opendoor that reads &quot;the essential checklist for first-time home buyers&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/checklist-for-first-time-home-buyers\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Buying a home is a perfect example of this, and Opendoor meets their audience’s need by providing a handy checklist (in infographic form!) for the reader that spells out all the steps that need to be taken. The graphic is aesthetically pleasing and even allows room for a few tips along the way.</p> \n<h3>How-To Video&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, the best way to solve a pain or problem is to learn a new skill. Sure, a purchase of some kind may be required along the way, but the audience may need to become more informed about the problem and how to solve it. That’s where instructional video content comes in.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 534px; max-height: 300px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.18%; margin: 0;\"> \n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyOqoV90v58?autoplay=0&amp;fs=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;start=0&amp;end=0&amp;origin=https://youtubeembedcode.com\" width=\"534\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Whiteboard Fridays is a popular video series by <a href=\"https://moz.com/\">Moz</a> where SEO principles are broken down to the audience in easy-to-understand language and visuals.

In some cases, they may require a little more utility or personalization. That’s why kits and tools are a great piece of content to create to help the reader along their path to purchase.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tool-example-nerdwallet.jpg\" alt=\"tool example from nerdwallet that reads &quot;the 50/30/20 budget&quot; and is a budget calculator\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/nerdwallet-budget-calculator\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Nerdwallet creates content around several financial topics, budgeting being one of them. It can be difficult to create a budget, though, so they developed a calculator that allows the user to provide their own numbers in order to receive a customized recommendation.</p> \n<h3>Ebook or Tip Sheet&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>Similar to whitepapers, ebooks and tip sheets are great options for downloadable content. In contrast, they tend to be shorter form and more actionable.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg?width=600&amp;name=tip-sheet-example-coschedule.jpg\" alt=\"tip sheet example from coschedule that reads &quot;180+ power words for writing emotional headlines&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>CoSchedule combines a few tactics by promoting their headline analyzer tool with a <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">blog post about writing great headlines that drive traffic</a>. On that blog post, they include a great <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/emotional-headlines/\">tip sheet of powerful words</a> to include in headlines if you want to catch a reader’s attention.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Educational Webinar&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A webinar is a web seminar where information is typically provided through video. A webinar can be prerecorded or streamed live, and this opens up tons of possibilities to disseminate information to an audience who wants more visual and auditory content.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/webinar-example-semrush.jpg?width=600&amp;name=webinar-example-semrush.jpg\" alt=\"semrush's webinar page on their website\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/webinars/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SEMrush makes webinars a key part of their content marketing strategy, often running a valuable topic multiple times to get more mileage out of the content.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Product Comparison Guides</h3> \n<p>In the consideration stage, the buyer persona is still considering solutions to their pain or problem. For this reason, product comparisons are a great way to help them make a decision.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg?width=600&amp;name=comparison-example-verwell-fit.jpg\" alt=\"comparison example from verywell fit that reads &quot;pros and cons of hiit training&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/is-hiit-training-or-steady-state-cardio-better-4126506\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Verywell Fit provides such a comparison to help their readers choose between high-intensity workouts vs. steady-state cardio, providing the pros and cons and use cases for each.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Case Study</h3> \n<p>A case study can be used in both the consideration stage and the decision stage simultaneously by convincing the reader that the solution works by establishing that the provider achieves results for their clients by administering the solution. A good case study will appeal to the emotions and logic of the persona by providing detailed information and quantitative data on the final solution.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg?width=600&amp;name=case-study-example-bluleadz.jpg\" alt=\"case study example from bluleadz that reads &quot;lead generation strategy lands 77 new clients for credit counseling agency&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/case-studies/credit-canada-new-content-offer\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>HubSpot Partner Agency <a href=\"https://www.bluleadz.com/\">Blueleadz</a> does this by telling a story about their client and the problems they had while providing a detailed account of how they solved it.</p> \n<h3>Free Sample&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A free sample is another example of content or an offer that overlaps between buyer’s journey stages. Consider this: An individual wants to paint the inside of their home, but they don’t know what color.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As they consider which color (the solution), they pick up paint chip cards from their hardware store. These cards are created by a provider based on their individual solution. When the individual falls in love with a color, they already know who the provider is that makes it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-sample-example-4colorprint.jpg\" alt=\"free sample example from 4colorprint that depicts a pack of sample business cards\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4colorprint.com/sample-request.php\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>SILKCARDS taps into this buying behavior by offering samples of their unique printing methods on the content that they create. They know that their business is tactile, and digital content alone is not enough to close a deal. Once their prospective customer holds the sample in their hands, other business cards are put to shame.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Free Trial or Live Demo</h3> \n<p>What better way to know if you want to purchase a product than take it for a spin? Car dealerships have been using the “test drive” tactic for years because it works. If the product itself checks all the boxes the buyer has, all the sales team has to do is handle their objections and make the close.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg?width=600&amp;name=free-trial-example-hellosign.jpg\" alt=\"free trial example from hellosign that reads &quot;unlimited signature requests with no hidden fees&quot; and has four pricing tiers, one that's free and two that offer free trials\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://app.hellosign.com/info/pricing\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Hellosign does this well. Though they have a free option with limitations, they know that the key to getting clients into their larger tiers is by offering a free trial upfront. Their pricing page sets the prospect’s expectations and points them to the free trial.</p> \n<h3>Consultation Offer&nbsp;</h3> \n<p>A consultation is another example of providing just a little bit of service in exchange for the opportunity to close the sale. The best consultation offers reduce the anxiety of entering into a sales conversation by promising something concrete they can walk away with (a strategy or actionable advice) in exchange for their time.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg?width=600&amp;name=consultation-offer-blkbld-co.jpg\" alt=\"consultation offer from blkbld &amp; co that reads 'for our initial consultation, we will discuss what you are looking to do, your budget, my marketing plans you can execute &amp; lastly the next steps&quot;\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blkbld.lpages.co/free-consultation/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Blk Bld &amp; Co.’s consultation offer is a great example because it reduces the friction of scheduling a consultation. By removing friction, this organization increases the chances of conversion.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Coupon</h3> \n<p>A coupon appeals to a fear of missing out (FOMO) mindset. By reducing the price by a certain amount, a coupon is handing a price objection while convincing the prospect that they’re leaving money on the table if they don’t use the coupon. This inertia enough to win the prospect’s business.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg?width=500&amp;name=coupon-example-fragrant-jewels.jpg\" alt=\"coupon example from fragrant jewels in a &quot;spin-to-win&quot; style popup format\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.fragrantjewels.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Fragrant Jewels does this well by gamifying their coupons. By spinning the wheel, the website visitors have the chance to get a coupon before checking out the products. They’ll likely be evaluating the products that are a good deal with the coupon they won.</p> \n<p>In addition to decision stage content, you should also create content to delight your existing customers. This may include FAQ and knowledge base content to make the customer experience easier, coupons for the opportunity to upsell, and additional educative content that deepens their understanding of a topic.</p> \n<h2>Mapping Content Across All Stages of the Funnel and Buying Cycle</h2> \n<p>Every business has a unique sales funnel, sculpted and designed around their buyer’s unique journey.&nbsp;It’s a recipe that can’t necessarily be replicated from one business to another.&nbsp;When creating your own buyer's journey, there are a number of factors specific&nbsp;to your business to take into consideration.</p> \n<p>That said, the general approach remains the same: Understand your audience, develop your funnel around your industry and audience intent, and create a documented content marketing strategy that maps custom content specifically to each phase of their journey through the funnel.</p> \n<p>Do it well, and this process will have the greatest possible impact on your customer relationships, as well as the greatest possible lift in your overall conversions.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in August 2016 and has
