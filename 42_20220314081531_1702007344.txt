The system is based on a camera that is mounted inside the rubbery robot finger. The camera observes the internal walls of a hollow area within the finger, which is lit using a ring of LEDs, and a neural network interprets the camera feed to accurately calculate the location, magnitude, and direction of the force applied to the finger. The system aims to offer a level of sensitivity to robotic fingers that is similar to that of our own skin, and the technology could have various medical applications, including haptic feedback for robotic prostheses and as a safety mechanism for future assistive robotic technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The robot butlers (or doctors) we were all promised have not come to pass, yet, but researchers are still working steadily on increasing the capabilities of robotic systems. Eventually, assistive robotic technologies may become more mainstream. With our aging population, robots that can assist with daily living and medical care, such as nursing, will be very useful, and robotic prostheses are poised to provide unprecedented utility for amputees and those with other mobility issues. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if robots are to interact closely with humans it is important that they don’t cause injury or damage. A large part of this involves applying an appropriate amount of force to perform a specific task. This latest technology aims to allow a robot to precisely gauge the force applied by or to a rubbery robotic finger.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/fingertip-sensor.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531185\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/fingertip-sensor.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/fingertip-sensor-300x173.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/fingertip-sensor-768x442.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The finger consists of an elastomer coating mounted on a ‘skeleton’ frame. In a hollow space within, the researchers mounted a fisheye camera lens and illuminated the space with a ring of colorful LEDs. When the finger is deformed by touching something, the colorful pattern inside changes. Cleverly, the researchers used a neural network that learned how to interpret the changing patterns and infer the force that is being applied with great sensitivity. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We achieved this excellent sensing performance through the innovative mechanical design of the shell, the tailored imaging system inside, automatic data collection, and cutting-edge deep learning,&#8221; said Georg Martius, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;Our unique hybrid structure of a soft shell enclosing a stiff skeleton ensures high sensitivity and robustness. Our camera can detect even the slightest deformations of the surface from one single image,&#8221; added Huanbo Sun, another researcher involved in the project. &#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See a video about the technology below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Fingertip Sensitivity for Robots - a publication in Nature Machine Intelligence\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lTAJwcZopAA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00439-3\">A soft thumb-sized vision-based sensor with accurate all-round force perception</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://is.mpg.de/en/news/fingertip-sensitivity-for-robots\">Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=iYjjOeKLXt0:d1rpCpag8kE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=iYjjOeKLXt0:d1rpCpag8kE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=iYjjOeKLXt0:d1rpCpag8kE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=iYjjOeKLXt0:d1rpCpag8kE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Mar 2022 16:56:54 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finger-tip-sensor-side-1.png","linkMd5":"027003949b3129d6d27ae2a593fefa07","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-45-884_d9278c2908e3763a.webp","destWidth":466,"destHeight":510,"sourceBytes":339264,"destBytes":26158,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/finger-tip-sensor-side-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-14-45-884_d9278c2908e3763a.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/fingertip-sensor.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn72@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-07-473_5b5daf699b340f9c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-685_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-310_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=iYjjOeKLXt0:d1rpCpag8kE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-06-514_b93bd841a8c87797.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245679448},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","title":"Optical Probe Measures Dental Plaque Acidity","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1531529","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/imaging-scope.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531541\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/imaging-scope.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/imaging-scope-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/imaging-scope-768x497.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A team at the University of Washington have developed an optical probe that can detect the acidity of dental plaque. The acidity created by bacteria within plaque causes cavities, and knowing which areas of the teeth are particularly acidic could help dentists to predict where cavities are likely to arise. The knowledge could help someone change their oral hygiene practices, such as brushing more in high-risk areas. Moreover, the new device provides a quantitative measurement of overall oral health, which may give dentists and other clinicians an easy way to diagnose and track certain conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children learn at a young age that plaque on their teeth can cause cavities, also known as caries, and parents highlight the importance of regular brushing to remove that plaque. But plaque, which is essentially a bacterial biofilm, is not the full story, and all plaques are not created equal. The specific bacteria present in the plaque are predictive of how likely it is to cause a cavity, since the acid released by certain bacteria within these biofilms is responsible for the acid erosion that commonly causes cavities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Plaque has a lot of bacteria that produce acid when they interact with the sugar in our food,&#8221; said Manuja Sharma, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;This acid is what causes the corrosion of the tooth surface and eventually cavities. So, if we can capture information about the acidic activity, we can get an idea of how bacteria are growing in the dental biofilm, or plaque.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dental-probe-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531543\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dental-probe-1.png 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dental-probe-1-209x300.png 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The new technology, which the researchers have called the O-pH system, relies on fluorescence to measure local acidity levels in and around the teeth. To begin with, a dentist would apply a tasteless, FDA-approved dye to the mouth before a patient has had their teeth cleaned. Eric Seibel, another researcher involved in the study, said that &#8220;a dentist would rinse them with the tasteless fluorescent dye solution and then get their teeth optically scanned to look for high acid production areas where the enamel is getting demineralized.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current iteration of the device is a prototype, and the researchers are still figuring out how it can be most useful to patients and dentists alike. One aspect involves education, where a dentist can show a patient in real-time which areas of their mouth are at high-risk, or if they are at an overall high-risk because of poor oral hygiene or a sugary diet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We do need more results to show how effective it is for diagnosis, but it can definitely help us understand some of your oral health quantitatively,&#8221; said Sharma. &#8220;It can also help educate patients about the effects of sugar on the chemistry of plaque. We can show them, live, what happens, and that is an experience they&#8217;ll remember and say, OK, fine, I need to cut down on sugar!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>I</em><em>EEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering</em>: <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720240\">O-pH: Optical pH Monitor to Measure Oral Biofilm Acidity and Assist in Enamel Health Monitoring</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2022/03/08/o-ph-a-new-uw-dental-tool-prototype-can-spot-the-acidic-conditions-that-lead-to-cavities/\">University of Washington</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=hOAtYNCatso:Ra0Z6lIdQ-0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=hOAtYNCatso:Ra0Z6lIdQ-0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=hOAtYNCatso:Ra0Z6lIdQ-0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=hOAtYNCatso:Ra0Z6lIdQ-0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 15:41:11 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/imaging-scope.jpg","linkMd5":"31dd864f6a2505b087be054f2e41a8ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn54@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-04-233_38c30f1143bd835f.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":498,"sourceBytes":205583,"destBytes":26638,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/imaging-scope.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn54@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-04-233_38c30f1143bd835f.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dental-probe-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn7@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-06-842_2af25d49277800c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-685_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-310_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=hOAtYNCatso:Ra0Z6lIdQ-0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn75@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-06-570_882b80ea2408092e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245679444},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","title":"Soundwave Microchip to Grow New Bone Cells","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1530592","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/soundwave-chip-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531068\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/soundwave-chip-2.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/soundwave-chip-2-300x268.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at RMIT University in Australia built a microchip that can induce stem cells to differentiate into bone cells by stimulating them with high-frequency sound waves. The technique lets the researchers create bone cells using stem cells derived from adipose tissue, which are easier to extract than the traditional bone marrow-derived stem cells that are often used in bone tissue engineering experiments. The approach is low-cost and also avoids the growth factors and drugs that are sometimes used to stimulate stem cell differentiation.    </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tissue engineering holds great potential for a variety of patients who require treatments to repair or replace damaged tissues or organs, but it has taken longer than researchers had initially hoped to bring viable treatments to the clinic. Stem cells are an important part in the tissue engineering arsenal, but converting them in large numbers into a desired cell type can be expensive and complicated, often requiring incubation in a cocktail of growth factors and/or drugs to achieve the desired effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, stem cells are not just responsive to biochemical cues. They can also be influenced by physical stimuli. This latest technology takes advantage of the mechanosensitivity of cells, which can be influenced by the vibrations caused by sound waves. The stem cells are exposed to high-frequency sound waves within a low-cost microchip, causing them to undergo osteogenic differentiation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/soundwatch-chip-layout.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531069\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/soundwatch-chip-layout.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/soundwatch-chip-layout-300x83.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/soundwatch-chip-layout-768x213.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The sound waves cut the treatment time usually required to get stem cells to begin to turn into bone cells by several days,&#8221; said Amy Gelmi, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;This method also doesn&#8217;t require any special &#8216;bone-inducing&#8217; drugs and it&#8217;s very easy to apply to the stem cells.

The device consists of a series of magnetic metamaterial resonators that significantly boost MRI performance. This results in crisper images that can be obtained at twice the speed of a normal scan. The breakthrough may allow clinicians to obtain useful images from low-field MRI scanners, potentially expanding the accessibility of brain scans to people in low-resource regions of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MRI is an incredibly useful imaging technique, but it can often be difficult to achieve the image resolution required to identify the features of a specific disease or condition. Moreover, the scans are not exactly quick, often lasting nearly an hour. Upping the field power of an MRI system can increase its imaging power, but this is expensive. What if a simple device, made from plastic and copper wire, could help with all of these issues, and look like a goofy toy for kids in the process? Look no further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helmet has been designed by Boston University researchers to significantly enhance MRI brain scans. The helmet is an example of a metamaterial, which consists of an array of unit cells called resonators. Metamaterials are intended to influence waves, including sound waves and electromagnetic waves, by bending, absorbing, or otherwise influencing their behavior. &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These researchers have previously designed acoustic metamaterials to influence sound waves, which can make something quieter without blocking the flow of air and so could help to reduce the noise from engines or air-conditioners. This latest technology is a wearable metamaterial, which aims to influence the magnetic field of an MRI scanner to enhance MRI performance when the wearer is undergoing a brain scan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology is relatively simple in terms of its components. The helmet consists of 3D-printed plastic tubes that have been wrapped in copper wire. These are placed so that they affect the magnetic field of the MRI machine within the brain in such a way as to improve the resulting images. Moreover, the time required for an MRI scan is reduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, the Boston University researchers hope to develop the technology to the point that it can enable clinicians to obtain excellent images using low-field MRI scanners, which could increase the accessibility of such imaging around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Advanced Materials</em>: <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202109032\">Auxetics-Inspired Tunable Metamaterials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.bu.edu/articles/2022/this-bizzare-looking-helmet-can-create-better-brain-scans/\">Boston University</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_kquJRBR0xA:VC2zR9Nexrs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_kquJRBR0xA:VC2zR9Nexrs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_kquJRBR0xA:VC2zR9Nexrs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=_kquJRBR0xA:VC2zR9Nexrs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 15:55:26 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MRI-helmet.jpg","linkMd5":"38e6b3d73c19ddc030053ace581cea87","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn80@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-46-112_9deee236ca950113.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":514,"sourceBytes":220423,"destBytes":44352,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MRI-helmet.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn80@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-14-46-112_9deee236ca950113.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-685_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-310_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=_kquJRBR0xA:VC2zR9Nexrs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn51@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-06-678_6a4e7241b7165cf5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245679466},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","title":"Increasing Representation of People of Color in Medtech: Interview with Kwame Ulmer, Co-Founder of MedTech Color","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1530752","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mtcTransparent.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531213\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medtechcolor.org/\">Medtech Color</a> is a non-profit organization that aims to increase the representation of people of color within the medtech industry.

The medtech industry serves hundreds of millions of people globally but suffers from the lost learnings and insights from persons of color who are largely absent from high-level decision making. There is immense untapped potential from people of color, and MedTech Color is committed to providing and promoting opportunities for them to make a meaningful contribution to the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MedTech Color holds various networking events such as our annual <a href=\"https://medtechcolor.org/pitch-competition/\">Pitch Competition</a> and Networking Breakfast in order to help us reach these goals. We have also established the MedTech Color <a href=\"https://medtechcolorcollaborativecommunity.org/\">Collaborative Community on Diversity and Inclusion in Medical Device Product Development and Clinical Research</a>, a forum for medtech professionals and other stakeholders to address minority health issues in medical device product development and clinical research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: How did the organization come about? What inspired you to start it?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kwame Ulmer:</strong> In 2017, I met with 14 other African-American leaders from the medical device industry to discuss the complexities of the medtech industry and how minorities are affected. Our conversation then turned to the untapped potential of POC who either don’t join the medtech industry or leave early, culminating in a discussion of ways we could build a community that could tangibly address some of these issues. With that, MedTech Color was born and was officially founded as a nonprofit in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: What sorts of barriers do people of color face within the Medtech industry?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kwame Ulmer:</strong> Although the medtech industry serves all individuals, people of color are inadequately represented in the medtech industry as professionals, executives, clinical trial patients, and entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data on medtech professionals, although Black people represent 13% of the population, they represent less than half of medtech professionals &#8211; and the number is even lower for Black executives in the industry. It’s vital to have diverse decision makers at the table to ensure that populations served are accurately represented. Furthermore, Black entrepreneurs receive less than 1% of venture capital funding, which is one of the main drivers behind our annual MTC Pitch Competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spend my professional life working nearly exclusively with early stage medtech companies and have seen that minority-led companies tend to get the farthest with the least amount of capital. I meet companies with the talent and unique solutions for overlooked companies. One great example is Candlelit Therapy Inc. – a digital therapeutic for new and expectant BIPOC parents at risk of postpartum depression or anxiety. My work in Venture Capital has me in countless meetings a week. Over nearly four years, I can count on two hands the number of times I have sat across from an African-American medtech CEO. I want to change that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Please give us an overview of the Pitch Competition and how it works.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pitch-competition.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531211\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pitch-competition.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pitch-competition-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kwame Ulmer:</strong> The MTC Pitch Competition highlights Black and Brown startup founders seeking further funding and mentorship for their innovative medtech products and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year we received 75 applications, which our judges narrowed down to the top ten finalists.

I started working for Medtronic over 15 years ago, spending the majority of my time in commercial, strategy, and business development roles. Prior to my current role, I led Medtronic’s targeted drug delivery business, and prior to that, led marketing and strategy for our pacemaker business that launched the Micra transcatheter pacemaker. I also led product planning for our first Bluetooth-enabled platforms in that business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, I assumed the role of General Manager for our Implantable Pain Therapies business, which is comprised of our spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and targeted drug delivery (TDD) technologies. Implantable Pain Therapies is part of our Neuromodulation operating unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Spinal cord stimulation is a chronic pain therapy that has been around for several decades. How has the technology evolved in recent years? What’s new?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charlie Covert: </strong>Chronic pain is a debilitating condition, and symptoms can persist over years for many patients. Medtronic pioneered spinal cord stimulation more than a 40-years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also made strides in recent years to take this technology further. Features like more efficient, longer lasting batteries, smaller and more contoured devices for comfort, broader MRI access, more robust data reporting for physicians, and personalized stimulation thanks to AdaptiveStim<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> technology, which automatically adjusts stimulation based on the patient&#8217;s body positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps our most consequential new technology in this space is DTM<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> SCS therapy, which coordinates multiple signals at multiple anatomical targets and is proven superior to conventional SCS. Unlike conventional SCS, Differential Target Multiplexed (DTM) stimulation targets different areas of the spinal cord – hence, Differential Target – with different signals or frequencies—hence, Multiplexed.&#160;Our randomized, controlled trial for DTM SCS, the results of which were published in <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/papr.13066\"><em>Pain Practice Journal</em></a>, showed 84% of chronic back pain patients treated with DTM<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> SCS reported at least 50% pain relief, compared with only 51% of conventional SCS patients at 12 months. Data has shown DTM<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> SCS therapy with the Intellis<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> platform provides superior, sustained, and profound back pain relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: Patients have an option between rechargeable and recharge-free implantable spinal cord stimulators, but historically Medtronic has not been a major player in the recharge-free segment of this market. How are you looking at this space and patient population?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charlie Covert: </strong>While it’s true that we have not historically made a lot of noise in the recharge-free segment of this market, which represents about a quarter of all chronic pain patients, that is no longer the case with the launch of our FDA-approved Vanta<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> neurostimulator this past summer.

This past May, we launched CareGuidePro<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, which serves as a virtual guide for patients throughout their Medtronic spinal cord stimulation therapy journey. This app allows patients to record their pain relief and other feedback directly into the app, which can be used by Medtronic and the patient’s health care provider to make more informed therapy decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: What is your vision for Medtronic’s future in pain therapies? Where are you taking the business from here?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charlie Covert: </strong>With our company mission to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life, Medtronic strives to be at the forefront of medical device innovation. We pioneered the field of neuromodulation over 40 years ago and we remain committed to delivering innovative therapy and technology solutions that are deeply grounded in clinical evidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of strategies we’re pursuing to fulfill this mission. First, we are focused on reaching more patients in more places. We can do this through indication expansion of our current platforms, for example with patients with Non-Surgical Refractory Back Pain (NSRBP) and Upper Limb pain. These are conditions we are looking to treat in the future and we are working hard to develop the clinical evidence necessary for these approvals. We also just <a href=\"https://news.medtronic.com/2022-01-24-Medtronic-announces-FDA-approval-of-spinal-cord-stimulation-therapy-for-treating-chronic-pain-resulting-from-diabetic-peripheral-neuropathy\">announced</a> FDA approval for treating patients with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy which represents a substantial opportunity given the prevalence of that condition and the need for effective treatment options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, Medtronic is advancing closed-loop spinal cord stimulation technology designed to enable clinicians to deliver optimized therapies based on patient needs. Our closed-loop approach is based on Evoked Compound Action Potential (ECAPs), which are signals generated by the spinal cord in response to an electrical stimulus. These signals can guide dynamic, real-time therapy adjustments to respond to the patient’s unique needs. We believe this will enhance outcomes, and we are committed to building on our early clinical experience in this area to demonstrate this. So, it’s an exciting time to be in this business for sure, and we look forward to continuing along this innovation journey and reaching more patients in new ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/divider.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531134\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Product info page: <a href=\"https://www.medtronic.com/us-en/healthcare-professionals/products/neurological/spinal-cord-stimulation-systems/vanta-pc-neurostimulator.html\">Vanta SCS Neurostimulator&#8230;</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=fYf4UxAm9Ps:dFOfFnYR6pY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=fYf4UxAm9Ps:dFOfFnYR6pY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=fYf4UxAm9Ps:dFOfFnYR6pY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=fYf4UxAm9Ps:dFOfFnYR6pY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Mar 2022 22:55:04 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanta-implant-1.png","linkMd5":"ffd269e82069ae18171201eb81478848","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn48@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-05-968_a7c98ba7e97b69bb.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":544,"sourceBytes":403487,"destBytes":48660,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanta-implant-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn48@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-05-968_a7c98ba7e97b69bb.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CharlieCovert-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn68@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-07-898_9b3b1b4eaa09a35d.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn79@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-06-553_5ae013c0eecc399e.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/medtronic-app.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn87@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-07-425_256a5415e4c12b6f.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/divider.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn3@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-06-674_674254178c242b75.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-685_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-310_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=fYf4UxAm9Ps:dFOfFnYR6pY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn91@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-06-487_76bd0167aed09487.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245679456},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","title":"New Vascular Contrast for Clearer Blood Vessel Imaging","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1531125","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-connections-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531283\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-connections-1.png 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-connections-1-300x267.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins developed a new imaging technique that allows them to view the vasculature of experimental animals in great detail. Research into a variety of conditions, from vascular disease to cancer, relies on acquiring images of the vasculature in animals, with a variety of imaging techniques available. These researchers have created a unique blend of polymer contrast agents which can be perfused into the vasculature, permitting imaging using optical microscopy, MRI, and computed tomography (CT). The combined imaging creates highly detailed tissue maps of the vasculature at different spatial scales, revealing insights into cell types and tissue structures that surround blood vessels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blood vessels play a role in many disease states, and researchers have spent years developing and fine-tuning imaging techniques that let us view these complex and winding structures. This includes imaging within our human bodies and also within experimental animals to increase our understanding of various diseases. There are numerous techniques available to image blood vessels, such as MRI or CT scans, and they all provide slightly different information and have different strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Usually, if you want to gather data on blood vessels in a given tissue and combine it with all of its surrounding context like the structure and the types of cells growing there, you have to re-label the tissue several times, acquire multiple images and piece together the complementary information,&#8221; said Arvind Pathak, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;This can be an expensive and time-consuming process that risks destroying the tissue&#8217;s architecture, precluding our ability to use the combined information in novel ways.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-shot.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531281\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-shot.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-shot-300x218.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-shot-768x559.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This new technique allows the same sample to be imaged using optical microscopy, CT imaging and MRI imaging. The approach relies on a combination contrast agent, which the researchers have called VascuViz. It consists of a blend of a fluorescent MRI contrast agent called Galbumin-Rhodamine and a CT contrast agent called BriteVu. The relatively inexpensive polymer blend rapidly sets when perfused into the vasculature, allowing both the micro- and macro-vasculature to be imaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new imaging technique allows the researchers to assemble complex visualizations of the vasculature and surrounding anatomy, providing more information than could be achieved by using just one imaging modality. &#8220;Now, rather than using an approximation, we can more precisely estimate features like blood flow in actual blood vessels and combine it with complementary information, such as cell density,&#8221; said Akanksha Bhargava, another researcher involved in the study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See a video about the technique below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"VascuViz Demo\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMltFRdxpSQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Nature Methods</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01363-5\">VascuViz: a multimodality and multiscale imaging and visualization pipeline for vascular systems biology</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/making-the-invisible-visible-a-clearer-picture-of-blood-vessels-in-health-and-disease-thanks-to-new-imaging-approach\">Johns Hopkins Medicine</a> </p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=u4_ek9tVOQI:JKJvDp95A30:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=u4_ek9tVOQI:JKJvDp95A30:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=u4_ek9tVOQI:JKJvDp95A30:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=u4_ek9tVOQI:JKJvDp95A30:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 21:05:29 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-connections-1.png","linkMd5":"381f537f7905cfb30dabd550b03f00f8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn55@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-14-49-746_22d9c7106f54d8a3.webp","destWidth":466,"destHeight":415,"sourceBytes":281662,"destBytes":31492,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-connections-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn55@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-14-49-746_22d9c7106f54d8a3.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/brain-shot.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn83@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-774_a34d72b37f33d2cb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-685_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-310_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=u4_ek9tVOQI:JKJvDp95A30:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn2@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-06-579_f9161d486f0a26b6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245679446},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","title":"Artificial Neurons and Synapses from Printed Transistors","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1530940","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Artificial-organic-neurons-LOE-LiU-2022-01-11-TB-_DSG3516.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531123\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Artificial-organic-neurons-LOE-LiU-2022-01-11-TB-_DSG3516.jpg 740w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Artificial-organic-neurons-LOE-LiU-2022-01-11-TB-_DSG3516-300x199.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Linköping University in Sweden have created artificial neurons and synapses using organic electrochemical transistors that can be printed onto plastic foil in their thousands. The printed structures can conduct both electrons and ions, helping them to mimic the action potentials generated in biological neurons. So far, the Swedish team integrated the artificial neurons into a living organism, in this case a carnivorous plant called a Venus flytrap, and showed that they could activate the closing mechanism of its leafy trap, even though an insect had not landed inside. The technology may prove very useful for a variety of medical applications, including better integration and control of robotic prostheses and implantable neuromodulatory technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electronics and biological systems are not usually a match made in heaven, at least in terms of direct contact and interaction. The cyborg revolution, in which humans seamlessly integrate electronic components into our bodies for super-human powers and evil antics, remains the realm of science fiction writers. However, this latest tech could pave the way for easier integration between machines and our nervous system, with a variety of potential uses in medical technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology in question consists of organic electrochemical circuits that can be printed on a plastic substrate. The structures can conduct both ions and electrons, and positive and negative charges, allowing them to mimic the action potentials generated by neurons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve developed ion-based neurons, similar to our own, that can be connected to biological systems,” said Chi-Yuan Yang, a researcher involved in the study. “Organic semiconductors have numerous advantages &#8212; they&#8217;re biocompatible, biodegradable, soft and formable. They only require low voltage to operate, which is completely harmless to both plants and vertebrates.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We chose the Venus flytrap so we could clearly show how we can steer the biological system with the artificial organic system and get them to communicate in the same language,&#8221; said Simone Fabiano, another researcher involved in the study. The researchers can use the artificial neurons to stimulate the leaflet trap to close, despite there being no insects in sight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers hope that the technology could enhance medical devices where close communication between the device and the nervous system is required, such as in robotic prostheses or neuromodulatory devices. &#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Nature Communications</em>: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28483-6\">Organic electrochemical neurons and synapses with ion mediated spiking</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://liu.se/en/news-item/de-bygger-artificiella-nervceller\">Linköping University</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=X2_Jx1LtXIo:Hg_rk-QspCM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=X2_Jx1LtXIo:Hg_rk-QspCM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=X2_Jx1LtXIo:Hg_rk-QspCM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=X2_Jx1LtXIo:Hg_rk-QspCM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Mar 2022 22:07:29 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Artificial-organic-neurons-LOE-LiU-2022-01-11-TB-_DSG3516.jpg","linkMd5":"f821ceecdce6badb4ccf43310e3be186","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn50@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-14-39-870_981a8cd5eabada45.webp","destWidth":740,"destHeight":492,"sourceBytes":64565,"destBytes":37474,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Artificial-organic-neurons-LOE-LiU-2022-01-11-TB-_DSG3516.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn50@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-14-39-870_981a8cd5eabada45.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-685_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-310_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=X2_Jx1LtXIo:Hg_rk-QspCM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn44@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-06-501_b65e2d50cbc4c37f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245679448},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","title":"Smart Orthopedic Implant to Enhance Bone Growth: Interview with Ben Hertzog, CEO at Intelligent Implants","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1529451","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-in-hand.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1530756\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-in-hand.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-in-hand-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-in-hand-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.intelligentimplants.co/\">Intelligent Implants</a>, a medtech company based in Cork, Ireland, has developed the SmartFuse TLIF cage, a spinal implant intended to enhance bone healing and reduce rates of non-union following spinal fusion surgery.

This is an invasive and costly procedure, sometimes cited as the costliest surgical procedure in the US. When it works, spinal fusion can be a game-changer for patients suffering from chronic back pain. However, we still see an&#160;unacceptably high rate of non-union (i.e., when the vertebrae fail to fuse). It is estimated that 10-40% of spinal fusion procedures result in failed&#160;fusion, with an estimated $16B of&#160;associated economic waste in the US alone. The&#160;“soft costs” of failed fusions are even higher. Failed fusion is frustrating for the surgeon but can be&#160;devastating for the&#160;patient, often resulting in&#160;significant pain (lasting&#160;months and often requiring opioids), complex revision surgery (often with poor&#160;outcomes), lost work, and generally diminished&#160;quality of life.<br><br><strong><em>Medgadget: What do you think is needed to remedy the high failure rates in spinal fusion&#160;surgery?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ben Hertzog: </strong>There are something like 500 different&#160;implants approved for use in spinal&#160;fusion, yet we are still dealing with these high rates&#160;of non-union in high-risk and complex cases. There have been amazing advances in materials and&#160;implant&#160;design, but nothing has dramatically improved outcomes yet. Biologics, such as Bone Morphogenic&#160;Protein (BMP), have been shown to grow&#160;significant bone, but they have also struggled to improve outcomes in clinical use. In addition, they are very&#160;expensive&#160;and involve ongoing debates regarding complications.&#160;We&#160;believe new&#160;technologies are needed that can both accelerate and control bone growth. This is&#160;our mission at Intelligent Implants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#160;<br><strong><em>Medgadget: What inspired the company to develop a smart spinal implant?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ben Hertzog: </strong>The genesis of our company&#160;starts with our co-founders Dr. Rory&#160;Murphy (Neurosurgeon, Barrow Brain and Spine,&#160;Phoenix&#160;AZ) and our CTO, Erik Zellmer, Ph.D. They realized there was an&#160;opportunity to do something interesting by applying the concepts and technology of neurostimulation (the focus of Erik’s Ph.D.) to orthopedics and&#160;spinal fusion. This idea eventually became the SmartFuse system.<br>&#160;<br><strong><em>Medgadget: Please give us an overview of the SmartFuse system and how it works.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-between-fingers-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1530758\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-between-fingers-1.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-between-fingers-1-245x300.jpg 245w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ben Hertzog: </strong>SmartFuse&#160;is a wirelessly enabled, active&#160;implant technology that uses an array&#160;of electrodes to stimulate, control, and&#160;monitor bone growth.&#160;The system is comprised of an implant&#160;to deliver local electrical stimulation to accelerate bone growth, an external&#160;“wearable”&#160;to wirelessly power and communicate with the implant, and a cloud-based&#160;physician portal and patient App.<br>&#160;<br><strong><em>Medgadget: How did the idea for the implant come about? How did you realize that electrical&#160;stimulation could enhance spinal healing?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ben Hertzog: </strong>Electric signals are part of&#160;nature and core to our physiology. We have known&#160;for many decades that electrical signals play a crucial role in the body’s&#160;process of&#160;creating new bone. In fact, it is also known that if an external&#160;electrical signal is applied in the&#160;appropriate manner, we can&#160;stimulate the&#160;formation of bone. What our company has done is applied neurostimulation&#160;principles and&#160;advanced micro-electronic design to create the first wireless implant that can deliver this electrical&#160;stimulation directly to the site where the new bone is needed, and do it in a way that we have precise control over that&#160;stimulation.<br>&#160;<br><strong><em>Medgadget: What type of data does the implant generate, and how can it help clinicians&#160;make treatment decisions?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/the-implants-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1530760\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/the-implants-1.png 400w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/the-implants-1-203x300.png 203w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ben Hertzog: </strong>In addition to&#160;stimulation, we can also use the&#160;implant to&#160;measure the electrical properties of the&#160;surgical site. The&#160;electrical&#160;properties of the mature (healed) bone are quite&#160;different than that of the&#160;immediate post-operative surgical site, so by measuring these properties, over time, we can&#160;actually detect the new bone being formed and&#160;present this data to the surgeon in a way that is&#160;indicative of healing. Our SmartFuse Cloud system&#160;enables the&#160;physician to&#160;access the data in real-time. We can also track&#160;patient compliance and system status. Overall, we can provide the surgeon with an unprecedented view into the patient’s post-operative journey, including how&#160;well they are&#160;healing. We&#160;believe&#160;this&#160;ability to accelerate bone growth AND monitor&#160;healing and&#160;patient&#160;compliance has the potential to improve outcomes dramatically.<br>&#160;<br><strong><em>Medgadget: How has the system performed so far in reducing non-union and enhancing bone&#160;healing?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ben Hertzog: </strong>We have demonstrated in a chronic, large animal (ovine)&#160;model of&#160;spinal fusion that SmartFuse can&#160;increase the&#160;quantity of new bone by 3X and&#160;improve the&#160;quality of that bone versus a&#160;standard (e.g., unstimulated) control.<br>&#160;<br><strong><em>Medgadget: Congratulations on receiving Breakthrough Device Designation for the SmartFuse&#160;System. What is next for the technology?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ben Hertzog: </strong>As a company, our big focus&#160;right now is all on&#160;getting the SmartFuse system into the&#160;clinic for a first-in-human study for&#160;spinal fusion. We see SmartFuse as a platform technology that can be applied to almost any orthopedic implant where you want to&#160;accelerate and&#160;monitor healing. We are working on other orthopedic indications in&#160;addition to the spine.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/divider-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1530761\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://www.intelligentimplants.co/\">Intelligent Implants homepage&#8230;</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=hdLrGB-v26Q:SFrzDsLsGUY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=hdLrGB-v26Q:SFrzDsLsGUY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=hdLrGB-v26Q:SFrzDsLsGUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=hdLrGB-v26Q:SFrzDsLsGUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 15:17:08 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-in-hand.jpg","linkMd5":"0ae36d9de1062e986e113f19715feae7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn43@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-14-51-712_121471684ba5b966.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":578,"sourceBytes":327079,"destBytes":35016,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-in-hand.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn43@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-14-51-712_121471684ba5b966.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Benjamin-Hertzog-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn100@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-06-906_f0f2b95421f60305.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/implant-between-fingers-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn48@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-07-334_a2c9f37e68488194.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/the-implants-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn15@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-07-634_1ecf14b16d0ba18c.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/divider-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn13@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-06-635_a4ac5936d8aa2a6c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-685_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-310_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=hdLrGB-v26Q:SFrzDsLsGUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn92@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-06-727_9c13911d1a5c7972.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245679465},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","title":"Microfluidic Device for Quick and Accurate SARS-CoV-2 Testing","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1530736","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/prepping-the-device-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531079\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/prepping-the-device-1.png 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/prepping-the-device-1-294x300.png 294w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Barcelona, Spain, have created a microfluidic chip that can detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in less than 30 minutes, and with a similar level of accuracy as the current gold-standard test, PCR. The technology combines the speed of antigen tests with the accuracy of PCR and may be useful for point-of-care testing. The technique involves combining a few drops of saliva with fluorescent antibodies against the virus. Then, the saliva sample is passed through a microfluidic channel, where a laser illuminates bound fluorescent antibodies and an optical detector rapidly assesses if the virus is present. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the current global wave of the omicron COVID-19 variant is relatively mild in terms of severe disease and death, another more serious variant may be around the corner, and researchers are reluctant to assume that new technologies to identify and fight the virus are not required. Moreover, another viral pandemic is sure to happen sooner or later, and developing platform diagnostic and therapeutic technologies will mean we are better prepared for the next one. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this light, these researchers have unveiled a new COVID-19 test that combines the speed of antigen tests with the accuracy of PCR. The test, which the researchers have described as a flow virometer, does not require an uncomfortable nasal swab, and will work with just two drops of saliva.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/covid-spit-test.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531076\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/covid-spit-test.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/covid-spit-test-300x206.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/covid-spit-test-768x528.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The device uses a couple of drops of saliva and fluorescent light markers. When saliva is collected from the saliva of a patient&#8217;s mouth, we introduce it in a solution that contains fluorescent antibodies. If the saliva contains any presence of viral particles, the fluorescent antibodies will attach to the virus,&#8221; said Rubaiya Hussain, a researcher involved in the study. “The reader collects the sample and sends it into a microfluidic channel that will pass through a laser illumination detection set-up. The laser illuminates the sample and if there is presence of viral particles, they will emit a unique enhancement of the fluorescence signal. In less than 1 minute, the reading translates into peaks in our graph and alerts the system that the sample is a positive.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have tested the technology with 50 patients, and have shown that it has a specificity of 90% and a sensitivity of 91.2%, which is similar to PCR. However, the test is faster and easier to perform than PCR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the technology may be useful for other pathogens. “Our device is very versatile,” said Ewelina Wajs, another researcher involved in the study. “By selecting proper antibodies, this technology could also be adapted for the detection of other viruses, such as seasonal coronavirus or influenza virus, or even microorganisms in water, such as Legionella and E-coli, with a very fast response time, with respect to gold standards relying on culture.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See a video about the device below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"New light-based device to effectively test Covid-19 patients\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5lhksKJRwL0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Biomedical Optics Express</em>: <a href=\"https://opg.optica.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-13-3-1609&#38;id=469734\">Small form factor flow virometer for SARS-CoV-2</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.icfo.eu/news/1991/light-based-device-uses-a-few-drops-of-saliva-to-effectively-test-covid-19-patients/\">Institute of Photonic Sciences</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=slxkwYZji-M:pYocT-nhN2s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=slxkwYZji-M:pYocT-nhN2s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=slxkwYZji-M:pYocT-nhN2s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=slxkwYZji-M:pYocT-nhN2s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Mar 2022 22:31:11 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/prepping-the-device-1.png","linkMd5":"b3348ad61cc5fa9b7afa3d1520bada41","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn75@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-03-326_d3f4ebe1aeb813ab.webp","destWidth":466,"destHeight":475,"sourceBytes":316587,"destBytes":19776,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/prepping-the-device-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn75@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-03-326_d3f4ebe1aeb813ab.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/covid-spit-test.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn64@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-147_374957c91ff9b3e9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-06-685_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn10@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-07-310_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=slxkwYZji-M:pYocT-nhN2s:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn5@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-20-646_c3a773a6e0debb5d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245679458},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:14:39","title":"Ultrathin Conductive Films for Wearables are Flexible and Durable","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1531192","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/stretchable_film2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531535\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/stretchable_film2.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/stretchable_film2-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/stretchable_film2-768x449.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at UCLA created ultrathin films that are just 10 nanometers thick, but which can maintain electrical conductivity, flexibility, and strength. The molecules within the films are held together by non-bonding van der Waals forces, making them highly pliable, and the numerous sheets within the films are able to slide over each other without breaking apart. The films are also breathable and are permeable to water and air. These properties mean that the films are highly suited as a component for health-related wearables, and the resulting wearable creations can easily conform to the shape of the body part they are applied to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearable tech is evolving apace. However, finding the right material for a bioelectronic film that can be applied directly to the skin can be challenging. Some materials are limited by poor flexibility and stretchability, and don’t easily fit to the variable shapes and contours of our bodies. Other materials are not breathable, causing sweat to build up, and others cannot handle the presence of such biological fluids.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Skin_transistor.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1531536\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a material that ticks all (or at least most) of the boxes for wearables is difficult. However, these researchers have achieved some success with this latest material, which consists of a patchwork of incredibly thin sheets made from molybdenum disulfide. The patchwork structure allows the sheets to slide over each other, allowing the material to flex easily and conform to the surface of the skin without breaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Conceptually, the membrane is like a much-thinner version of kitchen cling film, with excellent semiconducting electronic functionality and unusual stretchability that naturally adapts to soft biological tissues with highly conformal interfaces,&#8221; said Xiangfeng Duan, one of the developers of the new material. &#8220;It could open up a diverse range of powerful sensing and signaling applications. For example, wearable health-monitoring devices built with this material can accurately track electrophysiological signals at the organism level or down to the level of individual cells.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers have conducted some preliminary proof-of-concept tests with the material to assess its potential as a major component in health wearables, and so far, the results have been promising. For instance, they created a wearable electrocardiogram system that involves small discs of the material being applied to the forearm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our proof-of-concept demonstrations using the van der Waals thin film really just hint at the myriad possibilities for this new material,&#8221; said Yu Huang, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;The membrane could serve as the connection for human-machine interfaces, enhanced robotics and artificial intelligence-enabled technologies that connect directly. This could open a pathway to synthetic electronic-cellular hybrids – cyborg-like living organisms with electronic enhancements.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an animation showing how van der Waals thin films work. On the left, the layered patchwork design enables the membranes to stretch and flex over irregular geometries. On the right, a film with single continuous layers breaks upon stretching.:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9
