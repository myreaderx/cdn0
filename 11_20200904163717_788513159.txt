Out of the box, the default PostgreSQL configuration is not tuned for any workload. Thus, any system with the least resources can run it. PostgreSQL does not give optimum performance on high permanence machines because it is not using all available resources. PostgreSQL provides a system where you can tune your database according to your workload and machine specifications. In addition to PostgreSQL, we can also tune our Linux box so that the database load can work optimally.</p>\n<p>In this webinar on PostgreSQL High-Performance Tuning and Optimization, we will learn how to tune PostgreSQL and we&#8217;ll see the results of that tuning. We will also touch on tuning some Linux kernel parameters.</p>\n<p>Please join <strong>Ibrar Ahmed </strong>on <strong>Thursday, September 17, 2020, at 1 pm EDT</strong> for his webinar <strong>&#8220;PostgreSQL High-Performance Tuning and Optimization</strong>&#8220;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\" href=\"https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1635755952347196175?source=blog\">Register for Webinar</a></p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t attend, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/1635755952347196175?source=blog\">sign up anyway</a> and we&#8217;ll send you the slides and recording afterward.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Our white paper &#8220;Why Choose PostgreSQL?&#8221; looks at the features and benefits of PostgreSQL and presents some practical usage examples.
