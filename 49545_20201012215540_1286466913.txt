It&rsquo;s the closest I&rsquo;ve ever felt to being part of the Apollo 11 moon landing. They took the actual video filmed outside the window of the lunar module, the audio recorded between astronauts and mission control, and a bunch of data about the landing itself — including Armstrong&rsquo;s heartrate over time — and synced it all together into a sweet interactive experience.</p>\n\n<p>Looks something like this, &lsquo;cept on the site you hear everything and can scrub back'n'forth from descent to &ldquo;The Eagle has Landed!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://static.tumblr.com/9hgswys/Pdxnglk48/apollo.gif\"/></p>\n\n<p>Playing w/ this site is how I learned about a software glitch that almost botched the whole thing. Neil Armstrong is a couple minutes from touching down when he says &ldquo;program alarm&rdquo; so calmly you could almost miss it amid the chatter. Goes something like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre>Armstrong: \"Program alarm.\"\n\n[4 seconds, unrelated chatter]\n\nArmstrong: \"It's a 1202.\"\n\nAldrin: \"1202.\"\n\n[16 seconds of silence]\n\nArmstrong (now with urgency in his voice): \"Give us a reading on the 1202 program alarm.\"\n\nMission control: \"Roger. We got...we're go on that alarm.\"\n</pre></blockquote>\n\n<p>And on the Mission Control loop in Houston — the one the astronauts can&rsquo;t hear — they say:</p>\n\n<blockquote><pre>Steve Bales: \"If it doesn't reoccur, we'll be go.\"</pre></blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.firstmenonthemoon.com/\">Go listen to it</a>! For those of you who haven&rsquo;t spent your lives in software, let me translate from Super Professional NASA Speak™ into ordinary developer chat for you:</p>\n\n<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://static.tumblr.com/9hgswys/u96nglhob/screen_shot_2014-12-14_at_3.07.29_pm.png\"/></p>\n\n<p>This is obviously a silly caricature. NASA are professionals. But I read about this event after listening to the audio. Turns out there&rsquo;s a bit of truth here — when that 1202 error first showed up, there was a lot of confusion. Only <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Garman#1202\">one person</a>, thanks to a previous simulator failure, happened to have a hand-scribbled list of various possible program alarms and was able to suggest that it was safe to keep going. The alarm would pop up three more times before landing.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s always been one of my favorite moon-landing stories — almost aborting right at the very end.</p>\n\n<p>So I was really happy to learn about the programmer behind this success: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)\">Margaret Hamilton</a>. I&rsquo;d never heard her name until <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2oskna/til_that_preventing_an_abort_of_the_apollo_11/\">a recent reddit thread</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8735912\">a followup on hacker news</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://static.tumblr.com/9hgswys/tjxnglj7h/mhh-apollo_ii.jpg\"/></p>\n\n<p>Turns out she&rsquo;s not only responsible for this alarm not ruining the mission but <strong>she actually coined the term 'software engineering&rsquo;</strong>. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8737533\">Apparently she spent a lot of time arguing for software safety checks</a> that prevented astronauts from accidentally doing the wrong thing, despite being regularly assured that this code wouldn&rsquo;t be worth its weight because professional astronauts don&rsquo;t accidentally do the wrong thing.</p>\n\n<p>In Apollo 11&rsquo;s case, a switch in the lunar landing module was set in the wrong position, causing its computer to process data from two radars instead of just the one pointed at the moon. This was too much to process, so Hamilton&rsquo;s system began (impressively) dropping its low priority tasks in order to have enough CPU to properly handle the critical lunar surface radar input. Wasn&rsquo;t a software glitch at all — quite the opposite. A graceful handling of a critical situation.</p>\n\n<p>Rest is history. <a href=\"http://firstmenonthemoon.com\">Enjoy it for yourself</a>, and be sure to thank Margaret when Neil gets to ignore those scary-sounding alarms.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 00:08:00 +0000","feedId":49545,"bgimg":"http://static.tumblr.com/9hgswys/Pdxnglk48/apollo.gif","linkMd5":"8672276ccec67c4c6839b8c57965cc10","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn18@2020_3/2020/10/12/21-55-36-745_bbcd56c0a598384c.webp","destWidth":1428,"destHeight":660,"sourceBytes":3680594,"destBytes":1957824,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://static.tumblr.com/9hgswys/Pdxnglk48/apollo.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn18@2020_3/2020/10/12/21-55-36-745_bbcd56c0a598384c.webp","http://static.tumblr.com/9hgswys/u96nglhob/screen_shot_2014-12-14_at_3.07.29_pm.png":null,"http://static.tumblr.com/9hgswys/tjxnglj7h/mhh-apollo_ii.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn15@2020_2/2020/10/12/21-55-38-531_018286ed854d9edb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602539664618}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 05:54:24","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 05:54:24","feedId":49545,"fetchDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 21:54:24 +0000","fetchMs":118,"handleMs":752,"totalMs":76101,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"3b815f166924abacecf011ee14a8b2ba","hostName":"us-005*","requestId":"d8b90c3518684f6da96275e0c3ae31f7_49545","contentType":"text/xml;
