Now, the author is revealing more details about his upcoming book --particularly why he chose to tell the story from a minority lens.</p><p>Ridley told <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/9/3/21408118/dc-comics-alternate-history-other-black-lightning-john-ridley-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Polygon</a>, \"for me going into it, it was less about just rehashing, say, <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>, but really getting into, say, a character’s difficult relationship with Superman. If you’re a character of color, and you’re faced with bias, and you’re faced with intolerance, and you see an individual who is literally an alien but because of his forward-facing facade, his visage — his passport is stamped. And at the same time, when people have a difficult relationship with anyone, but something like <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i> happens and Supergirl is killed? How do characters react? How do they react to Superman, and how do they reconcile how they felt about this individual? But at the same time, he was out there trying to do right, he was out there trying to do certain things.\"</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED:<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/john-ridley-worlds-finest-influenced-work/\"> John Ridley Reveals the DC Series That Was Most Influential to His Work</a></span></p><p>He elaborated, \"Even little things. When Batman labels his group 'The Outsiders'— on one hand it just sounds like 'Hey, we’re kind of these rogue fighters who don’t quite fit in with the Justice League.' But on the other hand, what does it say [to] the Black hero and the Japanese hero, or Geo-Force, who is [also] a foreigner? And they’re all labeled the Outsiders? And how do they feel about things like that?\"</p><p>Ridley added, \"So to me, it’s less about just going back and saying, <i>Hey, in the ’80s, it was this big event. Hey, in the ’90s, it was this big event</i>, but really saying within these big events on a human level — Think about any crisis that’s going on right now. We have maybe some shared collective opinions about things. Obviously, we’re a very broad country, we don’t all think alike, but individually, how we look at these events, how we feel, how we react to them as people, how we then go back and interact with other people based on these changes, and the nomenclature and how our politicians treat them.\"</p><p>He concluded, \"That, to me is what I wanted to get into <i>The Other History</i>, that it wasn’t just recounting history, but looking at it from perspectives of people of color, of women, of people from the LGBTQ community, of people of different ages. For us it was really [about] trying to create as much of a plurality of perspectives as possible. And that is the great thing, over time DC has built it up. For me it was about trying to take all of these narratives and then weave them together, but allow that weaving to travel through events that comic book readers should know and remember. And in cases where they don’t, I hope they want to go back to those stories and <i>Oh, I forgot about a moment when John Stewart destroyed a planet. What was that like for him</i>?\"</p><p>Written by John Ridley and drawn by Giuseppe Camuncoli and Andrea Cucchi. <em>The Other History of the DC Universe </em>is set to hit shelves Nov. 24.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/john-ridley-dc-project-batman-person-of-color/\">John Ridley Reveals New DC Project --'47% Chance This Batman is a Person of Color'</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 23:10:48 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/other-history-dc-universe-header.jpg","linkMd5":"f79812bd54833bc8960a281507977f22","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn14@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-29-618_89e1314c3ad9524e.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":288235,"destBytes":254804,"author":"Evangelia Galanis","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/other-history-dc-universe-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn14@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-29-618_89e1314c3ad9524e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989067},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Wolverine Vs Wonder Woman: Who Would Win? | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-vs-wonder-woman-who-would-win/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Upward-Slant-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>The overtly violent <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/wolverine/\">Wolverine</a> is known for his extreme methods and total (mostly) lack of empathy in any course of action he takes, making him one of the hardest opponents to actually hold down in battle.

Interestingly, at that point, even she had no idea what, how or where she had obtained these new abilities from.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Wolverine: Adamantium</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/05.-HATE-Wolverine-Claws-Popped-Explosion-Fire.jpg' /></figure><p>This is easily <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-10-ways-wolverine-has-changed-over-the-years/\">the most iconic feature of Wolverine</a>, coupled with the *snikt* produced every time he unsheathes his claws. Although originally made of bone, they were later imbued with Adamantium under Weapon X's gentle guidance, giving him weapons both razor-sharp and practically unbreakable.</p><p>This can be quite dangerous for Wonder Woman, as she usually tends to rely on a single weapon rather than a flurry of flying blades. Would the Shield of Themyscira survive his claws, though?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Wonder Woman: Paraphernalia</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wonder-woman-explaining-lasso.jpg' /></figure><p>This is a category in which Wonder Woman is almost consistently well-prepared — who else can lay claim to bracelets that possess limitless durability as well as the capacity to deflect hard projectiles, energy rays, and so on.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-vs-mystique-who-would-win/\">Wonder Woman Vs.

On the opposite end, Logan doesn't really have that much going for him in the equipment department, and certainly nothing that can fare well against Diana's.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Wolverine: Rage Mode</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wolverine-1.jpg' /></figure><p>For <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-confusing-things-explained/\">a man who can be extremely zen when he needs to be</a> (offering eulogies for dead deer and cursed katanas), Wolverine is known for his so-called \"berserker\" style of combat, in which his higher brain functions are pretty much reduced into their basest, most animalistic instincts.</p><p>In this mode, he is nearly impossible to defend against, as he manifests the hyper-aggressive tendencies of the animal from whom he gets his name. In other words: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/things-wolverine-should-use-powers-missed-opportunities/\">a cornered Wolverine is far too risky</a> to attack.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Wonder Woman: Combat</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Wonder-Woman-Dead-Earth-Fight-1.jpg' /></figure><p>Wolverine is supremely proficient in various martial arts, from hand-to-hand to pugilism to multiple tiers of weaponry (and his age has allowed him more experience than the opponents he usually faces).</p><p>He will still lose to Wonder Woman in this department though, because her skills alone outshine his by a mile, not to forget that she has been practicing for thousands of years, compared to his hundred or so. Add this to her agility, velocity, response-time, and flexibility, and it's nearly impossible to see Wolverine coming out of this unscathed.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Wolverine: Assassination</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wolverine-Assassin.jpg' /></figure><p>For someone with his general aura of hostility, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-wolverine-common-misconceptions/\">it comes as no surprise that Wolverine</a> also happens to be a rather stealthy assassin (the act of aloofness helps him avoid being discovered or caught in several situations).</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-wolverine-ranking-every-love-interest/\">Every Love Interest Of Wolverine, Ranked</a></span></p><p>He is also competent at tracking his quarry, sniffing them out with a combination of physical clues, odors, energy patterns; it's not always clear, to be honest. Therefore, while Diana waits to have her battle with him, in a fair and unbiased environment, Wolverine could, technically, sneak into her home and massacre in her sleep. Or at least try.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Wonder Woman: Divine Powers</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-11-at-5.13.39-PM.jpg' /></figure><p>This feature of Princess Diana all but cinches the round for her: with all the blessings and gifts offered to her by the Olympian Gods, she is durable against nearly all types of attacks, her physical strength around the same level as that of Superman, and she can also fly around the battlefield, perhaps including this as part of her dodging patterns.</p><p>Her immunity to pain is probably similar to Wolverine's, and though each of them have augmented recuperative powers, Wonder Woman's tactical skills tilt the scales in her favor.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Wolverine: The Best There Is</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wolverine-by-frank-miller.jpg' /></figure><p>Wolverine believes himself to be \"The Best There is\", suggesting that he is superior at what he does than anyone else, regardless of their backstory. The Office of National Emergency, better known as O*N*E*, has categorized Logan under \"Severe Threat,\" a tier occupied by the likes of Cable, Mystique and Storm.</p><p>Similarly, S.H.I.E.L.D. data pegs him at around \"Power Level 9\", much like it does Iron Man. Wolverine is definitely a serious deal, but the ancient question remains: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-xmen-wolverine-cyclops-important-mutant/\">Will Jean ever choose him over Scott</a>?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Tie: Bond With Animals</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wolverine-Wonder-Woman-Animal-Bond.jpg' /></figure><p>If this isn't a strange thing to find in common between these two characters, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-vs-harley-quinn-who-would-win/\">consider that Harley Quinn</a> is also one of the biggest animal-lovers in the DC universe.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-vs-emma-frost-who-would-win/\">Wonder Woman Vs Emma Frost: Who Would Win?</a></span></p><p>Wonder Woman is able to reach out to any variety of creature, even \"manipulating\" them on her behest whenever necessary. Wolverine, being borderline feral in the first place, is likewise capable of exchanging information with animals, but at a slightly more limited pace than Diana.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Winner: Wonder Woman</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wonder-woman-mikel-janin-header.jpg' /></figure><p>Wolverine is strong, stronger than most, but he's not Wonder Woman, and not by a long shot. She, the Princess Diana, is the heir to the Amazon race, which by itself bestows her with enough strength to best Weapon X.</p><p>However, taking into account that her genetic father is Zeus, the literal king of the Greek Gods, puts her far beyond the (relatively) mediocre mutant abilities possessed by her opponent. Wonder Woman will take this match, and in her benevolence, will not kill Wolverine (not that he would die so easily, anyway).</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-wolverine-best-worst-moments/\">X-Men: 5 Times Wolverine Was The Best Mutant (&#38; 5 He Was The Worst)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:00:44 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Upward-Slant-1.jpg","linkMd5":"5a2ec1d8ea779c6303f4f16538e971b6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn51@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-406_f489a9a39df90884.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":326542,"destBytes":326542,"author":"Ajay Aravind","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Upward-Slant-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn51@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-406_f489a9a39df90884.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wonder-Woman-Magic.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn65@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-34-065_ca0689ff30ef2c33.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/05.-HATE-Wolverine-Claws-Popped-Explosion-Fire.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-40-572_05c3fe4fdeb1d566.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/wonder-woman-explaining-lasso.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn90@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-42-454_99e7980912bd0f53.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wolverine-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn94@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-42-436_d54bed0e8ebecbf7.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Wonder-Woman-Dead-Earth-Fight-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn22@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-41-880_78877cc79884cf6d.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wolverine-Assassin.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn68@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-38-271_63994b1581ddc392.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-11-at-5.13.39-PM.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-44-289_48762524bd124d5d.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wolverine-by-frank-miller.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn72@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-43-718_8c07c4c5c4315236.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Wolverine-Wonder-Woman-Animal-Bond.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn23@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-35-157_be90acbda1cde536.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wonder-woman-mikel-janin-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn33@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-43-601_1d8836c770b2d360.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989066},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"The Misfit of Demon King Academy: Anos Faces a Supposedly Reborn Hero","link":"https://www.cbr.com/misfit-of-demon-king-academy-anos-faces-revisionist-history-supposedly-reborn-hero/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/eleanor-bianca-happy.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: the following contains spoilers for Episode 9 of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-misfit-of-demon-king-academy/\">The Misfit of Demon King Academy</a>, now streaming on Crunchyroll.</strong></em></p><p>2,000 years in the past, Anos <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-misfit-of-demon-king-academy-episode-7-emilia-anos-clash-pride/\">the demon king </a>faced the great Hero Kanon and his ally Jerga, and while Kanon was interested in diplomacy, Jerga was not.

It's situated on a lake, with bridges leading to campus, and Anos throws open the front gates. It's not long before a student there, Eleanor Bianca, welcomes Anos' squad after learning who they are, as people can't visit campus without permission. Eleanor is friendly enough, and shows Anos' gang the extensive library of Arclanskia, but that is where things get awkward.</p><p>They teach history here at Arclanskia, but not the history that Anos remembers. Eleanor tells them the tale of the great Hero Kanon conjuring four great magic walls that divided the world into quarters, in order to protect the human realm from the demon realm. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/misfit-of-demon-king-academy-anos-name-mission/\">Obviously that's a piece of revisionist history</a>, but Anos can't bring himself to contradict Eleanor while she's telling the tale. She also says that the great demon king from the Age of Chaos was a certain Avos Dilhevia, proving that this conspiracy extends to the human realm.

According to her, Kanon and Jerga formed the Kanon Jerga reincarnation family, where Kanon had seven sources that have each been reborn into seven different people. All the humans here are certain that their legendary defender is now a whole squad, but Anos is skeptical. He is sure that Kanon had just one real source and six duds, so he wants to find the \"real\" reincarnation and and deal with just them. Anos was there when he faced Kanon and his overly eager agent Jerga, and knows that Jerga was a reckless man who attacked unprovoked, while Kanon was interested in diplomacy. Anos has every reason to find Kanon's true reincarnation and get some help setting the record straight.</p><p>Speaking of which, two so-called reincarnations of Kanon arrive. The first is a bookish student named Ledriano Kanon Azeschen, who is not entirely pleased to see Demon King students here. Right after him comes the hulking Laos Kanon Jilfor, who is ready to prove himself in combat. He charges at Anos, who uses a mere blink of his eyes to knock Laos back. Already, Anos is making enemies here at Arclanskia, and he's making slow headway toward finding the true Kanon (and dispelling the revisionist myth of Avos Dihelvia). Worse yet, Eleanor explains something strange to Anos: 2,000 years ago, Kanon was killed not by a demon, but by a fellow human.

With a style the blends the eastern and western animation, what is fairly certain so far is that this upcoming series will stand out among the other Crunchyroll Originals in a visual sense.</p><p>It seemingly has taken notes from other fantasy-related media, with hints of inspiration from magical girl anime, mixed together with a bit of western style that makes it reminiscent of cartoons like <em>The Owl House </em>or <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/questions-about-steven-universe-answered/\">Steven Universe</a></em>. It'll definitely be an interesting cocktail of styles to be sure.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Worried: Style Over Substance?</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Rosemary-High-Guardian-Spice-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>While style is definitely an important part of an animated series, there does need to be some substance behind it to really get the viewer's hooked on it. So far, <em>High Guardian Spice's </em>plot is rather vague, so it's not entirely clear what the series is actually about just yet.</p><p>What is known is that'll be about the four ensemble girls training to become guardians, but that's about it. Details about this show's story seem to be hidden for now until it's finally released, which might be intentional (saving the good stuff for the right time) but it does create the unease that the series might be style over substance.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Excited: It's Been Developed By A Diverse Creative Team</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Raye-Rodriguez-Creator-of-High-Guardian-Spice-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-men-and-women-racially-diverse-backgrounds/\">Diversity is very important</a>, and it's something that the animation industry as a whole could be more open to.

For <em>High Guardian Spice, </em>its creative team has a lot of unknowns and newcomers who haven't had a lot of prior work to speak for this show's quality.</p><p>This in no way implies that newcomers can't pull off something impressive, but there's not a lot of previous work from the known creative team behind this show that immediately translates to how it'll play out.

Not much is known about Rosemary and company, what can be said is that all of these character designs are so varied and distinct from one another.</p><p>Each character's look is not just diverse but also eye-catching, making each one feel unique when compared to another. From what little has been seen, they also have the potential to be incredibly expressive and maybe even become recognizable thanks to their distinct designs.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Worried: Vague Characterization So Far</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/High-Guardian-Spice-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>While the show does have characters that are all varied and uniquely designed, their personalities so far remain vague. Since there has been no proper trailer about the series itself, there's no way to gauge just what kind of characters Rosemary or the others actually are.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/crunchyroll-anime-awards-winners-loved-hated-controversy/\">The Crunchyroll Anime Awards: 5 Winners Fans Loved And 5 That Caused Controversy</a></span></p><p>From the promotional images, it seems like Rosemary is the happy-go-lucky adventurous type and Thyme seems to be more of the strong aloof one, but there's only so much that one can get from a few images alone.

Though originality is very much welcomed nonetheless.

That means that the Dragon of the Moon or the Marvel Universe Moondragon could always tap into these things and turn the merged Moondragon evil, not unlike Cassandra Nova famously took over the body of Charles Xavier. There's still a chance the main Moondragon could grow bitter again, co-opting Moondragon 2.0 from the inside when she sees how much Phyla-Vell is in love.

It could become jealous or see them as threats, leading to another psychic war. If this is the case, the main Moondragon may also look to heal the relationship with Drax, since the merged Moondragon and him seem to have hit it off. Simply put, the outsider came over and took everything from the main Moondragon, so the latter could be playing a long game in an effort to turn Drax into the Destroyer again.</p><p>What makes this possibility so worrying is the sinister Moondragon would know all the Guardians' flaws and weaknesses, and she'd easily know how to fake it with Phyla-Vell by spending time in the alternate's body. In so doing, she can manipulate her teammates with a body that holds much more power and become the ultimate Moondragon, even by seeking revenge on those who moved on while she couldn't. Whether she's using Moondragon's collective tragic past or her own demons, she's co-piloting and could be ready to jump into the driver's seat without the Guardians even realizing what's going on, and she could turn the Marvel team into unwitting pawns in her grand cosmic schemes.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-hercules-new-boyfriend/\">Guardians of the Galaxy #6 Reveals Hercules' New Boyfriend</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 03:20:22 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-feature-1.jpg","linkMd5":"bcec69b52748e6585011f61e72d34d43","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn75@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-30-870_6b58d499d81bcc89.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":227370,"destBytes":227370,"author":"Renaldo Matadeen","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-feature-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn75@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-30-870_6b58d499d81bcc89.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/moondragon.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn8@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-35-038_16af04f647332ab6.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/moondragon-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn35@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-40-331_7ce525778b5b62f5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989060},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"10 Of The Craziest Things To Happen In Ultimate Spider-Man, Ranked","link":"https://www.cbr.com/craziest-things-in-marvel-ultimate-spider-man/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ultimate-Spider-Man-cover-photo.jpg\"/></figure><p>At a time when <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/spider-man/\">Spider-Man</a> stories became more and more controversial with <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-spider-man-90s-clone-saga-bad-good/\">stories such as the original</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/clone-saga/\">clone saga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel/\">Marvel</a> introduced the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/ultimate-spider-man/\">Ultimate Spider-Man</a> with the arrival of the new <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/ultimate-marvel/\">Ultimate Universe</a>.

Their parents, Richard Parker and Eddie Brock Sr. worked together on \"The Suit\" which was designed to heal peoples' bodies upon attaching to it. The suit was even supposed cure diseases such as cancer. Peter tried it out, transforming into the black suited Spider-Man, and realized the dangerous potential of the substance. From that point, he tried to destroy it, but Eddie Brock took it and became <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/venom/\">Venom</a> in spite of this. This version of Venom is a prime example of good intentions gone wrong and with their history, he serves as a much more sympathetic character.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Aunt May's Character</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Aunt-May-Ultimate-Universe.jpg' /></figure><p>Another character that is changed for the better in this new universe is none other <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-best-worst-aunt-may-versions/\">than Peter's</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/aunt-may/\">Aunt May</a>.

For starters, he got his powers on a trip to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/oscorp-industries/\">Oscorp</a> which gave him more of a connection to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/norman-osborn/\">Norman Osborn</a>. Additionally, the spider was not radioactive, but did contain the OZ formula which would have some more unexpected effects.</p><p>As far as his relationships go, not only does Mary Jane appear much earlier than in the original comics, but Peter also tells her very early on that he is Spider-Man. This is huge as it was kept such a huge secret from everyone around him, especially Mary Jane in the Earth-616 universe. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spiderman-best-worst-versions-uncle-ben/\">Uncle Ben is around much longer</a> before his death and with this the relationship between Peter and himself is much more developed.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Carnage's Creation</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Carnage-Ultimate-Spider-Man.jpg' /></figure><p>Similar to Venom, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/carnage/\">Carnage</a> came about in a very different way in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spiderman-carnage-best-versions/\">the Ultimate Universe</a>. To create it, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/curt-connors/\">Doc Connors</a> uses his genetic materials as well as Spider-Man's blood. As a result, Carnage wanted to be Peter and used his DNA to complete his form. Similar to his Earth-616 counterpart, this form was a hellish version of Peter.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-peter-parker-spider-man-ultimate-616/\">5 Things Ultimate Spider-Man Did Great (&#38; 5 Things 616 Did Better)</a></span></p><p>To add insult to injury, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/character-changes-marvel-ultimate-universe-didnt-last/\">Carnage even kills</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/gwen-stacy/\">Gwen Stacy</a> and absorbs her into it in gruesome fashion. Although Gwen Stacy was eventually brought back, permanently free of Carnage, it was still a shocking twist of fate for the character in the first place.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>A Very Different Green Goblin</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Green-Goblin-Ultimate-Universe.jpg' /></figure><p>The Ultimate <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/green-goblin/\">Green Goblin</a>, noted by many as one of the best variations of the character, has his <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ultimate-green-goblin-different-classic-same/\">fair share of differences</a> from the original Norman Osborn. For instance, he underwent a mutation which turned him into a big, hulking, demonic monster contrary to Earth-616 where he wears a suit. The mutation also gives him incredible strength as well as fire powers. In this universe, he is also the leader of the Sinister Six. With this and their shared connection, Green Goblin cements himself early on as Peter's arch enemy.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Death of Spider-Man</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Death-of-Spider-Man.jpg' /></figure><p>In what has to be the most shocking event of the series, Spider-Man meets his end at the hands of Green Goblin and other villains. This proves to be a much more gruesome, sad death than many of his others throughout comic book history. For starters, he takes a bullet for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/captain-america/\">Captain America</a>, injuring himself for the fight that is to come. This is also when Aunt May shoots Electro, sadly only barely delaying Spider-Man's death.</p><p>The story sees him face off against Green Goblin and the Sinister Six, the former of which deals the killing blow.

While they eventually found Tic's missing father, they got roped up in a conspiracy that involved the Order of the Ancient Dawn and a group of white men who called themselves the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-why-sons-adam-ritual-failed/\">Sons of Adam</a>. These men were led by Samuel Braithwaite, a wizard who planned on using Atticus to open a door to the Garden of Eden. After <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-sons-of-adams-true-mastermind/\">Samuel's plans were thwarted</a>, Tic, Letitia and Montrose returned home following <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-episode-2-atticus-reunite-montrose-kills-off-george/\">George's tragic death</a>.</p><p>In the latest episode, \"Holy Ghost,\" Leti receives a large inheritance, which is secretly from Christina Braithwaite, and buys a house in an all-white neighborhood. However, the house is actually haunted by ghosts. But while the episode and its terrors are mostly self-contained, \"Holy Ghost\" may have a major connection to the larger Lovecraft mythos at the heart of the HBO series.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-atticus-george-montrose-real-father-question/\">Lovecraft Country: Atticus May Not Be Who We Think He Is</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lovecraft-Country-Letitia-header.jpeg\"/></figure><p>Shortly after moving into the Winthrop house, Leti realizes it's haunted by the ghosts of several mutilated Black people. She then dives into research about the history of her house, eventually learning Winthrop was a member of the Sons of Adam before he was eventually kicked out of the group. What's more, the house then belonged to a man named Hiram Epstein, a white scientist who experimented on African Americans inside his home. But Epstein wasn't just any old type of scientist -- he was an astrophysicist. Given that his field of study relates to the stars, it seems very strange that he performed torturous experiments on people, since his goals weren't medical or anything of the like.</p><p>Given Winthrop and Epstein's connections to the Sons of Adam, it's possible their experiments were done in the name of the Order of the Ancient Dawn's cosmic goals. Either they too were searching for a means to open the gates to the Garden of Eden, or perhaps their goals stretched even further than that.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-introduces-different-horror/\">Lovecraft Country Reveals a VERY Different Kind of Horror</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lovecraft-Country-Order-of-the-Ancient-Dawn.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>Lovecraft Country</em> obviously draws from author H.P. Lovecraft's mythology. The series premiere alone featured an appearance <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-series-premiere-cthulhu-debut-dream-sequence/\">from Cthulhu</a> (in a dream), as well as the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-series-premiere-shoggoth-explainer/\">monstrous Shoggoth</a>. The second episode of the series also mentioned the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lovecraft-country-necronomicon-explainer/\">Necronomicon</a>, a book that is said to contain spells meant to summon the Old Ones, ancient, god-like aliens who once ruled the Earth. Since Epstein was an astrophysicist and Winthrop was a member of the Sons of Adam, it's possible their experiments were connected to rituals meant to summon the Old Ones.</p><p>Now that Leti has helped the ghosts in her house find peace, perhaps she will learn more about the Winthrop house's previous owners, and its connection to the Sons of Adam -- and, by extension, Atticus.</p><p><em>Starring Jonathan Majors, Jurnee Smollett, Aunjanue Ellis, Abbey Lee, Jada Harris, Wunmi Mosaku and Michael K.

Heroes, like <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/without-peter-parker-spider-woman-lead-sony-spider-verse/\">Spider-Woman</a> and Spider-Girl, found their origins in secret government experiments and mystical societies. These different sources of spider-powers gave each Spider-hero their own set of abilities and worlds to protect. However, one hero shared both the same origin as Peter Parker, and she was bitten by the exact same spider. And that's how Cindy Moon was transformed into the hero Silk.</p><p>During the events of <em>Original Sin</em>, the Watcher's eyes, taken after his brutal murder, began to unleash the many secrets that Uatu had witnessed throughout the universe, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/what-nick-fury-whispered-thor-unworthy/\">secrets that even cut down gods</a>. Peter Parker learned of the secret history of Cindy Moon, a girl who was bitten on the same radioactive spider before it drew its last breath. As seen in the pages of 2014's <em>Amazing Spider-Man #</em>4, by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos, Peter saw how her inability to control her powers led Ezekiel Sims to discover her presence. Warning her of Morlun and his family of Inheritors, he convinced Cindy to remain hidden in a secret bunker, concealing her existence from the rest of the world.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/sony-multiple-marvel-series-silk/\">Sony Developing Netflix-Style 'Suite' of Marvel Series, Starting With Silk</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Silk-Original-Suit.jpg\"/></figure><p>When Cindy emerged after years of boredom, she was at first enraged and excited by the prospect. After Peter opened the bunker, she at first responded by attacking the man that had made her sacrifice worthless, as Morlun was then able to detect her presence. Peter saw firsthand how Silk's powers differed from his own. Shooting barb-tipped webs from her fingertips, Cindy possessed far greater speed than Peter at the cost of being slightly weaker. Additionally, Cindy was far more attuned to her Spider-Sense, giving her better reflexes in battle.</p><p>Due to sharing the same spider, Peter and Cindy share a rather complex relationship. Upon releasing her, Peter came to realize that Cindy was, at one point, destined to replace him. However, he lost this chance to stop being Spider-Man when he decided to continue being a hero. Cindy was well-aware of her potential as a hero and as the future head of the proverbial Spider-Family. The two were also extremely attracted to each other, thanks to pheromones that came from being bitten by the same spider. This created, in Peter's words, \"the urge to mate like spider-bunnies.\" Aside from this awkward situation, Peter worked to ensure that Cindy could restart her life, following years of isolation.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-ends-of-the-earth-guide/\">Ends of the Earth: A Complete Guide to Spider-Man's Sinister Six Epic</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/silk-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>Cindy's biggest role was during the events of the original \"<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/spider-verse/\">Spider-Verse</a>\" where she also donned a new costume. Sensing the pending arrival of the Inheritors, she attempted to hide Peter himself and take the lead. When this didn't come to pass, Cindy found herself a central role in the conflict as the Bride, one of the most powerful and important Spider-Totems to their enemy. Working with Spider-Woman and Spider-Man Noir, Cindy went on the run, but her inexperience in battle would eventually lead to her capture. After the Spider-forces freed her, Cindy would, in return, save Peter Parker in his confrontation with Morlun. After this battle, Cindy was completely free and able to pursue her own life.</p><p>In her civilian life, Cindy took a job at the Fact Channel, using the company's resources to track down her missing family that had disappeared in her time away. Silk continued to fight crime, even going undercover to take on the Black Cat's criminal organization. Currently, she serves as a member of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/agents-of-atlas/\">Agents of the Atlas</a>, having joined the team during the <em>War of the Realms</em>. Although she has joined the larger superhero community, Silk continues to come to Peter's aid whenever he needs it. When the Red Goblin attacked Peter's family, he relied on Cindy's help to save his loved ones. Now, with the rise of Kindred, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/amazing-spider-man-miles-morales-team/\">Cindy is sure to return to Peter's side</a> to help in his greatest battle yet.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-sin-eater-targets-green-goblin/\">Spider-Man: Sin-Eater's Next Target Is a MAJOR Marvel Villain</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 18:20:44 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Spider-Man-Silk.jpg","linkMd5":"294ee8cc68cba9ac60aa84adb207f3a0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn29@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-31-161_c56a8dd2f27a611a.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":138178,"destBytes":138178,"author":"Paul Yang","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Spider-Man-Silk.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn29@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-31-161_c56a8dd2f27a611a.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Silk-Original-Suit.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-40-256_3e640cc304775dd9.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/silk-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn12@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-39-517_30363bffc2a1b197.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989074},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"John Ridley Addresses the 'Black Heroes With Electrical Powers' Trope ","link":"https://www.cbr.com/john-ridley-black-heroes-electrical-powers-trope/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/OUTSIDERS-Black-Lightning.jpg\"/></figure><p>With the first issue of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/dc-black-label/\">DC Black Label</a> series <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-other-history-of-the-dc-universe/\">The Other History of the DC Universe</a></em> showcasing Black Lightning -- DC's first Black hero to lead his own title -- writer John Ridley mused about the trope of Black superheroes having electricity-based powers.</p><p>Ridley spoke to <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/9/3/21408118/dc-comics-alternate-history-other-black-lightning-john-ridley-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Polygon</a>, which noted that DC characters <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-lightning/\">Black Lightning</a> and Static, as well as the Marvel characters Storm and the Miles Morales Spider-Man, have such abilities in common.

And it's not one of those things where you can, at least to me, draw a line and go, 'Oh, well' — like the way Asian characters are usually going to have karate-related powers. And for a long time you went 'OK, sure, why not?' And you look at it now and go, 'Well, yeah, why couldn’t an Asian individual have these kinds of powers or those kinds of powers,' and certainly they can.\"</p><p>He then pointed out where the comparison fails, saying, \"But with lightning powers, it's not — at least in an way that I could look at and go, 'Oh, well, this goes back to something in the culture,' or something in storytelling that became a trope for perhaps the wrong reasons or perhaps overly identifiable reasons.\"</p><p>Ridley didn't draw a definitive conclusion, although he noted, \"It’s certainly nothing in particular that I look at as a person of color and go, 'Oh, man, people have been doing that and it’s wrong because it leads to this, this or this.'....

If done right, slow-burn horror can provide a terrific payoff to the audience. Manga, with its tendency to luxuriate in slower pacing, can shock a reader with the turn of a page. One series in particular blends slow-burn horror and intricately detailed artwork to become the \"greatest zombie manga ever\": Kengo Hanazawa's <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/i-am-a-hero/\">I Am a Hero</a></em>.</p><p>Published from 2009 to 2017, across 22 volumes,<em> I Am a Hero</em> centers on manga art assistant Hideo Suzuki, who dreams of becoming a successful artist even while his proposals are repeatedly rejected. Not helping matters is that his job is exhausting and low-paying, and his girlfriend is unfaithful. Then, one day, while going practice shooting with his hunting shotgun, Hideo finds himself in the midst of a zombie apocalypse.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/into-the-spider-verse-peni-parker-deserves-her-own-anime/\">Into the Spider-Verse: Peni Parker Deserves Her Own Anime</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/I-am-a-hero-apartment.jpg\"/></figure><p>The dance that Hideo Suzuki performs when he enters his apartment tells us that something isn't quite right with him. Even more unsettling is the hallucinations that he experiences: Arms sprout out from the blinds next to his bed, and he can see a face peering out at him from the peephole in his door. Hideo's strange antics set the tone for the manga as twisted with a sense of humor. The claustrophobic nature of Hideo's apartment heightens the tense atmosphere we've been thrust into, and that's just the start.</p><p>Hideo surrounds himself with manga and holds his shotgun before dosing off. The next morning, his TV turns on, and we are informed of what is being claimed as an arson attack on a senior home. Before Hideo switches the channel, the reporter says, \"In addition to burns on the corpses...\" We are left to imagine what else the reporter had to say, but we can guess that it would be something along the lines of \"bite marks on the corpses.\"</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-misfit-of-demon-king-academy-episode-8-sheilas-salvation/\">The Misfit of Demon King Academy Reveals the Key To Sheila's Salvation</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-am-a-hero-zombie.jpg\"/></figure><p>All throughout the first half of the first volume, there is the sense of impending chaos; incidents are commented upon and reported about in the background. Even Hideo's coworkers, while maintaining a level of normalcy in their daily lives, can't help but gossip about sudden attacks on people, with most of them involving being bitten.</p><p>The first glimpse we get of an actual zombie is when Hideo visits his girlfriend after work. On the way, he notices a large, scary tree, and then witnesses a car crash. To his horror, as well as that of other onlookers, the person hit by the vehicle gets up and walks away, her neck snapped backward and her mangled leg trailing behind. Even worse is we hear that bystanders who tried to help were bitten by the victim.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-am-a-hero-apocalypse.jpg\"/></figure><p>Eventually, Hideo learns that his girlfriend, Tekko, has become infected with a disease the government dubs ZQN, which causes people to become homicidal. After Hideo does away with Tekko, all hell breaks loose, albeit in a way where, in one part of town, people will literally be eaten on one side, and other people will nonchalantly comment on the events happening before them and carry on with their day on the other side.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-god-of-high-school-mira-fighting-solo-episode-9-clip/\">The God of High School: Mira's Fighting Solo in Exclusive Episode 9 Clip</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-am-a-hero-tekko-zombie.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>I Am a Hero</em> is slow with the way it presents its horror. The series knows to show and not tell, and it is through overheard conversations that Hideo -- and, thus, the reader -- learns the world is about to change, mostly for the worse. When the zombie apocalypse that we were promised on the book's cover comes to pass, it's tremendously rewarding.</p><p>An example of that is when Hideo learns that Tekko has become infected with ZQN. While crossing the bridge on the way to her apartment, he notices military vehicles are driving beneath; it's  an indication that, yes, something terrible is about to happen. Hideo ascends the staircase and peeks through the mail slot of Tekko's apartment door. The point of view switches to Hideo's view from the mail slot, and we see Tekko in bed. She sits up, despite Hideo's insistence that she not bother herself. She seems unaware of his pleas, and crawls out of her bed. As she gets closer to the door, the tension ratchets up to a fever pitch, before she reveals her face in all its disheveled glory.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\"><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/how-fist-of-the-north-star-perfected-manly-tears/\">RELATED: Boys DO Cry: How Fist of the North Star Perfected ‘Manly Tears’</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-am-a-hero-hideo-vs-tekko.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>I Am a Hero</em> is a zombie manga masterpiece. By making the reader empathize with each character and detailing their struggles, the horror is increased tenfold. Instead of plunging us headfirst into the zombie apocalypse, we are guided into the life of Hideo Suzuki, before seeing the world around him slowly be ripped apart in grizzly fashion. Because of this unconventional style of portraying the zombie apocalypse, it may very well be \"the greatest zombie manga ever.\"</p><p><em>I Am a Hero was published in 2009, and has a total of 22 volumes.</em></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING:<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/burn-the-witch-dragons-hollows-explained/\"> Burn the Witch: Dragons, the Hollows of Reverse London, Explained</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 22:00:50 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/i-am-a-hero.jpg","linkMd5":"1b32ab8c1942b6c3d284aa478e7b3a01","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn49@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-29-318_ba7073d771691c75.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":158708,"destBytes":158708,"author":"Marcus Jones","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/i-am-a-hero.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn49@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-29-318_ba7073d771691c75.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/I-am-a-hero-apartment.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-35-242_9a0d8e2060585c11.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-am-a-hero-zombie.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn91@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-36-655_0a7b2a83c2d5c6ba.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-am-a-hero-apocalypse.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn99@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-36-513_4df1caddb1359e0b.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-am-a-hero-tekko-zombie.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn46@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-34-029_466799e9eb1ed260.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/i-am-a-hero-hideo-vs-tekko.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn69@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-41-471_11fa381a32d389cc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989068},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"DC: 10 Weird Facts About Power Girl | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/power-girl-weird-facts/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Power-Girl.jpg\"/></figure><p>Power Girl is one of the most interesting and confusing DC Comics characters.

Due to some cosmic event, Power Girl ended up being transferred to Earth 1 and just stayed there.</p><p>The creators of the character wanted to highlight that she was <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dceu-comic-stories-supergirl-film/\">different from Supergirl</a>.

Stan Lee helped turn <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/Marvel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marvel</a> into the powerhouse it is today, helping to create Spider-Man, the X-Men, and Iron Man. What is interesting to note is that Stan Lee really didn’t like Power Girl.</p><p>The reasoning behind this comes from the time that Marvel was sued by DC after introducing a character known as Wonder Man, saying it was too close to Wonder Woman.

In his prolonged absence, certain demons had started to rebel against him, and he had to return to claim his throne and get everyone back in line. As Season 5 began, fans saw Lucifer continue to act as warden of Hell, but another person who looked just like him returned in Chloe's life. This doppelganger was actually the archangel Michael, Lucifer's twin brother. Michael resents Lucifer for many reasons, but especially because he always felt Lucifer acted as if he was better than him.</p><p>Throughout the eight-episode long first half of the season, Michael played an intricate game to get his revenge on his brother. Some of his plots worked, while others less so. However, the truth is, Michael could have easily won, he just had the completely wrong plan.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lucifer-why-the-show-goes-black-white-for-an-entire-episode/\">Lucifer: Why The Show Goes Black &#38; White For An Entire Episode</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lucifer-season-5-Michael-Chloe.jpg\"/></figure><p>When Michael first arrived on Earth, he started by posing as Lucifer. His goal was to take his brother's place, gaining the trust of his friends and loved ones until he would finally be ready to strike and dismantle the life Lucifer had built. This plan was, of course, all built around Chloe. Michael hoped that he would be able to seduce her and even sleep with her, something that would be sure to be torturous for her as well as Lucifer when the truth would be revealed.</p><p>However, things didn't work out that way at all. In fact, almost as soon as she saw him, Chloe knew this Lucifer wasn't the real deal. She played him until she was finally ready to confront him, at which point Michael revealed his true self. Then, the real Lucifer returned to stop his brother's rampage, placing Amenadiel in charge of Hell while he cleaned up Michael's mess. Lucifer then spent a bit of time reconnecting with Chloe while Michael disappeared. Then, Amenadiel later returned, revealing that God had told him Hell was no longer in need of a warden, allowing him to return home to his newborn son Charlie.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lucifer-michael-disappointing-season-5-villain/\">Lucifer: Michael Is A Disappointing Season 5 Villain</a></span></p><p>As for Michael, he only returned later on, revealing Lucifer's real, demonic nature to Dan. While this dismantled one of the stable friendships in Lucifer's life, it didn't have the intended effect. Indeed, Dan turned on Lucifer but when Chloe's life ended up being in danger, the two were able to put their differences aside to rescue the missing detective. Then, Michael continued to toy with both Maze and Amenadiel, turning the former against Lucifer and tormenting the latter by manipulating his fears.</p><p>All of this was part of his continuing plan to get revenge on Lucifer, but the bigger picture was never really made clear. And yet, there is something else Michael could have done instead, something that would have completely uprooted Lucifer's life, and endangered the entire world. In reality, it's simple: instead of taking Lucifer's place on Earth, he should have just taken his place in Hell.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lucifer-season-5-reveals-why-devil-can-be-hurt/\">Lucifer Reveals Why the Devil Can Be Hurt</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lucifer-Season-4-Hell-Header.jpg\"/></figure><p>When Amenadiel returned to Earth, he left Hell without a warden. This would have been the perfect opportunity for Michael to take his twin's place as ruler of the underworld. In this new role, Michael could have completely changed Hell and turned all of the demons on Lucifer -- if not the entire world. In fact, in Season 4, fans saw the amount of trouble a small number of demons set loose upon Los Angeles could cause. However, with Michael in Hell, he could have set loose hundreds more on the world to make Lucifer's life a living hell.</p><p>Of course, since there is still a whole second half of Season 5 that has yet to be released, Michael's full plan is still a mystery. It's possible that this really is his endgame, and fans certainly hope so, because it would set up one hell of a final season.</p><p><em>Lucifer stars Tom Ellis as Lucifer Morningstar, Lauren German as Det.

But in the timeline eventually known as the World of the Coinless, Tommy didn't join the Power Rangers after being freed from her control. Instead, he remained alongside Rita and worked alongside her to conquer the Earth - leading to a final battle against Zordon and the Power Rangers. Taking the title Drakkon from a story Rita told him, Tommy ended up winning the day -- killing the Red Ranger, destroying Zordon, and taking the energies of the Power Rangers for himself. Drakkon's rule proved to be cruel and efficient, leading to a world controlled by Drakkon and his armies of Ranger Sentries.</p><p>After murdering Rita and corrupting the Pink Ranger Kimberly (turning her into the fearsome Ranger Slayer before the effects of his brainwashing were reversed). Drakkon eventually came up against the Power Rangers of the Mighty Morphin Universe, with the team proving capable of (barely) defeating Drakkon. The villain eventually broke free and set off the events of<em> </em><em>Shattered Grid</em>, rallying an army of like-minded and dangerous Rangers to help him try to conquer the multiverse.</p><p>Stealing the powers of the Morphin Grid and the Heart of the Master, Drakkon even briefly destroyed the multiverse and replaced it with a world of his creation, where he was beloved and accepted by the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Eventually confronted by the specter of that universe's Tommy, Drakkon is faced directly with his crimes. Eventually defeated by this resurrected other version of himself, Drakkon seemed to perish when the world fell apart around him. He remains one of the most dangerous and evil villains the Power Rangers have ever encountered. But could he ever be redeemed?</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/power-rangers-drakkon-unknown-ranger-mystery/\">Power Rangers: Drakkon Introduces A NEW Mystery Ranger</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Power-Rangers-Drakkon-Green-Ranger.jpg\"/></figure><p>Drakkon was revealed to have survived this destruction through some unknown means, arriving in the Mighty Morphin Universe. He's quickly captured by the Power Rangers though and imprisoned within the Power Ranger's base. He's been taunting the Rangers ever since, suggesting that they could be as dark as him if they wanted to be. He hints at the dark power somewhere out there in the universe and suggests that it's a far more powerful threat than they've ever encountered in their own adventures. All of this has led Drakkon to develop a cruel relationship with the Power Rangers, with Kimberly even coming close to killing him while confronting him.</p><p>While the core-Tommy Oliver was able to force some semblance of humanity and regret out of Drakkon. But the villain has never shown any desire to actually change who he is for the better. The Rangers will certainly never fully trust the villain, especially after all the damage he brought to the universe during his reign. But the Power Rangers might not have a choice. With the threats to the Earth growing with each day, Grace has suggested that Drakkon be given the repaired Dragon Ranger Coin, turning him back into the Green Ranger. And that time may have come already, as the Dark Rangers are overwhelming the team in their first real battle. With the group already being beaten back, they might need the kind of ruthless brutality that Drakkon could bring to the battlefield.</p><p>Drakkon might make the perfect reluctant reinforcements for the Power Rangers. While he may not want to change who he is, he could be the ultimate secret weapon for the Power Rangers.

But after being left by her husband and exposed to demonic influences, Pryor became one of the X-Men's most cruel villains. She caused the events of <em>Inferno</em> in a bid to sacrifice her own son to achieve more power, and has been a demonic threat to the X-Men ever since. Unlike almost all other mutants - even former enemies such as Apoacaypse - Pryor hasn't been welcomed into Krakoa. Other demonic figures (like Magik) and cloned villains (Harpoon) have been given homes on Krakoa. Even Mister Sinister has been found a place there - and he's been made part of the Quiet Council, making him more powerful than ever.</p><p>From Pryor's perspective, there's no reason she shouldn't be a part of the current Krakoa life. That's why she's decided to bring it down and cause sheer mayhem for the mutants. Using her undead variants of the Marauders, Pryor intends to unleash <em>all</em> of the clones, a veritable army's worth. They'll use their mutant DNA to their advantage -- giving them access to the Krakoa Gates. Upon reaching the island, Pryor will unleash them as a swarm, to bring as much death and destruction as she can to the island - killing as many as possible. She intends to leave her mark on the island and become a lingering nightmare for the mutants there, ensuring they never forget Pryor again. She even intends to make a statement of purpose by killing her former lover Havok and sending his head to Cyclops.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-government-mutant-allies/\">X-Men: Marvel's Greatest Mutant Allies Are HIDING In [SPOILER]</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goblyn-Queen-Hellions-3.jpg\"/></figure><p>It's a brutal and straightforward plan, and if effective - for example, if one of the Five were to be targeted and killed - it could have a huge impact on the infrastructure of Krakoa. Luckily, while most of the team has either been killed (Empath), captured (Nanny, Orphan-Maker, and Scalphunter), or seemingly corrupted (Havok), Psylocke and Wild Child are still in the board. With Wild Child now following Pyslocke's command, it'll fall to the telepathic former villain to bring down Pryor before she can bring destruction to the island.</p><p>But it's important to remember that Pryor isn't the only one with plans to bring down Krakoa. After learning that the X-Men won't allow Destiny to be resurrected, <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/x-men-theory-mystique-is-x-of-swords-secret-villain/\">Mystique</a> has made her intentions to bring down Krakoa clear. With Pryor, the shape-shifter could potentially find an ally who doesn't want to bury the hatchet with the rest of her fellow mutants. As the X-Men approach the \"Swords of X\" crossover and prepare for more and more intense battles, it's important for the mutants to remember that there are still people out there who want them to suffer - no matter what.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-marvel-illuminati-selene-krakoa/\">X-Men: Has Marvel's New Illuminati Already Infiltrated Krakoa?</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 01:20:17 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/X-Men-Madelyne-Pryor-Goblyn-Queen.jpg","linkMd5":"fafaf32a957877a38ffc800ab6bbfa3e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn72@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-31-496_e227167fa0bc9516.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":120152,"destBytes":120152,"author":"Brandon Zachary","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/X-Men-Madelyne-Pryor-Goblyn-Queen.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn72@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-31-496_e227167fa0bc9516.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goblyn-Queen-Hellions-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn14@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-38-096_6c98bfa72a5a7d6f.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goblyn-Queen-Hellions-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn2@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-38-772_d9a28052c5953e9f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989064},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"The New Mutants Bring Down the X-Men's Most Persistent New Enemy","link":"https://www.cbr.com/new-mutants-x-men-enemy-dox/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-Mutants-DOX-1.jpg\"/></figure><p><strong><em>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/new-mutants/\">New Mutants</a> #12 by Ed Brisson, Marco Failla, Carlos Lopez, and VC's Travis Lanham, on sale now</em></strong></p><p>With the global influence of mutant-kind expanding thanks to the sudden rise of Krakoa as a genuine powerplay on a planetary scale, it makes sense that the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-men/\">X-Men</a> and their allies have to deal with new and surprising enemies.

While some have been more overtly dangerous than others (such as the mutate-assassins of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-force-domino-luck-ran-out/\">XENO</a>), one of the most persistent has been DOX. A news website within the Marvel Universe, the New Mutants have encountered DOX multiple times recently. Employing a small army of bloggers, DOX has been frequently deploying underhanded tactics to target the mutant population -- insulting them and twisting events to create a narrative where mutants are dangerous agitators.</p><p>They've even been doxxing many mutants who don't live on Krakoa by revealing their identities and locations to anyone with an internet connection. This has led to multiple incidents and attacks, with various mutants being hunted down and murdered before they can make it to the safety of Krakoa. DOX became a major concern for the New Mutants when Túmulo of the Bohem Cartel learned of Beak and Angel living off the island with their family. Attacking the family and demanding Krakoa Drugs for their safe release, the battle ended with Beak's human parents murdered by the Cartel members, and much of the criminal gang dead. Finally having enough with DOX after their \"expose\" on mutants in Carnelia, a small group of mutants decides it's finally time to do something about the website.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-editor-promises-a-massive-story-for-storm-in-2021/\">X-Men Editor Promises A Massive Story For Storm In 2021</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/New-Mutants-DOX-3.jpg\"/></figure><p>Deciding that it was time to confront DOX head-on, Magik recruits Mirage and Glob Herman to visit their office after Trinary hunts it down. After discovering the location thanks to the technopath Trinary, Magik is quick to intimidate the owner and publisher of the website, Joseph Canning. Although he tries to talk a big game about the mutants only using intimidation tactics and how DOX only ever reports \"the truth\" about events, Magik reveals that Trinary also constructed her a failsafe to deal with DOX.</p><p>The tech-using mutant inserted a flash drive into a computer connected to their servers, it's revealed that the mutants have designed a new permanent aspect of the DOX site.</p><p>Whenever a mutant is doxxed and has their personal information revealed to the world by DOX, the people making the site will have <em>their</em> personal information posted as well. If the mutants are going to get doxxed, then they're going to ensure their enemies are as well. When Canning tries ot threaten the New Mutants over this, Glob Herman lashes out and threatens to personally kill Canning if another innocent mutant death can be traced to the actions of DOX. This genuinely throws off the writers at DOX. Instead of becoming martyrs of the mutant/human conflict like they'd expected, the site can still technically operate but will expose themselves anytime they expose mutants.</p><p>But due to this new tactic, the website is revealed to later be undergoing \"maintenance\" and has been shut down, at least for now. This means that a number of attacks on mutants may be slowed down, and more of the stragglers who have not yet made it to Krakoa can finally make that journey. If this does indeed silence the hate coming from DOX, then this is an unmitigated victory for the mutants of Krakoa.

When <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-leia-organa-changes-stay-same/\">Leia</a> gives R2 a message to deliver, R2 makes a valiant effort to escape in order to deliver the message promptly.</p><p>In following R2, C-3PO is constantly fretting that they should be escaping. And when R2 gets into a pod to leave, C-3PO reluctantly follows him saying the above quote.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>\"Sometimes, I Just Don't Understand Human Behavior\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/C-3PO-Millennium-Falcon.jpg' /></figure><p>C-3PO repeatedly tries to tell <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-times-han-solo-was-right-mistaken/\">Han</a> that the hyperdrive is not functioning. But Han refuses to pay attention. C-3PO has a very nagging manner that displeases most people, and especially Han.</p><p>So when he again calls attention to the obvious, which is the difficult and troubling situation they are in, Han calls him \"the professor\" and asks <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/han-and-chewie-memes/\">Chewie</a> to take him to figure out the hyperdrive.

They are quite opposite in nature and character and hence work well in making sure the other survives.</p><p>While R2 is more courageous and adventures, C-3PO is terrified of everything and is willing to give up at any given moment. But R2's carelessness is compensated by C-3PO's excessive nagging, and C-3PO's insane cowardice is compensated by R2 heroics. Here, even in the middle of high stakes situation, R2 seems to be going to help.

But that doesn't make it less fun for the viewers.</p><p>Watching C-3PO being dragged around by this huge Wookie and have them both communicate with each other is hilarious.

C-3PO speaks like humans and is extremely funny and is a necessary character in the franchise.</p><p>But at the end of the day, it is possible for him to be in pieces and still communicate and even fix himself. The whole situation and C-3PO's cribbing about him being in pieces is quite funny.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>\"It's Against My My Programming To Impersonate A Diety\"</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ewoks-rise-of-skywalker.jpg' /></figure><p>In <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-concept-art-you-need-to-see/\">Return Of The Jedi</a></em>, the Ewoks take C-3PO to be a kind of God.

C-3PO, without a trace of irony or sarcasm says that he shouldn't be doing that.

Moe and Noah get back together, but Brady blackmails her because he knows Moe doesn't want to ruin her second shot. In addition, he's getting back at Tab for dumping him for being abusive in the past. This leads to Chase getting blamed for the crime, but in the finale, the girls leave a photo exhibit confessing they stole the test. They also out Brady for abusing girls and blackmailing them into the heist.</p><p>So, as they ditch school that day and empty El's mom's ashes, they admit they're in for a world of trouble when they get back. It felt as if their parents were going to ream them out because El was one step away from being sent to rehab, especially after running away with an indie rocker, while Moe and Tab were at Shoplifters Anonymous with bad track records of their own.

The fact El also just returns all the trinkets she stole to the stores and gets off without being arrested is quite convenient. She even buys Jillian a trinket right after returning to one of many stores, which paints the storeowners as people without a spine. It sets a bad precedent which apparently the school follows up because by not reprimanding the girls, the theme of consequence goes right out the window. Tab was distracting hotel guests so it's easy to understand her getting off, but El and Moe are dead-to-rights guilty, yet the series ends with them studying and focusing on their relationships.</p><p><em>Trinkets stars Brianna Hildebrand, Kiana Madeira, Quintessa Swindell, Brandon Butler, Odiseas Georgiadis and Larry Sullivan.

It's a testament of sacrifice that ultimately embodies the character arc of Tony Stark.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Memory Lane</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>One of the most unique pieces for Iron Man fan art, it is the one created by elite_adi_official.  Incorporating some fun splash art here, there is plenty of things to love. One of the most notable is the variety of Iron Man masks that are at the top of the art.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mcu-iron-man-endgame-tony-stark-changes/\">MCU: 10 Ways Tony Stark Changed Between Iron Man 1 &#38; Endgame</a></p><p>All circling around Tony Stark with the infinity gauntlet on his right hand, with its powers coursing through his veins. The abstract ground as it breaks beneath him only illustrates further, the power of the gauntlet as well as the gravity of Tony Stark's decision.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>The Iron Family</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>One of the most surprising but also genuinely enjoyable developments for Iron Man is the introduction of his family. Specifically his daughter Morgan. As a father, it became a point of his character that made him far wiser than he was before. As such, many fans loved this new addition and have created fan art like the one created by limaocomvodka. Since the art is based on the idea of a fun moment in time, it makes the ending of Endgame all the more depressing.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>What If Things Were Different</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>What if instead of Iron Man, it was Captain America who committed the ultimate sacrifice. Back in the comics when the Civil War was originally introduced, it was Captain America that perished. Even back when the movies were being made, some thought that Captain America dying was a possibility. So it's fun to see the dynamic switch between the two. As the relationship between them has always been a pivotal part of the MCU.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Forever Remembered</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Although this is technically not an <em>Avengers Endgame</em> piece, it is still important to have since it symbolizes the legacy that Iron Man gives to the future generation of superheroes. The grey statue showing how much many people miss the character, while also having a young Spider-Man sitting on his shoulder. Still missing him and also arguably being the living legacy of the invincible superhero.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Determined To Finish Thanos</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Created by Ultraraw26, this is an art piece that is utterly astonishing. The black and grey background with the white snow helps compliment the more somber colors of the Iron Man suit. Combined with the infinity stones, it shines brightly in the dark background along with the other lights within the Iron Man suit. The way the pose is positioned also shows a determined character who is willing to go above and beyond against Thanos.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Journeying Back Into The Past</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>This simple but fun piece is created by nandskarth. Depicting the scene where Iron Man and Captain America journey back in time to get more Pym particles and the tesseract, the piece is very clean. With soft colors and clean linework, it creates a warm and straightforward piece that also has decent expression work done as well. Probably the cheekiest thing that's in the art is the bubble on the top right corner which helps illustrate the scene further with the other character in the elevator.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>The Iron Trinity</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>This gorgeous piece is created by Camille Vialet which depicts the Iron family trinity. Specifically Tony Stark, James Rhodes' <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/iron-man-tony-stark-closest-allies/\">War Machine</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/iron-man-pepper-potts-real-hero-iron-man-avengers-tony-stark/\">Pepper Potts</a> who are probably wearing the MCU version of Rescue. It's a straightforward piece with the three being in front of an explosive background.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mcu-best-iron-man-monologues/\">MCU: 10 Best Iron Man Monologues</a></span></p><p>But what makes this piece special is the power that is put behind these three. As they are the first characters that most fans know of, it's only fair that fans are able to get them at their absolute peak. With all of their development generally getting finished and their character arcs complete at this point.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>I love You 3000</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Finally, the last piece to be talked about is the one created by art.eileenkim. Showing the last message given by Iron Man upon his death, although done a little differently, still shows the emotional weight that has been put upon his death. Showing a mixture of sadness and finality.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-tony-stark-pepper-potts-best-couple/\">Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart: 10 Reasons Pepper &#38; Tony Are The Best MCU Couple</a></span></p><p>Of course outside of that, the art is really special as it seems to have taken elements from animation like Disney or Dreamworks. The expressions from both Morgan Stark and Pepper Potts only makes this whole art piece go the extra mile overall.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dungeons-dragons-monsters-iron-man-could-destroy-would-beat-him/\">5 D&#38;D Monsters Iron Man Could Destroy (5 That Would Beat Him)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 02:00:31 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10Avengers-Endgame-Iron-Man-Fan-Art-Pictures-That-Are-Too-Good-header.jpg","linkMd5":"42a67c1d77fdd97131cc76bebe5c0106","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn79@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-30-275_e8cf28c43be6b403.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":157092,"destBytes":157092,"author":"Richie Nguyen","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10Avengers-Endgame-Iron-Man-Fan-Art-Pictures-That-Are-Too-Good-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn79@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-30-275_e8cf28c43be6b403.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Iron-Man-Fan-Art.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn72@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-39-312_ad7862ad7e473b11.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989064},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Joker War: The Batman Crossover Is Driving the DC Universe Mad","link":"https://www.cbr.com/joker-war-hallucinations-batman-nightwing-harley-quinn/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Batman-Joker-War-feature.jpg\"/></figure><p><strong><em>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for </em><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/batman\">Batman</a> #97-98, <em>by James Tynion IV, Jorge Jimenez, and Tom Morey, </em><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/harley-quinn\">Harley Quinn</a> #75, <em>by Sam Humphries, Riley Rossmo, Ngozi, Sami Basri, Emanuela Lupacchino, Joe Quinones, Riley Rossmo, Nicola Scott, Ramon Villalobos, Ray Mccarthy, Hi-Fi, Tamra Bonvillain, Anette Kwok, Ivan Plascencia, and </em><a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/nightwing\">Nightwing</a> #73, <em>by Dan Jurgens, Ryan Benjamin, Richard Friend, and Rain Beredo.</em></strong></p><p>The Joker War has engulfed the worlds of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/batman/\">Batman</a> and all of his affiliates. The <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/joker\">Joker</a> has taken over Bruce Wayne's secret Batcaves, divided up Gotham among his gangs, stolen Bruce Wayne's arsenal and forture. And now, it seems that he is even begging to take a hold over the minds of Batman and those around him.</p><p>The Joker is no stranger to madness, and those around him and those who oppose him are equally familiar with the concept. However, it seems that for Batman and Nightwing in particular things are taking a turn away from understanding and toward experiencing. Nightwing has been effectively taken over by the Joker while the souped-up fear toxin coursing through Bruce's veins (courtesy of Punchline) has him hearing the voice of the late Alfred Pennyworth - his former butler/father figure - rattling around underneath the cowl. While it's less of a new phenomenon, Harley Quinn is also experiencing some rather distressing signs of severe psychological stress; namely, a Bat-Mite-like character that arrives to taunt her about her new status in a world where Punchline has taken over her former position with the Joker.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-doom-metal-nightwings-trauma-titans/\">Justice League: Doom Metal Reveals Nightwing's Ric Grayson Trauma to the Teen Titans</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Joker-War-Nightwing-feature.jpg\"/></figure><p>Dick Grayson has been dealt a pretty bad hand in recent years. This rough ride began for Nightwing back in <em>Nightwing </em>#50 by Benjamin Percy, Christopher Mooneyham, and Travis Moore, which began to deal with the fallout of him taking a bullet from KGBeast to the head. Things looked pretty dire with Dick falling into a coma. Luckily for fans of the original Boy Wonder, Grayson woke up from the coma, but sadly he did so without any memories of his life with the Bat-Family. Over time, he has steadily put himself back together, however, his condition has been manipulated by a handful of villains. The latest in that long line is, of course, the Joker.</p><p>The Clown Prince of Crime has the former Nightwing laboring under the delusion that it was the Joker who took him in as a boy, that he hated his acrobat parents, was happy when they died, and has always gone under the incredibly unfortunate name \"Dicky Boy.\" In <em>Nightwing </em>#73, by Dan Jurgens, Ryan Benjamin, and Richard Friend, the Joker sets Dicky Boy up to fight against the previously captured Batgirl, Dick's former love interest. Not only is this further salt on an old wound for those fans who shipped Dick and Barbara, but it also shows just how deeply the Joker has inserted himself into Dick's mind with the help of the memory crystal created by Dr. Hass.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harley-Joker-War-Hallucination.jpg\"/></figure><p>For the most part, <em>Harley Quinn </em>#75  is a story about the roast of Harley Quinn which turns out to be a massive and incredibly high definition bit of introspection on the part of the former doctor. However, a back-up tale by Sam Humphries and Riley Rossmo shows the effect that Joker War is having on Harley's already shaky mental state. The story picks up after Punchline and Harley squared off in a fight that left Harley's throat slit by the Joker's new girlfriend and her body dumped into the sewer. As Harley is sinking into the water with an alarmingly large red pool of blood swirling around her, a tiny Bat-Mite-like creature appears. The creature refers to itself as a guardian angel, demon and the desperate firing of her rapidly dimming synapses.</p><p>Instead of offering comfort, the creature repeatedly informs Harley that fighting is useless and that she's going to die after having been beaten by the Joker's newer, more dangerous girlfriend. Harley's near-death experience also gives readers some insight into her past in a collection of flashbacks which help to inform the action in the comic's present while the Imp continues to taunt her about her rapidly oncoming demise via blood loss. She doesn't die, but instead swims out of the sewer, fights a pair of wanna-be Joker henchman, and sews up her gaping neck-wound with a steel guitar string. It'll take more than a deep cut and a set of graphic hallucinations to put Harley down. If anything, Harley's experience only serves to show her actively pushing the Joker out of her head.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED:<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/harley-quinn-death-metal-punchline-injury/\"> Joker War Makers Harley Quinn More METAL Than Death Metal</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-Joker-War-hallucination.jpg\"/></figure><p>Batman has hallucinated quite a bit since the start of his illustrious career. However, Bruce has recently started hearing the voice of his beloved butler/confidant echoing in his head is upsetting in a way that flashier versions of the same idea can't quite deliver to the reader. Not only is this a similar salt-in-the-wound move to having Dick attack Barbara, but it also plays well into the ideas of the Joker attacking Bruce Wayne in Joker War and not just his Batman persona.</p><p>It feels as though the Joker revealing <em>The Mask of Zorro </em>and it's a connection to Gotham's very own masked vigilante has brought Bruce to a place where he needs to look to the closest person to him, and the only person that knew him at the time that he lost his family and knows who he truly is. Unfortunately, like so many others that he has cared about, Alfred has been lost to him, which gives this bout of hallucination a far more personal feel.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING:<a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/harley-quinn-outsmarts-batman-white-knight/\"> White Knight: How Harley Quinn Outsmarts the Joker and Batman at the Same Time</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:20:59 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Batman-Joker-War-feature.jpg","linkMd5":"1d062248e061796abc45fece37690c93","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":144786,"destBytes":144786,"author":"Carter Burrowes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Batman-Joker-War-feature.jpg":null,"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Joker-War-Nightwing-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn30@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-42-035_7627f88b8f1c1431.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harley-Joker-War-Hallucination.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn49@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-42-085_75280a66efe2da8f.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Batman-Joker-War-hallucination.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn64@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-36-790_ee32fba3817b0857.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989065},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"1940s Superman Radio Series Announced for DC FanDome: Explore the Multiverse","link":"https://www.cbr.com/dc-fandome-explore-multiverse-superman-radio-series/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/SUPERMAN-COSTUMES-Golden-Age.jpg\"/></figure><p>The acclaimed 1940's <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/superman\">Superman</a> Radio Series is being recreated for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/dc-fandome/\">DC FanDome: Explore the Multiverse</a>, courtesy of Warner Bros.

After his parents died in a mysterious plane crash, Danny was rescued by a mythical place, where he trained hard to become <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-heroes-iron-fist-could-defeat-lose-to/\">the immortal Iron Fist</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-superman-best-worst-comic-costumes/\">Superman: 5 Costumes That Made Him Look Cool (&#38; 5 That Were Just Lame)</a></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Over the years in the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-comics/\">Marvel Comics</a>, Iron Fist has played with his fashion sense; wearing old but impactful clothes, thanks to his history of being with a very old organization. It's no secret that he likes the yellow and green texture but there have been many little changes made to his uniform in every other comic. Here are some of them.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>The Immortal One</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Immortal.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">When the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avengers-vs-x-men-iron-fist-phoenix-force/\">Iron Fist comic books</a> series went through a reboot in 2006, the writersーEd Brubaker and Matt Fractionーdecided to make a telling change to the look of their superhero, although they tried to keep the main parts intact. The green and yellow didn't leave its place, although the costume changed to give a more modern look. The whole body was covered, with a dragon tattoo printed right in the middle of the costume.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\">There weren't huge changes made from the classic but all of them were clearly visible. In this whole new series, Danny fought shirtless a couple of times as well but he never changed his costume. He was, maybe, the second or maybe the third hottest dude in Hell's Kitchen after Daredevil and Luke Cage, of course.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Not Our Iron Fist</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Orson-randall.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">Orson Randall was another <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-netflix-replace-iron-fist/\">Iron Fist</a>, whose history is quite gripping. He was brought up in K'un Lun and as expected, he began to master his skills as an Iron Fist. After he became a master of the trait, he joined a group called The Freedom's Five, who fought in World War 1.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Daredevil Vs.

His Iron Fist costume was also green and yellow, but with a slight change as the dragon tattoo printed in the middle of the costume gave a black look. Orson also seemed to wear a jacket around his green shirt, which gave a decent golden look, although it kind of ruined the black dragon crest.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Iron Man's Version</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tony-Stark.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is the most peculiar version of Iron Fist costumes as this came out of nowhere, quite literally, and stayed only for one adventure. The event for this was the emergence of Serpent, an Asgardian villain who craved Odin's throne. Obviously, he attacked and some of the Marvel superheroes had to team up to try and stop him.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\">But the Serpent's powers were so scary that Tony Stark had to engineer new suits for almost everyone in order to gain an advantage over their enemy. Iron Fist's suit was green and yellow but it had a chain attached to it which Danny could use in battle. It was intimidating and scary, to say the least.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Heroes For Hire</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Power-man.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-defenders-strongest-most-powerful-members-ever-ranked/\">In the Netflix series, <em>The Defenders</em></a>, fans saw how well <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-iron-fist-vs-luke-cage-win-lose-fight/\">Luke Cage and Iron Fist</a> gelled together. Well, the inspiration of that was taken from David Walker's reunion comic book series - Power Man and Iron Fist, released in 2016.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/arrowverse-best-costumes/\">15 Best Costumes In The Arrowverse, Ranked</a></span></p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\">A modern-day comic book series demands a modern look from the beloved superheroes and the artists attempted to do exactly that. Iron Fist can be seen sporting a green tracksuit, which feels much lighter, with the ever glowing yellow mask and the dragon printed on the chest looking more lively than ever. It embodies the current generation as people love wearing light and comfortable clothes.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>New Avengers</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-avengers.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\">Luke Cage and Iron Fist have been best friends for a while and upon The Power Man's request, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-new-avengers-decade-ranked/\">Danny Rand joined the New Avengers</a>, only this time, he had a total change in his costume. This happened when the New Avengers were involved in a problem featuring the Eye of Agamotto, with Doctor Strange caught right in the middle of all the chaos.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\">Iron Fist looked completely different, with the mask giving a new golden look and the body covered in a beautiful white suit. The dragon tattoo printed on the white shirt was the best thing because the golden look actually suited Danny a lot. Some might say this is the best Iron Fist costume ever but the very first suit will always remain on top of the chart.</p></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>The Cult Classic</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Classic.jpg' /></figure><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/netflix-marvel-iron-fist-finn-jones-comics-accurate/\">Danny Rand</a> burst upon the scene with a comic book in 1974, introducing himself as a boy billionaire lost in the world of grown-ups. Fortunately, he found himself in a place called K'un-Lun, and there, he found a purpose. After years of hard work, he finally became the Iron Fist and returned to New York. His first appearance laid the groundwork for his costumes for years to come.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\">The green around his body, while the yellow on his head, with the dragon tattoo on his open chest, left a pretty intimidating look and one that stayed with him and the fans for decades before it was finally changed in 2006. To date, this is Iron Fist's best look because it matches his personality and colorful childhood. Although the new ones have started replacing this look, fans would love to see it being reintroduced.</p></p><p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Marvel-Less: 20 TV Shows Marvel Cancelled Way Too Soon\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/cancelled-marvel-tv-shows/\">Marvel-Less: 20 TV Shows Marvel Cancelled Way Too Soon</a></span></p></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 02:00:33 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Iron-Fist-feature-image.jpg","linkMd5":"e1960377392d3d4ab6e60c1791a0361e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn4@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-29-564_18ce63b28c05391a.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":167184,"destBytes":167184,"author":"Nishid Motwani","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Iron-Fist-feature-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn4@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-29-564_18ce63b28c05391a.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Immortal.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn80@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-39-255_2b53b6363704d632.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Orson-randall.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn43@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-38-111_996490fa4b880617.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tony-Stark.jpg":null,"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Power-man.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-42-721_17ccb123af45619c.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/New-avengers.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn21@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-38-027_8970d911571d10c5.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Classic.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989063},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"One Piece: 5 Winners Of Wano Country Arc (& 5 Losers) | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-wano-country-arc-winners-losers/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Luffy-vs-Kaido-Wano.jpg\"/></figure><p>The Wano Country arc has been built up to be the greatest story arc of <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/one-piece/\">One Piece</a></em> to date.

His comic strip <em>Toast N’ Butter</em>, featuring an anthropomorphic breakfast food duo, is about to be nationally syndicated. He’s the featured guest at an upcoming comic-con in San Francisco, where he lives. He’s about to move out of the apartment he shares with a pair of slacker roommates and into a nice house with his beautiful lawyer girlfriend. When local journalist Ayana (Sasheer Zamata) stops him at his favorite comics shop and praises his strip for its subtle commentary on racial politics, he stops her. He doesn’t want the obligation of representing all Black people in his art. He just wants to “keep it light.”</p><p>And then he’s tackled and handcuffed by aggressive cops while innocently posting flyers for his comic-con appearance, mistaken for a robbery suspect who of course looks nothing like him. Although he’s not ignorant of the prevalence of racism in America, he never thought something like that would happen to him, and it shatters his entire world. Keith starts hearing inanimate objects talk to him, berating him for his apathy and his willingness to have his art co-opted by corporate interests. He finally has a full-on breakdown onstage during his comic-con appearance, trashing his own creations and torpedoing his career in the process.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/high-fidelity-zoe-kravtiz-calls-out-hulu-lack-diversity/\">High Fidelity Star Zoë Kravitz Calls Out Hulu for Lack of Diversity</a></span></p><p>It’s an extreme and sometimes off-putting introduction to what quickly shifts into a more low-key comedy about the struggles of a Black creator in the Bay Area, and the real-life Knight, who co-created the show with Marshall Todd, pushes his namesake a little too far in order to make a relatively basic point. The show’s Keith doesn’t need to have a mental breakdown to become aware of societal inequality, and the apparent equation of mental illness and social responsibility is a little disingenuous.</p><p>Luckily, the show tones down the presence of the talking objects in subsequent episodes, without losing its sharply observed social commentary. Keith still hears voices from trashcans and paper bags and his own ever-present marker (voiced by J.B. Smoove), but it’s more of a stylistic choice for the show than a representation of a man losing his grip on reality.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/woke-blake-anderson-lamorne-morris.jpg\"/></figure><p>There’s a lot to like about <em>Woke</em>, which is inspired by Knight’s autobiographical comics (including long-running strips <em>The K Chronicles</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-knight-life/\">The Knight Life</a></em>), and it settles into an entertaining groove pretty quickly, with a sitcom-style ensemble including Keith, Ayana, Keith’s roommates Clovis (T. Murph) and Gunther (<em>Workaholics</em>’ Blake Anderson), and Keith’s new artist love interest Adrienne (<em>iZombie</em>’s Rose McIver). Once Keith tanks his chances at syndication success with <em>Toast N’ Butter</em>, he struggles to reinvent himself as a socially conscious artist, not entirely comfortable in Ayana’s world of activism or in Adrienne’s world of high art, but unable to just sit back and let the easy money roll in, as Clovis suggests he should. Instead, he works to combine his audience-friendly cartoon style with a more explicitly political point of view, with mixed results.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hulu-renews-solar-opposites-and-crossing-swords/\">Hulu Renews Solar Opposites and Crossing Swords</a></span></p><p>He also navigates relationship difficulties and works to make ends meet, in more familiar kinds of storylines. As the eight-episode season goes on, the supporting characters get their own subplots as well, and the central ensemble has fun, relaxed chemistry. The female characters start out as plot devices for Keith to expand his horizons in various directions, but Zamata and McIver make them vibrant and memorable right away, and the show later develops deeper personalities for them while retaining their humor. Stand-up comedian Murph gets the showiest role as the brash, womanizing Clovis, but he eventually shows a vulnerable side as well.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/woke-t-murph-sasheer-zamata.jpg\"/></figure><p>Throughout, various celebrities lend their voices to the objects that Keith hears talking to him, and it’s an amusing device, if never quite as effective a metaphor for political awareness as the creators seem to think it is. The likable Morris holds the show together as an insecure but well-intentioned creative type who’s still finding his voice, and while Keith is the show’s most subdued character (even when he thinks he’s going crazy), Morris is never overwhelmed by the wackier supporting performances. As in fellow Hulu comedies <em>Shrill</em> and <em>Ramy</em>, both based on the real-life experiences of their artist creators, <em>Woke</em> sometimes shifts awkwardly from the personal to the goofy, but it has more genuine laughs than a lot of overly serious streaming TV “comedies.”</p><p>Knight has decades of experience delivering social commentary in a funny, easy to digest format, and he makes a strong transition to another medium here. <em>Woke</em> may not give viewers the kind of jarring wake-up call that its main character experiences in that first episode, but it provides thoughtful analysis along with humor, and that’s probably more effective in the long run.</p><p><em>Starring Lamorne Morris, T. Murph, Blake Anderson, Sasheer Zamata and the voice of J.B. Smoove, the eight-episode first season of Woke premieres Wednesday, Sept. 9 on Hulu.</em></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/feels-good-man-review/\">Feels Good Man Thoroughly Chronicles the Strange Journey of Pepe the Frog</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 17:45:36 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/woke-header.jpg","linkMd5":"3f743c83299a37ef3ca68f103647ad02","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn99@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-644_01bc8edf3563799a.webp","destWidth":6000,"destHeight":3000,"sourceBytes":2458703,"destBytes":1772062,"author":"Josh Bell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/woke-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn99@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-644_01bc8edf3563799a.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/woke-blake-anderson-lamorne-morris.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn69@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-39-766_fa06b249cf8261d5.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/woke-t-murph-sasheer-zamata.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn5@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-44-301_4fb66eb93c61db9f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989075},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Super Mario 3D All-Stars: Scalpers Are Already Listing ‘Preorders’ on eBay","link":"https://www.cbr.com/mario-all-stars-scalpers-already-listing-preorders/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg\"/></figure><p>With the 35th anniversary of the world's favorite Italian plumber right around the corner, Nintendo has announced a brand new collection of classic <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/mario/\"><em>Super Mario</em></a> games for the Switch.

This title combines <em>Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine</em> and<em> Super Mario Galaxy</em>, three of Mario's popular 3D platformers, into one package.

Nintendo in particular has had issues with scalpers, especially with collectibles like its mini-consoles and amiibo figurines.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NES-Classic-Mini.jpg\"/></figure><p>For its part, Nintendo hasn't done a great job of keeping scalpers in check. The company is known for producing fewer products than would sell, most notably only making about 2.3 million NES Classic Edition consoles at launch. These sold out almost immediately, making it virtually impossible to find. Those who were unable to secure preorders were faced with the prospect of paying at least double due to scalpers.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/animal-crossing-super-mario-furniture-march-2021/\">Animal Crossing: Nintendo Announces Super Mario-Themed Furniture</a></span></p><p>The decision to limit <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>' availability to six months is an <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mario-all-stars-limited-makes-no-sense/\">odd choice</a> that practically invites scalpers to take advantage of the situation. Within just hours of the game's announcement, there were already pages and pages of preorders listings for the game <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&#38;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&#38;_nkw=super+mario+3d+all-stars&#38;_sacat=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on sale on eBay</a>. Most scalpers are asking for between $90 and $120 dollars for a game that is priced at $59.99.</p><p>However, for those who can't secure a preorder but don't want to pay a scalper's asking price, there is another option: buying the game digitally. While it may not come with the box and cartridge that many fans, especially collectors, want to own, it'll keep you from making the difficult choice between missing out on the game and paying a bad actor for a copy. Still, much of the blame falls on Nintendo for limiting sales and having a reputation for dragging its feet when re-upping supply for collectibles. If history is an indicator, it may be hard to get a hold of a physical copy of <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>, so it's not at all surprising that some people would see that as an opportunity.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/super-mario-bros-35-battle-royale/\">Super Mario Bros. 35 Transforms the Classic Platformer Into a Battle Royale</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 18:15:45 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg","linkMd5":"074f984833153f998add757db8a83071","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn40@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-30-485_b40fabc6045cc3e3.webp","destWidth":1280,"destHeight":640,"sourceBytes":65766,"destBytes":65766,"author":"Leo Holman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mario-3d-all-stars.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn40@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-30-485_b40fabc6045cc3e3.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NES-Classic-Mini.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn65@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-43-534_da17408c59ca2662.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989075},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"The 10 Best Anti-Heroes In DC Comics | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/best-anti-heroes-dc-comics-harley-quinn/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-10-Best-Anti-Heroes-In-DC-Comics-featured-image.jpg\"/></figure><p>In the history of the medium, anti-heroes are a relatively new addition to comics.

She would lose her life during this period but this being comics, Artemis would eventually get resurrected.

There were very few things he found any qualms about doing and he gloried in the insanity of war, indulging his bloodlust in the chaotic orgy of violence that was Vietnam. The Comedian qualifies as an anti-hero because he was a member of the Watchmen, but he was also an awful person who committed many unforgivable atrocities.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/heroes-marvel-dc-comics-stole-each-other/\">5 Heroes Marvel Stole From DC (&#38; 5 DC Stole)</a></span></p><p>The Comedian's murder was the catalyst for the entire mystery at the center of the comic, the taint of his darkness throwing a pall over everything that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/watchmen-most-thought-provoking-quotes/\">made readers ponder the central question of the book- \"Who watches the watchmen?\"</a></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Huntress</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huntress.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/birds-prey-huntress-trivia-details/\">Helena Bertinelli took a strange road to heroism</a>. The child of a mob boss, she watched her family get gunned down and swore vengeance, spending her early years training herself into a machine meant for revenge.

Sometimes, he's the best mercenary in the DC Universe, using his enhanced strength, speed, and intellect to battle the heroes and make money. Other times, he's fighting against threats that are worse than he is...and still making money. That's Deathstroke in a nutshell – he doesn't mind doing good or bad things if the price is right.</p><p>It certainly helps that Deathstroke is one of the most formidable combatants on the planet, able to singlehandedly defeat teams of both heroes and villains.

Walter Kovacs, what little there was of him, died and Rorshach took over.</p><p>Rorschach was never meant to be the character that readers loved and empathized with but that is what happened. A line can be drawn from his popularity to the subsequent \"grim and gritty\" era of comics that blossomed after <em>Watchmen. </em>However, many people learned the wrong lesson from Rorschach – he was a damaged yet compelling character who used his violence to make sense of the world. While he is a near-perfect anti-hero, Rorschach is not someone to look up to.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Harley Quinn</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BM80-KeyMoments-marq-HarleyQuinn-5ce444cb576b16.98898302-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/harley-quinn/\">Harley Quinn</a> is the little engine who could. Starting out as Joker's girlfriend on <em>Batman: The Animated Series, </em>she would continue to grow in popularity over the years. She would get her own book, join teams, and move away from the Joker, becoming one of DC's most popular characters.</p><p>There's just something about Harley – her attitude, madcap humor, the tenderness underneath it all – that really speaks to fans, from comic readers to movie-goers and Hot Topic shoppers. She tells jokes while beating people to death with mallets, but underneath it all there is a heart that makes her wonderfully palatable and a great character to spend time with.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-retcons-best-worst-hated-loved/\">DC: 5 Controversial Retcons Fans Actually Loved (&#38; 5 They Hated)</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 18:30:36 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-10-Best-Anti-Heroes-In-DC-Comics-featured-image.jpg","linkMd5":"8dd95a8fb868f8edbb5dbbb0bc4b26ad","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn63@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-29-502_5c93fc75e4482e8d.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":200466,"destBytes":200466,"author":"David Harth","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-10-Best-Anti-Heroes-In-DC-Comics-featured-image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn63@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-29-502_5c93fc75e4482e8d.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Wild-Dog.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn74@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-34-176_ad5b2b6298a24f53.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/artemis-requiem.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn4@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-35-196_78ade7f6fbd6b4a6.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Black-Adam-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn88@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-35-375_c23f68124da07f47.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/before-watchmen-comedian-vietnam-display.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn60@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-36-741_9b3771f301606401.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huntress.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn48@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-35-225_e2f20dd266a2ef55.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GalleryComics-1920x1080-20160803-SuicideSquadDeadshot1-577fe69ad10589.20985089-57a136d8eb72c6.64997058-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn82@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-40-848_0afc41dfe5aac743.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Red-Hood.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn40@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-43-537_240fc892fd3110da.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/deathstroke.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn78@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-38-410_93c3086b3cde56e1.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rorschach-Watchmen-12.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn98@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-41-811_cb41970019df54dd.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BM80-KeyMoments-marq-HarleyQuinn-5ce444cb576b16.98898302-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn44@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-40-624_737f42effb023f29.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989075},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Mulan: Ming-Na Wen DOES Have a Cameo in the Remake - Here's Where to Find It","link":"https://www.cbr.com/mulan-ming-na-wen-remake-cameo-where-to-find-it/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mulan-Live-action-Animated-header.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/mulan/\">Mulan</a>, available now through Premier Access on <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/disney-plus/\">Disney+</a>.</strong></em></p><p>Ming-Na Wen broke ground as one of the first Asian actresses to go on to star or guest star in popular television series such as <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/er/\">E.R.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/agents-of-shield/\">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> </em>and<em> <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-mandalorian/\">The Mandalorian</a>, </em>but she's probably best known as the voice of Fa Mulan in Disney's original 1998 animated classic. She returned to the role several times, in 2004's <em>Mulan II</em> and in guest appearances in other Disney properties. In the fourth decade of an illustrious career, Wen was no longer an appropriate age to play the character in the 2020 live-action remake -- that honor went to Liu Yifei -- but the veteran of stage and screen played coy as to whether or not she'd make an appearance, saying she could <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/ming-na-wen-hinted-at-a-mulan-cameo-while-giving-disneys-live-action-movie-her-blessing-12574206\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">neither confirm nor deny</a> suspicions in interviews.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mulan-why-mushu-left-out/\">Mulan Director Digs Deeper Into Why Mushu Was Left Out Of The Live-Action Remake</a></span></p><p>Rumors abounded as to what character she might portray if she did appear, and details were kept secret from most of the cast and crew. With the primary cast list published long before the movie's planned-then-canceled March premiere, Wen was always unlikely to play a major character. However, Wen does in fact have a cameo in the Disney+ premium release, and it comes at the perfect moment.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ming-na-wen.jpg\"/></figure><p>At the film's climax, Mulan rescues the Emperor during a high-wire fight with one of the film's villains, Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee).  Having defeated their mutual enemy, she bows before the Emperor respectfully, fearing he will disapprove that a girl was leading his army. He asks for her name. The scene cuts to the inside of a throne room.</p><p>Having just saved the kingdom and its leader, Mulan is being officially presented at a grand ceremony. That's when Ming-Na Wen, billed in the credits as \"Esteemed Guest,\" walks into view, regal and beautifully costumed. She has the privilege of reintroducing Mulan to the Emperor and the public he commands, speaking one line, “Your Imperial Highness, Huan Mulan.” It's an endearing gesture, and passes the baton from one generation to the next. Both Wen and Liu Yifei clearly grasp the significance of the moment in their performances.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/disney-reveals-mulans-debut-date-for-all-subscribers/\">Disney+ Reveals Mulan's Debut Date For All Subscribers</a></span></p><p>Fans of Wen's and Disney aficionados will spot the actress immediately and appreciate the homage, but the cameo is definitely a bit of an inside reference. The moment might be lost on some younger viewers who've seen the animated <em>Mulan</em> but weren't alive during the pop cultural phenomenon that followed it, including the regular airplay of its theme song \"Reflection\" on the radio. Though Wen voiced the title character's dialogue, singer Lea Salonga is responsible for the vocal performance of \"Reflection\" in the movie, while Christina Aguilera performs the radio version of the song for both films.</p><p>For her part, Wen seems delighted to have been involved in the new film, and even made it a family affair. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/live-action-mulan-ming-na-wen-cameo-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Her daughter</a> can also be found in the crowd of Mulan's presentation ceremony.</p><p><em>Directed by Niki Caro, Disney's live-action Mulan stars Yifei Liu as Mulan, Donnie Yen as Commander Tung, Jason Scott Lee as Böri Khan and Yoson An as Chen Honghui, with Gong Li as Xianniang and Jet Li as the Emperor.

With a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/crunchyroll-tiered-membership-offline-viewing/\">revamped series of membership</a> services and the ability for fans to watch episodes of their favorite shows faster than ever, Crunchyroll has positioned itself as the premiere anime streaming service. The various new perks offered to its members not only provide simple entertainment for the fans, but also help to officially support the Japanese anime industry from all across the world. This, along with KissAnime's recent death, continue to kill off the rampant piracy that has consistently been a part of the non-Japanese fandom.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/how-you-can-support-anime-industry/\">How YOU Can Support the Anime Industry</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CR-Premium-Tiers-PR16x9-Orbs.png\"/></figure><p>Instead of the simple Free and Premium tiers of the previous version of Crunchyroll's membership, the service now has several options. These include Free, Fan, Mega Fan and Ultimate Fan. The latter three all offer a variety of benefits, with the most notable being unhindered access to Crunchyroll's entire library. This means that fans can not only read through the numerous manga that the service provides, but also watch the entirety of the available anime shows, completely ad-free. Likewise, viewers will have access to same-day simulcasts of shows' Japanese airings, while those with only the free version of the service will have to wait a week for new episodes.</p><p>Other features include offline viewing for when wireless streaming isn't possible. The higher cost memberships also allow for multiple streams across one account. These features, common among other streaming services like Hulu and Netflix, have been demanded from Crunchyroll for years, and their presence make the service more competitive than ever. Ironically, Crunchyroll itself began as an illegal streaming service for anime, but not only has it legally offered content for years, it has potentially become the best way to gain access to the most popular and obscure anime out there.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/death-note-another-note-best-american-names/\">The Death Note: Another Note Has the BEST 'American' Names</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Light-Laughed-At-The-Death-Note-In-the-Manga-.jpg\"/></figure><p>This paid access to material helps to officially support production studios and the anime industry as a whole. Piracy has been a constant moral issue with many fans outside of Japan who wish to watch or read certain series, but don't have an official international release to support. This lack of international availability drastically increased piracy within the industry, as many took to torrents and sites such as Putlocker to watch shows that were otherwise unavailable. Recently, the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/kissanime-is-dead-and-it-deserved-to-die/\">well-known pirating website</a> KissAnime was shut down for good after years of essentially robbing the anime industry and the creators within it.</p><p>The convenience factor was one of the biggest reasons to pirate anime, as viewers didn't have to pay outrageous prices for shows that were unavailable in their native country or wait for official releases of episodes. But, with same-day simulcasts, easily affordable price, and an ever increasing library of mainstream and niche shows, Crunchyroll continues to help eliminate the need to turn to illegal means for anime viewing. The official subs and translations will also likely be of a much higher quality than what was found on KissAnime, where oftentimes \"fanlations\" were stolen from other groups. Though piracy sites are seemingly dying their deserved death, Crunchyroll and the anime industry are in a better position than ever to thrive.</p><p><em>Updates to the Crunchyroll Android and iOS applications will be rolling from Aug. 21 to give fans access to these new benefits. Not all users will have access right away, but the updated application should be fully available to global fans in early September. </em></p><p><em>Fans without a current premium membership can learn more by going to <a href=\"http://crunchyroll.com/welcome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crunchyroll.com/welcome</a>.

Their battle became increasingly brutal, with Wonder Woman eventually punching a hole clean through the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-beats-superman-dead-earth/\">Man of Steel's chest</a>. Wonder Woman soon entered a catatonic state. She would eventually wake up centuries later, unaware of what had happened or who had saved her. In reality, it was the other third of this world's Trinity. Working with the last remaining Superman Robot, Batman ensured that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-uses-superman-skeleton-as-weapon/\">Wonder Woman</a> was protected while recovering from her battle. While the Superman Robot was quick to ask about his own status, Batman revealed that just like the other major cities in the world, Gotham now lays in ruins.</p><p>On top of that, the lingering radiation of the surrounding world has already affected him. He predicts that he wouldn't be much use for much longer anyway, and instead leaves a box--a box that can only be opened by human hands--that could eventually restore Wonder Woman's power. Batman brings her back to the remains of Wayne Manor, and hides her away in suspended animation. Batman notes how much he wishes he could \"end\" Diana for her actions, but his faith that she could restore the world eventually keeps him from lashing out at her. After ensuring her survival by hiding her in the remains of the Bat-Cave, a dying Batman retreats back to the surface.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-dead-earth-remixes-legends-of-the-dead-earth/\">Wonder Woman: Dead Earth Remixes One Of DC's Most Underrated '90s Events</a></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wonder-Woman-Dead-Earth-Batman.jpg\"/></figure><p>Reaching into his family liquor cabinet, Batman sits down in his chair and actually takes a drink of alcohol--something he's avoided while putting on the airs of loving to drink as Bruce Wayne. After a moment, the exhausted hero chuckles and finishes his drink. This was where he remains until he dies, drinking amid the ruins of the city he long fought for. This is where Diana finds Bruce decades later, his body reduced to a skeleton on that couch. Diana later takes Batman's utility belt to help her on her journey, in part as a tribute to her fallen friend.</p><p>While Batman may have been enraged by her actions and wished for nothing more than to get his revenge, he still made sure to do the right thing and help protect her. This gives humanity a champion to protect them in the future, helping ensure their survival. In a way, Batman's choice to get over his own sense of vengeance helps ensure the survival of this world, even if he didn't get to see it. But it's also a decidedly tragic end for Batman, the ultimate defeat of the Dark Knight who could conquer any threat, with Batman just accepting his death and letting it come for him as he looked over the ruins of the city he protected.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-dead-earth-turns-diana-into-ultimate-god/\">Wonder Woman: Dead Earth Turns Diana Into the ULTIMATE God</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 19:20:39 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Batman-Dead-Earth-feature.jpg","linkMd5":"fb9104f1ba7096d0f92f56b7392efb53","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn64@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-30-259_29a3972c46c2cb7b.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":236592,"destBytes":200484,"author":"Brandon Zachary","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Batman-Dead-Earth-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn64@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-30-259_29a3972c46c2cb7b.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Wonder-Woman-Death-Earth-Batman.jpg":null,"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wonder-Woman-Dead-Earth-Batman.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn94@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-34-042_5865d06d59d6e015.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989073},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Red Hood: Joker's Most Disgusting New 52 Moment Almost Breaks Jason Todd","link":"https://www.cbr.com/red-hood-joker-new-52-face-jason-todd/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/redhood.jpg\"/></figure><p><em><strong>WARNING: The following contains spoilers for </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/red-hood-outlaw\"><strong>Red Hood: Outlaw</strong></a><em><strong> #48, by Scott Lobdell, Brett Booth, Danny Miki, Arif Prianto, Ben Meares, Ben Abernathy and ALW's Troy Peteri, available now.</strong></em></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/joker\">Joker</a> has played some sadistic games with Batman, culminating in violent acts on the likes of Jason Todd, Batgirl and Alfred.

It hits home hard for Jason as this was the same treatment meted out to him, but now Punchline and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/nightwing-bat-family-showdown/\">a brainwashed Dick Grayson</a> are making the mission harder.

She was part of the Suicide Squad as well, so this seems to be the end of a tragic road for Duela, even if all Jason can see is the face of his killer on her. Noticing the tears in her eyes and pain in her voice, Jason wants to free her, but as he's incapacitated outside, the bomb he set to kill the Joker's thugs actually kills the woman inside the building. Terrified, he rushes in and cradles Duela's dead body, just like the Bat did him as a kid.

They used her as bait and appeared to swap her out for the explosion, so the game continues.

Taking advantage of the situation, the vile pirates put a sheet over Whitebeard as Teach Blackbeard walked under it. When he came out from under it, he possessed power of Whitebeard's Devil Fruit, the Quake-Quake Fruit. With it came the ability to create tremors, in addition to Blackbeard's own power to control darkness from the Dark-Dark Fruit. Teach became the first person to ever possess two Devil Fruit abilities, and though it's still unclear how he was able to take Whitebeard's power or even be able to possess two without dying, there's one solid theory that comes <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-episode-937-rebellion-against-kaido/\">from another Yonko</a>.</p><p>When a Devil Fruit user dies, the fruit they obtained their power from regrows somewhere else in the world. There can never exist more than one Devil Fruit with the same power nor the same user. However, decades prior, Charlotte Linlin, better known as <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-key-events-vol-94/\">the Yonko, Big Mom</a>, got her own Devil Fruit ability in a similarly unusual way. It all began where she grew up: on Elbaf, home of the Giant race, in an orphanage run by the nun Mother Caramel.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Franky X Robin?: All the Hints That the One Piece Nakama Belong Together\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-franky-robin-nakama-hints-belong-together/\">Franky X Robin?: All The Hints That The One Piece Nakama Belong Together</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/big-mom-as-kid-one-piece-yonko.jpg\"/></figure><p>In chapter 867, after an incident that forced them to leave Elbaf, the orphanage celebrated Linlin's 6th birthday with a delightful tea party. Linlin unknowingly devoured everything and, when she finished eating, her surroundings were empty and her family was nowhere in sight, but she now possessed Mother Caramel's Soul-Soul Fruit powers, giving her the ability to manipulate the souls of living beings. It's a horrifically morbid truth to behold, but Linlin must have devoured her entire family without realizing, which is how she obtained her adoptive mother's powers. With that being the case, it seems that a person can obtain a Devil Fruit user's power by eating them or a part them, so it could mean Blackbeard stole the Quake-Quake Fruit's power by eating part of Whitebeard or at least one of his organs.</p><p>This is only one possible theory on how one pirate acquired the other's abilities, but the fact that such an event is still theorized to this day speaks volumes about how much is still unknown about the workings of the Devil Fruits.

Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics set out to make the long-overdue video game celebration of the Avengers, and they pulled it off...mostly.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ps4-avengers-destroys-team-and-it-works\">Marvel's Avengers SHATTERS the Team Like NEVER Before - That's Why It Works</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Marvels-Avengers-game-team.jpg\"/></figure><p>Following a Terrigen explosion and the death of <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/captain-america\">Captain America</a>, the Avengers are outlawed and the world sees the newly created <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/inhumans\">Inhumans</a> as threats. Five years later, former Avengers scientist George Tarleton has created A.I.M. and is hunting both the Inhumans and an Inhuman Resistance. Meanwhile, Inhuman Kamala Khan is being hunted after finding proof Tarleton may have been responsible for Captain America's death.</p><p>The story mode is where <em>Marvel's Avengers</em> shines, but it's not perfect. There are a few twists and turns, but they're all pretty obvious if you're a comic book fan. Characterization saves the game, but not all the characters are perfect; Tony Stark is a little less rock star superhero and a little more \"your dad is going to save the day,\" for example. Still, the game finds plenty of time to reinvent; the Avengers are interesting, and these may be the best versions of A.I.M. and M.O.D.O.K. we've seen to date.</p><p>The problem is that a lot of characterization is missing. Characters who were hyped up in early marketing, such as <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-crystal-dynamics-interview/\">Cerise, an Inhuman who uses a wheelchair,</a> or Maria Hill, don't contribute much to the plot or gameplay. Storied Avengers don't acknowledge each other's existence. Characters who hated each other appear to reconcile immediately. The important beats of reconnecting feel like they're missing from a story that's all about getting the band back together. The story exists only to justify who is going to fight and why.</p><p>What story it does have is good, at least. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-bruce-kamala-relationship-defines-game/\">Kamala and Bruce</a> remain the highlight; their contrasting personalities perfectly embody <em>Avengers</em>' tone. The characters are exciting when the plot needs them to be, and emotional beats still hit hard. You'll find yourself incredibly attached to the infectiously positive Kamala by the story's end, so much so that even her final moments before the credits can bring tears to your eyes.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-playstations-most-downloaded-beta/\">Marvel's Avengers is PlayStation's Most-Downloaded Beta Ever</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Marvel-Avengers-video-game-2.jpg\"/></figure><p>The story's fine, but it's all just there to justify the gameplay. <em>Marvel's Avengers</em> simultaneously has gameplay in spades while also not having much. At its core, <em>Avengers</em> is closer to a looter shooter like <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/borderlands/\">Borderlands</a></em> or <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/destiny-2\">Destiny 2</a></em> than a superhero game like <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/spider-man-ps4\">Marvel's Spider-Man</a></em> or the <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/batman-arkham\">Batman: Arkham</a></em> titles.</p><p>Missions begin from a War Table and are accompanied by brief flavor text. From there, you're dropped into the fray. Missions have you facing off against various A.I.M. baddies, even when it doesn't seem like you should be. Combat is fast and action-packed, but not always fun. The difficulty curve tends to consist of an enemy you can handle alone surrounded by smaller, additional enemies. The result is a chaotic, overwhelming mess that's at best difficult to manage and, at worst, an impossible onslaught that leaves you stunlocked.</p><p>In these instances, the game thinks you'll be OK <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-companion-ai-keep-gamers-playing-hours/\">thanks to your A.I. controlled companions</a>, but it would be wrong. We lost several fights because our A.I. companions had wandered off and in one case, appeared to despawn. One encounter saw <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/thor\">Thor</a> and <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/hulk\">Hulk</a> staring at a wall around the corner; since they didn't have a direct sightline, they were seemingly oblivious to the robot stepping on <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/iron-man\">Iron Man</a> not five feet away. Games like <em>Ultimate Alliance</em> solve this by allowing you some degree of control or influence, but here you cannot summon, control or even get the attention of your A.I. teammates.</p><p>The fights don't appear to be designed with every Avenger in mind, either. Every character has options for ranged and close encounters, but they aren't all well suited for it. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-gameplay-footage-captain-america-skills-costumes/\">Captain America</a> is the most fun character in the game, but he struggles against air units or hovering warships. The A.I. should be supporting you in these instances, but again ours often would break and watch as Cap frantically threw his shield a hundred times over at the one remaining weak point on a ship.</p><p>These are significant issues when they pop up, but fortunately, they're not often, at least not until the end of the story mode. The missions remain varied enough to keep them interesting, and the Avengers do play differently enough that you don't find it feeling stale. It's worth remembering that the game is built for the long haul, and gameplay may be significantly improved just by the upcoming roster expansions, which will likely add additional play styles.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-hawkeye-kate-bishop-roster-reveal/\">Marvel's Avengers: The MCU's Next Disney+ Star, Kate Bishop, Joins The Roster</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Marvels-Avengers-A-Day-team.jpg\"/></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-beta-gorgeous-far-from-perfect/\"><em>Avengers</em> Beta was gorgeous</a>, and the main game is no exception. The character models are well-rendered, and the animation is fluid and exciting. Traversing the world is an adventure, and there's plenty to see and do. But the game needed a lot more polish, especially in the back half.</p><p>Around two-thirds through story mode, graphical issues began popping up. Screen tearing, visual artifacts and even small issues like character mouths not moving or models getting stuck were prevalent. At one point, we found a floating Iron Man head on the Helicarrier at a point in the story when he was explicitly not on the Helicarrier. Later on, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent may have secretly been a Mr. Fantastic cameo, based on how his neck was stretching to the sky from underneath the floor.</p><p>While those are temporary issues that can usually be blamed on a bad load, they don't excuse the frame rate or lack thereof. Multiple instances in the game saw stuttering, slowdown and a frame rate that dropped to single digits. Some cutscenes would stutter to the point that characters seemed to teleport to their marks. The game has a lot of trouble when large numbers of enemies are on screen at once, a trick it relies on in later missions. The game is a gorgeous, graphical powerhouse when it's working, but these visual problems occasionally ruined the mood.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-co-op-wont-cross-platform-launch/\">Marvel's Avengers Co-Op Won't Be Cross-Platform At Launch</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Continuity-Avengers-Game.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>Marvel's Avengers</em> is perfectly serviceable. That's really all you can say about it for now. It's an ambitious title, and one that's coming out at a weird time in gaming, caught between building for a dying generation and preparing for the next stage of hardware. With a rumored 10-year life cycle, a host of DLC and the on-going Avengers Initiative component, the game is far from being done. <em>Marvel's Avengers</em> has all the hallmarks of a game that will go from just OK to incredible after a couple of years of DLC and quality of life patches.</p><p>For now, though, the game is fine. For the casual fan who doesn't have a strong attachment outside the <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe\">MCU</a> or is looking for a new beat 'em up, this probably isn't the game for them. This game is driven by a love for the characters and is aimed at die-hard fans. <em>Marvel's Avengers</em> is rough around the edges, but it's a decent celebration of what makes the Avengers so compelling.</p><p>Developed by Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montréal and published by Square Enix, <em>Marvel's Avengers</em> is now available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Google Stadia and PC.</p><p><em>A copy of Marvel's Avengers was provided by Square Enix to CBR for review purposes.</em></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvels-avengers-first-look-modok-monica-rappaccini/\">Marvel's Avengers Debuts First Look at MODOK, Monica Rappaccini</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 22:15:20 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Marvels-Avengers-Heros-Key-Art-Golden-Gate.jpg","linkMd5":"55b73728feeeefb8997b80ca6d9577ea","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-29-539_c25e4608ae4576da.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":207472,"destBytes":176566,"author":"Christopher Baggett","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Marvels-Avengers-Heros-Key-Art-Golden-Gate.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn100@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-29-539_c25e4608ae4576da.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Marvels-Avengers-game-team.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn16@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-42-730_ec3785804c15f3d1.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Marvel-Avengers-video-game-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn97@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-43-219_ab52e75c3c888d16.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Marvels-Avengers-A-Day-team.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn86@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-40-002_79b72bd24463651f.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Continuity-Avengers-Game.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn24@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-41-152_1da1cfcda5ade30a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989068},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Why Hela May Not Have Destroyed the REAL Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok","link":"https://www.cbr.com/video-hela-destroy-mjolnir-thor-ragnarok/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Hela-Crushes-Mjolnir-Thor-Ragnarok-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Mjolnir is one of the key elements of Thor as a character, with much of the God of Thunder's first solo movie focusing on his attempts to prove himself worthy and regain the hammer.

But what if Mjolnir isn't really gone? In this video, we're going to go into a theory about why and how Hela might not have actually destroyed Mjolnir in the film.</p><p>A major part of this theory hinges on what we know about the upcoming <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>. In that film, Natalie Portman will return as Jane Foster and herself take up Mjolnir to become Thor.

Studios is proud to announce <strong>THE EXPANSE</strong>, a new four-issue limited comic book series from writer Corinna Bechko (Green Lantern: Earth One) and artist Alejandro Aragon (Resonant) which is set between Season 4 and the upcoming fifth season of the Amazon Prime Video hit television series, The Expanse. The limited comic book series is available in comic shops starting December 2, 2020.</span></em></p><p><em>The first four seasons of The Expanse television show are available to watch now on Prime Video. The show is financed and produced by Alcon Television Group, a division of Alcon Entertainment.</em></p><p><em><strong>THE EXPANSE </strong>picks up with Chrisjen Avasarala at the end of the television show’s fourth season. The longtime Secretary-General of the United Nations finds herself dealing with the outcome of the tumultuous elections for her position and far from Earth but not its politics. When Bobbie Draper - a former Martian marine - brings Avasarala intel on an intergalactic black market weapons ring, Avasarala sees a chance to reclaim her political position through a clandestine operation. But as Draper digs deeper into this secret cabal, she soon realizes the threat they pose is far larger - and closer to home - than either of them ever imagined.</em></p><p><em>Corinna Bechko has been writing both comics and prose since her horror graphic novel Heathentown was published by Image/Shadowline in 2009. She has worked for numerous publishers including Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, BOOM! Studios, and Sideshow on titles such as Star Wars: Legacy, Savage Hulk, Angel, Once Upon a Time, Court of the Dead: The Chronicle of the Underworld and the Hugo-nominated series Invisible Republic, which she co-writes with Gabriel Hardman. Green Lantern: Earth One, co-written with Gabriel Hardman, was nominated for an Eisner in 2019. Her book for young readers, Smithsonian Dig it! Dinosaurs, co-written with Brenda Scott Royce, appeared last year as well. She lives in Los Angeles and has a zoology degree, both of which probably influence her writing even more than she realizes.</em></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/boom-expanse-1.jpg\"/></figure><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/boom-expanse-2.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>\"I couldn't be more excited to add a piece to the universe of <strong>THE EXPANSE</strong>!” said Bechko. \"It's a show I both adore and admire, so the chance to craft a noir-tinged plot involving two of my absolute favorite characters from the series makes me feel like the luckiest writer around.\"</em></p><p><em>Alejandro Aragon is a comic book artist from Rosario, Argentina. Aragon's illustrations have been published by BOOM! Studios, Image Comics, Dark Horse, IDW, Vault Comics, and more. He is also the co-creator of comic book series Resonant with Vault Comics and Death Orb with Dark Horse.</em></p><p><em>\"<strong>THE EXPANSE </strong>is one of the best sci-fi television shows out there right now. I am honored to be a part of this journey and very excited to draw this universe and the incredible characters in it,\" said Aragon.</em></p><p><em>\"Corinna and Alejandro are the perfect team to tackle the complicated relationship between two of the most compelling and unpredictable characters in The Expanse,\" said Eric Harburn, Senior Editor, BOOM! Studios. \"Fans of epic science-fiction, political intrigue, and the machinations of Martians, Earthers, and Belters can’t miss a single moment of this tie-in series that sets the stage for the newest season of the beloved television series.\"</em></p><p><em><strong>THE EXPANSE</strong> is the latest release from BOOM!

In 1953, DC Comics purchased Quality Comics and integrated many of their heroes. In the 1970s, they acquired Fawcett, home of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/shazam/\">Shazam</a> family of characters. Just before <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/\"><em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em></a>, they acquired <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/charlton-comics/\">Charlton Comics</a>' roster of super-heroes.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/comic-stories-shazam-2-never-done-live-action/\">10 Comic Stories We Want To See In Shazam! 2 (That Have Never Been Done In Live-Action)</a></span></p><p>The incorporation of other companies' heroes didn't stop. Most recently, they merged the Wildstorm Universe into the New 52. While the Wildstorm heroes have not been able to break through and maintain a title, many of these acquisitions have become ingrained into the DC zeitgeist. Some characters <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-shazam-comics-fun-facts-trivia/\">like Shazam</a> are even well-known to be originally from another publisher.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Kid Eternity</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kid-eternity.jpg' /></figure><p>Kid Eternity was published by Quality Comics, not the Marvel Family's Fawcett Comics. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/grant-morrison/\">Grant Morrison</a> revamped the character for <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/vertigo\">Vertigo</a>. His Golden Age past is elaborated on in a revision that makes him a pawn of the Lords of Chaos. He's been used in the pages of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/teen-titans/\"><em>Teen Titans</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/jsa/\"><em>JSA</em></a> and has even been killed a couple of times.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Peacemaker</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/peacemaker.jpg' /></figure><p>The Peacemaker is going to appear in James Gunn's <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/suicide-squad/\">Suicide Squad</a></em> film.

He was also the basis for the Comedian in <em>Watchmen</em>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Sarge Steel</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sarge-steel.jpg' /></figure><p>There's something about Sarge Steel that became almost iconic with his artificial hand. Initially a Charlton Comics character, his hand was lost to drug lords, and Sarge Steel had it replaced with a metal fist with which he could club enemies. He was a Vietnam veteran working as a private eye. Later, he was made a Special Agent. This role was made integral to his adaption by DC Comics.</p><p>DC Comics made him the head of a federal agency and later a cabinet post over metahumans like the Suicide Squad. He's been used as a pawn against super-heroes by Circe, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/shazam-captain-marvel-mister-mind-monster-society-brigade/\">Mister Mind</a>, and Doctor Psycho. He remains a fixture of DC's Intelligence and spy operations.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Son of Vulcan</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/son-of-vulcan.jpg' /></figure><p>Son of Vulcan is another of those heroes that DC tried to do something with, but couldn't quite make it happen. A lot of that comes from an origin dependent upon the Greek Gods being active in the affairs of men. Of course, this is the domain of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/wonder-woman/\">Wonder Woman</a> and Shazam in the world of DC Comics.</p><p>Coming from Charlton Comics, Son of Vulcan was not a major Charlton character. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/marv-wolfman\">Marv Wolfman</a> didn't include him among the Earth-4 heroes assembled in <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths #6</em>. He only received a cameo in one panel of the final issue. Afterward, the character had a role in the <em>War of the Gods</em>. He was revamped in 2005 with ties to the White Martians and Teen Titans.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Blue Beetle</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ted-Kord.jpg' /></figure><p>Ted Kord was the Blue Beetle that heralded the Charlton characters' integration into DC Comics' roster of heroes in <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths #1</em>. He was the second Blue Beetle. The character had roots going back before Charlton Comics into the first years of the Golden Age.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-blue-beetle-ted-kord-vs-jamie-reyes-who-would-win-fight/\">Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) Vs. Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes): Who Would Win</a></span></p><p>Police officer Dan Garrett was the first Blue Beetle, with adventures published by Fox Comics and Holyoke Publishing. Ted Kord's stories retroactively changed him into an archaeologist gaining powers from a scarab he recovered on a dig in Egypt. Ted Kord was a student of Garrett and inherited the mantle of the Blue Beetle, but not the scarab. Ted went on to be a regular fixture in the DC Universe during the 1980s and into the 1990s.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>The Ray</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-ray-dc-comics-version.jpg' /></figure><p>The Ray has had a mixed time at DC, never quite rising above team level status. The version most fans are familiar with debuted in 1992 as the son of the Golden Age Ray. That Ray had been known as a member of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/freedom-fighters/\">Freedom Fighters</a> but goes back a little further.</p><p>The Ray originally debuted in comics published by Quality Comics. Like with most of the Freedom Fighters, his new adventures following the Crisis were extended to a legacy character, his son. That son has had a long run with DC, serving in many teams and appearing in many crossovers.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Uncle Sam</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/uncle-sam.jpg' /></figure><p>Uncle Sam has shown up a few times since being reintroduced to comic book fans.

He was created by none other than Will Eisner. DC incorporated many of the characters it bought from Quality Comics into the Freedom Fighters. After the Crisis, the character appeared infrequently, but was featured in a two-issue <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-vertigo-comics-imprint-bands-needed-obsolete/\">Vertigo series</a> by <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/alex-ross/\">Alex Ross</a> and in a series of short <em>Freedom Fighters</em> series introducing new teammates for Uncle Sam.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Max Mercury</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Max-Mercury.jpg' /></figure><p>Max Mercury was forgotten by many fans, but he is a Golden Age speedster. In <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/flash\"><em>Flash</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/impulse/\"><em>Impulse</em></a>, he took on a role as a mentor, especially to Impulse. Of course, no one will find the Golden Age adventures of \"Max Mercury\" because he was known as Quicksilver when being published by Quality Comics. He even got a Who's Who entry under that name but was never published by DC under that name.</p><p>Of course, his name was changed when Mark Waid introduced him in the pages of <em>The Flash</em> to avoid confusion with Marvel Comics' Quicksilver. He became a Speed Force <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-flash-barry-allen-closest-allies-superman-iris-west/\">mentor to Wally West</a> and then Bart Allen. He's been influential enough to have a lasting presence as an extended member of the Flash family of speedsters.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Blackhawk</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blackhawk-american-flag.jpg' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/blackhawk/\">The Blackhawks</a> were a team of ace pilots that fought against the Axis powers and several nefarious foes. The were led by an ace fighter pilot known only as Blackhawk. They are a legend among DC's rich history, even spawning a modern-day heroine, Lady Blackhawk.</p><p><em>Blackhawk</em> wasn't originally a DC comic. The character came from Quality Comics. It was not only one of their best sellers, but one of the best selling comic books. <em>Blackhawk</em> is unique in that DC kept its publishing consistent through their purchase of Quality Comics.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Plastic Man</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/plastic-man.jpg' /></figure><p>You'd be forgiven if you thought that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/plastic-man/\">Plastic Man</a> had always been a DC character. He had a Saturday morning cartoon in the 70s, has been a member of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/jla/\">JLA</a>, and was a regular fixture in more than a few ongoing series. However, Plastic Man's first stories were from Quality Comics.</p><p>His Golden Age origin has survived intact. Eel O'Brian was a criminal that was shot during a burglary. Some unknown chemicals got into the wound, giving him his <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-dc-plastic-man-vs-mr-fantastic/\">elastic, shape-changing powers</a>. He's gone on to remain one of DC's more popular humorous super-heroes, despite not starting with the publisher.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a

href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/batman/\">Batman</a> has quite a few tricks stored away in his utility belt or locked up in the Batcave, but his gadgets aren't the only tools at his disposal, as he is also a master of disguise who has gone undercover many times over the course of his crimefighting career with more than a few acting skills he picked up from Alfred.</p><p><span

was killed in private by a ricochet while firing at Batman, another opportunity presented itself.</p><p>Batman hid Malone's death and took over the identity, using Malone's already established rep to help him track down <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/ras-al-ghul\">Ra's al Ghul</a>'s agents, though that was only the first of many times Matches Malone would make an appearance in the criminal

She enjoyed a cushy life of being praised by the Axis Order for quite a long time, laughing at foolish humans and the ridiculous ways in which they met with an early end. That is, until one human has the idea to drag Aqua along with him to be essentially 'reborn,' keeping her abilities as a goddess but losing the praise and recognition she once had. Most simply laugh or scoff at Aqua when she insists about her goddess origins, and one man early on even gave her money out of pity for her 'delusions.'</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/konosuba-best-worst-isekai-anime/\">Konosuba: 5 Times It Proved To Be The Best Isekai Anime (&#38; 5 Times It Fell Short)</a></span></p><p>That isn't to say that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/konosuba-konosuba-characters-more-useless-than-aqua/\">Aqua is entirely useless</a>, as the main meme surrounding her goes.

All of these traits are perfectly on display in this piece by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/zarory\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zarory</a>, and the coloring is absolutely beautiful to boot.</p><p>While the background is quite simple, it pleasingly <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/konosuba-anime-characters-worse-kazuma/\">represents the area where Kazuma</a> and Aqua briefly spent a scene before being reborn. The vibrant bubbles floating around add a nice visual touch.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Aqua At The Ready</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Konosuba-Aqua-Cute-Wink-Fan-Art.jpg' /></figure><p>Due to Aqua's incredibly outgoing and cheerful nature, she can be seen reassuring her teammates and striking iconic anime poses, such as the one drawn above by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/kitsuneco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kitsuneco</a>.</p><p>Both Aqua's confidence and bubbly, humorous personality are on full display, and the line art is clean. Finally, the simple coloring complements the shading well, and having the silhouette behind her adds a fun extra layer of depth overall.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Goddess Of Panic</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Konosuba-Aqua-Crying-And-Dancing.jpg' /></figure><p>Aside from Aqua being less-than-useful in many situations throughout <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-konosuba-tattoos/\">the series,</a> as well as being known for her bubbly, cheerful attitude, she's also known for being prone to panic or burst into tears quite often. Her high range of emotional reactions is part of what makes her such an on-screen joy, and that wildly colorful personality is drawn beautifully by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/nikusenpai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NikuSenpai</a> here.</p><p>Aqua's pose mirrors the dance that she performs during the second opening, just with her trademark freaked-out face replacing the joyful expression she makes in the anime. All of the ornate little details in the background add to the piece's appeal.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Trusty Staff</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aqua-by-kwanfi-dc31xsl-fullview.jpg' /></figure><p>Whenever Aqua and the others have to charge headfirst into battle, she'd be caught dead without her trusty trademark staff. Not only is it simply gorgeous in its design, but it boosts the power of every spell she casts, making it a must-have weapon to have at her side. <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/kwanfi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kwanfi's</a> rendition of Aqua holding her dear weapon came out beautifully, with the coloring style being especially pleasing to the eye.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/konosuba-characters-chinese-zodiac-signs/\">Which Konosuba Character Are You Based On Your Zodiac Sign?</a></span></p><p>The background is simple, yet effective, as the rainbow illuminating Aqua and the splashes of water at her feet from the puddle are nice touches. They also manage to hint at parts of her personality for those who might be unfamiliar as an added bonus.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Chibi Trio</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Konosuba-Aqua-Megumin-And-Darkness-Chibis.jpg' /></figure><p>The two other girls that make up the series' main party, Megumin <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/konosuba-anime-characters-more-hopeless-than-darkness/\">and Darkness</a>, are just as much of an exciting, humorous joy to watch as Aqua. That makes it incredibly fun to see all three of them in an art piece together, and <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/yuries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yuries</a>' chibi style is super adorable.</p><p>Aqua's loud personality is perfectly displayed here, along with Darkness's submissive nature and Megumin's constant exhaustion. The simple coloring style works well with the look of the piece itself.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Confident Pose</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Konosuba-Aqua-Confident-Art.jpg' /></figure><p>Aqua's go-getter personality is on display throughout most of the series, save for the situations that Kazuma always seems to wrap her up into, which she'll vehemently reject – until she's usually made to do so anyway.</p><p>Aqua's more positive side is shown wonderfully here by <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/phiphiauthon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PhiphiAuThon</a>, and the thick navy line art is a great stylistic touch that really makes the piece pop. The coloring style being flat compliments the art style well and adds a cute, retro-cartoony atmosphere to everything.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Healer's Helping Hand</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>Although it can be hard to remember at times whenever Aqua's general incompetence is played up for laughs, she's not a complete airhead and is actually <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/aqua-vs-emilia-best-isekai-magic-user/\">quite an advanced healer</a>. This piece by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mizzuiita/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mizzuiita</a> makes her look like quite the lively and bubbly healer. That isn't entirely wrong, although Aqua is also prone to wildly flailing and screeching in the face of giant enemies.</p><p>The thick, dark lines complement the piece's overall look, and using tiny lines themselves for shading is a pretty creative touch.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Still Sleepy</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/konosuba-aqua-cosplays-you-need-see/\">Another trait of Aqua's</a> that's typically played up for comedic purposes is how much she loves to sleep, and specifically how easy she can nap just about anywhere. This includes the barn that she and Kazuma stayed in at the start of the series, as she was already dead asleep by the time he'd laid down and started complaining. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fooshikeyy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fooshikeyy's</a> interpretation of Aqua gives off the impression that she's still half-asleep, raising to cover her mouth as she yawns with one eye open.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/konosuba-megumin-awesome-cosplay-look-just-like-anime/\">Konosuba: 10 Awesome Megumin Cosplay That Looks Just Like The Anime</a></span></p><p>The coloring style is simply adorable and matches with the chibi aesthetic well – the hair especially shines and stands out.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Sailor...Aqua?</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p>In May 2020, the internet was swept off its feet by the <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/sailor-moon/\">Sailor Moon</a> </em>redraw challenge. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kenpaiarts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kenpaiarts</a> chose a character that fits the scene incredibly well, arguably just as good as the self-dubbed 'clumsy crybaby' Usagi herself.</p><p>The artist included the original meme at the end as well, just in case somehow this drawing is a viewers' first introduction to it. Aqua truly does fit as early-series crybaby Usagi so well that it begs the question of which scouts the other members of the main cast might be.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Capable (Looking) Goddess</h2><figure><img src='' /></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/konosuba-aqua-megumin-best-character/\">Aqua is incredibly good</a> at looking as if she's incredibly coordinated, confident, and capable. It's only a shame that most of the time, only one of those things is truly accurate. Fans still love her regardless, of course, and that love is captured in this Aqua portrait by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/https.miyadraws_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hhtps.miyadraws_</a>.</p><p>The pencil-sketch looking lines have a certain kind of charm to them, and Aqua's expression is especially darling.

It was a two-part <i>World’s Finest</i> series with Batman and Superman, where they ended up in a Soviet-style gulag, Superman without his powers in Batman without his utility belt. So you have these two characters — and this was literally one of the first comic books I read.\"</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/john-ridley-dc-project-batman-person-of-color/\">John Ridley Reveals New DC Project --'47% Chance This Batman is a Person of Color'</a></span></p><p>He added, \"I obviously was aware of Batman when I was a kid — mostly from the TV show, and Superman also mostly from the TV show. Because I was so young, I mean, I was not even a reader yet, [but] you can sit in front of a TV and absorb. And I don’t even remember how exactly I got these books, but I got them. And mind you, these were stories that I think were reprints, even, so the stories themselves were from the ’60s and I think by the time I read them, it was probably in the early ’70s.\"</p><p>Ridley continued, \"But what I remember more than anything, is that they were literally graphic. Obviously [with] stories from that time period it wasn’t that there was blood or gore or things like that, but there was something about the stories about these two heroes. Superman’s uniform was torn, they were standing in line and getting poured food, and [they were] behind barbed wire. And there was obviously, politics involved, it may have been agitprop at that time. But it was about the Soviets, and it was about gulags, and it was about “our enemies,” it was about, you know, <i>it’s not this alien threat</i>. It may be communism that’s coming for us.\"</p><p>The experience was formative, though not entirely heartwarming. He clarified, \"And more than anything, I just remember that reading those books and truly feeling upset, upset in my stomach, upset reading them. I remember, I think Curt Swan was the artist, but it just didn’t feel like the light, happy Superman or Batman that I’d seen.\"</p><p>Ridley concluded, \"So for me, reading these stories where it was less about the powers — they had no powers.

The speculation about what could've happened if Aang did not go into the iceberg is endless. He could've been killed with the rest of his people, or he could've survived and stopped the war earlier. If it were the latter, then the next Avatar most likely wouldn't be Korra, unless Aang lived a ridiculously long time, like Kyoshi did.</p><p>While some fans have theorized that the next Avatar in this situation was supposed to be Katara, another<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfytI-wXQk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> theory suggests </a>it was supposed to be Yue. The root of this theory is based on the mystery of her birth. As a newborn, Yue was born silent, and none of the healers could help, so they put her in the Spirit Oasis, where the Moon Spirit gave some of her life force to Yue.</p><p>Once this happened, Yue's hair turned white, and she started to cry. As youtuber Chunkyjammer explains, it's like Yue was a vessel in need of a spirit to come to life. As <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the%20legend%20of%20korra/\">Avatar: The Legend of Korra</a></em> reveals, the Avatar is connected to the spirit Rava, acting as a human vessel for the powerful spirit. When the Avatar passes away, the next Avatar inherits Rava.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/legend-of-korra-most-forgettable-villain-lieutenant/\">Legend of Korra's Most Forgettable Villain Should Be Its Next Mastermind</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Princess-Yue-Avatar-Moon-Spirit-header.png\"/></figure><p>It's possible that Yue was born silent because she was supposed to inherit Rava after Aang; however, he was alive longer than the cycle anticipated, so Rava could not be passed on to Yue. While the show does not explain how the next Avatar is chosen beyond the elemental cycle, it is a possibility that the cycle is predetermined yet flexible. As seen in both series, destiny is real, but it is not crystal clear or set in stone.</p><p>The fan theory further explains how Yue fulfills the role of the Avatar in Season 1. The Avatar is the bridge between humans and spirits, and they work towards maintaining balance. Not only does Yue have a connection with spirits, but she also restores balance by sacrificing her human form to bring the Moon Spirit back to life and restore waterbenders with their bending abilities.</p><p>There are factors working against this theory, like the uncertainty of reincarnation. While it is possible that the Avatar cycle is predetermined, it is equally possible that it is arbitrary. Furthermore, it is unclear what would've unfolded if Aang was never frozen. While he may have been able to escape the Fire Nation attacks, it is also possible that he would've been killed, meaning that the next Avatar would've been born decades before Yue. On the other hand, if Aang survived, then he would've needed to live up to the exact date of Yue's birth.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avatar-theory-kyoshi-real-animal-companion-unagi/\">Avatar Theory: Kyoshi's REAL Animal Companion Was the Unagi</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Yue-After-The-Death-Of-The-Moon-Spirit-In-Avatar-The-Last-Airbender.jpg\"/></figure><p>Along with these uncertainties, the Avatar cycle works against this theory. If Yue was supposed to be the Avatar, then the following Avatar would be an earthbender; however, Korra is the Avatar in the following series. This would mean the cycle either readjusted to accommodate the change in destiny or Yue was never supposed to be the Avatar in the first place.</p><p>Finally, Yue does not appear to be a waterbender. It could be argued that audiences don't see her bend because the Northern Water Tribe had strict restrictions for female waterbenders at the time; however there is not much evidence to prove this is the case for Yue. If she isn't a waterbender, then she couldn't be the next Avatar in the cycle.</p><p>Even if Yue was never meant to be the next Avatar, she remains one of the few humans to have a strong bond with the spirits. She lives up to the role of the Avatar by restoring balance between humans and spirits during the Siege of the North. While her character is minor, she manages an Avatar level feat, and her backstory further supports the notion that destiny may have had greater things in store for her if Aang never went in the iceberg.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-legend-of-korra-should-have-been-the-third-avatar-series/\">The Legend of Korra Should Have Been the THIRD Avatar Series</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:00:50 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Avatar-the-last-airbender-cycle.jpg","linkMd5":"e651e9c1ef7cce9b58d775febb3088fb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn93@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-31-785_7639b9d80d00b794.webp","destWidth":1800,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":113832,"destBytes":113832,"author":"Caitlin Chappell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Avatar-the-last-airbender-cycle.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn93@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-31-785_7639b9d80d00b794.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Princess-Yue-Avatar-Moon-Spirit-header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn38@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-38-154_24c27c380dc9c9ef.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Yue-After-The-Death-Of-The-Moon-Spirit-In-Avatar-The-Last-Airbender.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn61@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-39-878_31529c2172b0f216.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989066},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Brie Larson Shares Her Rejected Movie Auditions List - Including Multiple MCU Roles","link":"https://www.cbr.com/brie-larson-rejected-movie-auditions-list-mcu-roles/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/captain-marvel-brie-larson-display.jpg\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/brie-larson/\">Brie Larson</a> has portrayed a number of roles, including Captain Marvel in the <a href=\"http://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>.

There are feuds between empires, strategic alliances through marriage and court drama that sets up a lot of the main strategy game tasks. This includes things like constructing castles, waging war with neighboring nations and researching new technology. The slightest personal vendettas between two rulers can plunge entire countries into a bloody battlefield.</p><p>Meanwhile, well thought-out marriages between nations can unite multiple kingdoms, keep the peace and strengthen an empire. However, <em>Crusader Kings III</em> is not meant to be an exact replica of or sequel to <em>Crusader Kings II.</em> Rather, it is an improvement on the many things that had made <em>Crusader Kings II</em> work so well.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ghost-of-tsushima-tips-tricks-strategies/\">Ghost of Tsushima: Tips, Tricks &#38; Strategies for Beginners</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/crusader-kings-iii-art.jpg\"/></figure><p>In the previous games, each character had personality traits that did not really serve much of a function in the grand scheme of things. <em>Crusader Kings III</em> improves upon that by making each character's personality traits their decisions and interactions more. These personality traits now play more important roles in guiding a character's behavior, via a stress system.</p><p>For example, someone who is cruel will build up amounts of stress if they show their enemies too much mercy. This encourages players to feel more connected and roleplay more with their characters, because now personality traits affect more than just character stats. Make sure to have the correct personality trait to fit the kind of dynasty being created.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/final-fantasy-xiv-tips-tricks-strategies/\">Final Fantasy XIV: Tips, Tricks &#38; Strategies for New Players</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/crusader-kings-3-stress-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>As stated before, the main consequence to denying a personality trait is a buildup of stress. Of course, being an important person in a powerful empire can be stressful in itself, so keeping an eye on how much stress a character has is a good idea. Too much stress leads to the character having a mental break. Once this happens, a couple of choices are offered to the player that act as coping mechanisms.</p><p>These include drinking, fighting, or frequenting a brothel, all of which throw curveballs at the character's development. More opportunities for drama and conflict will open up as character begins to engage more in their stress-relieving pass time. One example could be the development of a temper.

It also opens opportunities for more personal stories and character development. Battle resolution is a lot easier to read, with an advantage bar that shows who has the high ground during a battle. However, some additions to the game don't totally succeed.</p><p>An effort was made here to lessen the amount of micromanaging present in <em>Crusader Kings II</em>'s warfare. Unfortunately, it's a little wonky because all the player's armies now rally at a single point. This makes it so troops do not always split up evenly, which creates more of a task to evenly distribute an attack force.</p><p>This combat system can be a little frustrating, as this system can drastically impacts the outcome of a campaign and can ruin war tactics or strategies, so try not to rely on it too much.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tlous2-survivor-difficulty-tips-tricks/\">The Last of Us Part II: Tips &#38; Tricks for Winning on Survivor Difficulty</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Crusader-Kings-3-King-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Politics in <em>Crusader Kings III</em> is nothing short of shady, because manipulation and deceit are incredibly important.

How time works doesn't just stylize the drama or set up a twist; it explains the whole plot. While Tenet is full of promising, innovate ideas about time travel and the science behind it, the execution of those ideas is a bit confounding.</p><p><em>Tenet</em> is about time spies scheming to prevent an apocalypse sent from the future. Its use of time travel is unlike the kind moviegoers are accustomed to. From <em>Back to the Future</em> to <em>Avengers</em>:<em> Endgame</em>, time traveling characters usually approach the practice like a journey. Various moments are merely destinations for them to visit. Once they've arrived, they're free to move about the periods with the laws of physics firmly in place.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tenet-imax-featurette-behind-scenes/\">Tenet IMAX Featurette Takes You Behind The Scenes Of The Christopher Nolan Blockbuster</a></span></p><p>The rules that govern time travel in <em>Tenet</em> are more restrictive, which is a brilliant, ambitious addition to the genre. Early on, a covert research scientist (Clémence Poésy) explains the concept of \"inversion\" to \"the Protagonist\" (John David Washington). In the future, someone devises a process that inverts an object's entropy so it travels through time in reverse. Entropy is a measure of thermodynamic energy, involving time and randomness, so Nolan's off to a plausible start. Bullets returning to the chamber of a gun illustrate the point. The character then advises the Protagonist to \"feel\" it rather than think too hard about it.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tenet.jpg\"/></figure><p>The lesson fans are meant to take away is the same one the Protagonist now understands. Inversion is physics in reverse, <em>but </em>whatever happens in rewind has to have happened first. In other words, time is a mirror, as the palindrome title suggests. This is also the first indication that, no matter how confusing things get, what audiences are watching is likely a closed loop. What happens is what is always going to happen, except bullets don't have free will like people do; therefore, whether time is fixed or changeable in <em>Tenet</em> is an open question until the end.</p><p>The most surprising thing about the movie is that a long stretch of time goes by before there's an obvious time distortion; however, clues are present. In one of the film's highlights, the Protagonist and his partner, Neil (Robert Pattinson), fight a masked figure who's been inverted. Masks are a necessary component, since inverted lungs can't handle non-inverted air. This science flourish possibly exists to help audiences identify characters during inversion and to hide the reveal that the Protagonist is wrestling his inverted self.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tenets-drive-in-theater-availability/\">Tenet's Drive-In Theater Availability Hinges On Whether Local Indoor Theaters Are Open</a></span></p><p>It's a strength of the film that audiences keep learning about inversion, the mission and the Protagonist; although, some plot points are more clear than others. Tenet's big bad, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh), has been receiving parts of a doomsday device called \"the Algorithm\" from the future, which would destroy the world. Future generations decides to do so because climate change has wrecked the planet they inherited. Sator is terminal ill and lusts for the power to end the world, so the Algorithm will go off upon his suicide.</p><p>To stop them, the Protagonist has to invert himself. In another stand out scene, viewers see a car chase twice. The first happens in forward moving time, as the Protagonist loses a piece of the Algorithm. He notices a car un-crash and repair itself before it tails him in reverse. The chase ends with Sator shooting his wife and leaving to assemble the Algorithm. This pivotal moment serves as the N in <em>Tenet</em>, or the mid-point where the forward moving subject and the inversion meet. In a replay of the scene from an inverted Protagonist's perspective, fans see him driving the silver car, trying to alter the course of events.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Tenet-Sator-2.jpg\"/></figure><p>Characters in <em>Tenet</em> are able to invert with purpose because of a tactic known as temporal pincer movement. People with knowledge of how events transpire can, using designated turnstiles, reverse course, creating a mini closed loop. The film's climax is a mirror image battle, with Tenet forces using the pincer method to attack Sator's grunts, from both ten minutes in the past and the future. They have to delay Sator's suicide and disassemble the device at the exact right moment.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tenet-amc-reopen-70-percent-theaters-christopher-nolan-blockbuster/\">Tenet: AMC To Reopen 70% Of US Theaters For Christopher Nolan's Blockbuster</a></span></p><p>Twice, the plan appears to fail; however, an operative with a red string on his backpack saves the day, but he is shot in the process. As they discuss the mission's success, the Protagonist notices Neil's backpack with its red string. <em>Tenet</em>'s final twist confirms two things that are teased throughout the movie. One, the Protagonist has, with a few exceptions, been moving forward through time, and he will found Tenet and recruit Neil. Secondly, and more importantly, time appears to be a closed loop.</p><p><em>Tenet</em> goes so far as to bring up the grandfather paradox to explain the central conflict. That brain teaser holds that if a person goes back in time to kill their grandfather, they'd never exist; therefore, they'd be unable to kill their grandfather. This, along with Neil's heartfelt goodbye, hints at Nolan's interpretation of the film's conclusion. Despite the espionage, combat and explosions, the world is never doomed, at least not because of the Algorithm.</p><p><em>Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Tenet stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Kenneth Branagh, Dimple Kapadia, Martin Donovan, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Himesh Patel, Clémence Poésy, Denzil Smith and Michael Caine. The film is now playing in theaters overseas and arrives in select U.S. cities Sept. 3.

In that time, Sukuna has made sure the world remembered why he is <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jujutsu-kaisen-chapter-115-sukuna-king-of-curses/\">known as the King of Curses</a>. Unfortunately for Yuji, he'll have to come to terms with all the death and destruction Sukuna has unleashed since possessing his body.</p><p>Megumi Fushiguro, Yuji's friend and fellow <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jujutsu-kaisen-which-sorcerer-could-become-shaman-king/\">Jujutsu Sorcerer</a>, is known for his use of the Ten Shadows Technique that allows him to summon various Shikigami he can command. Part of this ability includes calling a Shikigami that the user doesn't have control of yet, but can if they're able to exorcise it. Fushiguro does the first part of that ritual by bringing the immensely powerful, and so far undefeated, Shikigami named Mahoraga onto the battlefield. This <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jujutsu-kaisen-chapter-117-fushiguros-exorcism-strategy-risky/\">risky plan</a> was meant to cause issues for the Cursed Spirits, even if it meant Fushiguro could lose his life in the process.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jujutsu-kaisen-trailer-plot-release-date-news/\">Jujutsu Kaisen: Trailer, Plot, Release Date &#38; News to Know</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Sukuna-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>Mahoraga immediately knocks Fushiguro unconscious, but Sukuna arrives and saves the young sorcerer's life, claiming there is something he still needs from him. As the two square off, Sukuna begins to understand how Mahoraga's abilities work. Aside from using the Sword of Extermination, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/monster-hunter-milla-jovovich-dual-blades-image/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a blade</a> specialized for taking down Cursed Spirits, Mahoraga can adapt to any attack. This allows it to see and recover from Sukuna's slashing abilities, but its limits are tested when Sukuna unleashes his Malevolent Shrine.</p><p>Malevolent Shrine, like most Domain Expansions, is guaranteed to hit anything within its effective area. Described as an artist's masterpiece painted on air instead of canvas, Malevolent Shrine is unlike other Domains as it hits everything within a 200-meter radius instead of creating a separate space surrounded by a barrier. As long as Malevolent Shrine is maintained, Sukuna's Cleave will strike anything with cursed energy, and Dismantle hits inanimate objects relentlessly. Sukuna makes sure to reduce the radius so Fushiguro isn't in range, but unfortunately, that kindness isn't extended to all the people obliterated by his attack.</p><p>Mahoraga can't escape the nonstop slashing of Malevolent Shrine, but it does try to regenerate after the flurry ends. Sukuna recognizes his chance to finish the fight, uttering the word \"Open,\" as he lets the same explosive flaming arrow that defeated Jogo fly into Mahoraga. After a massive explosion, the only thing remaining of the Shikigami is the strange wheel attached to its back, which Sukuna tosses towards Haruta Shigemo, a Curse user working with the Cursed Spirits. The area around Sukuna, which had once been a dense metropolis, is now a barren 140-meter circle of dirt.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fire-force-amaterasus-dark-secret-revealed/\">Fire Force: The Amaterasu's Dark Secret, Revealed</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jujutsu-Kaisen.jpg\"/></figure><p>Haruta is a Curse user seen throughout the \"Shibuya Incident Arc,\" fighting with both Nanami and Fushiguro, but his name and the nature of his cursed technique have only just been revealed. By collecting everyday miracles that erase themselves from Haruta's memory, these stored moments release when his life is in danger. Haruta can't believe his luck when Sukuna tells him to leave, but as he happily obliges the King of Curses, we see that his lucky miracles have run out. Believing he'll live to see another day, Haruta gets a couple of steps away before being sliced in half vertically.</p><p>With that final gruesome act, Sukuna can sense he'll soon lose control of Yuji's body. As Masamichi Yaga and Shoko Ieiri, the principal and doctor of Jujutsu High respectively, look at the utter destruction left by Sukuna, they spot the unconscious Fushiguro. Yaga notices Yuji/Sukuna for a moment, wondering which one is currently in control. The final panel reveals an extremely troubled and disturbed looking Yuji.</p><p>Yuji, like most <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/jujutsu-kaisen-anime-stream-exclusively-crunchyroll-fall/\">shonen protagonists</a>, is against taking a life, but has slowly learned that there are instances where he won't have the luxury of sticking to that principle. He's already reluctantly crossed that line, but that's nothing compared to the scale of Sukuna's massacre. Considering Yuji probably had a front seat view of Sukuna demolishing the city and murdering an unknown number of people, there's a big chance he'll struggle to cope with the aftermath.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-vol-16-final-arc/\">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba Vol. 16 Sets Up the Manga's Final Arc</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jujutsu-kaisen.jpg","linkMd5":"d8f5053c3cb359b3845e5ee8cf167a2b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn38@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-29-334_f2a218122e3d0250.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":105466,"destBytes":105466,"author":"Erik Kozura","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/jujutsu-kaisen.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn38@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-29-334_f2a218122e3d0250.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Sukuna-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn38@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-34-121_292bf21148d0b3b2.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jujutsu-Kaisen.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn5@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-37-925_ad436d44a13948b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989075},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Friday the 13th Blu-ray Box Set Details Are Scary Impressive ","link":"https://www.cbr.com/friday-the-13th-blu-ray-collection-details-scream-factory/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/friday-13th-jason-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>He's Back.

Studios series, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/brzrkr/\"><em>BRZRKR</em></a>. Co-written by Reeves and Matt Kindt, with art by Ron Garney, colors by Bill Crabtree, and letters by Clem Robbins, the new brutal and violent new series about an immortal warrior will pay tribute to one of the most beloved images the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/bill-and-ted-3/\">Bill and Ted Face the Music</a> star has ever appeared in, the \"Sad Keanu\" meme.</p><p>The meme, which surfaced in May of 2010, features a sad-looking <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bill-ted-face-the-music-makes-creepy-arc-even-creepier/\">Keanu</a> eating a sandwich on a park bench. Since it first surfaced, it's exploded into a series of colorful memes and has been remixed into countless variations over the past decade.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/keanu-reeves-brzrkr-comic-series/\">Keanu Reeves Launches BRZRKR Comic Series With Kindt &#38; Vitti</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SadKeanu.jpg\"/></figure><p>Although Reeves told the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtuWvi0fkb4\">BBC</a> that he wished he hadn't had his picture taken while \"eating a sandwich on the streets of New York\" in 2011, the meme cemented him as one of the Internet's most beloved actors. While Reeves has continued to star in genre fare like <em>Bill and Ted: Face the Music </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/\">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, </em>Reeves is equally celebrated for his various charitable contributions and overall positivity.</p><p>And in a preview of <em>BRZRKR </em>#1, Reeves and his creative collaborators have paid tribute to the mem in loving detail. In a preview, the protagonist of <em>BRZRKR </em>sits on a bench, striking that iconic, sandwich-eating pose in the rain.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bill-ted-face-the-music-george-carlin/\">Bill &#38; Ted Face the Music Has a Righteous George Carlin Tribute</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Reeves-Meme-BRZRKR.jpg\"/></figure><p>Although it's not clear why the titular Berzerkeris sad here, he has a long life of violence to look back on. As the Kickstart describes, the series will follow the immortal demigod warrior as he tries to uncover the truth behind the lifetimes of violence that have pushed his sanity to the breaking point. He'll also try to figure out how to free himself from the curse of immortality while fighting the battles that are too dangerous for anyone else.</p><p>While Reeves' public persona is positive and wholesome, <em>BRZRKR's </em>dark soldier seems to have far more in line with the ruthless killer Reeves portrays in the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/john-wick\">John Wick</a> franchise. With this image, <em>BRZRKR </em>reclaims the image that inspired thousands of jokes to highlight the pain and isolation of its violent lead. While the Internet rallied around the idea of cheering Keanu up, it seems like the Berzerker will have to carve out his own path to happiness.</p><p><em>BRZRKR </em>#1<em> is set to be released in October 2020.</em></p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fortnite-nexus-war-ends-meowscles-avengers/\">For Fortnite's Nexus War, Meowscles Needs to Join the Avengers</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 22:20:56 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Keanu-Reeves-BRZRKR.jpg","linkMd5":"e48defe6fc5e2065c0b63836799041af","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":200661,"destBytes":159328,"author":"Ian Powell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Keanu-Reeves-BRZRKR.jpg":null,"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SadKeanu.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn58@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-41-520_1a78aff6e3134e92.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Reeves-Meme-BRZRKR.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn77@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-40-803_17c609f686e77717.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989067},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Bleach: 10 Facts About The Series Even Hardcore Fans Forgot | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-series-facts-hardcore-fans-forgot/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-Featured.jpg\"/></figure><p>The iconic series, <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/bleach/\">Bleach</a></em>, has been going on for so long that most fans, even the most fanatic ones, do not recall some of the core details about the story (and its creation). The manga ended in 2016, after a whopping 74 volumes comprising 686 chapters in total, but the in-world timeline barely takes two years for the narrative to reach completion.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-ichigo-kurosaki-transformations/\">Bleach: The 10 Transformations Of Ichigo Kurosaki</a></span></p><p>However, discussing everything about <em>Bleach</em> would require far greater space than is available in this article, so here are the ten most important facts pertaining to the series that deserve to be remembered.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>The Gigantic Franchise</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bleach-social.jpg' /></figure><p>There are a <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/ways-bleach-ripped-off-yu-yu-hakusho-reasons-why-own-thing/\">lot of similarities between <em>Bleach</em> and <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em></a>, but that didn't stop the former from becoming one of the most beloved series of all time.</p><p>In addition to its manga and associated anime series, the story has been adapted to various other forms of media, as well, including several movies, video games, artbooks, novels, trading card series, and even <em>Rock Musical Bleach</em>. The latter is especially fascinating, as it seems that <em>Bleach</em> is popular enough to be represented via live stage performances.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Kyouka Suigetsu's Bankai</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bleach-Facts-Fans-Forgot-Aizen-Bankai.jpg' /></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-kyoka-suigetsu-ryuujin-jakka-comparison-most-powerful/\">zankapkuto known as Kyouka Suigetsu is no ordinary one</a>, and its inescapable hypnotic powers serve as both offense and defense while in combat (combined with Aizen's overpowering <em>reiatsu</em>). Interestingly, this is only his shikai's ability, leaving his unknown bankai a complete mystery.</p><p>He probably does have one, but there can be no confirmation about this due to the very nature of Kyouka Suigetsu. Some fans have even suggested that Kanzen Saimin is a feature of the bankai, implying that Aizen has woven yet another layer of lies about his true strength.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Orihime As Deus Ex Machina</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bleach-Fans-Forgot-Orihime-Deus-ex-Machina.jpg' /></figure><p>Yes, the same girl who is best known for her plaintive and interminable mewling of Ichigo's name might just be the most powerful character in Bleach (in her own way). Orihime's Shun Shun Rikka, a result of the Hogyouku's long-distance blessing, is able to bring about, as Aizen puts it, \"the rejection of phenomena,\" in that it can simply reverse a performed action, making it so that it had never occurred in the first place.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-manga-nerf-female-characters/\">Bleach: 10 Ways In Which The Manga Nerfs Female Characters</a></span></p><p>This ability of hers, considerably more effective than space-time manipulation, is actually sufficient to restore Ichigo's destroyed bankai — although only with the assistance of Tsukishima and his dreaded Book of the End.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Tite Kubo, Fashionista</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bleach-Cast-of-Characters.jpg' /></figure><p>Several <em>Bleach</em> characters have been dressed up by the mangaka in really spectacular outfits, ranging from casual homegrown attire to blazing beachwear. Apparently, Kubo has a thing for clothes, as can be seen from <a href=\"https://unrealitymag.com/bleach-creator-tite-kubo-one-hell-bleach-cosplay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his unbelievably authentic Captain Kurotsuchi cosplay</a>.</p><p>Further, he has admitted that he loves the aesthetic nature of fashion, claiming that the haori worn by the Shinigami are also an attempt to make them look stylish while fighting. Too bad he doesn't incorporate some of his funkier designs into the actual story.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Ichigo's Kill Count</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bleach-Ichigo-Fullbring.jpg' /></figure><p>Surprisingly, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-ichigo-fights-survive/\">Ichigo hasn't really killed a lot of characters</a> in the course of events, because, while he's a nice guy and everything, he doesn't care much about not spilling blood (unlike, for instance, Aang from <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>). Regardless, he has only officially murdered one person in the whole story, the previous Substitute Shinigami and antagonist of the <em>Fullbringer</em> arc, Kugo Ginjou.</p><p>Also, his Vasto Lorde incarnation pretty much vaporizes Ulquiorra Cifer's Segunda Etapa, but there is no clear consensus on if this can be included in the list, as he has absolutely no recollection of the event. Yhwach doesn't count, because it is Kazui Kurosaki who actually deals the final blow a decade later.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>The Nazi References In The Fourth Arc</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pjimage-10-1.jpg' /></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-villains-unfair-endings/\">final villains, the Wandenreich</a>, are apparently Quincy, so everything about them screams German.

To top it all off, Yhwach's sword hilt is designed much like the Reichsadler, the eagle-based herald that was, and still remains, part of Germany's official standard.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Too Many Filler Episodes</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bleach-filler-kisuke-mirror-match.jpg' /></figure><p>If there was one thing that diluted <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-moments-that-changed-everything/\">the momentous events in <em>Bleach</em></a>, it was the ridiculous number of fillers that the show's producers kept pumping out to pass time until the manga's storyline caught up to the anime.</p><p>Of the 366 total episodes created, covering all events that occurred before the <em>Thousand Year Blood War</em> arc, 163 of them are considered to be unrelated plots that include all the characters, their backstories and mythologies, but deviate from the essence of the narrative way too much to be acceptable. It's not that something this annoying is easy to forget, but the anime did stop production in 2012.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Rukia Was The Planned Protagonist</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rukia-bleach-ichigo-funny.jpg' /></figure><p>Before the fire-haired main character came into the picture, <em>Bleach</em> was supposed to be called <em>Snipe</em>, and Kuchiki Rukia (wearing her standard robes but holding the Grim Reaper's scythe to mark her as a Death God) was to be the story's protagonist.</p><p>More importantly, the antagonists were not meant to be Hollows at all, but actually human villains armed with guns instead of reiatsu and magical katanas. As fascinating as this version might have been, choosing Ichigo was a very smart decision made by Tite Kubo: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-uryu-wrong-smarter/\">At least it wasn't Uryuu</a> or Chad.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>The Anime Is Returning!</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bleach-Anime.jpg' /></figure><p>As stated above, the anime ended in 2012 (actually shelved because it was not receiving as much traction as before). Luckily, it has been recently announced that the series last arc would be given its own TV adaptation in 2021, eight agonizing years after most fans had lost hope that it would ever come back.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-characters-questionable-forgotten-things/\">Bleach: 10 Questionable Things Its Characters Did (Which Everyone Has Forgotten)</a></span></p><p>It will cover the manga chapters from 480 to 686, which means that there might be over a hundred episodes, at the very least! This decision makes more sense considering that next year happens to be <em>Bleach</em>'s twentieth anniversary.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Why Is It Named Bleach?</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bleach-Ichigo-Final.jpg' /></figure><p>The word Bleach is said to refer to the color \"white,\" evincing monochrome vibes in contrast with the Shinigami's black garments. This is the direct, and most believable, explanation for the origin of the name, but there remains another possibility.</p><p>Some fans have speculated that <em>Bleach</em> is a verb, not a noun — this way it can be read as the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/bleach-ichigo-wrong-smarter/\">release command for Ichigo's zanpakuto</a>, the only major one for which the words are still unknown.

It has some of the best arcs in <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/one-piece/\">One Piece</a></em>. There are a total of five arcs in the Summit War Saga: Sabaody Archipelago arc, Amazon Lily arc, Impel Down arc, Marineford arc, and Post-War arc.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-wano-arc-top-pirate-bounties/\">One Piece: Predicting The Top 10 Pirate Bounties After The Wano Arc</a></span></p><p>All the arcs are unique and two of them in particular are highly rated by the <em>One Piece</em> community. It is quite difficult to rank all the arcs because each of them is special in their own way. But, we will give it a fair go in this post. Here are all the arcs in the Summit War Saga ranked!</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Amazon Lily Arc</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Amazon-Lily-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After beaten ruthlessly by Bartholomew Kuma, Luffy was sent to Amazon Lily. The island was inhabited by women and Luffy was not welcome there. He had to fight against Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold, and in the meantime, he won the heart of Boa Hancock. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was on Amazon Lily that Luffy found out that Ace was going to be executed by the Marines. Luffy made up his mind that he was going to save his only brother. So, he sought help from Boa Hancock, who couldn't turn him down. This lead to the start of the mission \"Save Ace\".</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Post-War Arc</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Luffy-Sabo-Ace.jpg' /></figure><p>After the crushing defeat of the Whitebeard Pirates, the entire world rejoiced as they believed that the Marines rid them of one of the most malevolent pirates in the world. Luffy was distraught; he watched Ace die in his arms. It fell to Jinbe to motivate his future captain and made him realize that Luffy still had his crew, who were waiting for him.</p><p>This was one of the most difficult times in Luffy's life, but he didn't give up. Luffy went to Marineford with a message for his crew inscribed on his arm. The arc also covered Luffy's childhood including the time when he <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-ace-sabo-best-big-brother/\">met Ace and Sabo</a>. The arc is perfect and it complimented the fast-paced Marineford arc. The post-war arc toned down the seriousness and showed how the brothers bonded together.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Impel Down Arc</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ace-Impel-Down.jpg' /></figure><p>In this arc, all hell broke loose. Luffy managed to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-strongest-characters-impel-down-arc/\">enter Impel Down</a> with help from Boa Hancock. Luffy had one goal in mind and that was to free his brother. He had no idea that it was going to be such a difficult job. Luffy almost got himself killed when he tried to fight against Magellan. But, Luffy didn't care about getting himself killed, he wanted to save his brother and he was willing to go to any lengths to do so.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-characters-surpass-blackbeard/\">One Piece: 5 Characters Who Will Surpass Blackbeard (&#38; 5 Who Won’t)</a></span></p><p>With help from Ivankov, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-fan-favorite-villains-myanimelist/\">Bon Clay</a>, and a few others, Luffy managed to reach the level where Ace was being kept. However, he was met with disappointment when Jinbe told him that Ace was taken away to Marineford. Now, Luffy's goal became to chase away Ace and reach Marineford. In order to help Luffy, Bon Clay used himself as a distraction. He stayed behind which allowed him to open the Gates of Justice. This solidified the bond between Luffy and Bon Clay.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Sabaody Archipelago Arc</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/One-Piece-Sabaody-Archipelago-arc-Luffy-Celestial-Dragons.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sabaody Archipelago is one of the most highly rated arcs in the series. The arc saw all the Supernovas gathering together at the same place. If this wasn't enough, one of the members of the Roger Pirates was revealed. Silvers Rayleigh stole the spotlight when his real identity was revealed. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this arc, Luffy did one of the most outrageous things; he actually punched a Celestial Dragon, which put all the pirates at Sabaody Archipelago in jeopardy. Sentoumaru and his Pacifista wreaked havoc on the island. To pile further misery on the pirates, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-marine-admirals-yonko-level-reasons-below-close/\">Admiral Kizaru</a> and Bartholomew Kuma were also present on Sabaody. Kizaru crushed several Superonovas with minimal effort. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-worst-loss-straw-hat-pirates-ranked/\">The Straw Hats suffered</a> the most as all of them were sent to different places. The arc showed that Luffy and co. were not ready to enter the New World, that was crawling with insanely powerful pirates, who were merciless.</span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Marineford Arc</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Whitebeard-using-the-tremor-fruit.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best arc in the Summit War saga is Marineford. The stakes were very high during the arc. Portgas D. Ace, the son of Pirate King, Gol D. Roger was going to be executed by the Marines. Adding to this, Ace was a member of the Whitebeard Pirates and their captain didn't like it if anyone of his crewmates was harmed. So, the Marines were ready for an all-out with Whitebeard who had the title of the Strongest Man in the World. The war at Marineford involved the Whitebeard Pirates, the Shichibukai, and the entire Navy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The arc was a rollercoaster of emotions; in one instance it seemed that the Marines had the advantage and Ace was gonna be executed but then things would change quickly and the tide would turn in favor of the pirates. The entry of Luffy at Marineford made for an emotional reunion of the brothers. The arc ended with Ace and Whitebeard dying, thus the Marines emerged victorious. The arc also saw cameos from Shanks and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-blackbeard-pirates-bounty-ranked/\">Blackbeard</a>. There are some really iconic moments in the arc and some of them will never be forgotten, but one will forever stand out among the rest; the confirmation of the existence of One Piece by Whitebeard.

Working with massive franchises like <em>Star Wars </em>and creating original series like <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/mass-effect/\">Mass Effect</a> </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/dragon-age/\">Dragon Age</a> </em>has kept BioWare relevant for the last two decades.</p><p>The developer's two longest-running original franchises, <em>Mass Effect </em>and <em>Dragon Age</em>, are often compared by both casual and hardcore fans. While both of BioWare's big franchises contain consistent elements, like well-developed companions and massive fictional worlds to explore, each franchise handles these in unique ways. Both series appear similar on the surface, but diving just beneath the surface reveals what makes each franchise distinct.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-age-inquisitions-romanceable-characters-ranked/\">Dragon Age: Inquisition's Romanceable Characters, Ranked</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-combat.png\"/></figure><p><em>Mass Effect </em>and <em>Dragon Age </em>both focus on squad-based combat, with players controlling their own custom-made character and commanding a small number of followers. Both series let players freeze the battle at any time to pull up a radial menu, which allows them to use abilities and issue commands in the heat of battle. This makes the player character feel like a true leader, able to strategize and lead their unique team.</p><p>However, the similarities end there. <em>Dragon Age</em> focuses on close-range combat, ranged combat with bows or magic, and micromanaging your squad to achieve victory. Players can switch between controlling squadmates and programing the behavior of AI-controlled heroes to gain a tactical advantage over the enemy. Meanwhile, <em>Mass Effect</em> adds a heavy dose of third-person shooter gameplay to the equation, which makes moment-to-moment combat feel fast and hectic. In general, <em>Mass Effect</em>'s combat feels fast and natural, <em>Dragon Age</em>'s combat is slower and more tactical.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mass-effect-andromeda-great-idea-poor-execution/\">Mass Effect: Andromeda - Great Idea, Poor Execution</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dragon-age-companions.jpg\"/></figure><p>Characters are the bread and butter of any good BioWare game, and both <em>Mass Effect </em>and <em>Dragon Age</em> boast huge casts of iconic and memorable characters that can join you throughout the game. However, each franchise handles the companion system a bit differently.</p><p><em>Dragon Age </em>games feature an approval system where companions may agree or disagree with the protagonist's actions. Constantly making decisions that an ally disagrees with will damage your relationship with them, making them less friendly to speak to and even making them abandon your crew altogether. <em>Mass Effect</em>'s morality system is less intense, with your squadmates usually agreeing with your decisions. Each companion leans towards either compassion or ruthlessness, but the player's actions will never actually damage their relationship with a follower.</p><p>The <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy also focuses on a core group of companions. The six companions you meet in the first game become massive parts of the trilogy's story, with some of them returning in the following two games. While <em>Mass Effect 2 </em>introduces many new companions, <em>Mass Effect 3</em>'s team is comprised almost entirely of returning characters from the first two games.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mass-effect-shepard-illusive-man-tension/\">Mass Effect: Shepard and the Illusive Man's Tension, Explained</a></span></p><p>In contrast, the three <em>Dragon Age </em>games so far feature almost completely different casts. While there are a few companions that return in subsequent games, it is far less common than in the <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy. This makes <em>Dragon Age</em>'s cast feel larger and more diverse, but also less intimate than the tight-knit group in <em>Mass Effect.</em></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dragon-age-world.jpg\"/></figure><p>Both <em>Dragon Age </em>and <em>Mass Effect </em>feature breathtakingly detailed and unique worlds for players to venture through. <em>Mass Effect </em>is set in the Milky Way galaxy in the 22nd century, when humanity has discovered a method of interstellar travel that allows them to join a galactic community of various species. <em>Dragon Age </em>is set in Thedas, a dark fantasy world rife with political conflicts and horrifying monsters. Both franchises flesh out their intricate worlds using dozens upon dozens of in-game texts that make each world feel authentic.</p><p>Due to the differing nature of the universes, <em>Mass Effect </em>and <em>Dragon Age </em>allow players to explore their worlds in different ways. <em>Mass Effect</em> allows players to explore different planets, traveling between them on the spaceship <em>Normandy, </em>but typically only a small linear area of each planet can be explored. <em>Dragon Age </em>is much more open, with players able to explore large areas and venture between them at their leisure. This results in <em>Mass Effect</em>'s galaxy feeling larger overall, but <em>Dragon Age</em>'s world feeling more natural and real.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mass-effect-shepard-samara-ended-morinth-rampage/\">Mass Effect: How Commander Shepard &#38; Samara Ended Morinth's Rampage for Good</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shepard-male-and-female.jpg\"/></figure><p>Even with interesting worlds and iconic supporting characters, every story needs a protagonist. The player character determines how the player experiences a game and allows them to immerse themselves in its world. As RPGs, <em>Mass Effect </em>and <em>Dragon Age</em> allow players to customize their character with a unique appearance, gender, personality and abilities. However, each franchise differs heavily in the treatment of their protagonists. The <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy features a single protagonist, Commander Shepard, whose attributes and relationships can be imported across all three games. This gives the trilogy consistency, with other characters meeting and building relationships with them over multiple titles.</p><p>Meanwhile, each <em>Dragon Age </em>game features a new protagonist with a new origin story and different relationships. While this means that the games feel less closely connected, it allows players to experience new things in each title rather than feeling confined by past decisions. Players who feel compelled to continue Shepard's morality and abilities across the whole trilogy might be more likely to experiment with new races, genders or classes in the <em>Dragon Age </em>games.</p><p>Over two decades, BioWare's titles have transported gamers to fantastical worlds and iconic characters, with each franchise delivering a fresh experience. <em>Mass Effect</em> uses save files to form a cohesive story with recurring characters and a consistent protagonist, while <em>Dragon Age</em> tells a variety of stories from the epic world of Thedas. While fans may prefer one approach, it's clear that BioWare has created two of the greatest role-playing series in history.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">Keep Reading: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-age-inquisition-witcher-3-better-rpg/\">Dragon Age: Inquisition Vs The Witcher 3 - Which RPG Is Better?</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 02:15:16 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mass-effect-dragon-age.jpg","linkMd5":"26164f43debbcd7af7b31f01bee03faa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn75@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-29-424_6782328d264fd1be.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":127658,"destBytes":127658,"author":"Thomas McNulty","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mass-effect-dragon-age.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn75@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-29-424_6782328d264fd1be.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mass-effect-combat.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-42-174_9408ca208ad7ed89.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dragon-age-companions.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-36-522_a0f84bf9abc65e76.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dragon-age-world.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn40@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-42-709_1013d773ce65c43d.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shepard-male-and-female.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn49@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-39-832_14598b4bcd9d7521.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989062},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Riverdale Boss Teases the Death of Archie Andrews in Season 5","link":"https://www.cbr.com/riverdale-roberto-aguirre-sacasa-teases-archie-andrews-death-season-5/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Riverdale-Archie-arrested-header.png\"/></figure><p>Since it premiered on The CW in 2017, one of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/riverdale/\">Riverdale</a>'s core characters has been Archie Andrews (KJ Apa).

Ned was sent to invade Earth but went a different direction after he fell in love with humans, and especially our planet’s most valuable resource: celebrities. Now, aided by their spaceship’s AI BETI and the tiny, comical CLODS, Ned and Cornelius beam famous folks onto the bridge of their ship for interviews in which Ned strives to learn more about different aspects of human culture. Some of the stars who do their best to get Ned up to speed in the show's first 10-episode season include RuPaul, Joel McHale, Andy Richter, Kristen Schall and Billy Dee Williams. This fun and unique take on the traditional late-night talk show comes from the brilliant minds at the Jim Henson Company, and while its beloved characters from <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-muppets/\">The Muppets</a> and <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/sesame-street/\">Sesame Street</a></em> have been a part of the pop culture landscape for decades, Ned and his cronies are brand new -- and every bit as fun and lovable as Kermit the Frog or Elmo.</p><p>In an exclusive interview, CBR spoke to Brian Henson, an executive producer on <em>Earth to Ned</em>, about the long road Ned’s taken to the small screen, the creation of the show's puppets and their personalities and how improvisation became a vital part of puppeteering at the Jim Henson Company.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-not-too-late-show-with-elmo-exactly-what-we-need/\">The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo Is Exactly What We Need Right Now</a></span></p><p><strong>CBR: Where did the idea for <em>Earth to Ned</em> come from?</strong></p><p><strong>Brian Henson:</strong> Well, I've sort of been working on it for a while, actually, for years. I love the idea. I love the idea of somebody who's completely ignorant looking at mankind and trying to figure them out, and trying to figure out people. So, that was sort of at the heart of it, so that led us to aliens, aliens hosting a talk show. And over the years, at one point  it was aliens reviewing what was on television and stuff like that, but then it became the talk show, which was a much, much more fun and richer area to play with.</p><p>But the idea also was, I wanted to do something that felt and looked like a late-night talk show format, but we definitely made it super family-friendly, because we knew we were on a streamer, there is no time that it is aired, it's available on the streamer. But the idea of doing that late-night talk show format, but not having it be sort of cynical or sarcastic or too cool for school, I wanted to just be really positive. So that sort of guided us in the developing of the personality of Ned that he just loves humanity. You know, he was sent here to destroy the planet and he just can't do it, because he starts watching TV and he loves people.</p><p>And he wants to <em>be</em> a great person. He loves people, and he has gotten it all wrong, which is part of what's fun. So he's made all these assumptions that he understands mankind and he understands the way people think and what they do, but he's getting it wrong all the time. But everything delights him, all of the absurdity of people just delights him. And that feeds into a lot of the interviews where very quickly the guest celebrities figure out that Ned just keeps getting it wrong so they're able to tell him how society really works and how people really interact. And that's just kind of a great and fun place to be as the show, the content, because it kind of allows us to laugh at ourselves instead of getting angry at ourselves. So, it's a positive look at the absurdity that is our existence. And I just loved that.</p><p>So once we have that as Ned, then we're like, we need a cool sidekick. And actually originally, it was Ned and the sidekick and they were reviewing television. But then we developed BETI, the artificial intelligence, and the CLODS are really there for just ridiculous comic relief and I just thought it was part of the suspension of disbelief. They're very, very simple puppets and a lot of fun. So then the show then becomes a talk show, but it has very rich [characters] and their relationships are a lot of fun. So you also get this overarching storyline as you're watching these characters interact. So it's a talk show, but it's also the show behind the scenes of the talk show at the same time.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Earth-to-Ned-Brian-Henson.jpeg\"/></figure><p><strong>While there is that overarching story, as you said, the interactions in the actual talk show segments seem very spontaneous. How much of the show is scripted?</strong></p><p>Yeah, almost never is a guest on script. So, all of the interviews are 100% improvised, and Cornelius and Ned are improvising. But they have a set of questions and topics that we know relates to the storyline of the episode.... But both the field pieces and the interviews are almost never scripted at all.</p><p>And then the pieces between the interviews are scripted. So when it's Ned and Cornelius talking before a guest comes in, then we're scripted. We don't stay rigid to the script. Improvising puppets is something that I've been having so much fun with and started back in like 2006 with my show, <em><a href=\"https://www.henson.com/puppet-up.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Puppet Up! -- Uncensored</a></em>. So my puppeteers have been training in improv comedy for over 10 years, so I really liked the idea of improvising animatronic creatures because it's just something that we had never done.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/fraggle-rock-reboot-ordered-series-apple/\">Apple Orders Fraggle Rock Reboot to Series</a></span></p><p><strong>I've seen <em>Puppet Up!</em>; it's really phenomenal.</strong></p><p>And these guys all came off of that. So Colleen [Smith] who's BETI and Paul Rugg who's the voice of Ned and Michael Oosterom was the main puppeteer on Cornelius. Basically all the puppeteers came out of <em>Puppet Up!</em>.</p><p><strong>How did the team develop the different personalities for the different characters?</strong></p><p>Well, we had a very exhaustive audition process to figure out, primarily, the pairing of Cornelius and Ned. But like I said, the type of content we wanted guided us a lot in creating the personality of Ned. So we knew a lot about what we wanted Ned to be. He's very optimistic. He's ignorant and excited about all things human. And we knew that he was also a military general, that this was the worst job; he should never have been made a military general because he's the last guy that should have done that. And that guided us. Then we're like, \"Well then how did he get the job?\" Well because his dad is the Admiral of the Fleet, and that's how he was given a ship. And he's sort of coming out; Ned has had a life of suffering because he's been forced to be what he isn't comfortable being, and then he's gotten to Earth, and now he wants to be a person. It's opened him up so that he's now a new person, and so excited about being a person.</p><p>And then Cornelius really is a military lieutenant, and so we were saying for Cornelius, this is all a huge sidetrack that he doesn't particularly like, he doesn't know why we've done it. But then what we knew was his arc was he was going to learn more about himself and more about humanity, and that really, he's the one that grows the most. And then BETI is just the cynical artificial intelligence that really was running a battleship, and really, the only purpose is to be destroying planets, and this is all a ridiculous waste of time. And she just thinks Cornelius and Ned are idiots.</p><p><strong>What about the creation of the physical puppets? Even just the eyes on Ned and Cornelius are remarkably articulated. Is there new technology being used to make the puppets so intricate?</strong></p><p>...The route that came into creating Ned was when I created Richfield for <em>Dinosaurs.</em> I loved that character. He can't move, he's stuck behind a desk, but because of that you can bring to life this really big character. And I loved Ritchfield. I loved Ritchfield so much, that's what led us to creating Pilot on <em>Farscape</em>. Pilot was also really big, and Pilot turned out to be really my favorite animatronic character that we've ever created.</p><p>So Ned, the physical creation of the puppet, there's a lot of what we learned on Pilot that goes into Ned. He's stuck behind a desk, he's got four arms, he's got a really big head, and that allows you to do more with motors, and that allows him to be more expressive. So yeah, I guess, the route to Ned was Richfield via Pilot into Ned.</p><p>And then Cornelius is more akin to characters that we've done more often, where it's a hand puppet but with an animatronic enhancement. Neither of them have any CG enhancements going on. So, they are 100% animatronic, which is a little old school in a fun way.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Earth-to-Ned-CLODS.jpeg\"/></figure><p><strong>How many people does it take to operate Ned and Cornelius?</strong></p><p>Ned takes six.</p><p><strong>Wow.</strong></p><p>And they're improvising. And actually, that's the one thing that I thought might have turned out to be impossible. I was a little worried... I didn't know if six people could ever get on the same page and improvise together. And it was really hard. For the first couple weeks, it was really tough. And then they all just sort of gelled, and then it became the most fun. All of the puppeteers on <em>Ned</em> all said this is the most fun they've ever had puppeteering because of trying to work with a group of six. It's just delightful and unpredictable. And we also kind of programmed it into his personality a little bit that he's a little bit all over the place because I knew there's six people. He can't be a precise performing character... it'll never work, so he's a little bit all over the place.</p><p>And then Cornelius is three, which is something we do often. So Cornelius is the main puppeteer is doing one hand and the head, and so that's very like the Muppets. And then the second puppeteer is just doing the other hand, and the third puppeteer is doing all of the facial features. And that's a combination we've done quite a bit, so that's pretty predictable. And then BETI is... Colleen is basically performing BETI on her own, that's a real-time animated character. And then all the little CLODS... basically, they're simple little rod puppets. They're styled after a puppet that my dad [Muppets creator, Jim Henson] made well before I was born. And I don't know what the name of it was but he made these little creatures with these extending plastic stretched necks, and they just had a little nose and eyes.... He made them probably in the mid 1950s. And so I was basically borrowing from that heritage with that puppet that my dad made and sort of updating it.</p><p><strong>So which came first the physical puppets or their personalities? It sounds like the personality came first and then the look came later. Is that correct?</strong></p><p>Yeah, a little bit. I mean, you have the concept of the character first.... This is how much I knew before we started drawing the character: He loves mankind, he just adores mankind, that was where it started. Then we started drawing. So then we were drawing and developing the personality kind of simultaneously. And then by the time we were building the character..., we had a three-page full description of his personality.</p><p><strong>It's really amazing how fully realized the characters seem to be as soon as they appear on the show. Is creating those believable personalities something you have a formula for or do the personalities naturally emerge as you create the characters?</strong></p><p>No. It's why I started <em>Puppet Up!</em> The reason I started <em>Puppet Up!</em> is because our puppeteers had become so script-based that it was taking way too long for characters to feel fully rounded. Because they were just... coming up with a voice. A puppet was assigned, they would come up with a voice and then they would do the script, and that was just not creating rich enough characters. And so that's why we started the whole improvising inside of our company was because with a good improviser, the moment they start improvising in the scene you believe their character is fully realized, they have a whole history, a whole life, and that, I knew, was what we needed. So that's why we shifted all of our training to improv and puppeteering training since 2006. That's the way we train all of our puppeteers now. We train them in improv comedy and puppetry.</p><p>And in the old days... when my dad was alive, we only trained in puppetry, and for every 20 people -- and I did a lot of the training for my father -- for every 20 people we trained, we maybe had two good performers. And it would be the people that what my dad would call, \"could ad-lib,\" because we never thought about improvising. But the ones that were good enough that they could actually ad-lib tended to be the best ones.</p><p>They were the ones who could develop a new character. Because... this is the way we would find new characters [on <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-muppet-show/\"><em>The Muppet Show</em></a>]. We'd have an episode where cows walk in, say three things and then walk out. And then if we loved the cow, then the cow would be written to come back in in another show and then another show and another show, and then eventually the cow might become a main character on <em>The Muppet Show</em>. And so what we were finding is it's only those performers who could ad-lib who could make that cow funny, who would make that cow unforgettable in the first three lines.</p><p>So anyway, that's what pushed us to improvising and why I love so much the idea of improvising in this show. I love these aliens... improvising because that gives you that character richness. It does mean you do overshoot. Most of our interviews were one-hour interviews. You know, they have to be so that you can play around [with] different topics, and then in the end you tighten it all up.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-muppets-2015-isnt-train-wreck-remembers/\">The Muppets' 2015 Series Isn't the Train Wreck Everyone Remembers</a></span></p><p><strong>Recently there have been several talk shows hosted by Muppets. Elmo has a talk show, Miss Piggy had a talk show for a while. What is it about the talk show format that seems to work for these characters?</strong></p><p>I think it basically comes from puppets work well with celebrities. So that's the first thing, because puppets can get celebrities to relax and not worry about being too cool for school, you know. Celebrities don't worry about humiliating themselves when they're with a puppet, and so they open up a lot more. So that's just always been true and... <em>The Muppet Show</em> and <em>Sesame Street</em>, even in the early years, that's where it became clear that the puppets work really well with celebrities. And you know, nobody's doing variety shows anymore, so that format may be on the rebound, it may be coming back. But honestly, we didn't know that Elmo had a talk show when we started making <em>Ned</em>. And Miss Piggy's talk show, you mean the ABC series <em>Muppets</em>, right?</p><p><strong>I do.</strong></p><p>And yes, but we didn't really think that we were treading too close to that. Ours is actually much closer to a real talk show.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Earth-to-Ned-Ned-with-Irwins.jpeg\"/></figure><p><strong>Unlike something with Elmo or Miss Piggy, though, this is a whole new character that celebrities might not be familiar with. Was it easy to get stars to participate?</strong></p><p>Yes, but not everyone. It's because it is very normal that when you have a new talk show it's all about who's the host, and what has the host done, can you show us some material on the host, because we want to protect our clients. So when agents and managers weren't able to see anything on this, literally, we had to cast quite a few of our guests when Ned was only a drawing, when he was still being built. So I guess, truthfully, it meant that our guests tend to be more daring, where they didn't mind that they didn't really know what they were getting into.... By the time we finished shooting the first episode, we already had cast all the episodes that we shot. So, we literally didn't cast anyone who had really seen Ned, maybe three guests were cast after they could see Ned and see him interviewing somebody else....</p><p><strong>It's actually a really fun group of guests.</strong></p><p>And that's what we were looking for is fun. Fun is exactly the word we were looking for. People that would have fun, who would be daring and do things that were unexpected and all of that. I couldn't be happier with the results of all the guests. They were really terrific.</p><p><strong>There've been a lot of revivals recently with legacy characters. There's been a new <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/muppets-now/\">Muppet show</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/Fraggle-Rock/\"><em>Fraggle Rock</em></a> is coming back, but Earth to Ned is really fun because it's a completely original new character. Are there any plans to create other original characters for other shows?</strong></p><p>...People are loving rebooting things, and we're doing it... but we tend to do it not as remakes. You know, like <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-dark-crystal-age-of-resistance/\">The Dark Crystal </a></em>that was prequel, the miniseries was prequel. Yeah, we're always developing original stuff. I love doing original stuff. It's harder to sell. I thank Dan Silver at Disney+ for loving this one. And... part of the problem with our kind of shows is creating Ned and Cornelius costs a ton of money, so you can't really do a test, you can't do a pilot. The only way it makes sense financially is if you make a whole series, even though you don't even have the characters yet. And so that's hard for a channel, for an outlet to take that kind of risk. And I just think, ...kudos to Disney+ that they liked the idea of doing something so original.</p><p><em>All 10 episodes of Earth to Ned are available to stream now on Disney+</em>.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/muppets-now-scooter-interview/\">Muppets Now's Scooter Talks Up the New Disney+ Show</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:45:38 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Earth-to-Ned-Ned-and-Cornelius.jpeg","linkMd5":"eb51cc1336fe5f65a2d7db346cbe143b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-30-574_5900a87769b5f10d.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":324958,"destBytes":324958,"author":"Cynthia Vinney","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Earth-to-Ned-Ned-and-Cornelius.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-30-574_5900a87769b5f10d.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Earth-to-Ned-Brian-Henson.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn46@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-41-426_d21ebc7aecaaa70a.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Earth-to-Ned-CLODS.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn47@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-40-528_be95d62b53ab69f0.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Earth-to-Ned-Ned-with-Irwins.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn81@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-42-279_a01d9797ab8801f8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989066},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"Assassin's Creed Manga, Blade of Shao Jun, Hits in Early 2021","link":"https://www.cbr.com/assassins-creed-manga-blade-of-shao-us-release-viz-february-2021/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/assassins-creed-header.jpg\"/></figure><p><em>Assassin's Creed: Blade of Shao Jun</em>, Minoji Kurata's manga based on the popular <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/assassins-creed/\">Assassin's Creed</a> series of video games, is getting a localized release in the United States this February from Viz Media.</p><p><em>Blade of Shao Jun</em> follows Shao Jun, a Master Assassin of the Chinese Brotherhood of Assassins who lived during the 1500s.

One of the most popular examples of this is <em>Watchmen</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/dr-manhattan/\">Doctor Manhattan</a>- a man who basically becomes a science god but still has a glimmer of humanity in him.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/alan-moore-watchmen-miracleman-better-worse/\">5 Reasons Alan Moore's Miracleman Is Better Than Watchmen (&#38; 5 Reasons Watchmen Is Better)</a></span></p><p>Another example of this is <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/lucifer/\">Lucifer Morningstar</a>. The biblical Devil, he was introduced in <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-sandman/\">The Sandman </a></em>before abandoning Hell, going to Earth, and getting his own book about his adventures. If Doctor Manhattan were to clash with Lucifer Morningstar, who would win?</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">11 </span>Doctor Manhattan: Recreator Of Worlds</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Dr.-Manhattan.jpg' /></figure><p>The New 52 was an ambitious move by DC to garner new readers by wiping much of their slate clean, much like <em>Crisis On Infinite Earths </em>was before it. However, it never gained the success of its fabled predecessor and was shuttered about five years after its inception. There were <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-new-52-aged-well-badly-batman-female-characters/\">a lot of changes to the universe that were great, and some that weren't</a>, but DC came up with a novel reason for all of these changes.</p><p>Doctor Manhattan came to the DC Universe and decided to start messing around with it. He went back in time, stopping certain events and literally stole time from the universe, basically recreating the DC Universe.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Lucifer Morningstar: First Fallen</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lucifer.jpg' /></figure><p>Lucifer was once God's favorite archangel and he was also the first rebel. Cast out of Heaven, he became the ruler of Hell. It's all pretty standard to people who are familiar with Judeo-Christian tradition. Lucifer was the first being to question God and led the war against Heaven for uncountable years after that until he got tired of it.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-lucifer-morningstar-memes-best/\">DC: 10 Hilarious Lucifer Morningstar Memes True Fans Will Enjoy</a></span></p><p>Lucifer has been conscious since the beginning of the all things and has watched creation develop. He has seen and done things that no other being has, giving him more experience in just about everything than most beings can possibly imagine.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Doctor Manhattan: Master Of Energy</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/04.-Dr.-Manhattan-Hand-Raised-DC-Costume-Pile.jpg' /></figure><p>Doctor Manhattan came from a world without superpowered beings. He helped the US government and was their main deterrent to Soviet nuclear attack. He could render the warheads inert and even absorb and change the nature of the nuclear energy released.</p><p>When he came to the DC Universe, he would eventually face some of the most powerful heroes and completely defeat them. He was able to turn their energies against them completely, even showing the ability to manipulate magical energy. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-villains-dr-mamhattan-can-defeat-and-villains-he-cant/\">This ability would serve him well against just about any foe</a>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Lucifer Morningstar: Eons Of Conflict</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DC-Lucifer-19-Header.jpg' /></figure><p>As ruler of Hell, Lucifer had to deal with some of the worst beings in existence. Hell was a constantly squabbling hierarchy of demons trying to gain power and they would often target Lucifer himself in their machinations, which was a huge mistake. Lucifer was much more powerful and canny than them and was always able to defeat any pretenders to his throne.</p><p>In his eons of existence, Lucifer has not only dealt with nearly every kind of scheme, but also been a part of many of them. He did it for so long that he got tired of it and decided to leave Hell. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-warriors-lucifer-morningstar-could-beat-lose-against/\">His experience in conflict is unprecedented</a>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Doctor Manhattan: A Man Of Learning</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dr-manhattans-child-the-secret-to-dcs-watchmen-sequel.jpg' /></figure><p>Doctor Manhattan's obsession is knowledge. One of the reasons he worked for the US government on his world for so long was because they gave him the means to not only do any experiments he wanted, but to use his powers for all kinds of beneficial scientific endeavors, such as designing an entirely new energy system based on lithium he could synthesize, revolutionizing technology.</p><p>All of this learning and knowledge had the added effect of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/watchmen-dr-manhattans-greatest-powers-ranked/\">teaching him new ways of using his powers</a>- the more he learned about the universe and the way it worked, the more he could do with his powers.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Lucifer Morningstar: Feared By All</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tumblr-inline-oumqqy728n1qec1pk-1280-Cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Lucifer was once the most powerful, wise, and beautiful angel of them all, and after his fall he still retained all of that. The universe is full of powerful forces, yet they all have one thing in common- they fear Lucifer Morningstar. Gods, angels, demons, it doesn't matter who, they all tread lightly in his presence.</p><p>Even beings like the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-endless/\">Endless</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/sandman-the-endless-facts/\">who gods listen to and fear</a>, are afraid of Lucifer. Morpheus treated him with dignity and respect in an attempt to mollify Lucifer and even the elder Endless, like Destiny and Death, knew better than to trifle with the Star of Morning.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Doctor Manhattan: Time's Orphan</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dr.-Manhattan.jpg' /></figure><p>Doctor Manhattan doesn't experience time like anyone else. For him, it's all happening at once- the past, present, and future all occurring simultaneously. This gives him a unique, almost unprecedented view of the universe and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dr-manhattan-vs-thanos/\">has allowed him to do some extraordinary things</a>- he knows what's going to happen and yet he also doesn't. It's can be confusing and yet it works for him.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/watchmen-most-thought-provoking-quotes/\">Watchmen: 10 Most Thought-Provoking Quotes From The Comic</a></span></p><p>The only thing that can mess with his perception of time are tachyons, which muddle his visions of the future.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Lucifer Morningstar: Created A Universe</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lucifer-feat.jpg' /></figure><p>As powerful as Lucifer is, he can't create things on his own, only transmute them from one thing to another. However, if he works in concert with the archangel Michael or his niece Elaine, he gains creative powers, and he's used this ability once to create an entirely new universe. The whole thing ended badly, but he still was able to do it.</p><p>Even though he can't do it on his own, the fact that he was able to create a universe at all is very impressive. He understood how things worked well enough to create one on his own, and that shows just how intelligent he really is.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Doctor Manhattan: Hard To Defeat</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/doomsday-clock-9-dr-manhattan-naked-header-copy.jpg' /></figure><p>Doctor Manhattan was created in a terrible accident. He used his prodigious knowledge to reassemble his molecular structure, and this allowed him to learn how to manipulate matter of all kinds and it also made him extremely hard to destroy. There are probably ways to do it, of course, and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-watchmen-dr-manhattan-battle/\">beings who could</a>, but the problem is figuring out how.</p><p>This makes battling Doctor Manhattan a daunting proposition- how does one destroy someone who learned how to reconstruct their molecular structure from scratch the first time they used their powers?</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Lucifer Morningstar: Actually Immortal</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lucifer.jpg' /></figure><p>Immortality is a tricky thing. There are many beings who have the potential to live forever and yet can still be killed. Conversely, there are beings who are completely indestructible who will one day die. Lucifer, however, is actually immortal- he will live forever and cannot be killed by anything other than a literal act of God- God himself is the only one who can do away with him.</p><p>Fighting Lucifer is a losing proposition, because there's no way to gain a final victory over him. Even on the small chance that someone was able to outmaneuver him, they couldn't kill him and this would give him a chance to come back and destroy them.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Winner: Lucifer Morningstar</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lucifer-header.jpg' /></figure><p>Doctor Manhattan is one of the most powerful beings in existence, however even his powers are dwarfed by those of Lucifer Morningstar. Lucifer is the second most powerful being in all of creation; he can do just about anything.</p><p>As hard as Doctor Manhattan can be to defeat, Lucifer would have the power to do so, whereas nothing Doctor Manhattan can do would put him down.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lucifer-tom-ellis-perfect-mannerisms-source-material/\">Lucifer: 10 Mannerisms From The Comics That Tom Ellis Nails</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 22:00:21 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doctor-Manhattan-Vs-Lucifer.jpg","linkMd5":"22f7c0f5f569cd5be27270fff0742bd3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn67@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-29-367_674be1a99201d055.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":188614,"destBytes":188614,"author":"David Harth","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Doctor-Manhattan-Vs-Lucifer.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn67@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-29-367_674be1a99201d055.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Dr.-Manhattan.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn85@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-42-283_c10b8ee833f3c459.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lucifer.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn78@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-41-648_ef8b7b5580660e1a.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/04.-Dr.-Manhattan-Hand-Raised-DC-Costume-Pile.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn12@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-35-162_2f1f8490af40dbeb.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DC-Lucifer-19-Header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-38-372_3d061d0ec3a83ff4.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dr-manhattans-child-the-secret-to-dcs-watchmen-sequel.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn84@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-36-884_dccb9c5e7f04c66f.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tumblr-inline-oumqqy728n1qec1pk-1280-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-40-379_bd87df124c310e89.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Dr.-Manhattan.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn24@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-39-508_aa4e42be73e4b5d1.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lucifer-feat.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn6@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-43-307_bb92d82632ddc78d.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/doomsday-clock-9-dr-manhattan-naked-header-copy.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn52@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-37-432_7cc5ddab62a90201.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lucifer.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn38@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-37-357_8aa19ffd409f594d.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lucifer-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn91@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-41-042_07301bc362a44580.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989069},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"5 Ways Squidward Is Secretly A Good Guy (& 5 Ways He's The Worst)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/squidward-secret-good-the-worst/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Good-Squidward-bad-Squidward.jpg\"/></figure><p>Love him or hate him, Squidward is one of the most recognizable and significant characters in cartoon history. While not exactly a stereotypical fountain of knowledge for kids in a kid's show, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spongebob-square-pants-squidward-facts/\">Squidward being an antithesis</a> of SpongeBob gives the show its own special character dynamics and unique brand of humor that rivals adult cartoons,' a tough feat for kid's cartoon.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/transformers-cartoon-comic-book/\">5 Reasons Why The Original Transformers Cartoon Is The Best Version Of The Story (&#38; 5 Why It's The Comics)</a></span></p><p>Of course, Squidward is a mixed bag and unlike the genuinely well-meaning but clueless SpongeBob, he's more agenda-driven. As a result, he's done a lot of deeds both good and bad-- mostly the latter, showing his egocentric and elitist side. Still, deep down, Squidward is a good guy, he just doesn't want to show it because of his pride. Here are five examples of each extreme of Squidward's moral spectrum.</p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>SECRETLY GOOD: GENUINE CONCERN FOR SPONGEBOB</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Spongebob-and-Squidward-wallpaper-spongebob-squarepants-40591291-1920-1080.jpg' /></figure><p>This one's certainly not a secret to the viewers and is generally a known quality of Squidward due to how often he shows it. At the bottom of his inky heart, Squidward actually cares for SpongeBob– enough to stand up for him and even fight for his rights.</p><p>This is especially noticeable when Mr. Krabs sold SpongeBob for 62 cents and Squidward got angry. There was also that one time where Squidward smacked a pizza at a customer's face after they berated SpongeBob. The list goes on to show just how Squidward secretly acts as a true friend to SpongeBob.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>THE WORST: KICKING OUT A HOMELESS SpongeBob</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Squidward-eyes.jpg' /></figure><p>Too bad Squidward can't maintain the momentum of being nice to SpongeBob as his more sociopathic nature gets the best of him. When SpongeBob's pineapple house gets destroyed, he tried to bunk up with Squidward only to get kicked out in the middle of the night right into the cold ocean floor.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spongebob-squarepants-battle-bikini-bottom-primer/\">SpongeBob: Everything You Need to Know About Battle for Bikini Bottom</a></span></p></p><p>What's even more heartbreaking for SpongeBob is that he did the opposite for Squidward and even sheltered the cephalopod when he became homeless after quitting Krusty Krab. Goes to show just how destructively cynical and remorseless Squidward can get.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>SECRETLY GOOD: HANDSOME SQUIDWARD REVERSAL</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Two-Faces-of-Squidward-24.jpg' /></figure><p>Squidward becoming handsome was a huge deal for him especially since he's an artist. He quickly got the attention he wanted and even became a sensation with his music despite being a mediocre clarinet player. He soon discovered that not all that glitters is gold and life as a handsome creature can be taxing.</p><p>This was a humbling lesson for Squidward and he quickly wanted to revert back to his old self. He was even happy when it happened and didn't seem to regret what he had lost, which displays just how content he is with his regular appearance. Needless to say, he's happier with not being shallow or superficial. His heart's in the right place with that one.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>THE WORST: VIOLENT APRIL FOOLS PRANK</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/April-fools-squidward.jpg' /></figure><p>There's no doubt that Squidward is the most neurotic character in <em>SpongeBob Squarepants</em>. He's quick to anger &#38; annoy and is also prone to mental breakdowns. That's why he went overboard with one April Fools prank for SpongeBob.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/adventure-time-best-quotes/\">Adventure Time: 10 Of The Most Relatable Quotes from the Beloved Cartoon</a></span></p></p><p>It was a rather overkill prank that involved injuring SpongeBob and humiliating him several times over in front of Bikini Bottom. Sure, it might have been SpongeBob's plan all along, but there's no denying that Squidward's schadenfreude humor is in poor taste.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>SECRETLY GOOD: TOLERANCE FOR NONSENSE</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spongebob-Squarepants-Squidward-feature.jpg' /></figure><p>Despite the neuroticism and his annoyance with SpongeBob and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/patrick-star-vs-sandy-cheeks-spongebob-real-best-friend/\">Patrick's shenanigans</a> or even with Mr. Krabs' unfair treatment, Squidward deserves a world record award for patience. He puts up with Bikini Bottom's nonsense every single day of his life.</p><p>It's even more impressive when one considers his location, he's practically stuck between two riots (SpongeBob and Patrick's houses). Yet, there were only a couple of episodes where he tried to move out. The rest of the series, he stayed and endured.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>THE WORST: RUINING A FRIENDSHIP</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Squidward-concern.jpg' /></figure><p>One of the worst things about being neighbors with two uber-optimistic dorks is the noise they create when they're having fun. Too bad Squidward cannot stand this cacophony of happiness because of his sad life, so he had to share his negativity to the world.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/cartoons-childhood-romances-best/\">10 Best Romances From Childhood Cartoons</a></span></p></p><p>He did this <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/cartoon-characters-most-destructive-ever/\">most destructively</a> when he ruined SpongeBob and Patrick's friendship in one episode. It was a surprisingly effective action and the two despised each other quickly all because Squidward can't stand their joy. Thankfully, it backfired against Squidward.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>SECRETLY GOOD: FORGIVING NATURE</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/squidward.jpg' /></figure><p>One would think that Squidward, neurotic as he is, would hold a grudge against most citizens of Bikini Bottom after being the whole town's figurative punching bag. However, he holds no such ill-intent and grievance towards SpongeBob, Patrick, or Mr. Krabs.</p><p>He might have some slight resentment but the stuff he's been through because of them would have filled a regular person with hatred. Instead, Squidward seems to have forgiven most of their missteps towards him. He moves on in life and goes through each episode only to get slighted or ridiculed as the cycle continues.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>THE WORST: MOOCHING OFF SPONGEBOB</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Squidward-bum.jpg' /></figure><p>The rock bottom for Squidward was when he resigned from Krusty Krab and hoped to become a football-playing king in space. Except that didn't happen and he instead became a vagrant with no practical or professional skills. So SpongeBob, being a good friend, took him in and cared for him until he found a job.</p><p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/gi-joe-original-cartoon-best-reasons-comics-better/\">5 Reasons Why The Original G.I. Joe Cartoon Is The Best Version Of The Story (&#38; 5 Why It's The Comics)</a></span></p></p><p>Except Squidward never found a job and quickly descended into an ungrateful bum who took advantage of SpongeBob's kindness and generosity. He even went as far as enslaving SpongeBob in his own house. Even SpongeBob noticed this and didn't put up with it for it too long.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>SECRETLY GOOD: PRETENDING TO BE SANTA CLAUS</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Squidward-Santa.jpg' /></figure><p>As for Squidward's most noble deed of unrecognized kindness? Being Santa Claus. It was Squidward at his nicest where he gave away everything dear to him (mostly house furnishings) just to complete SpongeBob and Bikini Bottom's first Christmas.</p><p>Since he pretended to be Santa, all credit went to the plump pensioner and it was a mostly thankless act of goodwill from Squidward. Oddly enough, a hiding Santa was there all along and let it all happen, but he did voice out his gratitude to Squidward as a compensation of sorts.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>THE WORST: NEARLY KILLED GARY</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/I-Was-a-Teenage-Gary-076.jpg' /></figure><p>Finally, we see Squidward at his worst when he got an important responsibility thrust upon him by SpongeBob. All Squidward had to do was feed Gary for three days but he didn't because he prioritized his sunbathing. As a result, Gary became sick and was probably close to death by starvation by the time SpongeBob came home. At the very least, Squidward had karmic judgment handed to him quickly by the end of that episode.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/best-cartoon-cosplays/\">10 Cartoon Cosplays You Have To See To Believe</a></span></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 02:00:52 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Good-Squidward-bad-Squidward.jpg","linkMd5":"3a4315f46fb4af73af69b7f806ef7007","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn84@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-30-717_b4a8308fa5540418.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":110912,"destBytes":110912,"author":"Sid Natividad","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Good-Squidward-bad-Squidward.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn84@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-30-717_b4a8308fa5540418.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Spongebob-and-Squidward-wallpaper-spongebob-squarepants-40591291-1920-1080.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn58@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-42-946_08253995a719ea65.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Squidward-eyes.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn58@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-34-073_ac0611d566e88343.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Two-Faces-of-Squidward-24.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn32@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-35-267_3b48267b93842a14.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/April-fools-squidward.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn85@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-38-398_e66a8adf9c80956b.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Spongebob-Squarepants-Squidward-feature.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn20@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-35-689_3dfe327012bb91be.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Squidward-concern.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn39@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-35-853_0f52b2bc529b0223.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/squidward.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn81@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-41-655_a3199f7e18f7047e.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Squidward-bum.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn90@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-37-903_32ed899b91821894.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Squidward-Santa.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn10@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-34-027_7fe7f87b96991bed.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/I-Was-a-Teenage-Gary-076.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn74@2020_6/2020/09/05/06-56-43-068_754064e5abbd64f8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989062},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"REVIEW: Archer's Season 11 Is a Disappointing Step Backward | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/archer-season-11-review/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/archer-season-11-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>For the past three seasons, both <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/archer/\"><em>Archer</em></a> the show and Archer the character have been in a fantasy world. When self-involved superspy Sterling Archer (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) slipped into a coma at the end of the series’ seventh season, creator Adam Reed took that as an opportunity to escape from the continuity and the sometimes repetitive storytelling that the show had built up, and reinvent the characters and the setting in different genres and time periods for each new season.</p><p>Archer and his entire supporting cast became the players in a noir-style detective story, a pulpy adventure serial, and a far-future space adventure. Sometimes the characters closely resembled their previous incarnations, but not always. It gave Reed and his collaborators the creative freedom to essentially create entire new shows while holding onto <em>Archer</em>’s talented voice cast and devoted fan base.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/archer-season-11-information-guide/\">Archer Season 11: Trailer, Plot, Release Date &#38; News to Know</a></span></p><p>However, some among that devoted fan base grew increasingly frustrated with the lack of answers about what was happening to the “real” Archer and his compatriots, and so at the end of the Season 10, Archer woke up from his coma, returning to the world he (and the audience) had previously known. It’s no coincidence that <em>Archer</em>’s return to the show’s old format comes as Reed has further stepped back from his duties on the show, although he approved the new direction. Whereas in prior seasons, Reed would write or co-write all of the episodes, he only wrote half of  Season 19, and in the new outing, he’s only writing a single episode. This leaves the show with a sense of falling back on what worked before, on imitating Reed’s distinctive voice rather than exploring something new.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/archer-season-11-pam.jpg\"/></figure><p>Granted, very few shows remain creatively vibrant so far into their runs, and it’s hard to blame the creators for <em>Archer</em> not being as fresh and exciting as it was a decade ago. The fantasy seasons were frequently uneven, full of funny moments that never quite came together into a satisfying story, and the new season is similarly hit-and-miss. There are still big laughs in all of the four episodes available for review (out of eight total for the season), and the characters and performances are so well-defined at this point that it’s a pleasure just to spend time with them again. But the world that Archer returns to is very, very familiar, even though it’s been tweaked slightly from the one he left several years ago.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/archer-first-season-11-teaser/\">Archer Adjusts to Post-Coma Life in First Season 11 Teaser</a></span></p><p>He’s still working for an independent spy agency run by his mother Malory (Jessica Walter), with the same dysfunctional set of colleagues, although they’ve become slightly more functional in Archer’s absence. The first episode of the season opens with a propulsive heist and chase sequence set to Judas Priest’s “You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’,” in which the team works together effortlessly. Two of them are in masks as they run from bad guys, and one reveals herself as Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), Archer’s former lover and frequent rival, and it seems likely that the other will be Archer himself, back in action. But instead it turns out to be Archer’s dorky colleague Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), who is now respected and in control. That’s when the team gets the call that Archer has woken from his three-year coma.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/archer-season-11-release.jpg\"/></figure><p>The main thematic resonance of the season is Archer’s feeling that time has passed him by. He’s welcomed back only reluctantly, despite his eagerness to return to duty and take his place as the world’s greatest spy. Over the course of the pre-coma seasons, the show had built up some surprisingly poignant character development, mainly for Archer and Lana, and the new season sporadically returns to that while also settling back into old rhythms. Archer’s newfound outsider status makes him more aggressively annoying, and it feels like a regression in his personality rather than a step forward. Most of the time, he just does exactly what he used to do, while the supporting characters yell at him.</p><p>Plot-wise, the show returns to episodic spy missions, including a <em>Bloodsport</em>-style underground martial arts tournament and a sting operation to stop an art thief. Some longtime recurring characters return, and there are plenty of callbacks to long-running jokes. The show has always excelled at complex wordplay, and the writers on this season continue that strength, which the voice actors carry off flawlessly as usual. Guest voices in the first four episodes include Jamie Lee Curtis, Bowen Yang and Stephen Tobolowsky, all of whom bring some extra flair to their roles. The animation, which has become increasingly sophisticated over the years, is immersive without losing the simple charm of the character design, and there are some impressively designed set pieces.</p><p>And yet it’s all disappointingly recycled and rote. Like Archer himself, going through the motions of his old life even though he’s not really capable of his former athleticism (he walks with a high-tech cane), the show tries to return to a glory that’s long since passed. Some fans may be happy to revisit the world that they grew to love in the show’s early seasons, but it’s not something that can easily be recreated. The fantasy settings were sometimes ridiculous, but at least they tried something new. “This all feels pretty coma-y,” Archer says in the fourth episode as the team embarks on its latest crazy mission. It’s a shame he’s not right about that.</p><p><em>Starring the voices of H.

Although there are more than just 10 shocking deaths in this series, we've tried to pick the 10 most startling ones that we've seen to date. Here are the 10 most shocking deaths that we've seen in <em>Naruto</em>.</p><p><strong><em>Updated on September 4th, 2020 by Josh Davison: </em></strong><em>Despite the series being over, Naruto continues to be one of the most popular and widely discussed anime in the world. Some of this is thanks to the continuation through <a href=\"http://cbr.com/tag/boruto/\">Boruto</a>, but Naruto keeps getting a bulk of the attention regardless of what's going on in Boruto right now. One of the things that made Naruto a compelling anime is the fact that characters could and, frequently, would die. Characters that were well-rounded and fully established would get wiped out in oftentimes grisly fashions. With that in mind, five more entries have been added to the list to spotlight more shocking deaths from Naruto.</em></p>\n                        <h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">15 </span>Shikaku Nara And Inoichi Yamanaka</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Naruto-Shikaku.jpg' /></figure><p>Shikaku and Inoichi were of the generation of shinobi that came before Naruto's, and they had become renowned for their teamwork as two-thirds of the Ino-Shika-Cho trio of that generation. However, their position in the series didn't make them bulletproof.</p><p>Their deaths still came as a bit of a shock. They were helping coordinate the Allied Shinobi Forces in the Fourth Great Ninja War until the Ten-Tailed Beast realized where they were communicating plans from. The Ten-Tails launched an attack at their headquarters, and Shikaku and Inoichi both knew they didn't have time to make a getaway. So, they sent out final orders, said farewell to their children, and accepted their fates.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">14 </span>Zabuza Momochi (Resurrected)</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Zabuza-Edo-Tensei-Cropped.png' /></figure><p>Zabuza Momochi was the first main antagonist of <em>Naruto </em>and died at the end of the \"Land of Waves\" arc. However, both Zabuza and his protege, Haku, were resurrected by Kabuto's Edo Tensei jutsu. Neither Zabuza nor Haku were in control of their actions at this point, and they made it known to their foes, Kakashi and Might Guy, that they were at peace and wanted to return.</p><p>This, along with Zabuza's genuine concern and respect for Kakashi, Naruto, and the rest of Team 7, is what made Zabuza's second death shocking. One would think that he would have a grudge against Team 7 over the circumstances of his own demise, but he instead showed concern for them and even happiness in learning that Naruto was living a good life.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">13 </span>Shishui Uchiha</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shisui-death.jpg' /></figure><p>Shisui Uchiha died years before the events of <em>Naruto. </em>He was close friends with Itachi Uchiha, and he was one of the few Uchiha completely against the planned coup against Konoha. He had one of his Sharingan Eyes stolen by Danzo, who later pushed for Itachi to wipe out the Uchiha.</p><p>In the end, Shishui couldn't handle what was becoming of the Uchiha Clan. He gave his Mangekyo Sharingan to Itachi, and Shishui took his own life. In this case, it's more the manner of Shisui's death than the actual occurrence that made it so shocking. It was tragic and downright heartbreaking.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">12 </span>Kimmimaro Kaguya</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kimimaro-cropped.jpg' /></figure><p>Kimmimaro Kaguya was one of Orochimaru's most powerful followers at the time, and he was the head of the Sound Five. When Sasuke fled Konoha to learn from Orochimaru, Kimmimaro helped ensure that Sasuke would be able to make his journey without being taken back home. This lead to Kimmimaro facing down Rock Lee and Gaara of the Sand.</p><p>Kimmimaro's Kekkei Genkai made him an immensely powerful foe, and the audience learns of Kimmimaro's tragic backstory, including his fatal congenital disease. Despite that, it looked like he was going to kill Gaara and Rock Lee until that disease killed Kimmimaro right before he could land the killing blow.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">11 </span>Gaara Of The Sand</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Gaara-Kazekage-One-Tail-Jinchu--riki.jpg' /></figure><p>Gaara's death came at the beginning of <em>Naruto: Shippuden</em> after he was kidnapped by Deidara and Sasori of the Akatsuki. They extracted the One-Tailed Shukaku from Gaara, and the process killed him.</p><p>This was shocking, as so much had gone into showing Gaara's reform. Plus, he was the Kazekage of the Hidden Sand Village now, and he was a fan-favorite. Of course, the audience knows now that the death didn't last. Chiyo, another shinobi from the Sand Village, gave her life to heal Gaara and bring him back from the dead.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">10 </span>Kakashi Hatake</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kakashi-Hatake-and-his-father-from-Naruto-Shippuuden.jpg' /></figure><p>One of the most popular characters in the entire <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/naruto-rock-lee-vs-jjba-characters/\"><em>Naruto</em></a> series, Kakashi Hatake was met with the cruel fate of death during the Pain arc. With Deva Path showing up in search of Naruto, it was up to Kakashi to stop him, and he nearly pulled it off. However, Kakashi fell short and ended up paying with his life.</p><p>Thankfully for the fans, he was reanimated towards the end of the arc when Nagato Uzumaki used the Rinne Rebirth technique, otherwise, he would've been a lot higher up the list.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Haku</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Naruto-Haku.jpg' /></figure><p>One of the first few characters to die in <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/naruto-characters-potential-surpass-naruto-sasuke-who-can-never/\"><em>Naruto</em></a>, Haku fought against Team 7 during the battle of Tazuna's Bridge. While fighting against Naruto, he foresaw the danger that Kakashi posed to Zabuza, his benefactor.</p><p>Throwing his body in harm's way, Haku died a premature death despite being only a child, shocking most of the fans and giving them a taste of what <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/naruto-rock-lee-fan-art-limit/\"><em>Naruto</em></a> was all about at the same time. Although Haku was reanimated in the series, later on, he faced the same fate of getting pierced by Kakashi's Raikiri.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Konan</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Naruto-Konan.jpg' /></figure><p>After having left the Akatsuki for good, nobody expected Konan to appear in the story for quite some time. However, Obito saw to it that Konan was disposed of right away. The two engaged in a fight in which Konan emerged victorious and successfully managed to kill Obito, only for him to use Izanagi and take her by surprise.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Naruto: 5 Heroes Of The 4th Great Ninja War (&#38; 5 Villains)\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/naruto-heroes-villains-4th-great-ninja/\">Naruto: 5 Heroes Of The 4th Great Ninja War (&#38; 5 Villains)</a></span></p><p>Not only did Obito surprise Konan but the entire fandom as well. Konan ended up dying in an excruciatingly painful manner while Obito proceeded to take Nagato's Rinnegan and use it for his own good.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Hiruzen Sarutobi</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hiruzen-Sarutobi.jpg' /></figure><p>The death of the Third Hokage of Konoha remains to be one of the most shocking ones we've seen in the series. This is largely because nobody expected the Chunin Exams to turn into a mess where Orochimaru fought against the Third. With a powerful barrier erected by the Sound Four, it was either do or die or Hiruzen Sarutobi.</p><p>He ended up dying, but he took away Orochimaru's arms with him in the process. The death of Hiruzen Sarutobi marked the end of an era for Konoha and left the village reeling as they lacked a proper leader until quite some time.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Asuma Sarutobi</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Naruto-Asuma.jpg' /></figure><p>One of Konohagakure's elite Jonin, Asuma Sarutobi met his demise during the Hidan and Kakuzu arc of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/shonen-jump-anime-areas-wrong-better/\"><em>Naruto Shippuden</em></a>. With Team 10 stepping into action after a long time, hardly anyone could've seen Asuma's death coming. The entire fandom was taken by surprise when Hidan actually managed to kill him as not only was he the leader of Team 10 but also the son of the former Hokage.</p><p>Asuma's death was crucial to the development of his students, however. Shikamaru, Choji, and Ino pulled through and saw to it that their teacher was avenged by the end of the arc, thanks to help from Kakashi Hatake and Naruto Uzumaki.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Madara Uchiha</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Uchiha-Madara-from-Naruto-Shippuuden.jpg' /></figure><p>Madara Uchiha was one of the main antagonists of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/naruto-times-hated-kakashi-loved/\"><em>Naruto</em></a> who ended up dying in the Fourth Great Ninja War. Although being an antagonist means you'll die most of the time, Madara's death was shocking in every way.</p><p>Right when the Uchiha was at the peak of his powers, Zetsu struck and turned him into a vessel for Kaguya Otsutsuki. With Kaguya's defeat, Madara Uchiha was released from her grasp and he went on to die alongside the other reanimated shinobi from his era, such as his war buddy Hashirama Senju.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Obito Uchiha</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Naruto-Obito.jpg' /></figure><p>Just like Madara, Obito's death was rather strange. After having a change of heart, thanks to Naruto Uzumaki, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/naruto-martial-arts-fighting-styles-inspiration/\">Obito could fight right until the end</a> and help Kakashi build a new era after the war. Surprisingly, he wasn't given the opportunity as he ended up dying at the hands of Kaguya Otsutsuki towards the end of the Ninja War.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Naruto: 5 Reasons Jiraiya Should Have Been Hokage (&#38; 5 Why He Shouldn't Have Been)\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/naruto-jiraiya-should-hokage-reasons/\">Naruto: 5 Reasons Jiraiya Should Have Been Hokage (&#38; 5 Why He Shouldn't Have Been)</a></span></p><p>To Obito, the act of shielding <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/naruto-obito-fan-art-amazing/\"><em>Naruto</em></a> with his body was like an act of redemption.

He was the detestable elder brother of Sasuke who murdered their entire clan. With that being said, Itachi's death came as shock to the fans as Sasuke had well and truly lost the battle.</p><p>With the revelation of how Itachi actually intended for this to happen, his death got an even bigger meaning, and to date, it leaves the fans shaking when it is mentioned.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Neji Hyuga</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Neji.jpg' /></figure><p>Neji's death is unarguably one of the most shocking ones we've seen in the series to date.

That poster quickly became the subject of intense criticism for its <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/netflix-apologizes-poster-sexualizing-child-stars-movie-cuties/\">apparent sexualization of children</a>.

However, prior to their confrontation, Homelander learned that Becca was not dead, and that she had given birth to his son. Enraged at having been lied to, Homelander burned out Stillwell's eyes, killing her. Billy then tried to blow the two up, but this didn't kill Homelander.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-boys-jeffrey-dean-morgan-season-3-covid-19/\">The Boys: Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Season 3 Role May Not Happen Due to COVID-19</a></span></p><p>At the end of Season 1, Homelander brought Billy to Becca's house, revealing to him that she'd survived. Considering Homelander's penchant for violence, it initially seemed somewhat odd that he would let Billy go. However, the first three episodes of <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/boys-season-2-certified-fresh-rotten-tomatoes/\"><em>The Boys </em>Season 2</a> explains why Homelander didn't kill Billy.</p><p>In <em>The Boys </em>Season 2's first three episodes, Homelander regularly visits Becca and Ryan, his son. This makes Becca incredibly uncomfortable, though, as Homelander wants to insert himself in his son's life and help the boy see himself as more than human. During a fight about the superhero's behavior, Homelander makes clear to Becca that he let Billy go because she made access to Ryan conditional on her husband's survival.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-boys-why-homelander-threatened-stormfront/\">The Boys: The Reason Why Homelander Is Threatened by Stormfront's Arrival</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Becca-Butcher-1.png\"/></figure><p>The second episode of <em>The Boys </em>Season 2 also reveals what happened to Billy directly after the finale. Following the initial confrontation at Becca and Ryan's house at the end of Season 1, Homelander dropped Billy off outside of a Tony Cicero's, and Billy rushed inside to make notes about everything he could remember. While inside, a news cast revealed Billy was wanted in connection with the murder of Stillwell, forcing him to flee. However, he still intends to find and liberate Becca, using any means at his disposal to achieve his goal.</p><p>The explanation given in the show isn't necessarily complete, as Becca would have no way of actually knowing Billy survived. Plus, Homelander would pretty easily be able to just force his way into his son's life. However, Homelander is tremendously arrogant, which is at least partially why he let Billy go. The leader of the Seven certainly doesn't believe that a powerless man is at all capable of taking him down, and Billy's credibility is gone following claims that he killed Stillwell. As such, Homelander likely doesn't believe Billy is in any way a threat. Billy, though, is tenacious, and he's willing to do anything to get Becca back, so Homelander might have grossly underestimated his opponent this time around.</p><p><em>Amazon Studios' <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/the-boys-season-2-3-comic-stories/amp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Boys</a> stars Karl Urban as Billy Butcher, Jack Quaid as Hughie, Laz Alonso as Mother's Milk, Tomer Kapon as Frenchie, Karen Fukuhara as the Female, Erin Moriarty as Annie January, Chace Crawford as the Deep, Antony Starr as Homelander, Aya Cash as Stormfront and Simon Pegg as Hughie's dad.

In the film, Tagoma is around on Zarbon’s level and is immediately killed by Frieza upon his revival. In the anime, however, Tagoma becomes Frieza’s personal sparring partner. Tagoma becomes stronger alongside Frieza before swapping bodies with Ginyu. From there, Tagoma-Ginyu is killed by Vegeta.

Sorbet plays an instrumental role in helping take down Goku at the end of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resurrection F</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but he’s killed unceremoniously like the rest of Frieza’s infantrymen. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Kikono</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Kikono.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kikono is an interesting character.

It certainly helps matters that Berryblue was Frieza’s personal nanny growing up, suggesting that some of Frieza’s personality might have been picked up from Berryblue. </span></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Frieza</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dragon-Ball-Golden-Frieza.jpg' /></figure><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frieza’s time in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dragon Ball Super </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has been an interesting one and the end of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broly </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">implies that Frieza won’t be going anywhere anytime soon.

The film was a nostalgic and reverent trip down memory lane for fans of those films, filled with character details like Lois’ struggle with smoking and Lex’s obsession with real estate.</p><p>Moreover, the film paid homage to generations of the Man of Steel’s mythology. The film had costuming and a visual aesthetic reminiscent of the 1940’s Fleischer cartoons. Clark Kent was an overly clumsy milquetoast. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-jimmy-olsen-best-worst-versions/\">Jimmy Olsen was a wide-eyed, good-natured photographer</a>.

Centering around the shaky romantic relationship between the Man of Steel and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-10-best-lois-lane-stories-of-all-time/\">Lois Lane</a>, the film explored the rift between the two since Superman's disappearance, as well as what the future might possibly have in store for them as parents.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dccomics-superman-lois-lane-most-romantic-moments/\">10 Most Romantic Moments Between Superman &#38; Lois Lane</a></span></p><p>The preponderant focus on romance rather than action is something fans and moviegoers criticized, feeling the film was too melodramatic and slow at times for a movie about the world's first and greatest superhero. However, the drama provided a nice layer of substance and texture to the characters.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>MAN OF STEEL: BATTLE SCENES</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Man-of-Steel-Superman-Flight-Fight.jpg' /></figure><p>It's not every day a moviegoer gets to see two people punch each other through skyscrapers or destroy a small Midwestern town in its entirety. Those who decried <em>Superman Returns</em>' lack of battle scenes got what they craved and more in <em>Man of Steel</em>. The film finally depicted what could be possible in terms of an onscreen fight between people with <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-strongest-kryptonians-ranked/\">Kryptonian power levels</a>, which resulted in the destruction of most of downtown Metropolis. This carnage was not only thrilling (and also a little difficult) to watch, but also proved the impetus for Batman’s actions in <em>Dawn of Justice</em>.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>SUPERMAN RETURNS: SUPER-DAD</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Superman-Son.jpg' /></figure><p>The formula for storytelling when it comes to the Man of Steel hasn’t really changed much in the last eighty-odd years. He’s a reporter. He’s from Krypton and was raised in Kansas. He’s vulnerable to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-kryptonite-types-effects/\">kryptonite</a>. He saves people from danger, especially Lois Lane.</p><p>Most of the elements readers and moviegoers see as iconic were added years after Superman’s debut. For example, he only gained the ability to fly a few years after his first appearance. <em>Superman Returns</em> sought to add another element to the narrative stew by including Jason White as Superman’s biological son. The idea was interesting if not well-received, and has since been introduced in the comics in the form of Jonathan Kent, Superboy.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>MAN OF STEEL: EARLY WANDERINGS</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Man-of-Steel-Beard.jpg' /></figure><p>Before <em>Man of Steel</em> gave Superman the <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/unanswered-questions-batman-begins-dc-nolan-alfred-christian-bale/\">Batman Begins</a></em> treatment by showing the hero’s early wanderings, no film had depicted Clark Kent’s early adulthood.

This colored-in an important part of the character’s life and added to his depth in the eyes of the audience.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>SUPERMAN RETURNS: HUMOR</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Superman-returns-Lex-Luthor-Brushes-his-Teeth-Daily-Planet-conference.jpg' /></figure><p>One of the major criticisms leveled against <em>Man of Steel</em> (as well as all of Zack Snyder’s DCEU offerings) was that it was too dark and somber in tone, lacking the optimism and humor with which the character had come to be associated.</p><p>Thankfully, <em>Superman Returns</em> made more of an effort to infuse its narrative with a little comedy. Whether it was Lex Luthor’s toothpaste-filled recognition of Lois Lane, Kitty Kowalski’s reluctance to let Superman fly after saving her, or Jimmy Olsen’s nervous musings, <em>Superman Returns</em> was chock-full of lighthearted and amusing moments.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>MAN OF STEEL: SUPER-PHYSIQUE</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hnery-Cavil-Superman-Physique.jpg' /></figure><p>Nothing against Christopher Reeve or Brandon Routh, who both worked notoriously hard to attain their spandex-ready physiques, but the svelte and slender Superman doesn’t really match the comic book depiction. In the comics, Superman is presented as quite muscular, somewhere between ripped solid and jacked up.</p><p>Whatever regimen Henry Cavill was on to gain his Super-physique, it worked perfectly. The actor managed to capture Superman’s look to a tee, from his chiseled pecs to his bulging biceps to his rock-hard abs. Christopher Reeve had us believing a man could fly; Henry Cavill had us believing a man could lift the whole world on his perfectly formed shoulders!</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>SUPERMAN RETURNS: HOPE</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Superman-Returns-Space.jpg' /></figure><p>For all its faults,<em> Superman Returns</em> is a film about hope. It’s hope that drives Superman to the remains of Krypton, hope that allows people to accept Superman’s return to Earth, and hope that helps Lois &#38; Superman rekindle their friendship in wake of the rift that grew between them.</p><p>In many ways,<em> Superman Returns</em> captures the hopeful aspect of the character infinitely more than <em>Man of Steel</em>’s curt discussion of the “S” on his chest. <em>Superman Returns</em>’ bright and upbeat portrayal features a Superman who inspires hope in the people of the Earth, whereas<em> Man of Steel</em>’s gritty and somber depiction inspires ambivalence or a modicum of distrust.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>MAN OF STEEL: FOUNDATIONS OF THE DCEU</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Man-of-Steel-1.jpg' /></figure><p>Ever since Marvel Studios weaved together its own interconnected universe of films, fans have been clambering for DC Comics to do the same. With eagle-eyed fans spotting a Wayne Enterprises logo on a satellite damaged in a Zod/Superman battle, fans knew it was only a matter of time before the first steps were taken for a DC extended universe, and<em> Man of Steel</em> was quickly established as that first step.

This isn't <em>Arrow</em> or <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> -- the characters in <em>Lucifer</em> may be celestial beings, but none of them are superheroes in any sense of the word. It's not a series filled with super-heroics and elaborate fight sequences. Still, <em>Lucifer</em> occasionally features a good brawl between its characters, whenever the situation calls for it.</p><p>The series' fight scenes are usually far and between, given that it spends more time focused on the mystery of whatever case Lucifer and Chloe and currently on. But in Season 5, the Netflix series finally delivers something it never has before: an extended, no holds barred brawl between no less than four cosmic-level beings that easily ranks as <em>Lucifer</em>'s best fight scene yet.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lucifer-why-the-show-goes-black-white-for-an-entire-episode/\">Lucifer: Why The Show Goes Black &#38; White For An Entire Episode</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Lucifer-Season-5-fight.jpg\"/></figure><p>In the Season 5 finale of <em>Lucifer</em>, \"Spoiler Alert,\" Lucifer rescues Chloe after she was kidnapped by Michael. Once they are safely back at the precinct, Amenadiel arrives to talk to Lucifer about Charlie, but Lucifer needs to talk to Chloe first. However, everything changes when time inexplicably stands still for everyone except Lucifer and Amenadiel.</p><p>Soon, Michael also arrives to keep toying with his two brothers, fueling more fear into Amenadiel by using his newborn son against him. Eventually, Amenadiel's anger gets the best of him, and he finally unleashes his angel might on his archangel brother.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lucifer-michael-disappointing-season-5-villain/\">Lucifer: Michael Is A Disappointing Season 5 Villain</a></span></p><p>At the same time, Maze also joins the party, revealing that she has joined Michael's side after he promised to get her a soul. What then follows is an extended fight sequence between two teams: Maze and Michael versus Lucifer and Amenadiel, in the middle of a police precinct that is frozen in time. The confrontation is easily the longest in the show's five-year run, and also its most hard-hitting.</p><p>Here, all four celestial beings don't hold back. Maze fights to kill, and it takes all of Lucifer's skills to keep the lethal demon at bay. But one can also notice that the devil is slightly holding back, given that he is fighting one of his oldest friends. However, even he has his limits and eventually, he makes sure she stays down.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/lucifer-season-5-reveals-why-devil-can-be-hurt/\">Lucifer Reveals Why the Devil Can Be Hurt</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Lucifer-S5E2-Michael-Wings.jpg\"/></figure><p>The battle between Michael and Amenadiel is also spectacular. These are two angels battling it out, and every single one of their hits makes the camera shake. It's a great way to show off the characters' raw power. On top of that, every character has his or her own fighting style, which also makes for a nice touch. The fight also features a cheer-worthy team-up between Luci and Amenadiel, showing the brothers standing by one another.</p><p>And if all that wasn't enough, things get even more biblical when all three angels whip their wings out, only to be interrupted by a bright light that precedes the arrival of their father, God himself.

This guild combines red and black mana in an insane, bloody circus of spectacles and horrors, fire and glee. Everyone fears the Rakdos guild, and its members will improvise a stunning performance anywhere they can find room. All of Ravnica is their stage.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rakdos-4.jpg\"/></figure><p>A number of Ravnica's other guilds have clear goals and methods. The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mtg-boros-legion-guild-explained/\">Boros Legion</a> is dedicated to maintaining law and order on the street at swordpoint, while the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/magic-the-gathering-selesnya-guild-explained/\">Selesnya Conclave</a> seeks to unite all people with the power of nature and the Worldsoul. The <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/magic-the-gathering-izzet-league-explained/\">Izzet League</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mtg-ravnica-simic-combine-guild-explained/\">Simic Combine</a> want to experiment endlessly with artifice and evolution, respectively. As for the Rakdos Cult, the ultimate plan is to have fun.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/magic-gathering-2021-release-schedule-set-titles/\">Wizards of the Coast Announces Magic: The Gathering Release Timeline Through 2021</a></span></p><p>This guild is not seeking to reshape Ravnica in its image or create a better future. Instead, the Cult of Rakdos is about the pleasure and carnage of the here and now. It's a deliberately short-sighted guild that acts first and thinks never. At first, this may seem like a fruitless endeavor, but Ravnica is a stifling and stressful place to be, and the people need an escape valve to let themselves run free and indulge their inner desires, even the darkest ones. The Cult of Rakdos is that escape valve, and it will accept anyone who shares its members' values. Sadism, hedonism, the love of spectacle and more are the cornerstones of this wild and brutal guild.</p><p>When times are tough and misery dominates the streets, even more people turn to the Rakdos guild so they can drown their woes in someone else's blood. Since killing fellow members is an option, the Rakdos guild has a high turnover rate. But the idea of letting go and going wild is so appealing to so many people that this guild can sustain its numbers through recruitment, making it a fluid and dynamic place to live. Perhaps a tightrope walker was juggling torches when he fell to his death on rusty spikes, so a new recruit can don his bloody outfit and resume the show right away. Or, if a devil cuts loose and massacres an entire audience, that's all right; there's a whole line of maniacs outside the door, waiting to replace them.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mtg-ravnica-golgari-swarm-guild-explained/\">Magic: The Gathering - Ravnica's Golgari Swarm Guild, Explained</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rakdos-3.jpg\"/></figure><p>Humans are a major race of the Cult of Rakdos, and they are joined by an array of devils and imps, mischief-loving creatures that are experts in inflicting pain, setting everything on fire and, above all, putting on a good show. This guild is also home to many of Ravnica's demons, great beings of black and red mana that act as heavy cavalry during battles with rival guilds. A demon is perfectly willing to slaughter any ally who gets in the way of its attacks, and when a battle with the Rakdos is over, it's likely that almost <em>everyone </em>is dead, save the demons and their favorite minions. Goblins, rats, elementals and shades help fill the ranks of this guild.</p><p>The leader is Rakdos, an ancient red-black demon who was alive even before the Guildpact was signed 10,000 years ago. He is large and overwhelmingly powerful, but due to his age, he has high and complex standards about what makes for a good show. Only rarely does he emerge from his inner chambers in Rix Maadi, the central guild building, and when he comes along, he demands a good show. Outstanding performances are applauded, while poor ones are punished with a massacre -- thus creating a new show to enjoy. Many Rakdos guild members make it their personal goal to plan and put on a performance that entices Rakdos to join the party himself.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">Related: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mtg-ugin-life-powers-revealed/\">Magic: The Gathering - The Life and Powers of Ugin, Revealed</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rakdos-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Rakdos decks are aggressive and dedicate few resources to defense. Instead, they want to pressure the opponent from the start, and this guild's mechanics and creature designs reward proactive and reckless play styles. This guild first appeared in the <em>Dissention </em>set with the mechanic Hellbent, which rewards the player for having no cards in hand. Hellbent creatures might get extra abilities, and Hellbent instants and sorceries become more potent.</p><p><em>Return to Ravnica </em>brought back the Rakdos, this time with the Unleash ability found only on creatures. Such a creature may enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter and become larger than normal for its mana cost at the expense of being unable to block if it has any +1/+1 counters on it. This is a truly do or die mechanic, and it appears on big and small creatures alike. Some of these Unleash creatures get extra abilities if they have +1/+1 counters on them, such as trample.</p><p><em>Ravnica Allegiance </em>gave the Rakdos Spectacle, meaning any card with that effect may be cast for a (typically cheaper) alternate cost if an opponent lost life this turn. This encourages aggressive plays that turn the entire game into a carnival. Many of these cards give the caster bonus effects if the Spectacle cost was paid, on top of paying less mana overall.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/mtg-sideboard-against-modern-burn-decks-guide/\">Magic: The Gathering - How to Sideboard Against Modern Burn Decks</a></span></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:15:37 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rakdos-2.jpg","linkMd5":"c29ca3797307b91ad3bc81cfab4a8686","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-30-827_74ec522f1f5f70d0.webp","destWidth":2400,"destHeight":1200,"sourceBytes":327912,"destBytes":327912,"author":"Louis Kemner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rakdos-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn96@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-30-827_74ec522f1f5f70d0.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rakdos-4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn62@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-34-034_2a8f2ff999aca37c.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rakdos-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn36@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-35-272_7bbd21bcad55fa7f.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rakdos-1.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989065},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"X-Men: 5 Reasons Cyclops Deserves The Hate (& 5 Why He Doesn't)","link":"https://www.cbr.com/cyclops-most-hated-x-men-marvel-scott-summers/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cyclops-featured-james-marsden.jpg\"/></figure><p>Scott Summers a.k.a. <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/cyclops/\">Cyclops</a> is one of the most polarizing members of the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/tag/x-men\">X-Men</a>, and this is nothing new.

He was spoiled, refused to listen to anyone else, and he thought he was the only one worth leading the team.

He was the one who wanted to follow all the orders and never wanted to break rank. However, he also looked down on other mutants, even if he never meant for it to appear that way. He was dismissive of those who were more freewheeling and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-vs-cyclops-rivalry-explained/\">always had a cruel thing to say about Wolverine</a>. He just acted like he was better than everyone else, and that is never a good look.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>DOESN'T - HE WAS A GREAT LEADER</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cyclops-Optic-Blast-feature.jpg' /></figure><p>While Cyclops was someone who seemed to consider himself better than everyone around him, there was a good reason for it. Professor Xavier put a lot of faith in Scott and put a lot of responsibility on his shoulders. He never buckled under pressure and was always one of the best leaders of the X-Men.</p><p>In later years, when Scott became more dangerous, he was still a great leader, making the hard decisions that others were unwilling to make, leading by example, and ensuring his team always had a chance to win.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>DOES - HE POUTED WHEN HE DIDN'T GET HIS WAY</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Jean-wolverine-cyclops-feautred.png' /></figure><p>If there is one thing that makes Cyclops one of the least liked members of the X-Men, it is his petulant attitude that leads him to pout when he doesn't get his way. He saw Wolverine as an alpha male and a threat and always treated him poorly as a result.</p><p>At one point, he was challenged for his leadership role by Storm, and they settled it by sparring in the Danger Room. Storm won, so Cyclops quit the X-Men, took his ball, and went home.

However, Scott had some problems at that time and was a little too overly possessive, pushing her away more than once.</p><p>When she died, he ended up marrying a new woman in Madelyne Pryor, and the two were expecting a child. When <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-reasons-jean-grey-cyclops-scott-summers-x-men-best-comics-couple-terrible-together/\">Jean Grey turned out to still be alive, Cyclops left</a> Madelyne and his child.

He knows what it is like to grow up with a society that hates him. Unlike most mutants, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-cyclops-optic-blast-punch-dimension/\">Cyclops has no control over his powers</a> and has to wear his visor to keep them in check. No matter what he has done to help society, they have always turned on him. He has watched young mutants die, and humans hate them no matter what they do. Scott has a right to be bitter.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>DOES - HE SENT CHILDREN IN AS MERCS</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cyclops-vs-Wolverine-from-Marvel-comics.jpg' /></figure><p>In <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/x-men-important-cyclops-stories/\"><em>X-Men: Schism</em></a>, the team splintered down the middle.

He will charge headstrong into battle. He will take on any enemy, no matter how big or how strong. He will make the tough decision, and while some might think he makes bad choices for his teammates, he is willing to follow them into the depths of hell to save mutant-kind. Cyclops is a fearless leader and doesn't deserve hatred.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>DOES - THE MUTANT MARTYR</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cyclops-Burns-Charles-Xavier-To-Death.jpg' /></figure><p>During the Avengers V.

Over the years as the rest of the heroes at DC and Marvel grew darker, edgier, and more violent it was Superman who stood out as a slice of good old-fashioned American pie. But there are some lines he doesn't think twice about crossing are a major moral dilemma for some of his colleagues.</p><p>And in <em>Action Comics </em>#1024, Superman and his family spies on the entirety of Metropolis without a second thought.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Death Metal: A Twisted Batman Devises the Ultimate Way to Break Superman\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/death-metal-batman-breaks-superman/\">Death Metal: A Twisted Batman Devises The Ultimate Way To Break Superman</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Superman-Superboy-X-Ray-Vision-2.png\"/></figure><p>The breach of privacy comes on the heels of a death that rocked Superman to his core. The Deputy Chief of the Fire Department, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-melody-moore-red-mist-murder/\">Melody Moore, </a>recently made friends with Superman as the two saw hope for Metropolis amidst the corruption of the city that seemed to be everywhere. Superman helped Melody put out a few fires, as it were, and evidently that made her a target for the Invisible Mafia.</p><p>Adapting to new levels of discretion, organized crime in Metropolis developed into the Invisible Mafia as a response to Superman's absurd levels of surveillance. They form a comprehensive list of words they ban from their speech so that his super hearing will not detect him and only operate in facilities hidden from his prying x-ray vision. It turns out that they're just not discreet enough however, as killing Superman's pal Melody only spurs the superhero to sic his entire family on them.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"Superman Is Setting Up DC's Mystical CRISIS\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/superman-setting-up-dc-mystical-crisis/\">Superman Is Setting Up DC's Mystical CRISIS</a></span></p><p>Distraught for a moment by Melody's death, Superman immediately resorts to scanning the entirety of Metropolis with his super senses. He says that he is looking for blind spots or lead lining, trying to root out the Invisible Mafia wherever they are. Rather than admonish Superman for his breach in privacy, his whole family joins in. Both Superboys, Supergirl and even Brainiac 5 use their vast array of senses to comb across every detail of the city.</p><p>And the moral question doesn't even come up. In <em>The Dark Knight</em> the very question Superman ignores proved to be a major moral dilemma for the caped hero's counterpart. In that film, Batman used a type of sonar technology to turn every phone in Gotham into a spy network that allowed him to track down the Joker. Lucius Fox was so disgusted by the act he could not condone it and the technology was disposed of for being too much power for any one person to wield.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dark-Knight-Lucius-Fox.jpg\"/></figure><p>But such a question does not even come up for Superman. Instead, all five superheroes begin pouring over every inch of the city (and quite possibly the planet) while even explicitly mentioning how the can see private citizens using the bathroom. It's reduced to something of a joke about how \"gross\" people are, but at the bottom, it's actually a pretty severe violation of civil liberties.</p><p>The comic does not seem interested in grappling with such a problem materially, and that only raises further questions about how often and casually Superman does this. Does he only resort to spying on the whole city when a close friend dies, or does he do it all the time? Considering how many other heroes are all too eager to help him, this moment is packed with disturbing implications, and this might be a perfect example where truth, justice and the American way don't all fit together as neatly as Superman so often would like.</p><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a class=\"bc-title-link\" title=\"The Most Powerful Superman Is a DBZ-Like, Meta-Narrative Fusion Created by Dr. Manhattan\" href=\"https://www.cbr.com/most-powerful-superman-dbz-like-fusion-created-by-dr-manhattan/\">The Most Powerful Superman Is A DBZ-Like, Meta-Narrative Fusion Created By Dr. Manhattan</a></span></p><p><!-- Used for easily cloning the properly namespaced rect --></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 21:20:09 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/superman-action-comics.jpg","linkMd5":"7b78ed0f1b19c271de5fe45d89d002b2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-269_a26b21ee0b33a422.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":176662,"destBytes":176662,"author":"Brenton Stewart","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/superman-action-comics.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn25@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-269_a26b21ee0b33a422.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Superman-Superboy-X-Ray-Vision-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn87@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-36-984_a4380ad5a41c6b91.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dark-Knight-Lucius-Fox.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn46@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-36-689_40e2150f8d2ed014.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989069},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"10 Weird Facts About Supergirl | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/dc-supergirl-weird-facts/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/supergirl-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>Supergirl is one of the most iconic characters in the DC Universe.

Still, the fact Eagle doesn't seem rich means he's a little bit closer to Hawkeye than he is Green Arrow.</p><p>The Deep meets Eagle after being arrested, with the latter bailing the former out. While the Deep doesn't recognize his savior, Eagle notes that they have, in fact, met several times in the past. Not being remembered upsets Eagle a bit, but he moves past those feelings quickly. Eagle then lets the Deep crash at his apartment. However, this is part of an attempt to bring him to the Church of the Collective.</p><p>Drawing comparison between himself and his new friend, Eagle reveals that he ran out of arrows during a hostage situation, which resulted in people dying. This caused him to hit rock bottom. Following that incident, Eagle joined the Church of the Collective. He introduces the Deep to Carol, his teacher, and over the course of the next two episodes the former member of the Seven goes on a psychological (as well as psychotropic) journey in hopes of redeeming himself.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-boys-why-homelander-threatened-stormfront/\">The Boys: The Reason Why Homelander Is Threatened by Stormfront's Arrival</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/the-boys-key-art-1.jpg\"/></figure><p>As for the second hero, his name is Blindspot, and he appears when Ashley Barrett -- who has taken over for the deceased Madelyn Stillwell -- introduces him as a potential replacement for Translucent. Blindspot showcases his incredible acrobatic skills, and reveals that he's blind. The character is definitely meant to parallel Daredevil, who is essentially a blind ninja with incredible acrobatic skills. Blindspot even remarks that he's able to identify Homelander thanks to his \"super ears.\"</p><p>However, Homelander does not want someone with a disability on the Seven, and he resents that <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-boys-vought-propaganda-ad-season-2/\">Vought International</a> is trying to control his team. As a result of those feelings, Homelander smashes Blindspot's ears, rendering him deaf. While Blindspot seems unlikely to reappear in the foreseeable future, Homelander's choice to reject him directly leads to Stormfront being added to the Seven.</p><p>There is something of a double reference here in the name Blindspot, whether purposeful or not. Although there are a few different characters with the name in Marvel's and DC's comics, the most important version of Blindspot to know in this case is Sam Chung, who was created by Charles Soule and Ron Garney in 2015's <em>All-New, All-Different Marvel Point One</em> #1. A trained gymnast, Chung created an invisibility suit for himself and eventually teamed up with Daredevil. However, during a confrontation with the villain Muse, Chung was blinded, which set off a deadly chain of events involving The Hand, a group of villainous ninja.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-boys-honest-trailer-shades-disney-amazon/\">The Boys Honest Trailer Takes a Shot at Zack Snyder, Disney and Amazon</a></span></p><p>Overall, Eagle is much more likely to be important to <em>The Boys </em>Season 2 than Blindspot, seeing as the latter hero was pretty much immediately taken down by Homelander. For his part, Eagle's role in the Deep's recovery and what happens with the disgraced member of the Seven going forward isn't totally clear at this time. Still, the Church of the Collective very much looks like it could play a major role in <em>The Boys </em>Season 2.</p><p><em>Amazon Studios' <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/the-boys-season-2-3-comic-stories/amp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Boys</a> stars Karl Urban as <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-boys-season-1-billy-butcher-recap/\">Billy Butcher</a>, Jack Quaid as Hughie, Laz Alonso as Mother's Milk, Tomer Kapon as Frenchie, Karen Fukuhara as the Female, Erin Moriarty as Annie January, Chace Crawford as the Deep, Antony Starr as Homelander, Aya Cash as Stormfront and Simon Pegg as Hughie's dad.

He made it believable that he was a genius but he also nailed the awkward yet charming side of Banner to make one feel for his plight.</p><p>The same can be said for the likes of Liv Tyler as <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-hulk-betty-ross-best-moments-ranked/\">Betty Ross</a>, William Hurt as General Ross, and the villain who steals the show in every scene that he's in. All put their own unique takes on these iconic characters while remaining loyal to the comics that spawned them.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">9 </span>Unfortunate: A Little Too Short</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/edward-norton-hulk.jpg' /></figure><p>Understandably, the movie wanted to be more action-packed to avoid the mistakes of the Ang Lee movie which many fans felt was too long and padded out thus making it a boring film. With<em> The Incredible Hulk</em>, it's essentially one long chase between Bruce Banner and General Ross's forces.</p><p>This chase works but it comes at a cost of a lot of the story beats and character-driven moments feeling rushed with little time to simmer for the audience before Banner has to get on the run again or Hulk has to smash something. The movie could have benefited from an extra ten to twenty minutes of runtime.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">8 </span>Incredible: The Duality Of Banner/Hulk</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Edward-Norton-the-Hulk.jpeg' /></figure><p>One of Stan Lee's biggest inspirations for the Hulk's creation was <em>Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde</em> and it shows with Banner and Hulk being completely different beings who happen to share a body. This aspect was brought to the big screen rather well with Hulk's interactions with Betty and Banner's flashes of Hulk's memories.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/things-worldbreaker-hulk-can-do/\">Worldbreaker Hulk: 15 Things He Can Do That Regular Hulk Can't</a></span></p><p>Much like in this comics, it makes the viewer feel sympathy for both sides because one is a man who just wants to return to his normal life while the other is like a superpowered child experiencing everything for the first time. It's tragic and intriguing which is why Hulk is one of the most interesting Marvel characters.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">7 </span>Unfortunate: Forgettable Score</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Liv-Tyler-as-Betty-Ross-from-The-Incredible-Hulk.jpg' /></figure><p>One common complaint fans have had throughout the many years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is that other than <em>The Avengers</em> theme, <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-best-villains-never-been-movie-ranked-spider-slayer-puma-chameleon/\">Spider-Man</a></em> theme, and a few select others, the orchestral score for the movies rarely have any memorable tracks and <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> is no different.</p><p>However, it does feature a well-done tribute to<em> The Incredible Hulk</em> TV series starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno and an okay overture, it's not a terrible score by any means. The composition is nice but there's no track that one will consider to be an iconic theme for the character.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">6 </span>Incredible: The Hulk Is, Indeed, Incredible</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Incredible-Hulk.jpg' /></figure><p>The struggle of Bruce Banner, the chase sequences, the villain? All great things to enjoy but audiences come to a Hulk movie to see the Hulk destroy vehicles and look scary while doing so. Fans were not disappointed because every single time the Hulk appears on-screen, it is pure carnage candy with plenty of explosions, environmental weaponry, and a villain fight that wins the movie.</p><p>The Hulk's design is great as well, making him a much darker shade of green that, somehow, pops really well in all the very vibrantly lit scenes.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>Unfortunate: Hulk Looks Nothing Like Banner</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Incredible-Hulk.jpg' /></figure><p>This is an aspect that would be remedied with Mark Ruffalo's incarnation of the character in the first <em>Avengers</em> movie. In most cases, the Hulk is supposed to look like if Bruce Banner took too many steroids and jumped into a pool of green dye thus resulting in a caveman version of himself.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/every-incarnation-of-the-hulk-ranked/\">Every Incarnation Of The Hulk, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Well, in <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>, while his design overall is nice, the only issue fans have had with it is that the Hulk's face shares little to no similarities to Edward Norton. Even the hair magically changes lengths and facial hair vanishes when he's the Hulk for whatever reason.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>Incredible: The Look And Tone Of The Movie Was Perfect</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Edward-Norton-The-Incredible-Hulk-Featured.jpg' /></figure><p>As mentioned previously, this movie has a very vibrant look to it: the scenery and characters are all filmed with heavy contrast and brightness that's offset by the characters who all wear mostly dark clothes or, in the case of the monsters, have darker shades of skin compared to their comic book counterparts.</p><p>The movie's tone was also a healthy balance: when it needed to be dark and focus on the tragedy of the hero, it was. When it needed to be intense for action sequences, it was. It also added a healthy about of humor in there without going overboard.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Unfortunate: The Deleted Better Opening To The Movie</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Incredible-Hulk-suicide-scene.jpg' /></figure><p>The opening credit sequence of the movie is completely lackluster: it's essentially a laughably shortened and silent version of the origin story that looks cheap and feels tacked on at the last second which would not be surprising since there was going to be a much better opening scene.</p><p>Originally it was going to open up with a dark and literally cold scene where Bruce attempts to commit suicide but it just results in a transformation into the other guy. This scene was mentioned in the first <em>Avengers</em> movie by <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-mcu-incredible-hulk-accurate-depiction/\">Mark Ruffalo's Banner.</a></p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Incredible: Abomination Was The MCU's First Great Villain</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6401997-incredible-hulk-abomination-tim-roth-marvel-studios-1009669-1280x0.jpg' /></figure><p>Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane in <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/iron-man-armors-mcu/\">Iron Man</a></em> was considered a decent villain but nothing special whereas even before getting transformed into a nasty monster, Tim Roth was an intimidating villain as Emil Blonsky. He was a spec-ops soldier who got hopped up on super-soldier serum and was determined to get back at the Hulk which is intriguing.</p><p>However, once he gets his taste for powers, his descent into madness throughout the movie is one of the more fascinating aspects of the movie and when he finally gets Banner's blood and becomes <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/abomination-the-10-weirdest-facts-about-the-hulks-strongest-villain/\">Abomination</a>, he's instantly one of the best things of the movie.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Unfortunate: Setup For More That Went Nowhere</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Leader-1.jpg' /></figure><p>This movie acted as a great seed that should have bloomed into an entire franchise of movies about the Hulk but unfortunately, most of what they set up in this movie has yet to return in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Abomination was still alive which meant that he could have been a perfect recurring threat for even the Avengers but not even a cameo in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>.</p><p>Tim Blake Nelson's Samuel Sterns AKA The Leader has yet to even be mentioned again after his little tease for his transformation. Even Tony Stark's cameo at the end ended up being useless in the end since it's neither General Ross nor Stark that recruits Banner into the Avengers.

He's battled the likes of the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/avengers-marvel-empyre-heroes-back/\">Avengers</a> and the X-Men to a standstill and has forced Doctor Strange to act out of desperation to keep him at bay. Since gaining control of Chernobyl by faking a vampiric civil war and rallying the world's strongest vampires to him, Dracula has successfully begun a new Vampire Nation - and has even gained the ability to move through sunlight. This is thanks to a certain amount of Wolverine's blood, procured when Logan was lured into one Dracula's hidden bases in Paris.</p><p>Dracula has been lying in wait ever since, but he and his forces took the opportunity of Wolverine being frozen to gain more access to his blood. Draining the frozen Logan of more of his blood, <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-and-amazing-friends-fought-dracula/\">Dracula</a> is able to give it to two of his followers, allowing them to power \"Bloodclocks\" for themselves.

Loading the infected into a shipping truck, the vampires then casually drive the truck into Minneapolis -- and open the doors wide. This allows a whole slew of infected humans to quickly spread through the city and presumably cause terror and create more vampires. On top of increasing the number of vampires present in the world, this also sets up a potential American stronghold for the Vampire Nation. It's a very straight-forward and simple plan, with seemingly no other intent than to sew chaos and create more vampires for the heroes to deal with.  The vampires are even quick to admit to Wolverine when he catches them that they had no intention of keeping Wolverine permanently, as doing so would draw the attention of every vampire.</p><p>Instead, they just wanted the time to sew chaos and the advantage of longer hours afforded by the Bloodclocks. Even though the vampires are killed in action, they were still able to see free a veritable horde of new vampires to roam through the city streets and cause more death and destruction. It's a brutally efficient plan from <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/dracula-tomb-resurrection-quick-magazine/\">Dracula</a> and his followers to cause chaos and add to their ranks - and a surprisingly effective one by all appearances. They've already infected a number of people by the time Wolverine is able to escape his icy prison. It forces Wolverine's hand and releases more and more vampires into the world. The only downside is that Wolverine is now on the hunt for the vampiric nation -- and is intended to start his search by finding the treacherous Omega Red.</p><p>KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/wolverine-new-respect-marvel-franklin-richards/\">Wolverine Finds New Respect For Marvel's Most Powerful Mutant</a></p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 04:20:22 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wolverine.jpg","linkMd5":"a52a30e79b67fe497d6df71be3a2eed3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn88@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-30-792_65bb7dc5f82c7347.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":167316,"destBytes":167316,"author":"Brandon Zachary","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wolverine.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn88@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-30-792_65bb7dc5f82c7347.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Wolverine-Vampires-2.jpg":null,"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Wolverine-Vampires-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn92@2020_2/2020/09/05/06-56-39-394_ecfc561a64f562c6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989060},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"John Ridley Explains Why The Other History of the DC Universe Begins With Black Lightning","link":"https://www.cbr.com/john-ridley-why-other-history-dc-universe-begins-black-lightning/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/other-history-dc-universe-header.jpg\"/></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-other-history-of-the-dc-universe/\">The Other History of the DC Universe</a> promises to shed light on untold moments featuring DC's heroes of color.

Growing up in the far future as an obsessive fan of the Flash, Thawne's mind snapped when he learned that he was destined to become his greatest nemesis. This culminated in the evil speedster traveling back in time to Barry's childhood, murdering his mother Nora Allen and framing his father Henry for the crime.

As Max Mercury helps Barry acclimate to the pocket dimension and navigate his way out to regain control of the body, Thawne realizes his grip on his new form is slipping. Assembling the <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/reverse-flash-legion-of-zoom-roster/\">Legion of Zoom</a> in Central City's cemetery, the Reverse Flash issues a particular macabre order to the villainous ensemble: Unearth the corpse of Nora Allen from her grave.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-johnny-quick-status/\">The Flash Confirms the Status of a Classic DC Speedster</a></span></p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Reverse-Flash-Nora-Allen-Grave.jpg\"/></figure><p>Thawne reveals that when he traveled back in time to change history by murdering Nora, he had inadvertently left temporal residue on her body as he killed her. While Thawne's grasp on the relative present of the DC Universe, much less his control of Barry's body, already tenuous because of his multiple deaths causing temporal paradoxes, the residue remaining on Nora's corpse would help ground Thawne to this time period and Barry's body, effectively untethering Barry's consciousness and leaving him trapped in the Speed Force for good, with Thawne's possession of his greatest foe's body complete.</p><p>The one thing that the Reverse Flash didn't count on was that the Rogues have their own strict moral code, underscoring the old axiom that there is honor among thieves. While the villains were all too eager to follow through on their longstanding grudge against the Flash, the desecration of an apparent random woman's grave is a step too far for the group; Thawne had purposefully neglected to tell his associates the Flash's true identity and his connection to the grave they were tasked with digging up. Trickster was particularly affected by the morbid assignment, tipping off the rest of the Flash Family on the Reverse Flash's scheme, with Impulse and <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-jay-garrick-return-reverse-flash/\">Jay Garrick leading the charge</a> to stop Thawne's plot from coming to fruition giving Barry the time he needed to regain control of his body.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/flash-impulse-greatest-failure/\">The Flash Twists the Knife in Impulse's Greatest Failure</a></span></p><p>The opening salvo of the Reverse Flash's plan had gone off without a hitch, with the Legion of Zoom systematically <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-legion-zoom-first-attack/\">dismantling every aspect of Barry Allen's life</a> before ambushing him and aiding Eobard Thawne in seizing control of his body. However, in a twisted move harkening back to Thawne's most heinous crime of murdering Barry's mother, the Reverse Flash's plan quickly began to unravel as his associates became leery at the twisted lengths the villainous speedster would go to complete his revenge.

Around that same time, I would attend conventions to be around dorks of similar interests, but to my surprise, there were tons of other people there in costume too! It wasn't until a couple cons later that I decided to try to cosplay too. Out of some miracle, my first time cosplaying, I also won the judges favorite award in their cosplay competition! I've been hooked ever since. My most favorite part is the creative process of designing and putting together the costumes. I even went to college to learn design and drafting to help with my cosplay career. You could say I majored in cosplay.</p><figure><img src=\"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EnjiNight.jpg\"/></figure><p><strong>For you, what was your entry point into gaming? What made you fall in love with it?</strong></p><p><strong>Night:</strong> I got into gaming a bit later in my days because my family didn't believe in technology growing up. I was forced to go into the woods and play with the plants and wild animals. So going from innocently playing with the wildlife in the woods to shooting the wildlife in video games from the comfort of my cozy room was such an immediate \"fall in love\" moment. [...] My first game was actually <em>Ragnarok Online</em>! It basically stole my life and became my addiction. So long social life, amiright boys? After that I moved onto the next life-stealer, which was <em>wow</em>, and have been pinging from game to game like a true addict.</p><p>RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/batman-canceled-game-concept-art/\">Unreleased Batman Game Designs Introduce a Red-Eyed Dark Knight and a Killer King Shark</a></p><figure><img src=\"https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Android18.jpg\"/></figure><p><strong>How did the opportunity to work on Slide Stars come about?</strong></p><p><strong>Night:</strong> They \"SLID\" into my DMs. ;) ;) ;)</p><p><strong>When you've spent so much of your time dressing up as characters, how does it feel to actually be in a video game as a character?</strong></p><p><strong>Night:</strong> First it was shocking, then it was unreal.

The two had previously spoken when Mr. Hamada asked him to reprise his role as Cyborg in Warner Bros.' upcoming Flash movie, together with other members of the Justice League.</p><p>\"In their July conversation, Mr. Fisher recounted disagreements he’d had with the film’s creative team regarding his portrayal of Cyborg, and complained that his suggested script revisions were not adopted. Mr. Hamada explained that creative differences are a normal part of the production process, and that a film’s writer/director ultimately has to be in charge of these matters.</p><p>\"Notably, Mr. Hamada also told Mr. Fisher that he would elevate his concerns to WarnerMedia so they could conduct an investigation. At no time did Mr. Hamada ever 'throw anyone under the bus,' as Mr. Fisher has falsely claimed, or render any judgments about the Justice League production, in which Mr. Hamada had no involvement, since filming occurred before Mr. Hamada was elevated to his current position.</p><p>\"While Mr. Fisher never alleged any actionable misconduct against him, WarnerMedia nonetheless initiated an investigation into the concerns he’d raised about his character’s portrayal. Still not satisfied, Mr. Fisher insisted that WarnerMedia hire an independent third party investigator.</p><p>\"This investigator has attempted multiple times to meet with Mr. Fisher to discuss his concerns but, to date, Mr. Fisher has declined to speak to the investigator. Warner Bros. remains committed to accountability and to the well-being of every cast and crew member on each of its productions. It also remains committed to investigating any specific and credible allegation of misconduct, which thus far Mr. Fisher has failed to provide.\"</p></blockquote><p><span class=\"next-single\">KEEP READING: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/justice-league-hbo-max-debunks-september-2021-release-date/\">Justice League: HBO Max Debunks Rumored September 2021 Release Date</a></span></p><p>(via <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/09/justice-league-ray-fisher-joss-whedon-abuse-allegations-warner-bros-investigation-1234571413/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deadline</a>)</p>\n                        \n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 04:08:02 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ray-fisher-justice-league2.jpg","linkMd5":"0147ffcd4f95d0bde6da2086cc9d4c8a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-666_2abb151a80480578.webp","destWidth":1400,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":88608,"destBytes":88608,"author":"Mira Jacobs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ray-fisher-justice-league2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn97@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-666_2abb151a80480578.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989060},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","title":"The Wolverine Is Now Available on Disney+ | CBR","link":"https://www.cbr.com/the-wolverine-available-disney-plus/","description":"\n                        \n                        <figure><img src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/the-wolverine-header.jpg\"/></figure><p>One of 20th Century Fox's <em>X-Men</em> films has officially made its debut on <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/tag/disney-plus\">Disney+</a>.

The answer is - yes.</p><p>Thor did join the Avengers, albeit he did so in a different way in the comics and in the movies. In the MCU, Thor joins forces with the Avengers after he realizes they're both on the same side and want to stop <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/loki-vs-thor-villains-win-lose-marvel/\">Loki</a>. In the original comics, Thor is one of the founding members of the superhero team alongside Iron Man, Hulk, Ant-Man (Hank Pym), and the Wasp. And who did they fight? Loki, once again.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">5 </span>How Old Is Thor?</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Thor.jpg' /></figure><p>As it was already established, Thor is a God of Thunder which means he stands above mortal people. He's also one of the oldest Marvel superheroes.</p><p>The answer differs based on the source material. Thor himself provides a clear answer in <em>Avengers: Infinity War </em>when he states that he's 1500 years old. In the comics, he could very well be even a few centuries older, since the first reported sign of Thor in the mythology comes from the Roman Empire.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>How Tall Is Thor?</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Thor-1-1.jpg' /></figure><p>Thor is a physically imposing man whose mere presence can bring fear to the hearts of his enemies. It doesn't hurt that besides his considerable <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-favorite-heroes-confusing-powers/\">powers</a>, he's tall as well. But how tall is Thor?</p><p><p class=\"article-title\"><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-thor-best-worst-versions/\">Thor: 5 Best Versions Of The God Of Thunder (&#38; The 5 Worst)</a></span></p></p><p>The Marvel Encyclopedia states that Thor's official height is 6ft 6inch or 198 cm which makes him taller than most humans. He's supposed to weigh 640 pounds. On the other hand, Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor in the MCU, is 'only' 6ft 3inch tall.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Who Are Thor's Siblings?</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/thor-mjolnir-loki-captain-america.jpg' /></figure><p>Thor's complicated relationships with his siblings are a well-known fact. His brother Loki has spent a lot of time causing trouble for Thor. And there's also his powerful sister <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/thor-cate-blanchett-hela-comparison-comics/\">Hela</a> who appeared in <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>.</p><p>However, Thor has a different set of siblings in mythology. For example, one of his brothers is Balder, who's a half-brother of Thor. Balder is then the god of light, joy, sun, and purity.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>Who Else Can Lift Thor's Hammer?</h2><figure><img src='https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/captain-america-mjolnir-avengers-endgame.jpg' /></figure><p>Whoever is worthy, shall wield the power of Mjolnir. Or something along these lines, anyway. This means that Thor isn't the only one who can lift Mjolnir. The fans collectively cheered when Captain America was able to lift Thor's hammer in <em><a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/how-did-tony-stark-get-stones-questions-about-avengers-endgame-explained/\">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>. But he's not the only superhero who has ever achieved this, not by a long shot. In the comics, other people have lifted Thor's hammer.</p><p>The list includes Beta Ray Bill, Hulk, Magneto, and Loki. Even some DC superheroes got their chance to lift Mjolnir and prove their worth this way, most notably Superman and Wonder Woman.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">1 </span>Can Thor Fly Without Mjolnir?</h2><figure><img src='https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/thor-flying-display-1.jpg' /></figure><p>Finally, it's time to address the elephant in the room - or the Norse god in the air? The answer can be found in the comics, but once again, it's a bit more complicated. Thor has been shown flying without <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-thor-mjolnir-creative-uses/\">Mjolnir</a> in the comics but the creators aren't very consistent when it comes to his powers.</p><p>What's clear, on the other hand, is that Thor can jump and leap very well which can make him look like he's flying. Considering the inconsistencies, the most likely answer is - no, Thor shouldn't be able to fly without Mjolnir. That he does it sometimes anyway - well, that's a whole different story.</p><p><p class=\"article-title\"><span class=\"next-single\">NEXT: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-thor-best-romantic-partners/\">Every Love Interest Of Thor, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p></p>\n                        \n                    ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 03:00:15 +0000","feedId":3746,"bgimg":"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rsz-thor-flyingv1.jpg","linkMd5":"aa266183b2bfd66330f9f51584031c2c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn56@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-428_ac1144fcc05d6e1d.webp","destWidth":1710,"destHeight":900,"sourceBytes":234822,"destBytes":234822,"author":"Kath Leroy","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/rsz-thor-flyingv1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn56@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-31-428_ac1144fcc05d6e1d.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/thor-bifrost-asgard.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn78@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-37-642_a1f9051b10f335b8.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/thor-the-god-of-thunder.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn54@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-42-069_b93d40ab1574706a.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DISPLATE-Hulk-and-Thor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn100@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-37-166_39ed09adbd7ba964.webp","https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/06.-TEAM-Thor-Superman-vs-Thor-JLA-Avengers.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn28@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-39-912_1ded9efd3644f8f5.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Avengers-1-cover-Cropped.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn59@2020_4/2020/09/05/06-56-35-283_3729385789ff9600.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Thor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn55@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-36-826_0b5d8b7ef5840098.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Thor-1-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_1/2020/09/05/06-56-35-105_93a65d3a1d728518.webp","https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/thor-mjolnir-loki-captain-america.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn52@2020_5/2020/09/05/06-56-43-726_0fb4721b79792458.webp","https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/captain-america-mjolnir-avengers-endgame.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn96@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-35-089_03e91b7b6cd6c21b.webp","https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/thor-flying-display-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn88@2020_3/2020/09/05/06-56-44-029_06c56286b228321c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599288989061}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 14:56:29","feedId":3746,"fetchDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 06:56:29 +0000","fetchMs":405,"handleMs":98,"totalMs":28211,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":100,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"bb68ba08b547c3cddc415a3fc1d525f9","hostName":"us-007*","requestId":"77fa8173832c4fe1a255c5dd0ceb831d_3746","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":73350226,"bgimgsTotal":100,"bgimgsGithubTotal":93,"articlesImgsTotal":444,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":412,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":16,"myreaderx15":15,"myreaderx7":14,"myreaderx6":15,"myreaderx16":15,"myreaderx4":16,"myreaderx32":15,"myreaderx10":14,"myreaderx3":16,"myreaderx11":16,"myreaderx33":16,"myreaderx12":16,"myreaderx2":15,"myreaderx13":15,"myreaderx1":16,"myreaderx30":15,"myreaderx31":15,"myreaderx18":16,"myreaderx19":15,"myreaderx":15,"myreaderx25":16,"myreaderx27":15,"myreaderx21":16,"myreaderx22":15,"myreaderx24":15,"myreaderx5oss":15,"myreaderx29":14},"failGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":16,"myreaderx23":16}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:29:30","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:36:34","id":3746,"name":" CBR - Feed ","url":"http://www.comicbookresources.com/feed.php?feed=all","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/apple-icon-57x57.fcc95351.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn46@2020_4/2020/09/01/02-34-59-416_8ce38f8de2c4dd42.png","description":"Covering comics, movies, tv like no other in the world.
