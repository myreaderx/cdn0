It was a decade old so it wasn’t too surprising. The question, then, was whether to buy another professional camera or just upgrade to an iPhone Pro. After plenty of research, I came to the conclusion that the difference in quality and functionality for the layman photographer (which includes me; I take photos for work, but taking photos isn’t my job) between a pro camera and a smartphone camera just isn’t great enough to justify having two separate pieces of tech. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The smartphone cameras of 2020 are true wonders of technology. Not only is the photo quality exceptional, but the free editing functions are akin to software that used to cost hundreds of dollars. Unless you’re a professional photographer (or a very serious amateur), there just isn’t much need to venture beyond the device in your pocket. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet even with its suite of built-in features, taking great pictures with your phone isn’t necessarily easy or intuitive. After I got an iPhone Pro, I took a couple classes to get the hang of the phone as well as learn some basic photography skills and I’ve been thrilled with the results. Below are what I consider the simplest and most effective tips to upgrade the photos you’re taking with your smartphone. </span></p>\n<h3>1. Use Grid Lines (At First) </h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-119399 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/graham-grids.jpg\" alt=\"young boy on a trail with photo grid lines overlaid. \" width=\"445\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/graham-grids.jpg 445w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/graham-grids-320x431.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the classic tenets of photography (and most visual art mediums) is the “rule of thirds.” An image should be broken into thirds, both horizontally and vertically. As a grid, this makes for nine squares. Your instinct is probably to put the main subject of your photo right in the center. Don’t do that. Instead, place the subject — whatever you’re trying to take a picture of and draw people’s eyes to — near one of the four intersecting points. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get acquainted with using the rule of thirds, you can easily make those grid lines show up right on your camera screen: </span></p>\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iPhone: “Settings” —&#62; “Camera” —&#62; toggle “Grid” on </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Android: from Camera app, go to “Settings” —&#62; scroll down to “Grid Lines” and toggle on </span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you get used to the grid, you’ll naturally get better at composing your photos, and you can turn the grid lines off. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to helping you follow the rule of thirds, using grid lines also helps accomplish another key tenet of good photography (and design in general): embracing negative/white space. Rather than filling up the entire photo with your main subject, you want to leave white space around it, which actually better draws the eye towards your focal point. Whether you’re taking a picture of a person, a mountain, or a plate of food, the primary focus of the photo, in most cases, shouldn’t compose more than ⅓ to ½ of the total area in your frame. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at the photo above. By using the rule of thirds and placing the primary focus — my son’s beaming face — at one of the grid intersections, I’ve given nearly ⅔ of the photo to “negative” space. </span></p>\n<h3>2. Don’t Zoom In</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever you do, don’t use the pinch-to-zoom function on your phone’s camera. Without getting into the tech, the vast majority of phones use a digital zoom, which pixelates and blurs your photo. Professional photographers use different lenses and simple physical proximity (they get closer to the subject when they want to “zoom” in). You have two options better than pinching to zoom: </span></p>\n<ol><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a photo without zooming. You’ll probably better accomplish the rule of thirds and using white space, anyway. That said, if you still feel the need to zoom, edit the photo afterwards. The quality of smartphone photos is good enough that you can often zoom in and crop things just how you want after the fact without losing much in the way of quality. Much better to zoom in on a photo already taken than while taking the photo. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use the photographer’s trick and simply get physically closer to your subject. </span></li>\n</ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some models, like my iPhone 11 Pro, have what’s called optical zoom, which is functionally like a photographer switching out lenses. This feature works great, if you have it. Google your phone to see if it has optical zoom; unless you have the newest high-end model, it probably doesn’t.</span></p>\n<h3>3. Focus Appropriately</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_118324\" style=\"width: 852px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-118324\" class=\"wp-image-118324 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/bug-feat.png\" alt=\"man holding and shooting liquid from spray bottle. \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/bug-feat.png 842w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/bug-feat-768x570.png 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/bug-feat-320x238.png 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/bug-feat-640x475.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-118324\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">If the trees in the background were as much in focus as the spray bottle, this picture I took for <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-your-own-natural-bug-spray/\">my article on DIY bug spray</a> wouldn’t be nearly as good.</p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smartphone cameras are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">very</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> smart nowadays. Using portrait/live focus mode, available on most new-ish models for both iPhones and Samsung devices, you can easily simulate what a professional photographer expertly does with what’s called depth of field — a clearly focused subject with a blurred background. It’s a stunning effect which clearly separates foreground from background and instantly gives a professional look to your smartphone photos. Don’t neglect portrait/live focus mode. </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_119400\" style=\"width: 460px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-119400\" class=\"wp-image-119400 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/graham.jpg\" alt=\"smiling 5-year-old boy. \" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/graham.jpg 450w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/graham-320x427.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></img><p style=\" padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;\" id=\"caption-attachment-119400\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Portrait mode can make an everyday photo look professional. And sometimes, the subject is cute enough to ignore the rule of thirds. </p></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While portrait mode often only works with human faces (except for the latest iPhone and Galaxy devices, which can create the effect with non-human subjects), there are apps you can use to edit your photos afterwards. Before getting an iPhone Pro, I used Focos and found it to work great. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if not using that mode, it’s best to “manually” focus on what you want the subject of the photo to be. If you’re taking a picture of your dog, tap the dog on the screen so that the camera focuses there instead of on the park in the background. It can make a big difference. </span></p>\n<h3>4. Spend Time Getting to Know Your Smartphone Camera</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-119432\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/landscape2.jpg\" alt=\"A lake with mountains and blue sky.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/landscape2.jpg 1024w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/landscape2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/landscape2-320x240.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/landscape2-640x480.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></img></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If, like me, you’ve been part of the smartphone landscape since its inception, you probably just open your camera app, point it appropriately, and hit the button. That’s indeed the apex of what the tech was initially capable of — the intention was never to replace “real” cameras. Fast forward to today: your smartphone camera is way more powerful than those real cameras you were buying a decade ago. I recently happened upon an old camera from college that featured 4 megapixels, whereas my iPhone Pro sports 12 megapixels. It’s an insane leap in technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your phone’s camera features an array of settings, capabilities, and editing functions that I can almost guarantee you aren’t aware of. Beyond taking a photography class that was focused on composing good photos, I spent some time with a couple iPhone guides that were dedicated to understanding the technology and the various built-in functions of my particular smartphone. No matter your phone, there are numerous guides (both free and paid) available online that you can use to familiarize yourself with it and start taking even better pics. </span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/take-better-pics-with-smartphone/\">4 Tips for Taking Better Photos With Your Smartphone</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/-K6L3zECeRU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:34:59 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ab1e03efb1512fa74a3f40df9478e33c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jeremy Anderberg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/pics_phone_header3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn60@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-36-118_ee6e4063e9bd617e.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/graham-grids.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn16@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-37-41-078_1fd3d3567ff855e9.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/bug-feat.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn44@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-07-826_112d6e2c893db480.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/graham.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn67@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-37-07-670_c2ad25235528a69d.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/landscape2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn87@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-37-07-874_317d9fd9fd2c49b8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/-K6L3zECeRU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn19@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-37-28-221_bea7b9e84d392176.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237416533},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:36:56","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:36:56","title":"The 3 Cornerstones of Defensive Driving","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=119257","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-119369 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/driving_header_2.jpg\" alt=\"Cornerstones of defensive driving\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/driving_header_2.jpg 650w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/driving_header_2-372x230.jpg 372w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/driving_header_2-320x197.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/driving_header_2-640x394.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"></img></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s Note: This is a guest article by Dave Elniski</em>.</p>\n<p>Driving may be the most dangerous task that the modern man performs on a regular basis. Vehicles are the safest they’ve ever been, and new technology gives drivers the feeling of sanctuary from external hazards, but collisions at highway speeds continue to show us that all these technological advancements have yet to make driving a risk-free task.</p>\n<p>Central among the remaining risks are the vehicular operators with whom one is forced to share the road. There are those who intentionally drive aggressively, act like traffic rules are for drivers with less prowess than them, and perhaps even take pride in their ability to stunt. Arguably even more dangerous, are those drivers who hit the road with little thought given to the <em>skill </em>driving requires. These drivers may think of driving only as a means to get where they want to go, not as a proficiency worth developing. Both of these types of drivers are dangerous to themselves and others, but probably do not think of themselves that way.</p>\n<p>I have always taken safe driving seriously. Though when I was younger I pushed the envelope of what a rusted-out pick-up could do in farmers’ fields and off-road trails, and my brother and I raced cars at amateur events, our parents instilled in us the belief that it is important to take driving seriously and make safety an internal value. When working as a long-haul trucker and safety officer for a trucking company, safe driving took on a new meaning as I became keenly aware that my driving behaviors were now tied to my livelihood, and adherence to the rules of the road became more than just the right thing to do for me, but evolved into an activity in which I take pride.</p>\n<p>I’m proud of the hundreds of thousands of accident-free miles I have logged, but what really drove home the importance of safe driving for me was becoming a father. Hauling my entire family around in a small SUV gives me a great sense of responsibility, and I consider safe behavior something I owe my family, which depends on me. So, although it may not sound exciting to talk about safe driving, it is something about which I am extremely passionate.</p>\n<p>For over 50 years, defensive driving has been a topic taught for the purposes of improving safety for and collaboration between drivers on the road. I think most people have heard about defensive driving and understand it to mean driving in a manner that anticipates mistakes by others and aims to increase on-road safety for all road users, a definition which I consider accurate. It is the basic principles of defensive driving that I want to discuss in this article, because I believe that these offer the surest path to improving one’s driving skill and increasing the likelihood of making it safely to each destination. And given that driving may continue to be the most hazardous task our children will have to face in their lives, it is a skill that every man and father should develop so that it can be modeled and taught to our youth.</p>\n<p>As a professional truck driver and safety officer for a flatbed trucking company, I incorporate defensive driving practices and techniques into my own driving and into training programs for other drivers. Although there are many specific techniques involved in professional and defensive driving, I would like to explain three key concepts that I believe are cornerstones to this skillset: 1) preventability versus fault, 2) following distance, and 3) detachment from other drivers.</p>\n<h3>Cornerstone #1: Consider Preventability Versus Fault</h3>\n<p>In defensive driving, one of the most important concepts is preventability. The National Safety Council defines a preventable collision as “one in which the driver failed to do everything that reasonably could have been done to avoid it.” This is different from fault. Most people, when discussing an accident, talk about who was at fault; from an insurance standpoint this is indeed very important when settling claims. However, even though you may not be <em>at fault</em> for an accident, you still may have contributed to it.</p>\n<p>For example, let’s say your vehicle is rear-ended at a stop sign. This is a classic example of an accident where you would probably not be directly at fault. But if your rear taillights were not working, it could be argued that this accident was somewhat preventable if the other driver could not easily see that you were stopped. In this way, you would have contributed to the accident by not having working lights and you failed to do everything reasonable to prevent the accident.</p>\n<p>Trucking companies do not have their safety performance measured in terms of fault. Our accidents are counted against us unless we can show that the accident was non-preventable. Proper pre- and post-trip vehicle inspections and following all the rules of the road are the best way to ensure we are not involved in either preventable or at-fault accidents, and by considering preventability in driving decisions by <em>anticipating other drivers’ mistakes</em>, a professional driver can step up his game.</p>\n<p>A mature non-professional driver should do likewise. Always be thinking about preventing accidents, not just about not being at fault. Don’t trust that other drivers will follow the rules. What makes a defensive driver so safe is that he is vigilantly looking for mistakes other drivers will invariably make.</p>\n<h3>Cornerstone #2: Be Mindful of Following Distance</h3>\n<p>When it comes to driving any vehicle, following distance is one of the most important factors in determining a driver’s likelihood of getting into a collision and in their overall stress level.</p>\n<p>Following distance is the distance between the front of your vehicle and the rear of the vehicle in front of you. A common way to measure this is in seconds: when the rear of the vehicle in front of you passes by an object, start counting until you reach that same point. That amount of time is your following distance. Heavy truck drivers should aim for 7 seconds or more of following distance at highway speeds when the roads are dry; when visibility is reduced and the road is wet, slick, or icy, considerably more time should be added. For cars, 3-4 seconds is a good number but when road conditions deteriorate, this distance should be increased substantially.</p>\n<p>Following distance is the amount of time you have to react to collisions and hazards in front of your vehicle. Driving too closely to the vehicle in front of you is dangerous, discourteous, and stressful. I find that when I adjust my speed to keep a large following distance, I am much more relaxed. I am also more confident in my ability to handle unexpected situations safely. Brake lights well ahead allow me time to respond to a possible problem in a calm and controlled manner; brake lights right in front of me are an immediate crisis.</p>\n<h3>Cornerstone #3: Remain Detached from Other Drivers</h3>\n<p>Being stuck behind or driving around inexperienced, inconsiderate drivers can be very frustrating and lead to feelings of anger. Sometimes it is someone who is distracted; sometimes it is someone who cut you off. When you are in scenic areas, it can be someone using the highway as their place to take pictures, causing them to drive slowly and unpredictably.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the offense, there is nothing we can do about the actions of others. If we get angry because of mistakes others make, we are the ones who are harmed. If, in our anger, we do something we would not do when calm, our anger can cause us future regret and in extreme cases could cause an accident or violent encounter.</p>\n<p>One of the best pieces of driving advice I could give someone is to see other drivers as what they are: road hazards we can’t control. If someone cuts me off and I think of it as a personal attack against me, I am likely to get mad. If someone does the same thing but I just see them as a hazard and react by carefully slowing down and giving them space, I find that I am calmer and quickly forget the incident. This is remaining detached from other drivers: defensive drivers do not take the actions of other drivers personally and don’t play dangerous games of highway power and revenge.</p>\n<p>Bad drivers are like deer on the road: we must treat them with caution but should not waste our anger on them. When I encounter the dangerous actions of other drivers, I tell myself that they probably don’t know any better, try to get on with my day, and generally find that this approach helps me be calmer and more rational.</p>\n<p>By the way, the principles in this section may sound familiar to a reader familiar with Stoicism. Stoic philosophy is very applicable to driving. When I started reading about Stoicism and practicing it, I saw immediately how much this was going to help my driving. As Epictetus said, “Some things are in our control and others not,” and this advice certainly applies when it comes to keeping calm and detached from the actions of others when driving.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In an interpretation of Aristotle’s philosophy, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31wYhcx\">Will Durant wrote</a>: “We are what we repeatedly do.” I like this quote and believe what it says, for our actions are better indicators of who we are than our words. I can’t actually be a safe driver if I do not use safe driving techniques and put defensive driving principles into practice, no matter how skilled and safe I claim to be.</p>\n<p>I firmly believe that adopting the three cornerstones of defensive driving explained above makes me a safer driver and helps me make better decisions on the road. Additionally, because of how much less stressful and more enjoyable driving becomes when these principles are practiced, defensive driving becomes a positive feedback loop: the more I do it, the more I want to do it.</p>\n<p>Safe driving is important. Don’t believe that your modern vehicle will always protect you. Don’t trust that fellow drivers will always follow the rules. Don’t get complacent behind the wheel.</p>\n<p>Do treat driving as a skill that requires practice and mindfulness, remembering that we have the responsibility to protect our own lives, the lives of our occupants, and the lives of those around us.</p>\n<p>_______________________</p>\n<p><i>Dave Elniski is a happy husband to Katy and a proud father to his three-year-old twins Susan and Mack.

It’s complicated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to COVID-19, many schools have shifted entirely to remote/online learning or a hybrid model where some days students are in class physically, and other days they’re learning from home. Even if a school is gung-ho about starting the year with in-person instruction, there’s a possibility that its classes will eventually shift online if a COVID outbreak occurs among its students or faculty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, there’s a chance that all students, from grade school on up to college, will be doing some or the entirety of their schooling in front of a screen this semester.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While remote learning can provide the opportunity for educational flexibility, this setup comes with its own unique challenges. Educators that analyzed how online learning went during the beginning of the pandemic found three which were particularly significant: time management, distractions, and Zoom fatigue. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we look at this trio of online learning’s biggest challenges and offer some suggestions for students (and/or the parents of them) on how they can be overcome. </span></p>\n<h3>Manage Your Time</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With in-person school in years past, you probably struggled to make time for studying; it’s easy to procrastinate your reading and note reviewing, and then find yourself cramming before exams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With online school, particularly in the case of “asynchronous learning,” the problem has doubled in size. Rather than streaming their lectures in real-time, many professors/teachers are recording their lectures and letting their students watch them at their convenience. With that change, the onus for deciding if/when to engage with the class now falls on the individual student not only in terms of studying, but watching the lectures as well. With no part of your education already built into your schedule, it can be easy to keep putting things off and fall very behind and adrift in your curricular progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So if online learning doesn’t set a structured schedule for you, it’s up to you to create one for yourself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you don’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to physically go to class, plan and act as if you do. And do something that’s helpful even during in-person school, which is to act is if your studying sessions were inviolable too.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You accomplish this by creating a master weekly schedule for your semester; we wrote about this concept in <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/ace-your-exams-study-tactics-of-the-successful-gentleman-scholar/\">our article about college study tips</a> several years back, and it’s even more relevant for online learning today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within this master schedule, you block off times during the week that you’ll devote to both attending class (whether in-person or virtually) and to studying:</span></p>\n<p><b>1. Block off your class times. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important appointments of your week. Schedule everything else around your class times. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is very important to do even if your classes are asynchronous!</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Decide which times you’ll watch/listen to the recorded lectures, block these times off, and stick to that schedule. Treat those times as if they were a live lecture.</span></p>\n<p><b>2. Block off reading time for each of your classes.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Suppose you have a Monday/Wednesday/Friday class schedule. In that case, you’ll probably want to block off an hour or two on Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday for taking care of your assigned readings.</span></p>\n<p><b>3. Block off time for note review/outlining/homework for each class.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You’ll want to set aside time so you can synthesize class notes, do some outlining, and complete any homework assignments you might have. When I was in college, I typically blocked off an hour right after each class for this. If a class was lecture heavy, like ancient Greek philosophy, I’d use that hour right after class to review my notes and update my class outline. If the class was heavy on problem sets, like calculus or symbolic logic, I used the hour after class to do the homework which had just been assigned (the concepts being fresh in mind and ripe for reiteration) and any additional practice problems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of time you need for note review/outlining/homework will vary. I recommend setting aside at least one hour for each hour spent in class. If you need more time, schedule it.</span></p>\n<p><b>4. Other possible permanent time blocks.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If your work schedule is the same throughout the semester, you might as well block it off on your master schedule. In my law school days, I also blocked off time for exercise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make these times </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recurring</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> events in your calendar. You should only change or modify them in extreme cases. Treat them like doctor’s appointments. If a friend wants to get together during your reading time, tell them you have a prior engagement, and suggest another time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if online learning allows you the flexibility to jettison the idea of keeping any kind of regular schedule, you should still set and stick to one yourself. </span></p>\n<h3>Reduce Distractions</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lending your full attention to a possibly dry in-person lecture isn’t always easy. Watch that lecture online at home, without the eyes of your professor and fellow classmates on you, and focusing is even harder. Distractions abound.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one thing, the device you use to access your class is the same device that gives you access to YouTube, text messages, and video games. You can do a “quick check” of some of your favorite websites, ostensibly still listening to a lecture while you toggle around . . . but soon realize you can’t remember anything your professor said in the last ten minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or, since you’re at home, you might decide to pause a lecture to clean up the kitchen; then return to watch the rest and take a quiz; then put in some laundry; then do a few minutes of reading. While short bouts of such <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/practice-productive-procrastination/\">productive procrastination</a> can occasionally be helpful to break up a long study or work session, lectures are by and large meant to be consumed holistically, it takes awhile to get into the studying or writing groove, and constantly switching between tasks will leave you feeling scattered and unable to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-168-the-value-of-deep-work-in-the-age-of-distraction/\">do immersive deep work</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To manage distractions and keep your focus on track, even when you’re learning in your living room, do the following:</span></p>\n<p><b>Close all apps on your computer that are not in use. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re listening to an online lecture, whether it’s real-time or asynchronous, close all unnecessary apps. The only apps you should have open are the one you use to watch the lecture and the one you use to take notes (and even this optional; see below). That’s it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don’t have the self-control to keep unnecessary apps closed during lecture time, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-quit-mindlessly-surfing-the-internet-and-actually-get-stuff-done/\">check out our guide on how to quit wasting time on the internet</a>. We’ve provided several ways to block distracting websites and apps on your computer for set periods of time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Put your phone on Do Not Disturb mode. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides eliminating all would-be distractions on your computer, eliminate them from one of the most distracting devices in your possession: your smartphone. Just as you’d (hopefully) put your phone on Do Not Disturb mode if you were in a real-world class, do the same for your online class. Do this even if you’re watching a lecture that’s not live. Remember, treat your asynchronous classes as if they were in-person, live events.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better yet, while you’re watching lectures, put your phone in another room. Out of sight, out of mind.</span></p>\n<p><b>Watch your lectures at a table or desk. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The temptation with online learning is to watch your professors’ lectures the same way you do other media: from the comfort of your sofa or bed. While said pieces of furniture are comfy, they’re not conducive to effortful focus (taking your laptop into bed also isn’t conducive to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-get-a-good-nights-sleep/\">healthy sleep hygiene</a>; you should only use your bed for sleep, so that your mind only associates it with sleep). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of lounging while you try to learn, pick a spot in your home at a desk or table — somewhere a little more structured/formal feeling than a bed or couch — and make it your dedicated school spot. Create an environment there that’s conducive to learning, that stimulates you to perk up and pay attention, and that simulates a bit of the classroom feel. Whenever you sit down there, your brain will know it’s learning time. </span></p>\n<p><b>Consider taking notes with just pen and paper. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re still finding the computer distracting, consider closing all apps except the online lecture app and just use pen and paper to take notes. When I was in law school, I was a big computer note-taker in the beginning, but discovered that I’d find myself switching over to my browser to google random things or check email. I eventually shifted to taking notes by pen and paper and then taking those handwritten notes and entering them into my digital study outline after class. I found myself more focused during class time and soaking in more information compared to when I frantically typed my notes on my laptop. Plus, while writing down your notes twice (once with a pen and once with a keyboard) might seem annoying, it’s an excellent review tactic that will allow the information to better absorb into your brain.</span></p>\n<h3>Mitigate Zoom Fatigue</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video conferencing has allowed businesses and schools to “meet” while maintaining social distancing. But people have been reporting that after a day of talking to people via Zoom or Skype, they just feel exhausted. People call it “Zoom fatigue,” and researchers say it’s a real thing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why do we feel so tired after taking part in online video conferencing?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s primarily because video conferencing is more cognitively demanding than in-person communication. For starters, while video conferencing allows you to see the person you’re talking to, it doesn’t give you a full view of their body language and facial expressions. What’s more, low video quality can make sussing out body language and facial expressions even more difficult. So your brain is working harder than it usually does to interpret non-verbal communication, but because the non-verbal communication is poor quality, your brain has to try to pay more attention to the words being spoken, all at the same time it’s working overtime to decipher digitally-rendered body language. That’s a lot of cognitive load!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that’s just what happens when you’re trying to talk to one person via video conferencing. Imagine what the cognitive load is like when you’ve got multiple people on a video conference call and your teacher has multi-window view on so you can see all your classmates on your screen at once, Brady Bunch-style. Cognitive load overload!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out this </span><a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/coronavirus-zoom-fatigue-is-taxing-the-brain-here-is-why-that-happens/#close\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">article for more insights about Zoom fatigue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you may have to watch your live online classes via a video conferencing app, there are some things you can do to reduce its tiresome effect.</span></p>\n<p><b>Don’t use multi-window view. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest thing to do is to not use multi-window view on your video conferencing app. I’d just set your app to focus only on your teacher. You don’t need to have the screen switch over to every student who decides to talk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, most video conferencing apps have a window pop-up so you can see what you look like from your camera. Hide or disable it. What tends to happen is that as someone is talking to others in the video conference, their eyes will shift over to this window. This is just a distraction, increases cognitive load, and makes you feel more self-conscious. </span></p>\n<p><b>Just use audio. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other thing you can do to avoid Zoom fatigue is to just listen to your online class’s audio. Your professor might require you to have your camera on so they can see that you’re in class. That’s fine. Just open up the app and then minimize it. Listen to the lecture like you were listening to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/podcast/\">the AoM podcast</a>. Take notes. Answer questions when directed at you and offer commentary when asked.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By focusing just on the audio, you decrease the cognitive load required in trying to follow something that your brain senses is real . . . and isn’t real. Such is the entire challenge of online education!</span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-overcome-the-3-biggest-challenges-of-online-learning/\">How to Overcome the 3 Biggest Challenges of Online Learning</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/bOYyzGVvXQA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 18:35:41 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4129eb16cf5278039fd035e42fc04400","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brett and Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/learn.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn84@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-07-788_0e6bf92823f69a83.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/bOYyzGVvXQA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-31-917_324311fdd7151d8a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237416533},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:36:56","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:36:56","title":"The Reverse Sear: The Best Cooking Method for Steak","link":"http://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=65809","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65815 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Lead.jpg\" alt=\"grilled steak cut sliced on cutting board\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Lead.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Lead-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Lead-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p><em>With our archives now 3,500+ articles deep, we’ve decided to republish a classic piece each Friday to help our newer readers discover some of the best, evergreen gems from the past. This article was originally published in September 2017.<br></br></em><br></br>\nWhile on book tour in Chicago a few months back, I had the honor and pleasure of sitting down to enjoy a leisurely meal, and a few cold beers, with the one and only <a href=\"https://amazingribs.com/\">Meathead Goldwyn</a>. For those not in the know, Meathead is a world-renowned pitmaster, and he distinguishes himself from the pack by focusing on the science of cooking.</p>\n<p>Our delicious food ran out after an hour, but the conversation, and the beers continued. And of course a good conversation can always stir up an opinion or two. As I learned, Meathead never shies away from making and defending opinions that go completely against culinary tradition, instruction, and know-how.</p>\n<p>Though such controversy is well-documented on his own site, I thought it prudent to put one of his theories to the test. The challenge? Meathead believes that we are cooking our steaks all wrong!</p>\n<p>Now, steak carries high favor over here at the Art of Manliness, and as one who has written many a recipe on cooking it, I tried my best not to be offended. But the more I listened, and the more I read up on Meathead’s reverse sear technique, the more I became intrigued.</p>\n<h3>Throwing Tradition Out the Window</h3>\n<p>Although there are many ways to cook a steak, most chefs, culinary professionals, and experts agree on which method is best: sear the heck out of it over high heat, followed by a period of indirect heat until the steak reaches the desired temperature, and finish with a 10-15 minute rest (off of heat) until ready to serve.</p>\n<p>Meathead says to throw that all out the window, and to do the whole process in reverse.</p>\n<p>Certainly, this is not the first I have heard of such a technique. French chefs pioneered a similar method of cooking in the 1970s using their <em>sous-vide</em> style of cooking. Essentially, the <em>sous-vide</em> method entails sealing food in some sort of wrap, and submerging it into a precisely controlled, typically low temperature, water bath. The benefit of this technique is that it slowly brings the entire cut, from edge to edge, to the exact internal temperature desired — say 130 degrees. The problem with this method is that one would likely never eat the grey mass of meat when pulled from the bag, even though its internal temp is a near perfect medium-rare. To solve this issue, a chef will finish a <em>sous-vide</em> cut over high heat on a grill or pan to get the caramelized flavor and color (known as the Maillard reaction) that many of us are accustomed to enjoying. Additionally, because the cut was slowly brought up to temperature, it’s more evenly heated through, which means that resting the cut is not necessary (resting normally allows for some of that searing heat to transfer into the center). All that said, the <em>sous-vide </em>method is time consuming (it can take hours to bring a cut up to temperature), and it can be expensive — a decent in-home machine, though coming down in price and improving in technology, will still run you a few hundred bucks.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you don’t need a special <em>sous-vide</em> cooker to use the reverse sear method on a steak, and you can get a similar effect using an ordinary grill or smoker. Meathead in fact claims to be the first to perfect the reverse sear by way of grill or smoker, coining the term <em>sous-vide-que</em>.</p>\n<p>As someone with an enduring interest in all things BBQ, I decided to follow Meathead’s instruction, and cook up a nice Saturday steak using his method.</p>\n<p>The result? <em>Fantastic</em>.</p>\n<p>Before we get started, let’s go ahead and get a few disclaimers and necessary items out of the way:</p>\n<ul><li>Reverse sear is not just for steaks — it works with roasts, pork, chicken, turkey, and even vegetables.</li>\n<li>That said, a reverse sear works best on thicker cuts of meat. Meathead recommends that a steak be at least an inch thick. So, the conventional method of hot and fast is not wrong, per se, as it is best utilized on thin cuts (less than 1-inch thick), such as <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/skirt-steak-5-different-ways/\">skirt steak</a>.</li>\n<li>Become a master of time and temperature, and also direct and indirect cooking. Whether you have a $50 kettle grill, a gas grill, or a big ol’ expensive smoker, your food will taste best when you maintain the correct temperature over a set period of time. I like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GJEPTJS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B00GJEPTJS&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\">Chargriller Akorn smoker</a> — it’s a super affordable komodo-style cooker that allows me to hold steady, low temps, while also getting up to high heat very quickly.</li>\n<li>Invest in a good <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thermometer-Cooking-Instant-Waterproof-Grilling/dp/B083JY31NG/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1RRHRSQ5X51KH&#38;dchild=1&#38;keywords=meat+thermometer&#38;qid=1599192776&#38;sprefix=meat+therm%2Caps%2C207&#38;sr=8-5\">meat thermometer</a>, and use it.</li>\n</ul><h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Using the Reverse Sear Method to Cook the Perfect Steak</span></h3>\n<p>Here’s the step-by-step process I used to cook a delicious steak, using the Reverse Sear method outlined by Meathead, along with some of my own tweaks.</p>\n<h3>1. Set up grill for indirect, low and slow cooking.</h3>\n<p>My preferred manner when utilizing charcoal is known as the Minion method. This method is most often utilized on kettle or komodo-style smokers. Instead of lighting all of the coals at one time, I light just enough of the coals and place them in contact with the unlit coals. With proper airflow, the idea is that the lit coals will slowly burn and light the remaining coals in a steady, uniform pattern.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65814 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-1.jpg\" alt=\"charcoal brick set up in komodo style grill \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-1.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-1-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-1-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>I like to achieve this by creating a “reverse volcano” inside the bowl of my smoker. I stack fresh lump charcoal with the larger pieces towards the bottom and around the perimeter of the bowl, leaving a hole in the center of the pile. From there, I light just a few coals in my chimney starter and add them directly into the bottom of the smoker, making slight contact with the unlit coals.</p>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-65813\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-2.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-2-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-2-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>Using the air vents on the smoker, I maintain just enough airflow for the coals to slowly burn outward. With my fire prepared, I set the grill to hover just around 200 degrees F. Meathead recommends a temperature closer to 225 degrees F, but I had a little extra time and wanted to practice holding my temp very low and slow.</p>\n<h3>2. Cook the steak slowly over indirect heat.</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65816 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Indirect.jpg\" alt=\"large steak being cooked on grill indirect heat\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Indirect.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Indirect-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Indirect-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>I accomplished this using vertical separation, placing my steak high and above the heat source. I could have taken it to the next level using a smoking stone or other barrier between the heat source and my steak, but I decided not to add that extra step due to the relatively low cook time. You can also use the offset method, most commonly used on a gas grill by placing the meat horizontally away from the heat source.</p>\n<p>With my smoker holding at 200 degrees F, I cooked the steak indirectly for approximately 45 minutes until the cut reached my desired internal temp, between 115-120 degrees F.</p>\n<h3>3. Quickly bring the heat up on your grill/smoker.</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65811 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Sear.jpg\" alt=\"steak being cooked on grill low heat \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Sear.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Sear-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Sear-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>Removing the steak from the smoker, I opened up both the top and bottom vents to introduce as much airflow as possible. Fire loves air, so it didn’t take long, perhaps 10 minutes, for my Akorn to climb to a steady 600 degrees F.</p>\n<h3>4. Sear the meat over high, direct heat.</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65817 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Flip.jpg\" alt=\"steak being cooked on grill sear marks \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Flip.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Flip-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Flip-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>Leaving the lid of the smoker (or grill) completely open is very important when searing the meat. Not only does this supply the coals with plenty of oxygen to keep the fire hot, it also ensures that you do not overcook your steak. Closing the lid would create a convective style of heat — not what we want here. The internal temp of the steak is already very close to my desired 135 degrees F. Because I’m cooking over direct heat, I turned the meat often, every 45 seconds or so to ensure even browning across the entire surface.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I flipped the meat nearly every minute, taking the internal temperature until it reached my desired 135 degrees, exactly. Normally I would pull the steak off of heat 5 degrees early to account for some extra heat transfer, but wanting to test the “no rest” mantra, I pulled the steak at my exact temp. Note, the entire searing process took less than 4 minutes.</p>\n<h3>5. Don’t rest the meat whatsoever before cutting into it.</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65812 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/No-rest.jpg\" alt=\"grilled steak on wooden cutting board \" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/No-rest.jpg 600w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/No-rest-320x213.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/No-rest-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></img></p>\n<p>Sounds crazy, I know. It took every bit of trust for me to not let this steak sit on the cutting board for 10-15 minutes. I was sure that once I cut into the steak, the juices would run everywhere. But lo and behold, I was wrong.</p>\n<p>After slicing the meat almost immediately after I pulled it from the grill, the interior was cooked beautifully from edge to edge, without any mess whatsoever — juices completely retained. A bit of coarse salt, cracked pepper, and a cold beer to finish everything off – boy oh boy was this a delicious steak!</p>\n<p>In the end, I’m fully convinced the reverse sear method is superior to the conventional style of cooking, especially for thicker cuts of meat. That said, the one drawback of this method is its inconvenience. The same steak could have been grilled, and rested, in under 25 minutes, compared to my approximately 90 minutes of cooking to setup the grill, slowly cook, sear, and finish. I will say, though, that the results in terms of juiciness and tenderness were worthwhile. And when I’m paying good money for quality steaks, a bit more time and love in the cooking process is certainly worth it.</p>\n<p>____________________</p>\n<p><em>Matt Moore is a regular contributor to the Art of Manliness and the author of </em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YzsIg9\">Serial Griller</a><em>.</em></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/reverse-sear-best-cooking-method-steak/\">The Reverse Sear: The Best Cooking Method for Steak</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/CC9elw9Lxys\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 13:01:50 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"33acbe6b5b1564c21d3f627bc0113849","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Matt Moore","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Lead.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn92@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-19-966_17aa639a286b1812.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn9@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-47-232_854b5b63e0990fa9.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Minion-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-30-107_abc3e1c338705bd5.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Indirect.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-44-248_699efdb51db47bd4.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Sear.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn35@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-37-26-335_aa64afacef336f77.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/Flip.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn56@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-07-702_eb517927a1202f5e.webp","https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2017/08/No-rest.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn40@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-37-11-273_b946ea0285675658.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/CC9elw9Lxys":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn79@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-37-10-105_3e5f29a4a4d0163a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237416533},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:36:56","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:36:56","title":"Podcast #641: How Eisenhower Led — A Conversation with Ike’s Granddaughter","link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=119394","description":"<h4 id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-tag\" style=\"margin-bottom: 35px;\"></h4><p><iframe title=\"#641: How Eisenhower Led &#x2014; A Conversation with Ike's Granddaughter\" src=\"https://omny.fm/shows/the-art-of-manliness/641-how-eisenhower-led-a-conversation-with-ikes-gr/embed\" width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>From guiding the Allies to victory in World War II as supreme commander, to steering the ship of state for eight years as one of the country’s least partisan and most popular presidents, few leaders in history have had to make as varied and consequential decisions as Dwight D. Eisenhower.</p>\n<p>My guest today possesses insights into how he made the many choices he was faced with in his military and political careers that are gleaned not only from studying Ike’s life, but from personally knowing the man beneath the mantle. Her name is <a href=\"https://susaneisenhower.com/\">Susan Eisenhower</a> and she’s a writer, consultant, and policy strategist, one of Dwight’s four grandchildren, and the author of the new book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250238773/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1250238773&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>How Ike Led: The Principles Behind Eisenhower’s Biggest Decisions</em></a>. Susan and I begin our conversation with her relationship with Ike as both historic leader and ordinary grandfather, and why she decided to write a book about his leadership style. We then dive into the principles of his leadership, beginning with his decision to greenlight the D-Day invasion, what it reveals about his iron-clad commitment to taking responsibility, and how that commitment allowed him to be such an effective delegator. From there Susan explains how a love of studying history born in Ike’s boyhood allowed him to take a big picture approach to strategy, how he used a desk drawer to deal with his lifelong struggle with anger, and how his belief in morale as an input rather than an output inspired him to always stay optimistic for the benefit of those he led. We then turn to how Eisenhower dealt with the discovery of concentration camps at the end of WWII and making peace with Germany after it. We then talk about his nonpartisan governing style as president which he called the “Middle Way” and which involved emphasizing cooperation, compromise, and unity, including members of both political parties in his cabinet, limiting his use of the “bully pulpit” to sway public opinion, and striving not to turn policy issues into personality confrontations. We then discuss how this style influenced how he dealt with Joseph McCarthy and enforced the Brown v. Board of Education decision. At the end of our conversation, Susan explains that while she doesn’t expect everyone to agree with the difficult decisions her grandfather made, she thinks there’s something to be learned from how he managed to make them, and to make them without becoming hard and cynical in the process.</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Susan’s experience of growing up with her grandfather as president </li>\n<li>The remarkable D-Day note that Susan started her book with</li>\n<li>How Ike delegated</li>\n<li>What Ike read as a boy and what he learned about leadership and decision making </li>\n<li>Ike’s anger, and how he dealt with it </li>\n<li>How Eisenhower handled the discovery of German concentration camps</li>\n<li>How Dwight thought the Germans should be handled after the war ended </li>\n<li>What made Dwight decide to run for president?</li>\n<li>Eisenhower’s non-partisan governing style</li>\n<li>Balancing the role of figurehead and politician in the presidency </li>\n<li>How Ike beat Joseph McCarthy </li>\n<li>The enforcement of the Brown vs. Board of Education decision </li>\n<li>How Eisenhower coped with the stress of the office </li>\n<li>Ike’s surprising people skills </li>\n</ul><h3>Resources/People/Articles Mentioned in Podcast</h3>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/eisenhower-decision-matrix/\">The Eisenhower Decision Matrix</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-206-extreme-ownership/\">My interview with Jocko Willink about the idea of extreme ownership</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-never-criticize-without-offering-an-alternative/\">Never Criticize Without Offering an Alternative</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/tag/eisenhower-leadership/\">Our AoM series on Eisenhower’s leadership</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/books-about-war/\">43 Books About War Every Man Should Read</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/eisenhower-patton-bradley-wwii-generals/\">The Friendship, Rivalry, and Leadership of America’s 3 Greatest WWII Generals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/d-day-75-year-anniversary/\">Remembering D-Day 75 Years Later</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Taft\">Robert Taft</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416541500/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=1416541500&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>A Matter of Justice</em></a> by David Nichols</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393331806/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0393331806&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Eisenhower Diaries</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385129319/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=0385129319&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Letters to Mamie</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006AQTTA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B0006AQTTA&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>My Three Years With Eisenhower</em></a></li>\n</ul><h3><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-119396 \" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/susan-eisenhower-book-cover.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"556\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/susan-eisenhower-book-cover.jpg 494w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/09/susan-eisenhower-book-cover-320x509.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\"></img></h3>\n<h3>Connect With Susan</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://susaneisenhower.com/\">Susan’s website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eisenhowergroup\">Susan on Twitter</a></p>\n<h3>Listen to the Podcast!
