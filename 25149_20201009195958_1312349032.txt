We are happy to announce another exciting feature, a seamless continuation of our vision and promise to help you be more productive and keep you in your flow. Tap into the power of Your Phone app with Link to Windows integration on select Samsung devices to instantly access your phone’s mobile apps directly from your Windows 10 PC. There’s no need to install, sign-in or set up your apps on your PC, saving you time and hassle. You can conveniently pin your favorite mobile apps to your Taskbar or Start menu on your PC for quick and easy access. When you launch an app, it opens in a separate window outside of the Your Phone app enabling you to multitask. So, whether you need to quickly reply to a conversation, respond to your social posts, or order food, you can do it fast using your PC’s large screen, keyboard, mouse, pen and touch screen alongside your other PC apps!</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-image wp-image--no-caption alignnone\"><div class=\"alignwrap\"><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/08/981c0c28f97305545318d655cf5ac056.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-174460\" src=\"https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/2/2020/08/981c0c28f97305545318d655cf5ac056.gif\" alt=\"Mobile phone and Windows laptop highlighting Your Phone Apps feature.\" width=\"760\" height=\"380\" /></a></div></figure>\n<p>And we are not stopping here. Later in the year, Samsung Galaxy Note20 users will experience the power and convenience of running multiple apps side by side and we will continue to work with Samsung to bring this feature to additional devices. Apps will launch in separate windows enabling you to interact with multiple apps at the same time. So, whether you are working on a document, keeping up on your social media feed or simply staying connected with family and friends, everything is accessible in one place, so your flow is never broken.</p>\n<p>Starting today, Android phones supporting Your Phone app’s Phone screen feature will be able to preview the Apps feature. See list of supported devices <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4551890/supported-devices-for-your-phone-experiences\">here</a>. The ability to run multiple apps simultaneously is currently not available and will be introduced later this year.
