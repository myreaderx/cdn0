Include a mix of subjects at different scales; for instance, pick some wide shots that show the entire scene, as well as some detail photos that show lots of texture and personality. Without one or the other, the story won&#8217;t be complete. And it won&#8217;t carry the level of emotion that you&#8217;re after. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of <a aria-label=\"storytelling (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/8-tips-storytelling-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">storytelling</a>: It often does help to focus on the story you&#8217;re trying to tell. Do you want to offer a narrative surrounding an event? Do you want to clearly convey a meaningful concept? Make sure to take this into account when picking photos!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One more tip: If possible, include at least three photos and no more than eight. Too few photos, and you won&#8217;t be able to tell the full story. Too many photos, and you&#8217;ll confuse the viewer with clutter (plus, it&#8217;ll be tough to show off individual details).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"step-open-the-selected-images-in-photoshop\">Step 2: Open the selected images in Photoshop</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve picked your photos, open them all in Photoshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, you can drag and drop files directly onto the document window, or you can select <strong>File>Open</strong> and click on the relevant images.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209030\" style=\"width:570px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:570px;

If you&#8217;re working with big JPEGs and you aim to print, you should probably pick a 5000+ pixel width and height. If you want to display your collage on a standard web page, however, a 1500 pixel width and height will do just fine (though you can always start big and resize later, as discussed in <strong>Step 8 </strong>below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(I do recommend you make the file size a bit larger than the size you want in the end; that way, you can do a final crop to deal with any arrangement issues.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"step-add-your-images-one-at-a-time\">Step 3: Add your images one at a time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to your first open photo, then select it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, you can drag with the <a aria-label=\"Marquee tool (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/five-secrets-of-the-marquee-tools-in-photoshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Marquee tool</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><span class=\"responsive-image wp-image-209034\" style=\"width:291px\"><span class=\"space\" style=\"width:291px; padding-top:168.73%\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"291\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-6.jpg?resize=291%2C491&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"marquee tool how to make a Photoshop collage\" class=\"wp-image-209034\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-6.jpg?w=291&#38;ssl=1 291w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-6.jpg?resize=178%2C300&#38;ssl=1 178w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can hit <em>Ctrl/Cmd+A</em>.
