With the update, the entire experience with Workflow, whether on the platform or in the email notifications, is done through the new interface.</p><h4>Ideation section</h4><p>The Ideation section has been redesigned. Now teams can receive content ideas, approve and send them to production as a few-step process. Any actions taken by users get saved, so you know precisely what happened to that piece (who approved, when it was approved, when it was sent to production, who participated) across the entire production cycle.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iopmdPzI86FXXjaIhA2LiA.gif\" /></figure><h4>SEO Ranking</h4><p>From now on, you can segment the SEO Ranking feature to the specific country you are focusing on ranking. All countries and languages are available as an option so, if you are in Brazil, trying to rank for a Portuguese world, you can use the filters and keep track of how your domain is performing for that specific region and language.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_cyjP3SnkbZMCgkOZkn_xQ.gif\" /></figure><h4>Sort function</h4><p>In addition to improving the loading speed of the Execute list, we’ve also added the sorting functionality to the columns in the list view of <strong>Idea</strong> and <strong>Execute</strong> sections.</p><p>If you want to reorganize your entire backlog of ideas or of pieces being produced by, who suggested, by idea title, by content title, or any other variable — making it easier to find the exact information you are looking for.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*F2WpQro9cb0lssOa2b4tBQ.gif\" /></figure><h4>Marketplace</h4><p>Focused on creating an even better experience when you look for our content professionals. Our marketplace page has been redesigned and has added new fields, like ‘Tags’, ‘Categories’, ‘City’, and ‘Country’.

Now, aside from the existing options, you can also select which roles can or cannot participate in each <strong>Content &#38; Steps</strong> as well as <strong>Subtasks </strong>permissions.</p><h4>Integrations</h4><p><strong>API</strong></p><p>The public API also comes with a much-requested improvement: <strong>Ideas Section</strong>.<br>This improvement means you can connect Workflow with any external tool to input and/or manage new ideas.</p><p>So, for example, if you want to input new content ideas from your slack organization or with a proprietary internal tool, or even with a widget in your blog/portal, that can be done through the new API.</p><p><strong>Zapier</strong></p><p>Zapier is a very powerful tool that organizes and allows you to instantly <a href=\"https://zapier.com/apps/contentools/integrations\"><strong>connect Workflow with 3,000+ apps</strong></a> to automate your work safely and effectively.
