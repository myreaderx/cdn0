of the world's hard working landlords a bad rap. This landlord was pulling all kinds of criminal stunts. Not only that, but he refused to pay for the building's electricity during the icy heart of winter. That's just wrong, man. Fortunately, there was a moral enforcer around who was ready to do the research necessary to take this landlord down. By the end of it, the dude ended up owing thousands, and it sounds like that was completely justified.&#160;</p> </div> <div> <h3> 1. </h3> <div> <img class='event-item-lol-image' src='https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9575955200/h9A968ACA/after-being-released-prison-happy-someone-gonna-give-chance-improve-my-life-this-clearly-not-case' id='_r_a_9575955200' alt=\"Text - r/NuclearRevenge + Join u/TheAsianSquad • 1y 1 3 1 Take away our heat and electricity during the winter?

It took three days to get ED to even answer his phone. By that time his voicemail was full of complaints from his freezing cold tenants. He told me the law gave him reasonable time to fix it. We went two more weeks with no heat using our stoves and camping in the kitchen in our respective apartments. When ED got his electricity bill he attempted to raise the rent on the apartments.
