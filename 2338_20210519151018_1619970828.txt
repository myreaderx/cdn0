We’ve seen that happen quite consistently over the last decade but we’ve seen it accelerate during the pandemic because there’s been more digitalization of platforms.”</p><p>Offering bitcoin exposure would be a fairly dramatic about face for Wells Fargo, which was not allowings it banking clients to make cryptocurrency transactions as recently as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/l3l2ucelee/status/1149686757987717121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1149728891059261441%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&#38;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fccx10e%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dfalse\">July 2019</a>.</p><p>But it would also be in line with a growing trend from Wells Fargo’s competitors. <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/goldman-sachs-to-offer-clients-bitcoin-investment-vehicles\">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/report-jpmorgan-to-offer-bitcoin-fund\">JPMorgan Chase &#38;
