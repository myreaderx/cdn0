The first is The Molluetuesk (click to enlarge).  This was done using a Micron pen and some pointillism.  I like pointillism since you can use the same pen for the entire sketch and I suck at traditional shading (as you will see below). I originally planned to use pencil to draw some natural cave stalactites and stalagmites to see how the critter could blend in.  I opted against it because pencil smears too easily and I didn't want to overly obscure the Molluetuesk. I may submit this one to the<a href=\"http://odd74.proboards76.com/index.cgi?board=fanzine&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1809\"> Erol Otus art contest</a>.  I would feel honored just knowing he saw one of my pieces.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/vze4zjyn/throxiainsight.jpg\"><img style=\"margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 516px; height: 373px;\" src=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/vze4zjyn/throxiainsight.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />This next one is practically a colleague.  It uses pointillism, crosshatch, scribble-sketch, brush ink and whatever else I could think of.  This is what I think approaching Throxia would look like (Otter's game, <a href=\"http://worldofthool.blogspot.com/\">Thool</a>).  I don't like this one nearly as much but it is really a mandatory sketch since I need to get back into practice somehow.<br /><br />I will probably try to do some pen and ink art work in the future since I enjoy it and have let it go for far too long.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Mar 2009 16:46:00 +0000","feedId":42279,"bgimg":"http://mysite.verizon.net/vze4zjyn/molluetuesk.jpg","linkMd5":"09316b87338a7b692581315500a7a42f","author":"noreply@blogger.com (Canecorpus)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://mysite.verizon.net/vze4zjyn/molluetuesk.jpg":null,"http://mysite.verizon.net/vze4zjyn/throxiainsight.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605515875407}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 16:37:55","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 16:37:55","feedId":42279,"fetchDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:37:55 +0000","fetchMs":118,"handleMs":246,"totalMs":244187,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":25,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"d01126ad4678a8e169f9117eff8589f2","hostName":"us-013*","requestId":"6e65930731b94b0f83844a07f5d4572d_42279","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:26:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:44:01","id":42279,"name":"Valley of Blue Snails","url":"http://valleyofbluesnails.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss","subscriber":76,"website":null,"icon":"http://valleyofbluesnails.blogspot.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn22@2020_2/2020/09/06/21-43-59-548_39f55181dbbbbaeb.ico","description":"OD&amp;D, D&amp;D, B/X, military, pbp, pbem, custom campaign","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 16:41:59","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 16:41:59","id":null,"feedId":42279,"linkMd5":"09316b87338a7b692581315500a7a42f"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605515874992,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":169,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":246,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":121775,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":121794,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://us-035.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://europe-22.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":2,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null,null]},"http://us-009.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
