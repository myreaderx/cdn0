Bacterioplankton from the surface waters of a subtropical urban reservoir in southeast China were analyzed through high-frequency sampling over 13 months to compare patterns and ecological processes between short (0‒8 weeks), medium (9‒24 weeks) and long (25‒53 weeks) time intervals. We classified the bacterial community into different subcommunities: abundant taxa (AT); conditionally rare taxa (CRT); rare taxa (RT). CRT contributed &gt; 65% of the alpha-diversity, and temporal change of beta-diversities was more pronounced for AT and CRT than RT. The bacterial community exhibited a directional change in the short- and medium-time intervals and a convergent dynamic during the long-time interval due to a seasonal cycle. Cyanobacteria exhibited a strong succession pattern than other phyla. CRT accounted for &gt; 76% of the network nodes in three stations. The bacteria–environment relationship and deterministic processes were stronger for large sample size at station G (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">n</span> = 116) than small sample size at stations C (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">n</span> = 12) and L (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">n</span> = 22). These findings suggest that a high-frequency sampling approach can provide a better understanding on the time scales at which bacterioplankton can change fast between being abundant or rare, thus providing the facts about environmental factors driving microbial community dynamics. Patterns and processes in alpha- and beta-diversities and community assembly of bacterioplankton differ among different time intervals (short-, medium- and long-time intervals) and different subcommunities (abundant, conditionally rare and rare taxa) in a subtropical urban reservoir, demonstrating the importance of temporal scale and high-frequency sampling in microbial community ecology.</span>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":46419,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6af8285cf4375ca8d7ca1d7dbfdc513a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Nyirabuhoro P, Gao X, Ndayishimiye J, et al.
