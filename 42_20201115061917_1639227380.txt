Deformation is measured through changes in optical paths within the flexible fiber optic sensors. By providing a sense of ‘touch’, the sensors could provide additional functionality for medical soft robots or prostheses and also be useful in measuring forces in physical therapy and sports medicine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing machines to physically feel and explore their environment by mimicking the tactile sensation of skin is an active area of research at present. The potential rewards include surgical robots that can feel their way through the body, and robotic prostheses that give their users a sense of touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other applications may include unlocking new types of data for physical therapy, such as the forces exerted by a patient when performing a specific exercise or activity. At present, such therapy may involve motion-tracking to assess patient movements, but there is no reliable way to measure the forces involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Right now, sensing is done mostly by vision,&#8221; said Rob Shepherd, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;We hardly ever measure touch in real life. This skin is a way to allow ourselves and machines to measure tactile interactions in a way that we now currently use the cameras in our phones. It&#8217;s using vision to measure touch. This is the most convenient and practical way to do it in a scalable way.&#8221; &#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stretchable-sensor.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501693\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stretchable-sensor.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stretchable-sensor-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest technology uses fiber optic cables to measure physical deformation, such as bending and strain. The sensors are tubes that contain elastomeric cores, one of which contains absorbing dyes. An LED provides light along the core and a red-green-blue sensor chip measures changes in the light path along the core as an indicator of the deformation of the tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the researchers have installed their sensors on the fingers of a glove that is also fitted with a battery and is Bluetooth enabled, so that it can transmit data about the movements of the glove and the forces acting on the sensors. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See a video about the technology below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Stretchable sensor gives robots and VR a human touch\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/34ucE36zSCg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Science</em>: <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6518/848\">Stretchable distributed fiber-optic sensors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2020/11/stretchable-sensor-gives-robots-and-vr-human-touch\">Cornell</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=-mecCC3iRss:1h8stRIoetc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=-mecCC3iRss:1h8stRIoetc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=-mecCC3iRss:1h8stRIoetc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=-mecCC3iRss:1h8stRIoetc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/-mecCC3iRss\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 16:10:35 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stretch-glove.jpg","linkMd5":"e3ca6283cbbe58bd025a7d22d4ef07fd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn6@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-18-42-864_ab165fb7137035bd.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":465,"sourceBytes":176729,"destBytes":20412,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stretch-glove.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn6@2020_1/2020/11/15/06-18-42-864_ab165fb7137035bd.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/stretchable-sensor.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn17@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-18-44-105_fbb8a584124a1f6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_5/2020/11/15/06-18-53-973_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn14@2020_6/2020/11/15/06-18-43-964_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=-mecCC3iRss:1h8stRIoetc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_2/2020/11/15/06-18-43-970_1bf6612fd7925f2c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/-mecCC3iRss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_3/2020/11/15/06-19-16-952_fd25c2bf3843a327.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605421115524},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:35","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 14:18:35","title":"FDA Clears Most Powerful Clinical MRI","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1501650","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Signa-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1501651\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Signa-7.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Signa-7-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Signa-7-768x540.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>GE Healthcare won FDA clearance for its SIGNA 7.0T MRI scanner, currently the most powerful device available for clinical applications. A high end scanner&#8217;s magnetic field typically tops out at 3 Tesla, but the new device goes all the way up to 7 Tesla to provide an unprecedented look at highly detailed anatomy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly intended for neurological applications, the SIGNA 7.0T should also be useful for imaging of metabolism, function, and of joints that can&#8217;t be properly seen with even a 3 Tesla device. Besides clinical use, the same scanner can just as readily be utilized for research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to raw power, the SIGNA 7.0T features UltraG gradient technology in the whole-body gradient coil, which helps to get the most out of the powerful magnet. This leads to high resolution, speedier scans, advanced diffusion, and functional MRI (fMRI) imaging of the brain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>SIGNAWorks software works with the hardware to apply deep learning applications to image processing, smart slice positioning, and SilentMR imaging. There are also specialized tools for imaging the knee and cartilage, which may help with close monitoring of the joint during disease progression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are thrilled to add SIGNA 7.0T to our portfolio,” said Jie Xue, president and CEO of GE Healthcare MR, in a press release. “This new scanner is a critical tool in research for neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s disease and mild traumatic brain injury. Now clinicians will have access to the power of ultra-high field imaging combined with the ultra-high-performance gradients to translate research advances into new clinical diagnostic tools and potential treatment options.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div
