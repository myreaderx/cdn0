It holds that Xaeen ascended to immortality from the Mithril Throne of Qune in the years leading up to the creation of the great Zorisz Empire. The three heretics built their own churches in the hinterlands of Zorisz and for one at least, the heresy was brought back into the fold a thousand years later as the State religion of Shu-Qune. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen-no-grid.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"14532\" data-permalink=\"https://dysonlogos.blog/2020/10/08/last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen/last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen-no-grid/\" data-orig-file=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen-no-grid.png\" data-orig-size=\"12000,9600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Last Home of the Three Heretics of Xaeen (no grid)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen-no-grid.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen-no-grid.png?w=529\" src=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen-no-grid.png\" alt=\"Last Home of the Three Heretics of Xaeen (no grid)\" class=\"wp-image-14532\" /></a><figcaption>Last Home of the Three Heretics of Xaeen (1200 dpi) (no grid)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But the three grand clerics of the Qune Heresy didn&#8217;t live to see the acceptance of their teachings. Instead they died during the height of the Zorisz Empire and were entombed in the understructures of the Grey Temple in the hills of what is now Dehnuk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The semi-intact ruins of the Grey Temple were rediscovered a couple of hundred years ago, but outside interference from the Disciples of the Qune heresy kept the treasure hunters from finding the catacombs beneath. Now this secret society that spans several of the Xaeen churches quietly maintains the understructures and tries to keep the curious at bay. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/web-last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"14534\" data-permalink=\"https://dysonlogos.blog/2020/10/08/last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen/web-last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen/\" data-orig-file=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/web-last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;1&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Last Home of the Three Heretics of Xaeen (300 dpi promotional &#8211; no commercial license)\" data-image-description=\"&#60;p&#62;Last Home of the Three Heretics of Xaeen (300 dpi promotional &#8211; no commercial license)&#60;/p&#62;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/web-last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/web-last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen.jpg?w=529\" src=\"https://rpgcharacters.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/web-last-home-of-the-three-heretics-of-xaeen.jpg\" alt=\"Last Home of the Three Heretics of Xaeen (300 dpi promotional - no commercial license)\" class=\"wp-image-14534\" /></a><figcaption>Last Home of the Three Heretics of Xaeen (300 dpi promotional &#8211; no commercial license)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The 1200 dpi versions of the map were drawn at a scale of 300 pixels per square and are 12,000 pixels (40 squares) wide.
