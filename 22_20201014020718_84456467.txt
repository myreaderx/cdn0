and then scanning each part into a computer to make a perfect virtual copy of the aircraft, the <a href=\"http://www.military.com/air-force\">Air Force</a> said in a recent release.</p>\n<p>The effort to make a B-1 digital twin — which began in April and will take six years to complete — will help maintainers understand which parts disintegrate fastest given the aircraft's operational wear and tear and how they can be improved.</p>\n<p>\"Through the scanning process, we will discover all the places that saw structural failure or damage. It will create a living medical record for the B-1,\" Lt. Col.

It made the 1,000-mile journey from Arizona to Kansas via flatbed truck for the deconstruction.</p>\n<p>The digital twin will help maintainers expedite results and procedures for other B-1s, Lay said.</p>\n<p>\"We will be able to apply data from aircraft in the field to help us predict areas that are more likely to have structural issues,\" he explained. \"This living virtual model of the B-1's structure will be superimposed with layers of maintenance data, test [and] inspection results, and analysis tools, which can be integrated over the aircraft's life cycle.\"</p>\n<p>Lay added, \"We are also currently developing inspection techniques and repairs for areas on the upper fuselage and sharing that data back with the [manufacturer].\"</p>\n<p>The B-1, originally built by Rockwell, is <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/07/12/start-lanced-the-b-1s-nukes-but-bomber-will-still-get-new-bombs.html\">now a Boeing Co.</a> craft.</p>\n<p>The collected data on the wings and fuselage will give maintainers more understanding of \"fatigue damage in those areas,\" Lay said.</p>\n<p>The B-1 has the ability to climb thousands of feet into the air, <a href=\"https://www.military.com/defensetech/2017/12/26/anatomy-b-1-bomber-training-mission.html\">kick back its wings</a> — thanks to its variable swept-wing design — and dive low, following the Earth like a jet ski skimming water.</p>\n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a71e70d1072901d008b485c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"B-1 bomber at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar\" height=\"825\" width=\"1240\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   A B-1B Lancer takes off from Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, April 8, 2015. \n   <p class=\"copyright\">US Air Force</p> \n  </figcaption> </img>\n</figure>\n<p>However, last year, officials began telling B-1 <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/12/08/aging-b-1-bomber-may-soon-have-restrict-way-it-flies.html\">pilots to cut back on</a> the low-altitude terrain-following capability, known as TERFLW mode, in an effort to preserve the aircraft's structure.</p>\n<p>The B-1 digital twin is just the latest effort to address the bomber's maintenance.</p>\n<p>For example, the Lancer was one of the first aircraft named to the service's predictive maintenance experiment, headed by Air Force Materiel Command.

Over the past year, the airframe has undergone frequent inspections and time compliance technical orders, or TCTOs, which often mandate modifications, comprehensive equipment inspections or installation of new equipment.</p>\n<p>Gen. Tim Ray, the Air Force Global Strike commander, said <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/air-force-b-1-bomber-153653547.html\">last month</a> that the fleet's readiness is improving, and its recovery and maintenance are well ahead of schedule, thanks to concentrated resources and maintenance.</p>\n<p>\"On any given day, I probably can fly well over 20 of the B-1s,\" Ray said, referencing the fleet's mission-capable rate, or the ability to fly at a moment's notice to conduct operations.</p>\n<p>By comparison, <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/08/02/only-handful-air-forces-b-1-bombers-are-ready-deploy.html\">only about seven</a> of the bombers were ready to deploy in August 2019.</p>\n<p><em>— Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:oriana.pawlyk@military.com\">oriana.pawlyk@military.com</a>.

The idea is to package NBCU audiences in different ways and use data to grow NBCU's new shoppable ads, among other things.</li><li>Activist investors. Disney's reorg was pushed by Dan Loeb, who wanted the company to double down on Disney Plus.

class-action lawsuit against the county, lawyers charged that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the nation's largest law enforcement agency, violated the US Constitution by jailing immigrants past their release date, sometimes for months at time, on behalf of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>\n<p>In 2018, a US federal judge ruled that such immigration detainers, or \"ICE holds,\" were essentially arbitrary arrests.</p>\n<p>\"Let this settlement be a wake-up call to all those law enforcement agencies around the country that today continue to jail people unlawfully at ICE's warrantless requests,\" Jennie Pasquarella, director of immigrants' rights at the ACLU of Southern California, said in a statement. \"They should stop or be held liable in damages to all the people they've unlawfully detained.\"</p>\n<p>More than 18,500 people are entitled to compensation of up to $25,000 for having been unlawfully detained between 2010 and 2014 under the reign of former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, who is currently in prison after being convicted of lying to the FBI and obstructing justice.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit was filed in 2012 by Duncan Roy, a British filmmaker who was denied bail over an ICE hold and spent three months in jail, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-13/sheriffs-department-immigration-holds-settlement\">the Los Angeles Times reported</a>.</p>\n<p>As of 2020, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will only detain an immigrant past their release date from jail if ICE obtains a warrant approved by a judge.</p>\n<p>\"This settlement will likely contribute to a growing trend where local jurisdictions are taking appropriate steps to kick ICE out of their prisons, jails, and courthouses,\" Chris Newman, legal director at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said in a statement. \"[I]t is now clear that its coercive practices expose local governments to financial liability.\"</p>\n<p><em>Have a news tip?

<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-california-lawsuit-ruling-classify-drivers-employees-gig-workers-2020-8\">the companies' drivers are employees</a> under the state's gig work law, AB-5.</p><p>Judges from California's first district Court of Appeal pressed lawyers for Uber and Lyft over drivers' wages and autonomy, and questioned the companies' arguments that AB-5 would require them to reduce drivers' flexibility, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/13/uber-lyft-ab5/\">The Washington Post</a>&#160;and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kateconger/status/1316087860781436928\">The New York Times reporter Kate Conger</a>.</p><p>The judges also asked a lawyer for the state about potential harms to Uber and Lyft and drivers' preferences around their employment status, according to reports.</p><p>The landmark case could fundamentally alter the contractor-based business model that Uber and Lyft have relied on, and the companies are aggressively fighting the law in court and via a ballot measure that California voters will decide on in November.</p><p>AB-5, which went into effect at the beginning of this year, allows companies to treat workers as independent contractors instead of employees only if workers <a href=\"https://edd.ca.gov/Payroll_Taxes/ab-5.htm\">meet three criteria</a>: they're \"free from the control and direction\" of the company; they perform work \"outside the usual course\" of the company's business; and they're \"customarily engaged\" in their own independent business.</p><p>California state and city attorneys general <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/california-sues-uber-lyft-alleging-companies-misclassified-workers-as-contractors-2020-5\">sued Uber and Lyft in May</a> over their refusal to comply with the law, arguing that ride-hailing drivers don't pass that test. San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman sided with the state in August, ruling that Uber and Lyft must reclassify drivers as employees, but the ruling was stayed by Schulman and again by the appellate court while the companies appeal.</p><p>In Tuesday's oral arguments, Uber lawyer Theodore Boutrous Jr. argued the ruling would cause \"irreparable harm\" and that \"Uber would have to turn into a different company\" and cut jobs if the ruling is upheld, The Washington Post reported.</p><p>But according to Conger, Judge Brown questioned Uber on that claim, asking what part of AB-5 would require the company to reduce drivers' flexibility.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-ab5-fight-reveals-dependence-full-time-drivers-2020-8\">Uber and Lyft have focused heavily on flexibility</a> in their opposition to the law, citing drivers' alleged preference to work as contractors, but critics of the business model say it allows the companies to cut costs by depriving drivers of protections like minimum wage, health insurance, and unemployment insurance that other California workers are entitled to.&#160;</p><p>Matthew Goldberg, a lawyer from the San Francisco city attorney's office, responded to a question about drivers' preferences by saying \"employees should not have the right to work without those underlying benefits. ... You are not permitted to work for less than the minimum wage, even if you want to.\"</p><p>When pressed by the judges on potential harms to Uber and Lyft, Goldberg responded that every other company follows the law and so Uber and Lyft should have to as well, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kateconger/status/1316087860781436928?s=20\">The New York Times' Kate Conger tweeted</a>. He also said Uber and Lyft were causing harm to drivers: \"This is dollars and wages and money that is being stolen from drivers by virtue of the misclassification.\"</p><p>Uber and Lyft have repeatedly claimed that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/16/20868916/uber-ab5-argument-legal-experts-california\">the law doesn't apply to them</a> in the first place — an argument Lyft lawyer Rohit Singla brought up again Tuesday, while Boutrous cited changes Uber has made to its app that should exempt its drivers, according to The Washington Post.</p><p>But the judges appeared skeptical, Conger reported, pointing out that Uber still sets the base fare for drivers.</p><p>They also cast doubt on Lyft's claim that underpayment of drivers' wages isn't irreparable harm, according to The Washington Post, with one asking: \"Are you suggesting that the specter of thousands of individual claims for back wages is something that is insignificant and something that need not be considered in balancing the appropriateness of an injunction at this point?\"</p><p>California's Labor Commission brought a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-sued-again-in-california-over-driver-classification-2020-8\">separate lawsuit against Uber and Lyft</a> over the same issue in August, alleging they've been committing wage theft by classifying drivers as contractors.</p><p>Uber and Lyft have sought to head off a potential loss in court by <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-proposition-22-california-gig-workers-uber-lyft-2020-8#:~:text=Proposition%2022%20is%20a%20November,classify%20their%20drivers%20as%20employees.&text=Uber%2C%20Lyft%2C%20and%20DoorDash%20have,million%20to%20support%20the%20measure.ure.\">pouring more than $180 million</a> into a ballot measure, Proposition 22, that would exempt ride-hail and food delivery workers from AB-5. That's <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)\">the most money</a> ever used to back a ballot measure in the state, according to Ballotpedia.</p><p>Uber and Lyft also came under fire earlier this week after <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Fake-progressive-mailers-urge-yes-on-Uber-Lyft-15635173.php\">SF Gate</a> reported that the companies indirectly funded ballot guides sent to California voters urging them to vote for Proposition 22 by falsely claiming to be affiliated with Sen. Bernie Sanders and other \"progressive\" groups.</p><p>Both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1315650084567121920?s=20\">Sen.

Would be a big WIN for the USA!\"</p><p>That tweet was published on September 27, a day after Trump announced Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court.</p><p>Barrett has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-scotus-eliminating-obamacare-will-be-a-big-win-barrett-2020-9\">previously voiced criticism of the Affordable Care Act</a>.</p><p>In 2017, Barrett slammed Chief Justice John Roberts, who in 2012 joined the Supreme Court's four liberal-leaning justices in a vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act, saying he \"pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.\"</p><p>At the time, <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2330&context=law_faculty_scholarshipship\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"7b6cf345c95dbe262167ef0414696fe9\">Barrett said of Justice Roberts:</a>&#160;\"He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did — as a penalty — he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\"&#160;</p><p>Much of the consternation around Barrett's nomination to the court stems from concerns that the deeply conservative judge could be the deciding vote that strikes down the Affordable Care Act, potentially disenfranchising untold numbers of Americans who benefit from its protections for those with preexisting medical conditions.</p><p>Trump has been vocal about his disdain for the healthcare law signed by his predecessor, the former President Barack Obama, and has frequently promised that Republicans would deliver an alternative.</p><p>Nearly four years into his first term as president, Trump has not yet revealed what that alternative might be.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

And, this <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-day-best-deals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Amazon Prime Day 2020</a>, the company is offering up to 24% off its routers.</p><p>During Amazon Prime Day 2020, Amazon is selling the Gryphon&#160;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Z3PTJP?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Tower</a> for $190 and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082YGNKJH?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Guardian</a> router for $80. Both routers are currently $20 less than the usual going rate, and both are currently down to the lowest we've seen on Amazon.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The difference between the two routers is size and power. If you have a smaller house – less than 1800 square feet – the low-profile Guardian should be all you need. On the other hand, if you have a larger home or want more oomph, the Tower covers up to 3,000 square feet, has tri-band WiFi, and can handle a faster throughput (AC3000). The Guardian is dual-band and has a 1.2 Gbps throughput (AC1200).&#160;</p><p>But, what if your home is larger than 3,000 square feet? <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Z3PTJP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078Z3PTJP&linkId=24cc2300db76b09ecd2c5e9f2e7fd1f7db76b09ecd2c5e9f2e7fd1f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Gryphon</a> has you covered. Each unit can be used as a mesh WiFi extender. For instance, I live in a 4,000-square-foot house, and I have a Gryphon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078Z3PTJP?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Guardian</a> router on each of its three floors, which has rendered my house dead spot-free. If I wanted to, I could seamlessly link the Tower routers in with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082YGNKJH?tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1=1&#38;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Guardian</a> routers for even better coverage.</p><p>The highlight of the Gryphon routers is the app. You can use it to increase the security of your network, control your children's internet usage, and perform a number of other tasks from anywhere using your mobile device.</p><p>And, you can try <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Z3PTJP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B078Z3PTJP&linkId=24cc2300db76b09ecd2c5e9f2e7fd1f7db76b09ecd2c5e9f2e7fd1f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Gryphon</a> risk-free with its 90-day money-back guarantee.</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5f63c01abe509c2e6201be93\" style=\"position:relative;

Last July, Mueller testified before the House Judiciary Committee and suggested that Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice once he leaves office.</p><p>Trump was impeached in December 2019 for obstruction of Congress and abuse of power, but the GOP-controlled Senate acquitted him in February. His impeachment was in relation to a scandal with Ukraine and his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, as well as a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine — not the Kremlin — interfered in the 2016 election.&#160;</p><p>The president has also faced consistent scrutiny over his financial dealings, particularly over his refusal to release his tax returns, and the Manhattan district attorney's office recently stated it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/nyregion/donald-trump-taxes-cyrus-vance.html\">may have grounds to investigate Trump and his businesses for tax fraud.</a></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/barrett-wont-say-presidents-should-commit-peaceful-transfer-of-power-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/TZUJmgBEcYI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 22:49:19 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f862838fd1f49001964d743?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"ab05e803d8c269a8c857ddaa387ba0b2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn16@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-02-507_414eac207ecff525.webp","destWidth":1777,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":87876,"destBytes":87876,"author":"insider@insider.com (John Haltiwanger)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f86283091aa9e001880b7bc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn44@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-15-065_8a5ca9b45b23dcfe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn96@2020_3/2020/10/14/02-07-15-578_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn51@2020_2/2020/10/14/02-07-02-948_3ace56745020555a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/14/02-07-10-524_76ee648c5483fdd5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn12@2020_5/2020/10/14/02-07-09-684_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=TZUJmgBEcYI:Th0ViZTaNLY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn56@2020_4/2020/10/14/02-07-14-222_1c0cabb99ded2c07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/TZUJmgBEcYI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn27@2020_6/2020/10/14/02-07-12-939_f60f7e4d39c9f831.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602641206133},{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:46","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 10:06:46","title":"The best Prime Day deals under $25 — just in time for early stocking stuffer prep","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-under-25-dollars-2020","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>When you buy through our links, we may earn money from our affiliate partners. <a href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f84a11ac255d800190b95fd?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Amazon Prime Day 2020 Deals under $25 4x3\" height=\"1251\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon;

First, <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1\">enter the value you're looking for</a>. It can be anything from a name, number, or cell location. In this example, we'll look for pop-singer Lizzo's Instagram followers — so we would enter \"Lizzo\" into the text box. The function is case sensitive, so enter the data carefully.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ddc21acfd9db22dc97a4519?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to do vlookup in Excel\" height=\"1590\" width=\"2880\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Enter the fields into the formula builder on the right.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Meira Gebel/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>8. </strong>Now you will enter where Excel should search for the data — this can be two or more columns, creating a range on the lookup table. Remember: VLOOKUP searches for data vertically, so be sure to enter the column letter followed by the row number. For this example, we want to search through all the data, encompassing all fields on the worksheet, so we'll enter \"A2:B16.\"&#160;</p><p><strong>9. </strong>Next, Excel wants you to enter the \"<a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1\">column number in the range</a> that contains the return value\" — this data point should be where you want the data to come from. In our example, Instagram followers are represented in column B, so we would enter the numerical value of B, which is two (it's the second column).</p><p><strong>10. </strong>Finally, enter whether you want the results to be approximate (TRUE) or exact (FALSE). We want our results to be spot on so we will write FALSE. All together our formula looks like this: =VLOOKUP(\"Lizzo\",A2:B16,2,FALSE).&#160;</p><p><strong>11. </strong>Select \"Done\" at the bottom of the formula window.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ddc21d4fd9db22f914813d7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"How to do vlookup in Excel\" height=\"1600\" width=\"2878\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Select &#34;Done&#34; once you&#39;ve filled all necessary fields.

(We're guessing you've probably heard of <a href=\"https://theragun.xibx.net/c/196318/617418/10041?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theragun.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Fpro-us.html%3F&subid2=1602539909790b55fbi59gi59g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Theragun</a>). They're lightweight, powerful, and easy to use. And while <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/best-massage-guns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our favorite massage guns</a> will set you back $200-$600 upfront, the device can pay for itself over time.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Massage guns work by pounding your muscles at a rate of up to 4,000 times per minute. The depth of the stroke (called a percussion) and the amount of force determines how powerful the device feels. If you're muscular and looking for a hard massage, you'll want to find a massage gun with a higher stroke rate, more percussions per minute, and more force. For more sensitive people, you'll want a lighter-duty massager.&#160;</p><p>There's no shortage of Prime Day massage gun deals — at last count there were <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=massage+gun&i=prime-day&ref=nb_sb_noss_1&tag=biip_101320_amazon-prime-day-2020-20-day-2020-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">177 models on sale</a> for the event.
