Electrochemical performance tests of LiMnO 2\r\n@rGO and LiMnO 2 cathodes exhibited that after graphene oxide was loaded, the discharge capacity and\r\ncycling performance were greatly improved, the maximum discharge capacity reached 185.6 mAh g −1 at\r\nthe current density of 100 mA g −1 with retention capacity higher than 80% even after 100 cycles\r\nbetween 2 and 4.5 V vs. Li + /Li, which is much better than most previous reports (table S1). The\r\nprinciples of the corresponding phenomenon were fully explained by the low electron conductivity,\r\nhigh structural stability and...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":2302,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7486aa6b0274e5749ef70d1b03ad074a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Yulan Tian, Yunzhong Qiu, Zhifang Liu, Xianwen Wei and Huaqiang Cao","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602540190440}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 06:03:10","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 06:03:10","feedId":2302,"fetchDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 22:03:10 +0000","fetchMs":27242,"handleMs":7,"totalMs":27257,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"4b117c0f3b7eed13bb1169338088aa32","hostName":"us-023*","requestId":"8d4134f840c844b28f0a2f4025716cc6_2302","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 21:31:39","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:03:35","id":2302,"name":"Nanotechnology - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/0957-4484/?rss=1","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn20@2020_5/2020/09/01/02-03-34-747_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Nanotechnology","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602540163190,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":27243,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":7,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
