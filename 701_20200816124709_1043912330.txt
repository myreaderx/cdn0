Not only did she dive into learning a new country and culture, but also she decided to take on a whole new career. “It was a time where I had no regulations,” she says. “I could do whatever I wanted.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>To her, the timing couldn’t have been better. She needed to find work in her new city of Dublin and saw that programming, with all its job openings, would be the perfect way to engage her passion for building and creating new things. There was only one catch: She first needed to learn how to code.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Seeking both personal and professional development in Dublin, Henna started searching for opportunities that allowed her to learn code with others in a classroom setting. That instinct helped her find a program to study Android offered by <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/google\">Udacity and Grow with Google</a>. Henna applied, and heard back after a few weeks. She got a full scholarship.</p>\n  <p>As she started to attend more classes and meet more people, she noticed that many of her new friends belonged to different <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/community/gdg\">Google Developer Groups</a> (GDG). These groups are independently run communities, guided by Google, that bring local developers with similar interests in technology together. So in the same spirit that led her to move from India to Ireland, a curious Henna immediately called the organizer of <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Dublin/\">GDG Dublin</a>, the Google Developer Group that was closest to her. After hearing Henna’s story on learning Android from scratch, the organizer invited Henna to give a talk about her journey to the group.</p>\n  <p>Henna started her presentation to an excited crowd, but was struck by an overwhelming sense of stage fright. So the GDG Dublin community quickly sprung to action. Filled with Google mentors, experts and local thought leaders, the group offered Henna advice from their own experience as public speakers. “They told me to slow down and take a breath. They told me I could do it,” Henna says. “I felt like I had such huge support. That moment helped me find my confidence moving forward.” She pushed ahead, and nailed her presentation. She knew she found her developer family, and later helped the group organize events.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Empowered by the expertise and warm family support she received during her first talk, Henna realized that public speaking, even when it goes all wrong, is not that scary. She soon signed up to give a global talk at <a href=\"http://devfest.withgoogle.com\">DevFest</a> Dublin 2018, and then went on to seek out more leadership roles in her own local developer community.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>All of these experiences, paired with the Google mentorship and technical education content she received, helped Henna eventually land a full-time role as a Technical Services Engineer. In her free time, she is also a Community Organizer for <a href=\"http://womentechmakers.com\">Google’s Women Techmakers</a>, where she helps connect local companies to women in development. And, of course, she is still a dedicated member of her GDG Dublin family.</p>\n  <p>Want to join a Google Developer Group near you?&nbsp; Learn more about how to get involved virtually or in person, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/community/gdg\">on our website</a>.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":701,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/P1255586.MOV.14_59_41_19.Still001.max-1300x1300.png","linkMd5":"d5f44f670993f6d334c5ff7db64128f8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-46-12-561_39bc97497bc5fd5b.webp","metaImg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/P1255586.MOV.14_59_41_19.Still001.max-1300x1300.png","destWidth":1300,"destHeight":731,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EuropeanPublicPolicyBlog/~4/NuhMriAookI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn92@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-46-13-188_dc372f9fe9e340fa.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","title":"Protecting Europe’s workers: The urgent need for skills","link":"https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/protecting-europes-workers-the-urgent-need-for-skills/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>In recent years, new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics have helped companies increase efficiency and productivity and become more competitive on the global stage. But with these technological advances come challenges for governments and employers: in the short term, technology can fundamentally change the way people work, and in the long term it can displace some jobs altogether. With the additional upheaval of jobs markets as a result of the pandemic, it’s imperative that skills programs are targeted at those most at risk of displacement.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Governments around the world, including the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_940\">European Commission</a>, are gearing up for these challenges and initiating programs to re-train their workforces. Over many years, Google has sought to play its part by building products that help European businesses grow and helping over <a href=\"https://grow.google/intl/europe/impact\">seven&nbsp;million people</a>&nbsp;all over Europe learn new digital skills.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>How will the future work?</b></p>\n  <p>We recently collaborated with the McKinsey Global Institute on <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-in-europe\">new research</a> looking at the impact of automation on jobs in almost 1,100 regional labor markets in Europe over the next ten years. The research estimates that, even accounting for expected job losses, Europe may still have a shortage of workers rather than a shortage of jobs in 2030. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the research suggested that the shortfall could be as high as 6 million workers, although that may now be lower. To put it another way, automation in Europe is not the threat to jobs that some people fear.</p>\n  <p>However, these opportunities are not spread equally across Europe, and there’s a clear gap between the requirements of these future jobs and the skills people currently have. Some jobs will be lost, and people will need new skills to succeed in new types of work. Alongside this, COVID-19 is also having a major impact, accelerating trends that we expected to see over a longer period of time.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Unlike most prior research about the future of work, which was conducted at a national level, this report puts regions front and centre. Towns like Mannheim and Montpellier, or Dobrich and Douro, are more similar to each other than they are to the rest of their own countries, when it comes to the impact of automation. You can see those similarities clearly in this <a href=\"http://grow.google/intl/europe/future-of-work-map\">interactive map</a> that we launched today.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <a href=\"http://grow.google/intl/europe/future-of-work-map\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-10 at 21.04.06.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2020-06-10_at_21.04.06.max-1000x1000.png\" /></a>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><a href=\"http://grow.google/intl/europe/future-of-work-map\">The map</a> is a companion to the McKinsey Global Institute report, showing the types of jobs that will be growing and declining across Europe’s diverse regions over the next ten years. It’s also a clear illustration of the importance of tailoring skills and training programs to the needs and opportunities of individual European regions, sectors and communities.</p>\n  <p><b>What’s next?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>That’s certainly been our <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/building-the-workforce-of-the-future\">experience</a>: we’ve seen that training is only successful if you open it up to everyone, and especially to those most at risk of job displacement, who too often don’t have the opportunity or means to learn new skills, and may live in lower-growth regions.&nbsp;That’s why we’ve developed partnerships with experts to help reach underserved groups, including working with organisations to<a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/googleorg-helps-nesta-bring-skills-training-trade-unions/\">reach trade unions and workers in the transport and logistics</a> sector, developing programs to help<a href=\"https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalworkshop-eu/course/self-promotion/module/183\">women build confidence in their leadership skills</a>, and funding nonprofits to provide critical services for<a href=\"https://www.youthbusiness.org/news/covid-19-rapid-response-and-recovery-programme-launch\">underserved small businesses</a>.</p>\n  <p>The jobs market turmoil caused by the pandemic has made reskilling even more urgent. During the first few weeks of lockdown, we saw a 300 percent increase in the number of people taking our free <a href=\"https://grow.google/intl/europe/programmes\">Grow with Google</a> training courses. Significantly, McKinsey Global Institute conducted its research shortly before the COVID-19 crisis began, but analysis of more recent data shows a significant overlap between the jobs at risk in the next ten years and <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/safeguarding-europes-livelihoods-mitigating-the-employment-impact-of-covid-19\">those at risk now</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Every day, we work with European entrepreneurs and businesses to help them grow. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we’ve increased our support by providing <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/commitment-support-small-businesses-and-crisis-response-covid-19/\">funding</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/meet/bringing-google-meet-to-more-people/\">tools</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/100-million-dollar-contribution-covid-19-relief/\">programs</a> to help workers and businesses recover faster from the crisis, and help people stay safe, informed and connected. Along with increasing private investment from companies like ours, we call on governments to create the right environments to help citizens learn the skills that are required for the jobs of the future. It’s up to all of us—governments, companies and citizens—to make sure all European regions thrive and the benefits of automation reach everyone.</p>\n  <p>============</p>\n  <p>Below are some of the key findings from the research and you can read <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-in-europe\">McKinsey’s full report here</a>.</p>\n  <p><b>Reskilling is paramount</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>More than 90 million workers may need to develop significant new skills within their&nbsp;current roles, while up to 21 million may have to leave declining occupations.</li>\n   <li>Automation will affect sectors and occupations differently, with office work, manufacturing, agriculture and construction presenting some of the highest displacement rates.&nbsp;</li>\n   <li>Europe may still have a shortage of workers rather than a shortage of jobs in 2030, with growth predicted in healthcare, STEM-related sectors and creative and arts industries. So while tech aptitude is an asset, it’s not everything: Europeans will spend 30 percent more time doing work related to social and emotional skills.&nbsp;</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><b>The impact on labour markets will vary across countries and regions</b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Our research revealed 13 types of regional clusters across Europe. From superstar hubs that drive change and attract worldwide talent to regions supported by public investment, these profiles reveal the continent in a new light.&nbsp;</li>\n   <li>High-tech jobs will be a major growth area: jobs in science and engineering will grow by 40 percent in megacities like London and Paris, 35 percent in superstar hubs like Geneva and Stockholm, and 30 percent in service-based economies like Manchester and Budapest.&nbsp;</li>\n   <li>Even before the crisis, remote work has grown steadily since 2007: around 19 percent of German and 14 percent of French workers sometimes or usually work from home. However, this growth has been concentrated in urban areas, and not in the declining regions that don’t have enough jobs.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>Read the full report on <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-in-europe\">McKinsey’s site here</a> and <a href=\"https://grow.google/intl/europe/future-of-work-map\">visit our interactive map</a>.

But these events are happening at a time when the news industry is also being challenged financially. We care deeply about providing access to information and supporting the publishers who report on these important topics.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Today, we are announcing a licensing program to pay publishers for high-quality content for a new news experience launching later this year. This program will help participating publishers monetize their content through an enhanced storytelling experience that lets people go deeper into more complex stories, stay informed and be exposed to a world of different issues and interests. We will start with publishers in a number of countries around the globe, with more to come soon.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n  <p>This endeavor will diversify our support for news businesses today, building on the value we already provide through Search and our ongoing efforts with the <a href=\"https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/\">Google News Initiative</a> to help journalism thrive in the digital age. While we’ve previously funded high-quality content, this program is a significant step forward in how we will support the creation of this kind of journalism. To start, we have signed partnerships with local and national publications in Germany, Australia and Brazil.<br /></p>\n  <p>Our publisher partners, who we’ve been in discussions with for several months, say this is a positive shift in direction. \"We are always keen to explore innovative ways to attract readers to our high-quality content,” says Stefan Ottlitz, managing director of Germany’s <a href=\"https://www.spiegelgruppe.de/\">SPIEGEL Group</a>. “This interesting new partnership with Google will allow us to curate an experience that will bring our award-winning editorial voice into play, broaden our outreach and provide trusted news in a compelling way across Google products.”<br /></p>\n  <p>Where available, Google will also offer to pay for free access for users to read paywalled articles on a publisher’s site. This will let paywalled publishers grow their audiences and open an opportunity for people to read content they might not ordinarily see.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>\n  <p>Being able to grow their audience for important local content is what motivated Paul Hamra, Managing Director and publisher of Australian news titles including <a href=\"https://inqld.com.au/\">InQueensland</a> and<a href=\"https://indaily.com.au/\">InDaily</a> in South Australia to take part. \"With local news under stress, finding new channels and new audiences for our premium content, in safe and curated environments, is a high priority,” he says. “This opportunity will give us access to new markets and provide additional commercial benefits.”<br /></p>\n  <p>We have been actively working with our publisher partners on this new product which will launch first on Google News and Discover. We are currently engaged in discussions with many more partners and plan to sign more in the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>\n  <p>Geraldo Teixeira da Costa Neto, CEO of the Brazilian regional media company <a href=\"http://www.diariosassociados.com.br/home/\">Diarios Associados</a>, says they are proud to get involved: “From our side, we will do everything in our power to make this platform prosper and to be a compass for society to seek information from a safe and reliable source in times of challenges,” he says.<br /></p>\n  <p>In the last few months, COVID-19 has created new and unimagined pressures on the news industry, affecting everything from the creation of quality journalism to the continuation of traditional business models.

It’s a story of hard power turning into soft power: In the year 1000, the monarch decided everything. They had all the power and the resources to enforce it. Now, monarchy is a very soft power—we send the queen to whatever country we’re trying to get a good trade deal with, for example.<br /></p>\n     <p>I’ve done 27 of them now. Number 28&nbsp; is King Christian X, who is portrayed on a horse. That played a very big symbolic role for the country: After the First World War, southern Denmark was finally reunited with the rest of the country, and he rode over the former border as a symbolic gesture. Then in World War II, when Denmark was occupied by the Germans, he rode his horse around Copenhagen every morning at 10:00 as a reminder of Danish sovereignty. I’ll have him ready by July 10th the 100th anniversary of the reunification of Denmark.<br /></p>\n     <p><b>So before this you’d never crocheted anything?</b></p>\n     <p>No, I just taught myself from the Star Wars book. Since then, I’ve realized that there’s a major crochet community online, and people are very helpful whenever I ask questions. For example, right now I’m at great pains trying to figure out whether King Christian will be attached to his horse or not, and how to even make the horse in the first place, and I’m getting tons of very good advice.</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \">\n    <img alt=\"Christine with Queen margrethe 2.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Christine_with_Queen_margrethe_2.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>Christine poses with her crocheted Queen Margrethe II</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-small \">\n     <img alt=\"Chat with Helle Thorning.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Chat_with_Helle_Thorning.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n     <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n      <div class=\"rich-text\">\n       <p>Former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Christine's crocheted Queen Margrethe I</p>\n      </div>\n     </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <p><b>Has this project had any unexpected effects on your work?</b><br /></p>\n     <p>A lot of my job involves talking to journalists and politicians, and many of them will check in on how the crocheting is going—there’s always a nice conversation to be had if you’re stuck waiting around with someone.

For example, I brought together Denmark’s first woman prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and my crocheted Queen Margrethe I for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3g0Mg0nLhH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">a “chat”</a> about what it was like to be the first woman in each of their roles.</p>\n     <p><b>What are your plans for your collection when you’re done?</b></p>\n     <p>My moonshot is to get an exhibition at the National Museum of Denmark—stay tuned!

I travel a lot all over Northern Europe for work—or at least I used to—which means not only do I have time to crochet while I’m on a plane, but I can also bring the kings and queens to the places associated with them.

That space between us was a no-man’s land where neither of us knew of any parks or nature reserves or anywhere that would be suitable for two energetic toddlers. So I used Google Maps to find the rough halfway point. Then I filtered by “Attractions” (you can also choose “Parks” or “Restaurants” or other categories) to see what came up. I quickly landed on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Weald+Country+Park/@51.6253265,0.2608318,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x466d8c86a72be4df!8m2!3d51.6253265!4d0.2608318\">Weald Country Park</a>, which boasts a 4.5-star rating, almost a thousand reviews and a promising description: “Fallow deer, a visitor center &amp; hiking.”</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-small \">\n     <img alt=\"Screenshot of reviews of Weald Country Park.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screenshot_20200728-145432.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n     <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n      <div class=\"rich-text\">\n       <p><br /></p>\n      </div>\n     </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <h3>Read the reviews</h3>\n     <p>Deer-watching had the potential to keep toddlers occupied for at least one minute. A visitor center indicated parking and bathrooms. And hiking probably meant that picnicking was easily an option. But to double-check these critical questions, I relied on the kindness of strangers who had posted recent reviews and ratings. Local Guides and other people who contribute to Google Maps are very helpful in offering information about how much they liked (or didn’t like) their trip, and many of them have the same topics on their mind that I do. Since you can sort reviews by date, it was easy to see the most relevant ones—i.e., those that have been filed since lockdown lifted—for current info on toilets (yes), parking (yes, but it’s expensive), and whether the playgrounds have reopened (yes, very recently).&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-small \">\n     <img alt=\"screenshot of photos from Weald Country Park.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screenshot_20200728-145528.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n     <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n      <div class=\"rich-text\">\n       <p><br /></p>\n      </div>\n     </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <h3>Browse the photos and Street View</h3>\n     <p>To really get a feel for a place, sometimes there’s no replacement for a photo.

But she recently became the author of a new bestselling novel.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Called <i>Maria</i>, it’s about two women who share the name. One of them chooses her family over everything else, only to find that she’s sacrificed and given away so much of herself that there’s nothing left of her own personality. The other Maria puts her career before everything and, in her determination to become a successful business leader, also loses herself.</p>\n  <p>“It’s about self help and personal development—this is fiction as a format for helping build your career,” Malou says. Typical career advice books—and there are plenty already—can be dry and detached. “I wanted to drive an experiment to see if you can get different emotions in people by putting this type of advice into fiction,” she says.</p>\n  <p>We (virtually) sat down with her to learn how her literary pursuits complement her day job—and vice versa.</p>\n  <p><b>How do you explain your job at a dinner party?</b></p>\n  <p>I’m responsible for all of Google’s business in Denmark, all the amazing things we’re doing with <a href=\"https://grow.google/intl/europe/\">Grow with Google</a>, and helping build small businesses.&nbsp;And I also work with many industries here in Denmark.</p>\n  <p><b>Your career has taken some strange detours—what are some of those?</b></p>\n  <p>The red thread has been that I’ve spent more than 20 years in tech at Microsoft, IBM and now Google. But along the way I also spent four years as a Member of Parliament in Denmark, representing the then-leading liberal party.</p>\n  <p>The idea of a political career started after I’d been on an international assignment in the U.S. for a few years. I got back to Denmark and thought, compared to the U.S., there was a standstill in our innovation agenda. As a business leader I could make recommendations, but what I really wanted was to take leadership and ownership. After I helped craft some policy reforms for the party, they asked if I’d be interested in running for office. And from there it was a wild and rewarding experience.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-medium \">\n     <img alt=\"cover of malou aamund's book maria\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_20200204_193249.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <p><b>What made you decide to write&nbsp;<i>Maria</i>?</b></p>\n     <p>It started 10 years ago. I was 15 years into my career, and was constantly seeing the same patterns when I was mentoring younger women. They felt there was a big personal cost for them to pursue their career dreams. It was disproportionate compared to how men felt at the same point in their own careers. I saw these amazingly talented women struggle with lower self confidence than men. I could see that in terms of how often women asked for a raise—they lacked the confidence to go in and demand what they deserved.</p>\n     <p>So I had the idea of creating a story where you had these two opposite personalities—one person who’s thinking so much about other people’s needs that she forgets herself, and the other who’s self-centered and opportunistic. They follow the same life pattern, but react very differently at life-changing moments. I wanted to empower women to have an emotional response to the story and think about how they would actually react.</p>\n     <p><b>Is it based on real people?</b></p>\n     <p>Not really, but based on a lot of observations throughout my career, along with data and research that I’ve read. We now have so many insights into the fact that women have lower self esteem and how that unfolds in their career. It’s the same research that we focus on in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iamremarkable.withgoogle.com/\">the #IamRemarkable initiative</a>, a Google program to build self confidence in women. It’s becoming an amazing movement, a life-changing moment for women to go through.</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>What’s been the response to the book?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>I’ve been touring universities and leading career and book discussions. The most positive thing is that I’m seeing so many younger women embrace it, and really resonate with the characters’ problems and emotions.</p>\n  <p>There have also been a lot of parents who read the book first, and then give it to their adult children. As parents we all want to impart some values, and help our kids not make the same mistakes that we have. Here, parents can actually give moral advice in a fictional format.</p>\n  <p><b>Will <i>Maria</i> be translated into any other languages?</b></p>\n  <p>The publisher had planned to bring it to the London Book Fair, which is now cancelled due to COVID-19. But they are actively working on bringing it to other countries and languages.</p>\n  <p><b>Who has been a strong female influence in your life?</b></p>\n  <p>One of the highest ranking female executives in IBM was my mentor when I was pregnant with my second daughter. She asked me to join her team when I was six months pregnant, and showed a very courageous and progressive view on female talent, and took a personal bet on me. She is still a great support and a good friend.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>What advice do you have for women starting out in their careers?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>Choose the right partner. I have many girlfriends whose careers are not as highly prioritized as their partners’. Then, when they decide to pursue their career aspirations, it all of a sudden becomes a choice between their job and their marriage. Fortunately, there are many supportive spouses, but you need to discuss your dreams and aspirations up front to set the right expectations.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 09:00:00 +0000","feedId":701,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_20200204_193249.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"72c3555c3dd9d9b84e6c44b2083d97a3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-46-12-080_9329b31fd7c17393.webp","destWidth":995,"destHeight":1000,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/IMG_20200204_193249.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-46-13-629_9329b31fd7c17393.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EuropeanPublicPolicyBlog/~4/MVmDniuuDxw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn87@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-46-11-970_7f3041b9135eda06.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","title":"On World Art Day, try out this activity for the whole family","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/world-art-day-try-out-activity-whole-family/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>We could all use a little inspiration these days.

With nonessential businesses forced to close, public gatherings banned, and most people required to stay at home, these regulations instantly transformed daily life. They also presented a serious threat to Katie Wignall’s business: Katie makes her living as a tour guide, showing curious visitors the highlights of London.</p>\n  <p>But instead of trying to simply wait out the crisis, Katie looked to technology for a solution to creatively keep her business going.

I’m a <a href=\"https://www.itg.org.uk/about/how-to-become-a-tourist-guide/\">Blue Badge Tourist Guide</a>, which is the top accreditation for tourist guides in the UK. We do two years of training, pass 11 exams, and we’re the only guides that can take you inside the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey.</p>\n     <p>Look Up London started originally as a <a href=\"https://lookup.london/blog/\">blog</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/look_uplondon/\">social media channels</a>, where I shared quirkier bits of London history. The name is all about spotting the little details in the architecture around you, to tell the story of why something looks the way it does. For example, on Oxford Street, which is famous for its shopping, there's a building decorated with sculptures of beavers. They're a clue to the fact it used to be a hat factory—slightly gruesome, but a detail that is so often missed by passersby!</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>How has your business been impacted by COVID-19 and the government restrictions?</b></p>\n  <p>I’ve had to shut down, basically.

If I couldn’t go outside, I could offer people the next best thing, through a screen. I was already using Street View a lot for my work—it’s really good for my research. I love the feature where you can go back in time. It’s not possible for every location, but for a lot of central London, you can select a place in Google Maps for desktop, drag the Street View pegman into the picture and click on the clock in the top left corner to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvH3rtFMa9o\">explore imagery from the past</a>. You can see where buildings have been demolished and what used to be standing where.</p>So now, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 2 PM London time, I use Street View to give a virtual tour on Instagram Live. And for anyone who can’t make that time, I post the recordings \n     <a href=\"https://lookup.london/live/\">on my website</a>. They’re all free, and if people enjoy them, they can make a donation.\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>What’s been the response?</b></p>\n  <p>People have been so lovely. From the comments, I think it’s been very helpful for people in lockdown, who maybe are older and can’t get out of the house as often, or people who’ve had to leave London and are feeling homesick. Lots have messaged me to say it’s made them feel like they’ve been outside. They’ve really learned something new and taken their minds off the situation for twenty minutes or so.</p>\n  <p><b>Any advantages to using Street View compared to being there in person?</b></p>\n  <p>The great thing about Street View is that you can hop about—you can jump a mile down the road and people don’t have to get on a bus or actually walk, so you can cover a lot of ground.</p>\n  <p>And then there’s that feature to go back in time and see things how they appeared years ago, back to 2008. On a normal tour, you can show pictures and give people an idea, but if people are on Street View and feel like they’re standing in a space and seeing the changes right there, it’s a different experience.</p>\n  <p>One example, on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=252299472479782\">my Aldgate tour</a>, is a garden space that has been relandscaped. The garden looks beautiful now, but three years ago you could see the cobbles of Victorian London. And those cobbles happen to have been the site of the murder of Catherine Eddowes, who was a victim of Jack the Ripper. That was an evocative thing to be able to show.</p>\n  <p><b>Any advice for other small business owners who are trying to figure out how to adapt right now?</b></p>\n  <p>I think you have to do the thing that you enjoy doing. I don’t think I’d be able to do these three times a week if I didn’t enjoy them. If you have something that you want to share, there’s no reason you shouldn’t do that. Technology has made everything so accessible, and if you care about something, chances are others care about that as well.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 09:00:00 +0000","feedId":701,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Beavers_on_Oxford_Street.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"a69271097f463ce40e8ce86d6b380933","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn96@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-46-12-069_ed50bc57b6901687.webp","destWidth":755,"destHeight":1000,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Beavers_on_Oxford_Street.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-46-12-343_ed50bc57b6901687.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Photo_27-03-2020_17_47_30.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-46-12-171_1b5ee4d5d5271d13.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EuropeanPublicPolicyBlog/~4/SS4xtGzpp8Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-46-12-953_760b8ac0e1a0cdb3.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","title":"New training programs for European and Israeli startups","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/entrepreneurs/new-training-programs-european-and-israeli-startups/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Starting a successful company is a difficult job for anyone.

Much has changed since then due to COVID-19, but one thing hasn’t—our commitment to the potential of partnership with Europe on AI, especially to <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/free-public-datasets-for-covid19\">tackle the pandemic</a> and help people and the economy recover.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>As part of that effort, we earlier today filed our <a href=\"https://blog.google/documents/77/Googles_submission_to_EC_AI_consultation_1.pdf\">response</a> to the European Commission’s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/white-paper-artificial-intelligence-european-approach-excellence-and-trust\">Consultation on Artificial Intelligence</a>, giving our feedback on the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf\">Commission’s initial proposal</a> for how to regulate and accelerate the adoption of AI.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><b>Excellence, skills, trust</b></p> \n  <p>Our filing applauds the Commission’s focus on building out the European “ecosystem of excellence.” European universities already boast renowned leaders in dozens of areas of AI research—Google partners with some of them via our machine learning research hubs in Zurich, Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris and London—and many of their students go on to make important contributions to European businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>We support the Commission’s plans to help businesses develop the AI skills they need to thrive in the new digital economy. Next month, we’ll contribute to those efforts by extending our <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/grow-with-google/machine-learning-checkup-italy/\">machine learning check-up tool</a> to 11 European countries to help small businesses implement AI and grow their businesses. Google Cloud already <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/customers/#/regions=Europe%2C_Middle_East_%26_Africa&amp;products=Machine_Learning\">works closely</a> with scores of businesses across Europe to help them innovate using AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>We also support the Commission’s goal of building a framework for AI innovation that will create trust and guide ethical development and use of this widely applicable technology. We appreciate the Commission's proportionate, risk-based approach. It’s important that AI applications in sensitive fields—such as medicine or transportation—are held to the appropriate standards.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>Based on our experience working with AI, we also offered a couple of suggestions for making future regulation more effective. We want to be a helpful and engaged partner to policymakers, and we have provided more details in our formal <a href=\"https://blog.google/documents/77/Googles_submission_to_EC_AI_consultation_1.pdf\">response to the consultation</a>.</p> \n  <p><b>Definition of high-risk AI applications</b></p> \n  <p>AI has a broad range of current and future applications, including some that involve significant benefits and risks.&nbsp; We think any future regulation would benefit from a more carefully nuanced definition of “high-risk” applications of AI. We agree that some uses warrant extra scrutiny and safeguards to address genuine and complex challenges around safety, fairness, explainability, accountability, and human interactions.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><b>Assessment of AI applications</b></p> \n  <p>When thinking about how to assess high-risk AI applications, it's important to strike a balance. While AI won’t always be perfect, it has great potential to help us improve over the performance of existing systems and processes. But the development process for AI must give people confidence that the AI system they’re using is reliable and safe. That’s especially true for applications like new medical diagnostic techniques, which potentially allow skilled medical practitioners to offer more accurate diagnoses, earlier interventions, and better patient outcomes. But the requirements need to be proportionate to the risk, and shouldn’t unduly limit innovation, adoption, and impact.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>This is not an easy needle to thread. The Commission’s proposal suggests “ex ante” assessment of AI applications (i.e., upfront assessment, based on forecasted rather than actual use cases). Our contribution recommends having established due diligence and regulatory review processes expand to include the assessment of AI applications. This would avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts and likely speed up implementation.</p> \n  <p>For the (probably) rare instances when high-risk applications of AI are not obviously covered by existing regulations, we would encourage clear guidance on the “due diligence” criteria companies should use in their development processes. This would enable robust upfront self-assessment and documentation of any risks and their mitigations, and could also include further scrutiny after launch.</p> \n  <p>This approach would give European citizens confidence about the trustworthiness of AI applications, while also fostering innovation across the region. And it would encourage companies—especially smaller ones—to launch a range of valuable new services.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p><b>Principles and process</b></p> \n  <p>Responsible development of AI presents new challenges and critical questions for all of us. In 2018 we published our own <a href=\"https://ai.google/principles/\">AI Principles</a> to help guide our ethical development and use of AI, and also established internal review processes to help us avoid bias, test rigorously for safety, design with privacy top of mind.&nbsp; Our principles also specify <a href=\"https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/\">areas</a> where we will not design or deploy AI, such as to support mass surveillance or violate human rights. Look out for an update on our work around these principles in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p> \n  <p>AI is an important part of Google’s business and our aspirations for the future. We share a common goal with policymakers—a desire to build trust in AI through responsible innovation and thoughtful regulation, so that European citizens can safely enjoy the full social and economic benefits of AI. We hope that our contribution to the consultation is useful, and we look forward to participating in the discussion in coming months.</p> \n </div> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 28 May 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":701,"bgimg":"https://blog.google/static/blogv2/images/google-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"3d13ebb0e6880938ff135bde7e495922","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-46-12-064_6e554fa84199a90c.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.google/static/blogv2/images/google-1000x1000.png","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1000,"author":""},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","title":"Explore 250 years of the Royal Academy of Arts","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/explore-250-years-royal-academy-arts/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>London’s <a href=\"http://g.co/meetthera\">Royal Academy of Arts</a>(RA) has been championing artists and architects for more than 250 years, and—pandemic or not—isn’t stopping now.

Mette Jakobsen, Digital Learning Program Manager for schools in Aarhus, Denmark, and Stu Blackmore, Director of IT and Digital Learning at the <a href=\"https://www.bisstockholm.se/\">British International School of Stockholm</a>, have been leading their schools’ efforts to support the well-being of their educators as they juggle distance learning, and we’ve asked them to share the ideas that they’ve put in practice at their schools.</p>\n  <p><b>Educators are adapting their teaching to help students adjust to distance learning. How can we help educators adjust to this new world?</b></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><b>Mette:</b><b></b>We need to encourage educators to reframe their expectations for themselves and their work. In Arhaus, the head of our schools has reassured educators by saying, “You don’t have to give students a thousand lessons right now. Just try to find your way… and think about the kids at home, as well as their parents.” This is an important message for educators—to be patient with themselves and make smart decisions about when and how to scale back on classwork, like avoiding assigning too much homework to students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>Now that homes are workplaces, it’s challenging for educators to know when to stop working. How can educators set boundaries?</b><br /></p>\n  <p><b>Stu:</b><b></b>To maintain my own sanity, I don’t work on weekends. And my school day is structured: I work a long, full day, and then I’m done. We need to say to educators, “Decide when you’ll work, and when you won’t work—and create that separation.” It’s important that they have the down time they deserve, whether it’s making time for a virtual coffee break with a fellow peer or just blocking off personal time on their calendars to recharge.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n  <p><b>How are you supporting educators who are new to distance learning?</b><br /></p>\n  <p><b>Mette:</b>Typically, educators in Arhaus receive technology training through professional development workshops, or simply by visiting each other’s classrooms. Though these options are no longer available, this type of support is still important, and we are encouraging educators to create spaces online to continue sharing and learning. In Aarhus, we set up an educator-led daily Google Meet session, where anyone can drop in and ask for tech help. Our digital learning team also created a<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/aaks.dk/digital-undervisning/start?authuser=0\">website</a> (Danish only) with Google Sites for sharing tips about distance learning—such as advice for running a lesson on Google Meet.<br /></p>\n  <p><b>How are educators at your school staying connected these days?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br /></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><b>Stu:</b>My natural inclination is to laugh in the face of adversity—it relieves the pressure of what is a very stressful time. Our librarian has started a blog where educators can submit funny stories about their experiences with distance learning, or memes and GIFs that can put smiles on faces—and ultimately remind each other that they are not alone. The librarian is even thinking of asking educators to create short “day in the life” videos for posting on the blog—with a friendly competition for the best one.</p>\n  <p><i>If you’re looking for more ideas to support educators during this time, check out <a href=\"https://teachfromhome.google/intl/en/\">Teach from Home</a>, a central hub of information, tips, training and tools from across Google for Education to help educators keep teaching, even when they aren’t in the classroom.</i></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":701,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/1046-GDU-Teacher_Support_Header-ER-2-01-01.max-1300x1300.jpg","linkMd5":"ebe684a52a2e6086c769c4a2f653165d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-46-12-278_b4584cc02be85987.webp","metaImg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/1046-GDU-Teacher_Support_Header-ER-2-01-01.max-1300x1300.jpg","destWidth":1300,"destHeight":541,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EuropeanPublicPolicyBlog/~4/KASbv-SLSJk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn68@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-46-12-964_486b799774262442.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","title":"How AI could predict sight-threatening eye conditions","link":"https://blog.google/technology/health/predicting-sight-threatening-eye-condition/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the biggest cause of sight loss in the UK and USA and is the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/blindness/causes/priority/en/index7.html\">third largest cause of blindness</a> across the globe. The latest research collaboration between Google Health, DeepMind and Moorfields Eye Hospital is <a href=\"https://rdcu.be/b4fgc\">published in Nature Medicine today</a>.&nbsp;It shows that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to not only <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/moorfields-major-milestone\">spot the presence</a> of AMD in scans, but also predict the disease’s progression.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Vision loss and wet AMD</h3>\n  <p>Around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/condition/age-related-macular-degeneration-amd\">75 percent of patients&nbsp;</a>with AMD have an early form called “dry” AMD that usually has relatively mild impact on vision. A minority of patients, however, develop the more sight-threatening form of AMD called exudative, or “wet” AMD. This condition affects around 15 percent of patients, and occurs when abnormal blood vessels develop underneath the retina. These vessels can leak fluid, which can cause permanent loss of central vision if not treated early enough.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, causing &quot;blind spots&quot; directly ahead\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/pasted_image_0_3_pfGXV4M.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>Macular degeneration mainly affects central vision, causing \"blind spots\" directly ahead (<a href=\"https://www.macularsociety.org/whats-it-like\">Macular Society</a>).</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Wet AMD often affects one eye first, so patients become heavily reliant upon their unaffected eye to maintain their normal day-to-day living. Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30097785\">20 percent of these patients</a>will go on to develop wet AMD in their other eye within two years. The condition often develops suddenly but further vision loss can be slowed with treatments if wet AMD is recognized early enough. Ophthalmologists regularly monitor their patients for signs of wet AMD using 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the retina.</p>\n  <p>The period before wet AMD develops is a critical window for preventive treatment, which is why we set out to build a system that could predict whether a patient with wet AMD in one eye will go on to develop the condition in their second eye. This is a novel clinical challenge, since it’s not a task that is routinely performed.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>How AI could predict the development of wet AMD</h3>\n  <p>In collaboration with colleagues at DeepMind and Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, we’ve developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model that has the potential to predict whether a patient will develop wet AMD within six months. In the future, this system could potentially help doctors plan studies of earlier intervention, as well as contribute more broadly to clinical understanding of the disease and disease progression.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>We trained and tested our model using a retrospective, anonymized dataset of 2,795 patients. These patients had been diagnosed with wet AMD in one of their eyes, and were attending one of seven clinical sites for regular OCT imaging and treatment. For each patient, our researchers worked with retinal experts to review all prior scans for each eye and determine the scan when wet AMD was first evident. In collaboration with our colleagues at DeepMind we developed an AI system composed of two deep convolutional neural networks, one taking the raw 3D scan as input and the other, built on our <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/moorfields-major-milestone\">previous work</a>, taking a segmentation map outlining the types of tissue present in the retina. Our prediction system used the raw scan and tissue segmentations to estimate a patient’s risk of progressing to wet AMD within the next six months.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>To test the system, we presented the model with a single, de-identified scan and asked it to predict whether there were any signs that indicated the patient would develop wet AMD in the following six months. We also asked six clinical experts—three retinal specialists and three optometrists, each with at least ten years’ experience—to do the same. Predicting the possibility of a patient developing wet AMD is not a task that is usually performed in clinical practice so this is the first time, to our knowledge, that experts have been assessed on this ability.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>While clinical experts performed better than chance alone, there was substantial variability between their assessments. Our system performed as well as, and in certain cases better than, these clinicians in predicting wet AMD progression. This highlights its potential use for informing studies in the future to assess or help develop treatments to prevent wet AMD progression.</p>\n  <p>Future work could address several limitations of our research. The sample was representative of practice at multiple sites of the world’s largest eye hospital, but more work is needed to understand the model performance in different demographics and clinical settings. Such work should also understand the impact of unstudied factors—such as additional imaging tests—that might be important for prediction, but were beyond the scope of this work.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>What’s next&nbsp;</h3>\n  <p>These findings demonstrate the potential for AI to help improve understanding of disease progression and predict the future risk of patients developing sight-threatening conditions. This, in turn, could help doctors study preventive treatments.</p>\n  <p>This is the latest stage in our partnership with Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, a long-standing relationship that transitioned from DeepMind to <a href=\"https://www.moorfields.nhs.uk/news/next-phase-moorfields-work-google-health\">Google Health</a> in September 2019. Our previous collaborations include using AI to quickly <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0107-6\">detect eye conditions</a>, and showing how Google Cloud AutoML might eventually help clinicians without prior technical experience to accurately <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(19)30108-6/fulltext\">detect common diseases</a> from medical images.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>This is early research, rather than a product that could be implemented in routine clinical practice. Any future product would need to go through rigorous prospective clinical trials and regulatory approvals before it could be used as a tool for doctors. This work joins a growing body of research in the area of developing predictive models that could inform clinical research and trials. In line with this, Moorfields will be making the dataset available through the <a href=\"https://rimr.doheny.org/\">Ryan Initiative for Macular Research</a>. We hope that models like ours will be able to support this area of work to improve patient outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 18 May 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":701,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/pasted_image_0_3_pfGXV4M.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"ff88bbb91546ef04df50a30ac8f79065","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-46-12-077_22eecf3e3eb8de88.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":750,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/pasted_image_0_3_pfGXV4M.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn12@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-46-12-447_22eecf3e3eb8de88.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EuropeanPublicPolicyBlog/~4/XQUsG30wjE4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-46-13-145_f2e347434c351f12.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:46:11","title":"Free tools and training to help with economic recovery in Europe, the Middle East and Africa","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/grow-with-google/free-tools-and-training-help-economic-recovery-europe-middle-east-and-africa/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Through lockdown, many of us found that online tools have been a real lifeline.

To find out more about “do it” visit g.co/doitaroundtheworld or discover more on <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/\">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a>—or download our free app for <a
