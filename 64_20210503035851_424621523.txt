Part convenience, part laziness, takeout gives some much-needed variety with the monotony of cooking every meal during the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/covid-19/\">pandemic</a>. With this surge in popularity, Forest &#38; Whale, a multidisciplinary design practice that focuses on products, circular systems, and future envisioning, hope to combat single-use plastic&#8217;s harmful impact on the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/category/sustainable-design/\">environment</a> with Reuse, a single-use food container that can either be composted in cities with available corresponding facilities or eaten.</p>\n<p>Gustavo Maggio and Wendy Chua co-founded Forest &#38; Whale as a means to explore the world of design and its relationship with the environment, along with our own human behavior and living experiences. Made from wheat husk for its base and PHA for the lid, Reuse serves as a fully compostable food container that not only amplifies our experience consuming takeout food but creates a conversation around our high-consumption habits and the negative effect they have on our environment. Wheat husk and PHA, a bacteria-based composite that works like a natural plastic derived from organic materials, can both be composted as food waste, without additional industrial-level composting facilities. The usability of Reuse hinges on its simple decomposition and accessible construction processes, appeals for large cities and small towns alike to adopt this form of containing takeout food. Similar to the paper straw revolution we&#8217;ve seen come to fruition almost overnight, the takeout industry could quickly adapt to swapping out their plastic containers for biodegradable and compostable ones like Reuse.</p>\n<p>While single-use plastic containers are convenient and quick to get rid of, they leave a startling impact on the environment. Accounting for their low-recyclability rate, plastic takeout containers stick around for ages, running off into waterways and polluting the oceans, spreading toxins to wildlife, releasing harmful chemicals and gases into the air we breathe, and generally disrupting our waste management systems. Maggio and Chua of Forest &#38; Whale designed Reuse to take some of the pressure off our planetary responsibility and health. With hopes of entirely replacing single-use plastic containers with compostable and edible takeout bins, Reuse marks the initial steps towards a worthwhile goal.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a

Rather than adding extra components to house the helmet, the concept design makes it a part of the bike frame. The motorbike&#8217;s build keeps the aesthetics to the bare minimum since a single-track bike has its limitations concerning adding more weight. Remember, balanced weight distribution is crucial to the electric bike&#8217;s purpose of safely hauling the rider from one destination to another.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Vojta&#8217;s design places the engine at the rear, near the wheels, creating the hollow space to hook on the helmet. The overall footprint of the City E-Bike remains very minimal, and it has got the looks to kill.

Stowe, Vermont, a town known for its ski slopes and trails, is the Vermont Cabin. Built by Olson Kundig, the Vermont Cabin is a compact little home for a family that has owned property in this snowy region for generations. Occupying a humble space of 750-square-foot, Kundig designed the Vermont Cabin, keeping in mind that &#8220;The client brief called for a small, straightforward family cabin in the tradition of the Vermont cabins they grew up with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Surrounded by white pines and maples, the intimate home has been divided into three levels. The lowest level is settled comfortably within the site, and contains a garage that also doubles up as a fun game room! A single bedroom and a powder room are also included in this level. The middle storey consists of the main entry, two small bedrooms, and a bathroom. Whereas, the topmost level is essentially one large living area. This upper level provides panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, such as the Green Mountains to the west, and the Worcester Range to the east. A steel and maple hardwood staircase connects all three levels. Both inside and outside the cabin, durable materials were used, which were in turn left in their raw state! The unfinished work can be seen in the weathering steel external siding and the exposed timber ceilings, which create an intriguing effect. The entire cabin has been built using simple and raw materials, that subtly draw inspiration from the unfettered wilderness surrounding the site. This is exemplified by the poured and cast concrete elements present in the kitchen and the bathrooms, as well as the extensive use of steel and wood in the construction of the cabin.</p>\n<p>Kundig&#8217;s goal was to create &#8220;a very special place that took inspiration from the landscape&#8221;. And which he did quite successfully! The Vermont Cabin is a humble and economical abode with a raw essence and straightforward execution. It radiates warmth and homeliness in the otherwise cold and chilly landscape of Stowe.

href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/work-from-home/\">Work from home</a> is now the new norm! Although it can get boring at times. I mean your home is now your office, your office is now your home. You basically eat, sleep, work, and repeat the same old activities in the same old place. I&#8217;m always looking for little ways to brighten up my mundane workday! And I&#8217;ve come to find that a few innovative <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/stationery/\">stationery designs</a> can add that extra sparkle to your everyday work routine. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I always feel a rush of excitement before I use a new stationery product! Not only do these crafty designs excite you, but they can truly amp up your work from home productivity. Even the littlest of tasks are completed with more efficiency. So, we&#8217;ve curated some nifty stationery designs that we believe will truly be a valuable addition to your work from home desk. Be sure to invest in them!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/05/this-2-in-1-sustainably-designed-compass-is-an-all-rounder/03-compass_yankodesign.jpg\" /><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/05/this-2-in-1-sustainably-designed-compass-is-an-all-rounder/05-compass_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/05/05/this-compass-protractor-stationery-redesign-reduces-eye-and-hand-strain-while-measuring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CARBU</a> is a compass and a protractor – so if you are a student or a designer, you know exactly how convenient it is to have tools that serve more than one purpose. The user can make multiple circles without measuring the distance of the opening of the legs with a ruler. The slim legs of the compass on the inside are clogged with discs that are integrated with low-power magnets for smooth movements. The compass has a 2 disc system for accuracy – the inner one disc shows the measurement in a 0.2cm interval and this is amplified with a second disc that magnifies it for ease of viewing. The inner transparent case has two options – you can measure with degrees (for angles and arcs) and also without degrees for simpler things. The second transparent case that has a magnifying glass shows the distance between the two legs of the compass precisely. The discs also tell you if you are in compass mode or protractor mode.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/sorry-post-it-we-are-moving-onto-digital-sticky-notes/01-ouverture_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/sorry-post-it-we-are-moving-onto-digital-sticky-notes/03-ouverture_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Designer Jeong Woo Kim created <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/09/17/sorry-post-it-notes-we-are-moving-onto-digital-sticky-notes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ouverture</a> – a conceptual keyboard accessory that is a number pad + a digital notepad when you flip the cover. It has a typing mode which is the number pad and a memo mode which is the writing pad. “The leather cover acts as a number pad on a conventional keyboard. Current from the fingertips passes through the special conductive fiber to the touchpad inside the leather cover,” explains Kim. A quick survey showed that 98% of people take notes when they are working on computers and 70% of them said it is uncomfortable and 34% complained that their desk tends to get messy or notes tend to get lost. With a device like Ouverture, your notes are saved as image files and your desk remains clutter-free.</p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/this-tiny-inkless-pen-is-made-from-a-special-metal-alloy-that-can-literally-write-forever/foreverpen_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/this-tiny-inkless-pen-is-made-from-a-special-metal-alloy-that-can-literally-write-forever/foreverpen_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">This pen is quite literally timeless… in the sense that it will write forever, that too without a single drop of ink. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/04/27/this-tiny-inkless-pen-is-made-from-a-special-metal-alloy-that-can-literally-write-forever/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The ForeverPen</a> is a bit of a technological marvel that solves one of the most common problems in the world – needing to write but never find a pen around. Made from a unique silver composite, the ForeverPen writes without actually writing. Unlike a pen that leaves behind ink or a pencil that leaves behind graphite, the ForeverPen’s unique material can oxidize surfaces, leaving behind a mark without really wearing out or running out. In theory (and even practically), it lasts forever, letting you draw/write/doodle anytime or anywhere, infinitely.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/stationery-ds/stationery_ds_yanko_design-01.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/stationery-ds/stationery_ds_yanko_design-03.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The Constrained Ball by <a href=\"https://www.gihawoo.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gihawoo Design</a> is one of those concepts I can easily see myself buying from a late-night infomercial. I’m not saying it’s bad but the novel approach to a simple kind of problem is endearing. Fitted with a gasket, the gadget helps you draw straight lines and indicates the length. OMG, is this the end of the ruler’s dominance?!? No, but I quite like this concept. I’m a stickler for drawing straight lines. It’s either gotta be straight and perfect or it’s a no-go for me.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-313695\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/work-from-home-stationery-designs-ds/wfh_stationery_ds_yanko_design-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-313696\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/work-from-home-stationery-designs-ds/wfh_stationery_ds_yanko_design-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>This is a jellyfish that stings gently! We love stationery design and especially cute ones inspired by animals! Designed by Fabio Verdelli, Medusa is a jellyfish-shaped push pin that moves like the actual jellyfish when pushed into the board. this one is gentler. The designer has made this push pin soft and translucent just like the real ones in the ocean. It’s also slightly colored to give it a fluid visual effect. The CMF and the simple movement of the pin work together to make Medusa a functional yet realistic ode to the marine marvel. Who wouldn’t like to have a box of these!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/Ferrule_pencil_holder_that_will_extend.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/this-brass-holder-upgrades-your-average-wooden-pencil-into-immaculate-high-end-stationery/Ferrule_pencil_holder_that_will_extend_01.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Meet <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/04/15/this-brass-holder-upgrades-your-average-wooden-pencil-into-immaculate-high-end-stationery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Ferrule</a>, probably the most significant improvement to wooden pencils since they started putting erasers on the opposite end. The Ferrule is a brass pencil enclosure and extender. It upgrades the feeling of using a tiny, frail wooden pencil by enclosing it in a hexagonal brass body that gives you confident strokes, thanks to its weight, and a much more premium writing and drawing experience. The Ferrule works with all standard pencils (7-8mm in width) up to 120mm in length. Designed to function as a high-end pencil sleeve, the Ferrule works with short pencil stubs too, giving you a consistent premium writing experience throughout. It opens and closes with simple twisting action, allowing you to lock or release the pencil within with a satisfying click.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/this-miniature-whiteboard-lets-you-effectively-brainstorm-while-you-work-from-home/reusable_finger_sized_mini_whiteboard.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/032/730/359/10588752ebc737704aeb08d615e6d083_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1615709418&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=6ac648bed41fbd31521394a9a9d41014\" width=\"1050&#34;\" /></p>\n<p>Reusable like a whiteboard, portable and sticky like a Post-it, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/04/12/this-miniature-whiteboard-lets-you-effectively-brainstorm-while-you-work-from-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Mover Erase</a> brings one of the workplace’s most effective features to your WFH setup. You see, in our transition from the office to the home office, we missed out on quite a lot. Sure, there’s an obvious lack of workplace gossip and office chit-chat, but we’re also missing out on the kind of tools that make us more productive. The ability to stick notes around our work desk, to walk up to a whiteboard, and really brainstorm effectively. To streamline your process in a way that makes you more productive and organized. The Mover Erase turns the whiteboard into a portable setup that you can carry around with you because productivity shouldn’t be limited to a ‘place’.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/these-objects-merge-outside-inside-world-into-a-new-visual-haptic-functional-design/1-outsideinside_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/these-objects-merge-outside-inside-world-into-a-new-visual-haptic-functional-design/8-outsideinside_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/07/these-objects-merge-outside-inside-world-into-a-new-visual-haptic-functional-design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Outside/Inside</a> was created to question the traditional understanding of a “vessel” and reimagine it with materials like pine needles to not only add more function but also give it a refreshing form. “What do you understand as a ‘vessel’? What image comes to mind if I tell you to describe it? Now, how far can you stretch that image? How far is too far?” asked the duo as they worked on reinterpreting the meaning through their design. Just like wild grass, it looks like the ‘vessel’ is growing from the surface it is kept on. What I love is the usage of pine needles because it is an underrated and under-explored natural material. Pine needles also bring a touch of nature inside on your shelf or desk. It also adds a poetic theme to the design as its colors, smell, and texture change over time letting you experience the ‘seasons’ of Outside/Inside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/draft-clip-pen/clip_pen_gihawoo_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/draft-clip-pen/clip_pen_gihawoo_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/05/this-pen-and-paper-clip-hybrid-is-such-a-smart-way-of-keeping-your-stationery-and-sheets-together/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Clip-Pen</a> by Foxtail Gihawoo combines the traditional ballpoint pen with the even-more-traditional paper clip. The metal clip finds itself located on the pen-cap, where you’d normally see the cap’s pocket clip, creating a fusion that may seem weirdly clever at first, until weirdness wears right off and just feels like a good idea! The Clip-Pen retains its original functionality (of being able to be clipped to a pocket) but is capable of much more. You could use it to keep your pen and papers together, or just use the cap to hold your sheets while the ballpoint pen sits in your pen-stand.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/this-magnetic-modular-organizer-is-the-productivity-booster-your-portable-setup-needs/MagEasy_modular_magnetic_organizing_kit_10.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/682/853/c4c4790ca59c5023faad81ef1e20423f_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1586491315&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=4e36eac7de6c3b83cb96e189295de90c\" width=\"1050&#34;/\" /></p>\n<p>Created by LHiDS Creative, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/06/03/this-magnetic-modular-organizer-is-the-productivity-booster-your-portable-setup-needs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the MagEasy Folio and MagEasy Board</a> use a combination of powerful magnets to help keep you organized and productive.

/></p>\n<p>There was a point in time when only DSLRs reigned supreme, when it came to clicking photographs, however, people are slowly veering towards their smartphone cameras as well! Most of us today choose our smartphones based on the camera itself! Our smartphone camera is easier to use, more accessible, and always patiently waiting for us in our pockets or purses. Whether you love clicking selfies, portrait photos, snippets of your favorite meals, or even capturing your travels &#8211; the camera of your smartphone can cater to all your needs. And we&#8217;ve curated a collection of accessories that promise to function as the perfect sidekick to your smartphone camera. This bunch of accessories will elevate the functionality and usability of your smartphone camera, giving your pictures that extra professional edge and boost!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/auto-draft/lens_shawn_wang_iphone_photography_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/12/auto-draft/lens_shawn_wang_iphone_photography_3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/31/these-smartphone-camera-lenses-bridge-the-gap-between-your-iphone-and-dslr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The +Lens modular system</a> by Shawn Wang relies on empowering the primary camera with add-on lenses – much like the way you snap lenses onto your DSLR. Unlike most smartphone camera lenses, Wang’s +Lens system is both exhaustive and powerful. The system consists of four add-on lenses that come in a nice, AirPods-case-shaped box along with a holder that lets them snap right onto your iPhone. These lenses, apart from augmenting your iPhone’s photographic abilities, come with their own focus rings, giving you precise control over how you capture the world around you. Wide-angle, Fish-eye, Telephoto, and Macro lenses give you the versatility of a DLSR in the convenient portability of an iPhone, and the +Lens holder even features a slot to add modules like an external flash.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/magsafe-compatible-iphone-12-cases-and-mounts/Moment-for-iPhone-12-MagSafe-accessories_8.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/magsafe-compatible-iphone-12-cases-and-mounts/Moment-for-iPhone-12-MagSafe-accessories-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">For photography addicts, Moment has a lineup of <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/11/03/iphone-12-magsafe-compatible-accessories-by-moment-takes-your-smartphone-photography-to-the-pro-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tripod Mounts</a> that have a very strong magnetic system for extra strength. These mounts work even without the case and are compatible with ¼-inch to 20-inch tripods, so you are good to go with any tripod. Of them all, the Multi-Threaded Mount that comes at a price tag of $30 is the most intriguing. It can attach your iPhone to anything, as Moment themselves say, “Magic arms, tripods, rig mounts, ball heads, you name it… we let you mount your phone to it with magnets.” Along the same lines, Moment Cold Shoe Mount, Car Vent Mount, and the Wall Mount for MagSafe work like a charm. The first two cost $30 each while the Wall Mount will set you back $20. All of them are fully compatible with the new Apple phones and well worth the money spent.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271626/01-ShiftCam-ProGrip_smartphone-photography_accessories.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271626/01-ShiftCam-ProGrip_smartphone-photography_accessories2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/06/29/the-shiftcam-progrip-turns-any-smartphone-into-a-full-fledged-professional-dslr-camera\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ShiftCam ProGrip</a> comes with a universal gripping mechanism that allows you to clip any smartphone onto it and turn it into a pro-shooter. It features a Bluetooth shutter button that’s perfectly positioned so that you can click images with your index finger, and a grip that’s so inviting, you’re more likely to focus on photography rather than accidentally dropping your phone (it’s a real concern, believe me). The grip comes with a swivel joint that allows you to flip the phone over into portrait mode while you’re holding it in landscape, giving you varying degrees of freedom and the ability to shoot in a way that’s comfortable to you. Now that we’ve covered the basic stuff, let’s get to why the ShiftCam ProGrip stands out from brands like Pictar or Moment when it comes to providing the best DSLR-like experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/10/Lookstand_pocket_sized_phone_and_tablet_stand.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/711/921/aeb2c00301111325cc37b2b589afe326_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1600848284&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=bae1947ea16705b3719ebf9893e43e1a\" width=\"1050&#34;\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/10/07/meet-the-smallest-slimmest-3-in-1-tripod-stand-to-ever-attach-to-your-smartphone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The LOOKSTAND</a> adheres to the back of your device using a slim plastic mount that sticks on with 3M adhesive. Designed to work universally with smartphones as well as with tablets, the LOOKSTAND weighs between 1.6 to 2.9 ounces (depending on the size variant you pick) and can easily support devices as heavy as 28 ounces. Its AL6061 Aluminum Alloy construction makes it robust yet deceptively light and thin, and the stand comes with a 360° hinge that lets you rotate and tilt your phone/tablet in landscape, portrait, or even in any intermediary angle. Fold the tripod’s legs back into LOOKSTAND and it turns into a selfie stick that you can use to make dynamic videos or take group photos where everyone’s in the frame. A third mode allows you to use the LOOKSTAND as a regular kickstand, allowing it to prop your tablet or phone up like a standing photo frame.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2018/09/auto-draft/olloclip_multi_device_clip_1.jpg\" alt=\"olloclip_multi_device_clip_1\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2018/09/auto-draft/olloclip_multi_device_clip_2.jpg\" alt=\"olloclip_multi_device_clip_2\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Olloclip is easily considered one of the vanguards of iPhone photography. Its lenses for the iPhone have resulted in some marvelous pictures that have made it to the ‘Shot on iPhone’ billboards we see around us. Olloclip announced that it finally intends on losing its title of “iPhone Only” with the launch of <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2018/09/05/olloclips-superior-lenses-will-now-work-on-all-smartphones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Olloclip Multi-Device Clip</a>. The Multi-Device Clip is an attach-on device that easily clamps onto any phone, and acts as a dock for Olloclip’s incredible lenses. Giving you the ability to own and use Olloclip’s readily available lenses, the Multi-Device Clip enhances your phone camera’s capturing ability by quite literally broadening its horizons with the wide-angle lenses and fisheye lenses, and focusing on the minute details with their Macro Lens. Superior smartphone photography just got democratized!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2018/05/gnarbox_ssd_layout.jpg\" alt=\"gnarbox_ssd_layout\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/743/984/f1a36bdbc2a612006c6bc685269617e0_original.gif?w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1522620230&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=8c95c6b53d7bdfeb1cd42d3c6412e870\" width=\"1050&#34;\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Last year we called <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2018/05/30/the-blackbox-that-lets-you-edit-4k-videos-on-your-phone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the GNARBOX</a> “Filmmaking’s biggest innovation yet“because it refined a filmmaker’s post-production process so drastically and so efficiently, you could call it textbook groundbreaking. Like, being able to edit RAW images and 4K video on your smartphone groundbreaking. The GNARBOX would store all your captured data on its disk in its original format, letting you access files from a smartphone or tablet app, sorting, editing, and creating content within the GNARBOX… from your handheld device. It would cut down the time taken in the creative process by days or even months because you’d previously need to capture data on-site and then travel back to your studio to sort through and edit files on your desktop back in your studio. The GNARBOX 2.0 is a refinement of that groundbreaking outlook. A 1TB SSD that’s literally the size of your phone, the GNARBOX 2.0 stores and secures all your content from phones to drones, to action cameras and heavy-duty photography and videography equipment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271626/02-Bigsofti_smartphone-photography_accessories.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271626/02-Bigsofti_smartphone-photography_accessories2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Al Morrow &#38; VERT Design’s <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/07/21/this-mobile-soft-light-gives-a-professional-upgrade-to-your-smartphone-photos-and-videos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BIGSOFTI</a> comes with a universal clip that fits all leading smartphone, tablet, and laptop brands.

The set includes macro, anamorphic, telephoto, fisheye, and wide-angle lenses — lenses that you’d find in a professional photographer’s bag. Additionally, there are four SANDMARC filters to help enhance your photo’s beauty — replacing the need for Instagram or Snapchat filters. Aesthetically, the SANDMARC lenses give users the look and feel of operating a traditional digital camera. Users can experience the satisfying sensation of rotating a lens to fine-tune the camera’s focus — a small joy that amateur photographers (like me) can attest to. More importantly, the SANDMARC attachments work almost as well as professional photography equipment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/02/leica_photo_printer_layout.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/02/leica_photo_printer_01.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Hypothetically this could be <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/02/26/the-leica-photo-printer-revives-my-love-for-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a Leica branded printer concept</a>, but I’m going to keep that aside for now and focus on this clever idea and its potential. Instant printers are not a new phenomenon, so what makes this Photo Printer different? The prospect of it directly connecting to your phone, acting as a battery backup and a printing machine. I could go a step further and say that it even serves as a memory backup for all the wonderful moments you capture through your phone, but for some odd reason, I feel it shouldn’t have this feature. In my mind, it takes away the charm of printing instantly and that being the only evidence of the magic you created. Back in the days, it worked well – of course, you had a negative film that you could take more prints from. In this digital age, I think the phone’s memory will suffice.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271626/04-Pantone-Color-Match-Card_smartphone-photography_accessories.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/271626/04-Pantone-Color-Match-Card_smartphone-photography_accessories2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Meet the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/07/01/pantones-15-rainbow-card-turns-your-smartphone-camera-into-a-highly-accurate-color-picker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Color Match Card</a>… an innocuous-looking card with a grid of colored swatches and a hollow cutout in the middle. All you do is place the card on an object whose color you want to scan and point your camera at it. The Pantone Connect app does the rest, automatically analyzing the color within the hollow cutout and giving you matching Pantone color values that you can either document or save within the Pantone Connect app or even send directly to a palette that you can access using Adobe’s suite of creative tools. The tech behind the Color Match card is pretty simple. The colorful swatches (and the tracking markers around it) help the Pantone app calibrate the way it captures colors, allowing you to accurately grab hues in all sorts of lighting conditions with great accuracy.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/yankodesign?a=AYhKZKEtNMQ:ia5C8mdGmfw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img

Just like your seatbelt and the airbag, a windshield wiper keeps you safe by clearing your vision while you&#8217;re driving in inclement weather. However, seatbelts and airbags have very strict design guidelines and performance specifications&#8230; the windshield wiper doesn&#8217;t. It plays a crucial role in enhancing driver visibility in the rain, but it&#8217;s perhaps the weakest link in your car, and chances are that it almost never gets repaired or replaced when it needs to be.</p>\n<p>While the issue with the windshield wiper is more of a systemic problem, the KIMBLADE NANO has a design and material solution. With 4 years of experience and a pretty successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2018 (and even being referred to as the &#8216;Dyson&#8217; of windshield wipers), the team behind the KIMBLADE NANO has developed the most effective, efficient, and everlasting wiper design. It uses revolutionary materials and a tried and tested design to create a wiper that&#8217;s more durable and much better at keeping your windshield crystal clear during precipitation.</p>\n<p>The highlight of the KIMBLADE NANO is its use of CNT (Carbon Nano Tubes) in the wiper blades. The blades themselves are made of silicon, but sport a thin layer of CNT at their tip that allows the wiper to clean the glass with sheer perfection and minimal degradation over time. The silicone and CNT blades last MUCH longer than traditional rubber blades do, and they sport a rectangular edge that&#8217;s much more efficient at picking up and sweeping water away from the glass windshield. The rectangular edge is perhaps the most important bit of innovation in the KIMBLADE NANO. Unlike other wipers that use a squeegee-style flat surface, the KIMBLADE NANO&#8217;s rectangular edge makes a more precise edge-contact with the windshield. In doing so, it doesn&#8217;t spread or relocate the water the way other wipers do, it completely wipes it out of the way, giving you a clean pane of glass. The rectangular profile of the KIMBLADE NANO even allows it to change directions as your wiper moves back and forth, moving smoothly as opposed to some wipers that end up creating that unpleasant rubbery noise as they drag against the glass surface like fingernails on a chalkboard.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, not only do the blades efficiently wipe water away from the glass, they even coat the glass with a hydrophobic layer, allowing it to repel water even when the wipers aren&#8217;t moving. This process helps preserve the life of the wiper, because water drops don&#8217;t dry up on the glass, leaving hard water stains or dirt behind. This keeps the glass clean at all times and the wiper blades too, allowing them to last for years as opposed to rubber blades that give up within just the first month or two of the monsoons.</p>\n<p>The KIMBLADE NANO is designed to be compatible with a wide host of cars, and their model selection tool makes it incredibly easy to find the right wiper for your car&#8217;s brand and make. Each KIMBLADE NANO even comes with a set of cleaner and treatment wet-wipes that help remove fine contaminants and fill in any cavities or scratches, making the glass as good as new. These wipes help increase the transparency of your windshield and preserve the quality of your KIMBLADE NANO over time. However, in the event that some debris accidentally damages your wiper blade, KIMBLADE NANO&#8217;s easy-to-replace design lets you pop the silicone wiper blade and replace it with a new one in mere seconds.</p>\n<p>Designer: KIMBLADE DESIGN TEAM</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kimblade/kimblade-nano-wiper-blade-solution-completed-by-nanotech?ref=10hvo0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $65</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2021-05-01T14:44:09+00:00\">$113</del> (42% off).

The upper part of the wiper blade is made of flexible and durable material that securely holds the wiper blade and allows it to be used for a long time without tearing. KIMBLADE’s core technology, CNT-reinforced special silicone, is used at the tip of the blade, which touches the glass directly and wipes rain and water off the glass. The specially reinforced silicone minimizes tearing from foreign substances, works smoothly on the glass, and forms a coating film on the glass surface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kimblade/kimblade-nano-wiper-blade-solution-completed-by-nanotech?ref=10hvo0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/032/617/097/b05f49738ee9af1007c77da2fce96495_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1614927858&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=1246ee521751cee503e5bfeadebd6bd7\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>High/Low Temperature Resistance</strong> &#8211; The existing rubber wiper is relatively vulnerable to strong sunlight, freezing weather, ultraviolet rays, and ozone, resulting in an increase of deformation and corrosion as time goes by.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kimblade/kimblade-nano-wiper-blade-solution-completed-by-nanotech?ref=10hvo0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/032/617/100/19ed0987f428cd77dea843290b988cd2_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1614927881&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=6dd76f29ce680f1513e30266465eb8a9\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" /></a></p>\n<p>Kimblade wiper is made out of special double-layered silicon and is very stable regarding deformation and corrosion even when exposed to various environmental circumstances, enabling a user to experience reliability and convenience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kimblade/kimblade-nano-wiper-blade-solution-completed-by-nanotech?ref=10hvo0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/032/704/938/89c37a1b2d0698ddb240c0b62236b954_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&#38;w=680&#38;fit=max&#38;v=1615513330&#38;auto=format&#38;gif-q=50&#38;q=92&#38;s=edc0c4a3ee20c9939f979b79b81f3685\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" /></a></p>\n<p>Adding CNT to Improve Durability &#8211; CNT is the next-generation material that has a tube-shaped atomic arrangement and has high strength, as well as thermal and electrical conductivity.
