This blog post will serve as the final submission for my participation. I’ll go one by one over the Merge Requests that got accepted into Epiphany and give a short description of my work. <img alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/651\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!651</a> – This MR splits the source code files for the Preferences Dialog into several smaller ones with separate widgets for each of the individual pages. There was a lot of manual work here as it can be seen from size of the patch, but it was definitely worthwhile as the pages are now a lot easier to maintain and develop.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/664\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!664</a> – This is a small fixup to the previous patch. I didn’t update the copyright headers after moving the files around and this patch adjusts that.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/678\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!678</a> – I was certainly expecting that after the split landed there would be reports of stuff going wrong. <img alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /> This MR fixes runtime warnings caused by some bad casts.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/715\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!715</a> – Also as expected there was more than one thing that broke after the split. This patch fixes a crash in the webapps settings. In my defence webapps were not available in my local builds of Epiphany as they are not available with flatpak. This resulted in me spending several days trying to reproduce the crash and about several minutes to actually come up with a fix. <img alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/670\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!670</a> – This is the next big patch that landed this summer. It includes a bunch of UI changes to the Preferences Privacy page. With useful widgets from <code>libhandy</code> we also implemented several mobile and touch friendly details.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/731\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!731</a> – This is a fixup patch to the previous one. Surprisingly enough this isn’t a fix to something that was broken, but instead it’s simply a small adjustment to the UI. <img alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/733\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!733</a> – The time was finally arriving when I would move away from Preferences and go towards History. While I was playing around with the existing version of the History dialog, I noticed that errors were printed every time I would delete an item from the history list. I decided to fix this issue before applying my own changes and the small patch here solved the issue.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/734\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!734 </a>– Another small tweak in Preferences which marks some strings as translatable and adds mnemonics to some buttons.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/741\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!741</a> – The rationale behind this patch is quite funny. When looking through the existing History dialog’s source code, I noticed there’s a function implemented which was supposed to be called every time the user selected an item from the history list. However the function wasn’t connected to the <code>row-selected</code> signal of the list. As such the function was never called. I thought that the writer of the function would have wished the function to be called so I wrote a patch which connected the signal. <img alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/754\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!754</a>, <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/768\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!768</a> – I’ve grouped these two together as they are both small fixes and tweaks regarding the previous big patch in Preferences UI</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/758\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!758</a> – Working on this patch was a very educational experience as it involved async function calls, a concept which I wasn’t very familiar with. I even had to implement an async function here, which proved to be much trickier than expected, but thanks to help received from the mentors it was a good learning experience.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/740\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!740</a> – The next significant patch was implementing a selection mode for the History dialog. The selection mode is a fairly common pattern throughout GNOME applications. It’s used to select and manipulate a set of items from a list or grid. Here it’s used to delete or open in new tabs links from the history list.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/790\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!790</a> – A tweak to the behaviour of the History selection mode UI.</li><li><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/merge_requests/793\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">!793</a> – After the recent work done in the history dialog the source code files were left in a state which I found a bit difficult to read. This refactor patch rewrites the whole dialog in a single file such that all the logic is centralized and easier to follow. Contrary to expectations the new file wasn’t that large as the implementation was substantially simplified.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Work in Progress</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Currently I am working on fixing this <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/issues/1281\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a>, which has proven to be a lot more stubborn than expected. <img alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After that I’ll be on stand-by to implement some new design decisions in the History dialog. Currently these decisions haven’t been made and people are discussing <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany/-/issues/1304\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Michael Catanzaro, Jan-Michael Brummer and Alexander Mikhaylenko for providing help and support throughout this summer !</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, thank you for reading.

These are used to generalizes all interactions that are related to firmware. Where <code>RetroCore</code> is an implementation class of <code>Core</code> interface. <code>FirmwareManager</code> class is for organizing checksums verification through <code>Core</code>/<code>RetroCore</code> when a game requiring a firmware is run by the runner.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-games/-/merge_requests/405\">!405 (merged)</a>: Made a <code>Firmware</code> interface and a <code>RetroFirmware</code> class that moves all the functions and information needed by firmware from <code>FirmareManager</code> to itself. By doing this, the <code>Core</code> interface is used to make firmware objects, <code>FirmwareManager</code> manages firmware objects, and the firmware object runs checksum verification and contains all information related to that firmware.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-games/-/merge_requests/408\">!408</a>: Some minor changes to how checksum verification takes place to be more efficient. Added methods to <code>FirmwareManager</code> that handle addition and removal of firmware along with methods that listed all supported firmware and methods to check whether the file being added is a supported firmware or not.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-games/-/merge_requests/411\">!411 (merged)</a>: Since both SHA-512 and MD5 checksums will be mandatory by a commit in <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-games/-/merge_requests/408\">!408</a>, present core descriptor files needed to be updated to have both SHA-512 and MD5 checksums.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-games/-/merge_requests/415\">!415</a>: Merge request with back-end code from <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-games/-/merge_requests/408\">!408</a>, generalization of overlay in preferences page and the drag n drop widget. The need for an overlay generalization is to make it easier for each preferences page to add an overlay. This will be useful later when Firmware page is implemented, to show error messages and undo bar when adding or removing firmware. The reason why this merge request has back-end code is for proper functionality of the merge request on it’s own as the drag n drop widget uses the back-end code introduced in <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-games/-/merge_requests/408\">!408</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/retro-gtk/-/merge_requests/89\">!89</a>: Merge request with the parser that reads firmware name from the core descriptor.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>TODO</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As the code will not be merged until 3.38 release, I just have to keep refining the back-end code and making the drag n drop experience smoother.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As for firmware page, I have untracked Firmware Page UI, after the translation issue is resolved, and back-end code and the parser lands, a new merge request with the untracked files will be opened, after which <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-games/issues/145\">#145</a> will be resolved and closed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Google Summer of code was experience of a lifetime for me, being a student and getting a chance to work on open source and writing production level code. While working on my GSoC internship I learnt a lot. Working remotely on open source project taught me things like, time management, communication, git, open source workflow etc. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These past 3 months have been quite hectic with working on my GSoC project while taking online classes, doing assignments and submitting reports. GSoC was a valuable experience for me as better time management means more productivity out of the same 24 hours without missing out on things.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With summer ending and and summer vacations beginning, I would like to express gratitude to my mentor <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/exalm\">Alexander Mikhaylenko</a> (a.k.a @alexm a.k.a @exalm) for helping and guiding me this summer. Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This GSoC was a big learning experience as it taught me data flow and code design, UI/UX, widget writing, CSS and finally ways to use git to ease workflow.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I’ll try to keep posting, as I’ll still be working on GNOME Games and will probably look for more projects to work on later :^)</p></div>\r\n    ","descriptionType":"xhtml","publishedDate":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 16:44:31 +0000","feedId":10108,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"284d301277c35155e4d803a17a8651e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Adwait Rawat","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598862221270},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","title":"Google Summer Of Code 2020 Final Report","link":"https://gaharavara.github.io/gsoc-2020-final-report/","description":"<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\r\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"display: block;\" />\r\n  <img alt=\"GSoC @ Pitivi\" class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" src=\"https://gaharavara.github.io/static/0724c96375807a0259dc1300101aab53/fcda8/gsoc_pitivi.png\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle;\" title=\"GSoC @ Pitivi\" />\r\n    </span>\r\nDuring this summer I improved Pitivi’s Media Library.

Now both iconview and listview modes are powered by a single <a href=\"https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gtk-3.0/classes/FlowBox.html#Gtk.FlowBox\">Gtk.FlowBox</a> widget.\r\nIssue <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/issues/1343\">#1343</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/305\">Link To Submitted MR.</a>  ( merged )</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gaharavara.github.io/refactoring-pitivi-%20medialibrary/\">Link To Related Blog.</a></strong></p>\r\n<h3>Shifting the asset action buttons to a new action bar</h3>\r\n<p>The Tagging functionality is accessed through a new Tag button, for which we needed to make space since the MediaLibrary’s toolbar was already very crowded.</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\r\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"https://gaharavara.github.io/static/e615accacc90e7b875bf25bbd90307d2/533c1/initially_medialibrary.png\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"display: block;\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"display: block;\" />\r\n  <img alt=\"medialibrary before the introudction of new action bar\" class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" src=\"https://gaharavara.github.io/static/e615accacc90e7b875bf25bbd90307d2/533c1/initially_medialibrary.png\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle;\" title=\"medialibrary before the introudction of new action bar\" />\r\n  </a>\r\n    </span></p>\r\n<p>We decided to group all the buttons related to the selected clips on a new toolbar at the bottom of MediaLibrary.

A clip can have multiple tags. Multiple clips can have common tags. </p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"Tagging Feature\" src=\"https://gaharavara.github.io/3648ef2d67542bbb8aa66b7c727ded19/pitivi_tagging_functionality.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/index.html#Gtk-3.0/classes/Popover.html#Gtk.Popover\">Gtk.Popover</a> shown by the Tag button displays all the tags  using a <strong>Gtk.ListBox</strong>. The state of each tag can be controlled using a Gtk.CheckButton. A CheckButton is “checked” when all the selected clips have the corresponding tag, “unchecked” when none of the clips have the tag, and “inconsistent” when only some of the clips have the tag. Clicking the CheckButton takes it through the three states. </p>\r\n<p><strong>A Gtk.Entry</strong> allows to specify a new tag to be associated with all the selected clips. </p>\r\n<p><strong>An “Apply”</strong> button saves the changes in the project. The Apply button remains disabled unless there are changes to be applied. It does not permit creating a duplicate tag.\r\nNote: After applying the change via the Apply button it is not written in the project’s xges files. To do so we need to save the project.\r\nTaking advantage of the fact that the GES.UriClipAsset is a GES.MetaContainer, we store the tags under the individual clip’s metadata ( “pitivi::tags” ). When saving the project, the tags are thus saved in the project’s xges file. While working on saving and retrieving asset metadata we encountered a minor bug in GES because of which we were unable to retrieve the saved metadata from a reloaded project. So we worked on a fix before moving on.</p>\r\n<p>I introduced new test cases exercising the UI for addition and removal of tags under several scenarios.\r\nIssue <strong><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/issues/537\">#537</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/318\">Link To Submitted MR.</a></strong></p>\r\n<h3>Filtering of clips based on their tags</h3>\r\n<p>After completing the Tagging feature our plan was to utilise it for filtering the clips. We worked on extending our current search functionality to include searching by tags. Luckily the search bar in MediaLibrary is composed of Gtk.Entry which has a convenient method <a href=\"https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/index.html#Gtk-3.0/classes/Entry.html#Gtk.Entry.set_completion\">set_completion</a> to assign an <a href=\"https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/index.html#Gtk-3.0/classes/EntryCompletion.html#Gtk.EntryCompletion\">Gtk.EntryCompletion</a> to it.</p>\r\n<p>Gtk.EntryCompletion allows us to use Gtk.TreeStore to provide suggestions based on the text or key entered inside the Gtk.Entry. We already had a global set of tags maintained in the MediaLibrary for the tagging feature. We used it to fill the <a href=\"https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/classes/EntryCompletion.html#Gtk.EntryCompletion.set_model\">model</a> required by Gtk.EntryCompletion. We utilise it’s built in Autocompletion and Popover to manage our filtering operation using tags.</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"Filtering clips based on tags\" src=\"https://gaharavara.github.io/84da5972b5d546b51180a9dccd48c291/extended_search_functionality.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/318\">Link To Submitted MR.</a></strong></p>\r\n<h3>Work To Be Done</h3>\r\n<p>The work in <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/318\">https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/318</a> is currently under review, polishing and updating it as per the reviews would be my priority.

The project consisted of implementing an Object Tracking UI in Pitivi and the associated tracking functionality in GStreamer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"cvtracker-gstreamer-element\">cvtracker GStreamer element</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/commit/ef2cf45b71b4474b6f2e6bace6bbf8250e2a4d15\">flatpak: add opencv_contrib</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I began by adding the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">opencv_contrib</code> module to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">opencv</code> installation for the Pitivi development environment. <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">opencv_contrib</code> contains the <a href=\"https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d0/d0a/classcv_1_1Tracker.html\">library</a> with the tracking algorithms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/-/merge_requests/1321\">OpenCV Tracker Element for Object Tracking</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This merge request introduces the tracking functionality in the gst-plugins-bad package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">opencv</code> plugin was not being built due to the unavailability of the headers. This <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/-/commit/93f7b123f74ae9c276a97b3a21726de94414e5fb?merge_request_iid=1321\">patch</a> fixes the problem, ensuring that the headers are detected for the correct version of opencv and the plugin is built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next commit: <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/-/commit/d6c7f882d45d5c089565c9b0c2de5d27a17da562?merge_request_iid=1321\">opencv: add cvtracker plugin</a>, I implement the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cvtracker</code> element as part of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">opencv</code> GStreamer plugin and set up the associated tests to ensure correct working. The next commit: <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/-/commit/f8fa64083ecb74f22a1d794be54140c62832fdc2?merge_request_iid=1321\">meson: add opencv/tracking header requirement</a> ensures that the tracking library is available before building the plugin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I implemented an additional feature to draw a rectangle over the tracked object. This will come in handy during the testing phase and for live tracking in Pitivi. <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-bad/-/commit/e62a646c1a1b1cfe0069636138a15f106f512a3f?merge_request_iid=1321\">opencv: cvtracker: add draw property</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A brief explanation of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cvtracker</code> element can be found on my blog post: <a href=\"https://123vivekr.github.io/2020/08/15/gstreamer-cvtracker.html\">cvtracker: OpenCV object tracking plugin</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"tracker-perspective\">Tracker Perspective</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With the GStreamer element for tracking completed, the next stage was to implement a user-friendly UI for object tracking. The new Tracker Perspective replaces Pitivi’s main window, allowing to select an object on the viewer and track it. If the chosen tracking algorithm fails to track the object correctly, the tracking can be redone from a corrected position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work done on the Pitivi side currently resides in the <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/315/\">Merge Request</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A brief explanation of tracking objects can be found on my blog post:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://123vivekr.github.io/2020/07/28/pitivi-object_tracking.html\">Pitivi: Object Tracking</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the project progressed, we iterated and made a lot of UI improvements.

This can be done easily through the “Cover Object” button in the “Clip Properties” middle pane shown when a clip is selected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-diag1.png\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When an Asset from the Media Library is dragged and dropped on the timeline, it becomes a Clip. A user can create multiple Clips from a single Asset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tracked objects belong to the Asset. That means if an object is tracked, it’s available to all the Clips backed by the particular Asset. The tracked data is then applied to the properties of an Effect applied to the Clip to obtain the ‘cover rectangle’. Clips can have object effects independent of each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a tracked object is deleted from the Assed in the TrackerPerspective, the effects associated with that object will be deleted from all the Clips of that Asset. The below figure shows the situation when ‘Object 2’ is deleted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-diag2.png\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Technical Note</span></em>: Taking advantage of <a href=\"https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#GES-1.0/classes/UriClipAsset.html#GES.UriClipAsset\">Assets</a> being <a href=\"https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#GES-1.0/classes/MetaContainer.html#GES.MetaContainer\">MetaContainers</a>, we store the Objects’s tracking data as a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pitivi::tracker_data</code> metadata item. The tracking data is saved in the Project’s <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">.xges</code> file by GES when the Project is saved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"project-status\">Project Status</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The tracker element and Pitivi UI are complete, as demonstrated in my blog posts. However, there are 2 major bugs in the feature for adding effects to the tracked objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first bug is when the user adds the effect for two objects, one with more tracking data than the other, the video track of the clip gets disfigured. This might be due to no available tracking data before the start, which causes the tracking box (red box in this case) to be shown at the bottom-right corner until it receives its first tracking data point. Here’s a small demo of the bug: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8Z3iw2nDcqo\">YouTube</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fix for this bug is to add a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">zorder</code> property to the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">gescompositor</code> element of the effect and to set the tracking data point to some random far away point before the beginning of the actual tracked data points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second bug is when the user adds the effect for an object and then resizes the clip in the viewer, the effect doesn’t follow. Here’s a demo for the bug: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nPMFoFACIMs\">YouTube</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The currently discussed solution is to re-adjust the tracking data every time the user makes a change to the clip video track in the viewer, by resetting the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">ControlSource</code>.</p></div>\r\n    ","descriptionType":"xhtml","publishedDate":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 05:06:21 +0000","feedId":10108,"bgimg":"https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-tracker_persp.png","linkMd5":"dc54e2ec71c6de79388f291c9836d11b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn34@2020_5/2020/08/31/08-23-43-552_f4be0bdc7a2de716.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1042,"sourceBytes":94518,"destBytes":20812,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-tracker_persp.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn34@2020_5/2020/08/31/08-23-43-552_f4be0bdc7a2de716.webp","https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-selecting_object.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn99@2020_6/2020/08/31/08-24-02-815_1977e3b1db90e396.webp","https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-live_tracking.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn48@2020_5/2020/08/31/08-24-02-174_13a87994fd7093c8.webp","https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-cover_object.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_4/2020/08/31/08-24-02-487_82971b40249c2742.webp","https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-cover_obj_pop.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn84@2020_5/2020/08/31/08-24-02-342_145edb6cb064936b.webp","https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-cover_effect.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn100@2020_2/2020/08/31/08-24-02-449_4d837f1844fd00f0.webp","https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-diag1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_4/2020/08/31/08-24-02-168_6bdeb55517a254b8.webp","https://123vivekr.github.io/assets/wp-diag2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/31/08-24-02-340_9e964b27b1b6ba1e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598862221269},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","title":"GSoC final project report","link":"http://cocoonfly.wordpress.com/?p=557","description":"<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Hello again !

So, what’s been happening in that time? This will be a long one, so if you’re only interested in a part of it (and who could blame you), I’ve titled each section.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Leaving Impossible</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Well, unfortunately my work with Impossible ended, as we essentially ran out of funding. That’s really a shame, we worked on some really cool, open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/glimpse-project/glimpse\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stuff</a>, and we’ve definitely seen similar innovations in the field since we stopped working on it. We took a short break (during which we also, unsuccessfully, searched for further funding), after which Rob started working on a <a href=\"https://realfit.co/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cool, related project</a> of his own that you should check out, and I, being a bit less brave, starting seeking out a new job. I did consider becoming a full-time musician, but business wasn’t picking up as quickly as I’d hoped it might in that down-time, and with hindsight, I’m glad I didn’t (Covid-19 and all).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I interviewed with a few places, which was certainly an eye-opening experience. The last ‘real’ job interview I did was for Mozilla in 2011, which consisted mainly of talking with engineers that worked there, and working through a few whiteboard problems. Being a young, eager coder at the time, this didn’t really phase me back then. Turns out either the questions have evolved or I’m just not quite as sharp as I used to be in that very particular environment. The one interview I had that involved whiteboard coding was a very mixed bag. It seemed a mix of two types of questions; those that are easy to answer (but unless you’re in the habit of writing very quickly on a whiteboard, slow to write down) and those that were pretty impossible to answer without specific preparation. Perhaps this was the fault of recruiters, but you might hope that interviews would be catered somewhat to the person you’re interviewing, or the work they might actually be doing, neither of which seemed to be the case? Unsurprisingly, I didn’t get past that interview, but in retrospect I’m also glad I didn’t. Igalia’s interview process was much more humane, and involved mostly discussions about actual work I’ve done, hypothetical situations and ethics. They were very long discussions, mind, but I’m very glad that they were happy to hire me, and that I didn’t entertain different possibilities. If you aren’t already familiar with Igalia, I’d highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/about/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">having a read</a> about them/us. I’ve been there a year now, and the feeling is quite similar to when I first joined Mozilla, but I believe with Igalia’s structure, this is likely to stay a happier and safer environment. Not that I mean to knock Mozilla, <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">especially now</a>, but anyone that has worked there will likely admit that along with the giddy highs, there are also some unfortunate lows.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Igalia</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I joined Igalia as part of the team that works on WebKit, and that’s what I’ve been doing since. It almost makes perfect sense in a way. Surprisingly, although I’ve spent overwhelmingly more time on Gecko, I did actually work with WebKit first while at OpenedHand, and for a short period at Intel. While celebrating my first commit to WebKit, I did actually discover it wasn’t my first commit at all, but I’d contributed a small embedding-related <a href=\"https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/37322/webkit\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fix-up</a> in 2008. So it’s nice to have come full-circle! My first work at Igalia was fixing up some patches that <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/igalian/zdobersek\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Å½an DoberÅ¡ek</a> had prototyped to allow direct display of YUV video data via pixel shaders. Later on, I was also pleased to extend that work somewhat by fixing some vc3 driver bugs and GStreamer bugs, to allow for hardware decoding of YUV video on Raspberry Pi 3b (this, I believe, is all upstream at this point). WebKit Gtk and WPE WebKit may be the only Linux browser backends that leverage this pipeline, allowing for 1080p30 video playback on a Pi3b. There are other issues making this less useful than you might think, but either way, it’s a nice first achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>OffscreenCanvas</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After that introduction, I was pointed at what could be fairly described as my main project, OffscreenCanvas. This was also a continuation of Å½an’s work (he’s prolific!), though there has been significant original work since. This might be the part of this post that people find most interesting or relevant, but having not blogged in over 2 years, I can’t be blamed for waffling just a little. <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#offscreencanvas\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OffscreenCanvas</a> is a relatively new web standard that allows the use of canvas API disconnected from the DOM, and within Workers. It also makes some provisions for asynchronously updated rendering, allowing canvas updates in Workers to bypass the main thread entirely and thus not be blocked by long-running processes on that thread. The most obvious use-case for this, and I think the most practical, is essentially non-blocking rendering of generated content. This is extremely handy for maps, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/2020/04/07/better-web-maps-with-new-browser-features/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for example</a>. There are some other nice use-cases for this as well – you can, for example, show loading indicators that don’t stop animating while performing complex DOM manipulation, or procedurally generate textures for games, asynchronously. Any situation where you might want to do some long-running image processing without blocking the main thread (image editing also springs to mind).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the only complete implementation is within Blink. Gecko has a partial implementation that only supports WebGL contexts (and last time I tried, crashed the browser on creation…), but as far as I know, that’s it. I’ve been working on this, with encouragement and cooperation from Apple, on and off for the past year. In fact, <a href=\"https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/265543/webkit\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">as of August 12th</a>, it’s even partially usable, though there is still a fair bit missing. I’ve been concentrating on the 2d context use-case, as I think it’s by far the most useful part of the standard. It’s at the point where it’s mostly usable, minus <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186759\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">text rendering</a> and minus some edge-case <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204575\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">colour parsing</a>. Asynchronous updates are also not yet supported, though I believe that’s <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202798\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fairly close</a> for Linux. OffscreenCanvas is enabled with experimental features, for those that want to try it out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>My next goal, after asynchronous updates on Linux, is to enable <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209809\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WebGL context support</a>. I believe these aren’t particularly tough goals, given where it is now, so hopefully they’ll happen by the end of the year. Text rendering is a much harder problem, but I hope that between us at Igalia and the excellent engineers at Apple, we can come up with a plan for it. The difficulty is that both styling and font loading/caching were written with the assumption that they’d run on just one thread, and that that thread would be the main thread. A very reasonable assumption in a pre-Worker and pre-many-core-CPU world of course, but increasingly less so now, and very awkward for this particular piece of work. Hopefully we’ll persevere though, this is a pretty cool technology, and I’d love to contribute to it being feasible to use widely, and lessen the gap between native and the web.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And that’s it from me. Lots of non-work related <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRGjmwFxv08CfRjDcoKfv207zYrsn7JIG\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stuff</a> has happened in the time since I last posted, but I’m keeping this post tech-related.

I use to have this blog back then as well but the only reader apparently use to be me! (HA..HA…!) I had always aspired to become an open-source contributor and got my first genuine opportunity with GNOME which also eventually became my GSoC project. I have been using GNOME ever since I have been using Linux. I had never imagined I would be contributing to the file manager(<em>Nautilus</em>) I had been using every-day without appreciating the fact that it was made up of blood, sweat, and tears of the community and contributors, and maintainers who daily work on it voluntarily, to keep the project going, keeping it bug-free, and of course, maintaining its awesomeness . . ! I got to work on the properties-dialog and like I said my work has been accepted into the master branch as well, I can only imagine the subtle sense of satisfaction and joy which I would feel when I fire up nautilus on a normal day, look at the properties-dialog only to realize I had worked on it some time ago, even years from now (..apoos_maximus has goosebumps as he types this). (of course, I am impatiently waiting for distros to start packaging the latest version ..!) I only hope the work I did enhances the user experience of the people using it and the developer experience of the hardworking contributors working on it!</p>\r\n<p>During all this time I have grown closer to the community as well and made amazing friends, and connections, I feel these three months were by far the most amazing and productive months of my life. And GUADEC (.. about which I have already spoken, was a total blast ! I loved it !)I was able to build myself a new computer with the stipend I received so that now it won’t freeze on me when I try to apply a <em>Cage Transform</em> in <em>GIMP</em> or try to follow <em>Blender</em> tutorials on Youtube. Everything has been so nice that I can’t express enough how happy I feel! This project has ended but I am going to stick around and make more contributions, as to me, this place feels like home on the internet! So, thank you GNOME, and lots of love from me to the whole community who makes it awesome.</p>\r\n<p>Now, before we end it we have got something to say-</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I would love to thank my mentor Antonio Fernandes, whose iron-clad support has been with me since the day I posted my first message on #nautilus, This incredible experience wouldn’t have been possible without him.

A new category in the laptop market is 2-in-1 laptops with full drawing pen support. It has been a long time since I have done any real drawing or painting and this seemed like a nice way to get back into that. On the other hand the computer also needs to be performant for heavy duty software development such as running the Meson test suite (which is surprisingly heavy) and things like compiling LLVM. This yields the following requirements:<br /><br /><ul><li>A good keyboard, on the level of Thinkpads or 2015-ish Macbook Pros</li><li>13 or 14 inch screen, at least Retina level resolution, HDR would be nice, as matte as possible</li><li>Pressure and tilt support for the pen</li><li>At least 16GB of RAM</li><li>USB A, C and HDMI connectors would be nice</li><li>At least Iris level graphics with free drivers (so no NVidia)</li><li>A replaceable battery would be nice</li><li>Working dual boog (I need Win10 for various things), full Linux support (including wifi et al)</li></ul>After a bunch of research it turns out that this set of requirements might be impossible to fullfill. Here are the tree best examples that I found.<br /><h3>HP Elite Dragonfly</h3><div>The documentation is unclear on whether the pen supports tilting. More importantly this model is only available with Intel 8th gen processors and online reviews say the screen is super glossy.</div><h3>Lenovo Yoga X1 Gen5</h3><div>Pen does not support tilting. The graphics card is a standard Intel HD, not Iris.</div><h3>Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 7390</h3><div>This is the one that gets the closest. There is no USB A or HDMI connectors, and the pen requires an AAAA battery. This is annoying but tolerable. Unfortunately the keyboard is of the super thin type, which is just not usable.</div><h2>So now what?</h2><div>Probably going to stick with the current ones for now. New models come out at a fairly steady pace, so maybe this mythical white whale will become available for purchase at some point. Alternatively I might eventually just fold, give up on some requirements and buy a compromise machine. Typically this causes the dream machine to become available for purchase immediately afterwards, when it is too late. </div></div>\r\n    ","descriptionType":"xhtml","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 14:48:00 +0000","feedId":10108,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0f140e3aa318ffe2d391ec65c14907a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jussi","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598862221268},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","title":"New Release: Color Picker v2.4.0","link":"https://blogs.gnome.org/christopherdavis/?p=6286","description":"<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p dir=\"auto\">Gcolor3 is now “Color Picker”!

This has, naturally, caused people to become either confused, disappointed or angry. Presumably many people are writing responses and angry comments. I almost started one writing one pointing out all the issues I found in the post.<br /><br />Doing that would probably create a fairly popular blog post with followups. It might even get to the reddits and hackernewses and generate tons of comments where people would duke it out on issues on user choice vs the safety provided by a curated walled garden. There would be hundreds, if not thousands, of snarky tweets that make their poster feel superior for a while but are ultimately not productive. To quote Star Trek Deep Space Nine:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">Spare me please-think-of-the-children speech and I'll spare you the users-must-have-control-over-their-own-devices speech [1].</blockquote>Having us, the user and developer community, argue about this issue is pointless, unproductive and actively harmful. This particular phenomenon is not new, it even has a name. In fact this approach is so old that the name is in latin: <i>Divide et impera</i>. Divide and conquer. All the time and energy that we spend on arguing this issue among ourselves is time not spent on working towards a solution.<br /><br />The actual solution to this issue is conceptually so simple it could be called trivial. The entire problem at hand is one that has been created by Apple. They are also the ones that can solve it. All they have to do is to add one new piece of functionality to iOS devices. Specifically that users who so choose, can change an option in the device they own allowing them to download, install and use any application binaries freely from the Internet. Enabling this functionality could be done, for example, in a similar way to how Android phones enable developer mode. Once implemented Apple would then make a public statement saying that this workflow is fully supported and that applications obtained in this way will, now and forevermore, have access to all the same APIs as official store apps do.<br /><br />This is all it takes! Further, they could make it so that IT departments and concerned parents could disable this functionality on their employees' and children's devices so that they can only obtain apps via the app store. This gives both sets of users exactly what they want. Those who prefer living in a walled curated garden can do so. Those with the desire and willingness to venture outside the walls and take responsibility of their own actions can do so too and still get all the benefits of sandboxing and base platform security.<br /><br />Apple could do this. Apple could have done this at launch. Apple could have done this at any time since. <i>Apple has actively chosen not to do this</i>. Keep this is mind if you ever end up arguing about this issue on the Internet. People who have different priorities and preferences are not \"the enemy\". If you get into the flaming and the shouting you have been divided. And you have been conquered.<br /><br />[1] Might not be a word-for-word accurate transcription.</div>\r\n    ","descriptionType":"xhtml","publishedDate":"Sun, 30 Aug 2020 11:51:00 +0000","feedId":10108,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"282788762334ab8bd6ef945573279927","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jussi","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598862221271},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","title":"User-specific XKB configuration - part 3","link":"https://who-t.blogspot.com/2020/08/user-specific-xkb-configuration-part-3.html","description":"<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>This is the continuation from these posts: <a href=\"https://who-t.blogspot.com/2020/02/user-specific-xkb-configuration-part-1.html\">part 1</a>, <a href=\"https://who-t.blogspot.com/2020/07/user-specific-xkb-configuration-part-2.html\">part 2</a></p> <p>Let's talk about everyone's favourite [1] keyboard configuration system again: XKB. If you recall the goal is to make it simple for users to configure their own custom layouts. Now, as described earlier, XKB-the-implementation doesn't actually have a concept of a \"layout\" as such, it has \"components\" and <i>something</i> converts your layout desires into the combination of components. <a href=\"https://who-t.blogspot.com/2020/02/user-specific-xkb-configuration-part-1.html\">RMLVO</a> (rules, model, layout, variant, options) is what you specify and gets converted to <a href=\"https://who-t.blogspot.com/2020/02/user-specific-xkb-configuration-part-1.html\">KcCGST</a> (keycodes, compat, geometry, symbols, types). This is a one-way conversion, the resulting keymaps no longer has references to the RMLVO arguments. Today's post is about that conversion, and we're only talking about libxkbcommon as XKB parser because anything else is no longer maintained. </p><p>The peculiar thing about XKB data files (provided by <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/xkeyboard-config/\">xkeyboard-config</a> [3]) is that the filename is part of the API. You say layout \"us\" variant \"dvorak\", the rules file translates this to symbols 'us(dvorak)' and the parser will understand this as \"load file 'symbols/us' and find the dvorak section in that file\". [4] The default \"us\" keyboard layout will require these components: </p><pre><br />xkb_keymap {<br /> xkb_keycodes  { include \"evdev+aliases(qwerty)\" };<br /> xkb_types     { include \"complete\" };<br /> xkb_compat    { include \"complete\" };<br /> xkb_symbols   { include \"pc+us+inet(evdev)\" };<br /> xkb_geometry  { include \"pc(pc105)\" };<br />};<br /></pre>So the symbols are really: file <b>symbols/pc</b>, add <b>symbols/us</b> and then the section named 'evdev' from <b>symbols/inet</b> [5]. Types are loaded from <b>types/complete</b>, etc. The lookup paths for libxkbcommon are <i>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xkb</i>, <i>/etc/xkb</i>, and <i>/usr/share/X11/xkb</i>, in that order. <p /> <p>Most of the symbols sections aren't actually full configurations. The 'us' default section only sets the alphanumeric rows, everything else comes from the 'pc' default section (hence: <i>include \"pc+us+inet(evdev)\"</i>). And most variant sections just include the default one, usually called 'basic'. For example, this is the 'euro' variant of the 'us' layout which merely combines a few other sections: </p><pre><br />partial alphanumeric_keys<br />xkb_symbols \"euro\" {<br /><br />    include \"us(basic)\"<br />    name[Group1]= \"English (US, euro on 5)\";<br /><br />    include \"eurosign(5)\"<br /><br />    include \"level3(ralt_switch)\"<br />};<br /></pre>Including things works as you'd expect: <i>include \"foo(bar)\"</i> loads section 'bar' from file 'foo' and this works for 'symbols/', 'compat/', etc., it'll just load the file in the same subdirectory. So yay, the directory is kinda also part of the API. <p /> <p>Alright, now you understand how KcCGST files are loaded, much to your despair. </p> <p>For user-specific configuration, we could already <a href=\"https://who-t.blogspot.com/2020/02/user-specific-xkb-configuration-part-1.html\">load a 'custom' layout</a> from the user's home directory. But it'd be nice if we could just <b>add</b> a variant to an existing layout. Like \"us(banana)\", because potassium is important or somesuch. This wasn't possible because the filename is part of the API. So our banana variant had to be in <i>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xkb/symbols/us</i> and once we found that \"us\" file, we could no longer include the system one. </p><p>So as of two days ago, libxkbcommon now extends the parser to have merged KcCGST files, or in other words: it'll load the <b>symbols/us</b> file in the lookup path order until it finds the section needed. With that, you can now copy this into your <i>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xkb/symbols/us</i> file and have it work as variant: </p><pre><br />partial alphanumeric_keys<br />xkb_symbols \"banana\" {<br /><br />    include \"us(basic)\"<br />    name[Group1]= \"English (Banana)\";<br /><br />    // let's assume there are some keymappings here<br />};<br /></pre>And voila, you now have a banana variant that can combine with the system-level \"us\" layout. <p /><p>And because there must be millions [6] of admins out there that maintain custom XKB layouts for a set of machines, the aforementioned <b>/etc/xkb</b> lookup path was also recently added to libxkbcommon. So we truly now have the typical triplet of lookup paths: </p><ul><li>vendor-provided ones in <b>/usr/share/X11/xkb</b>,</li><li>host-specific ones in <b>/etc/xkb</b>, and</li><li>user-specific ones in <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xkb</b> [7].</li></ul>Good times, good times.  <p /> <p><small>[1] Much in the same way everyone's favourite Model T colour was black<br />[2] This all follows the UNIX philosophy, there are of course multiple tools involved and none of them know what the other one is doing<br />[3] And I don't think Sergey gets enough credit for maintaining that pile of language oddities<br />[4] Note that the names don't have to match, we could map layout 'us' to the symbols in 'banana' but life's difficult enough as it is<br />[5] I say \"add\" when it's sort of a merge-and-overwrite and, yes, of course there are multiple ways to combine layouts, thanks for asking<br />[6] Actual number may be less<br />[7] Notice how \"X11\" is missing in the latter two?

Below is a detailed summary of the work done during the last three months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"refactoring-the-render-presets-selection\">Refactoring the Render Presets’ selection</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The previous UI for selecting a render preset was being constructed dynamically. The same mechanism is used to also construct the audio and video selection preset UI in the project settings dialog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can you even notice where the render Preset option is in all the clutter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://ayush9398.github.io/blog/assets/img/render-dialog-old.png\" />\r\n    </p><p align=\"center\" style=\"font-size: 10px;\"> Old Render Dialog-1</p>\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to move forward with a button which shows the current preset. When clicked, it opens a Gtk.Popover which lists the available presets. The presets listed in the popover include a relevant icon and an informative summary, making it an easy choice for the user. Thus I fixed issue <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/issues/1813\">#1813</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We mostly cared about rendering a project to be uploaded to an online sharing service such as YouTube, Vimeo, etc., so there are not many other options at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A custom icon is used for Custom profiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://ayush9398.github.io/blog/assets/img/render-dialog-new2.png\" />\r\n    </p><p align=\"center\" style=\"font-size: 10px;\"> Updated Render Dialog with popover</p>\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n<p>Through multiple iterations, we fine-tuned the UI so it looks nice and clear, improving the User Experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>MR:</b> <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/306\">link</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>MR status:</b> Merged.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"addition-of-path-property-in-gstreamer-encoding-target\">Addition of path property in Gstreamer Encoding-Target</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously when a render profile was deleted, it was just marked as such. While at it, I took the opportunity to properly delete them. Unfortunately the path of the file where a <a href=\"https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#GstPbutils-1.0/classes/EncodingTarget.html#GstPbutils.EncodingTarget\">GstPbutils.EncodingTarget</a> object originates was not available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I added a new <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">path</code> property to GstPbUtils.EncodingTarget and populated it when the object is saved or loaded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>MR:</b> <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-base/-/merge_requests/714\">link</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>MR status:</b> Merged.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"hiding-the-advanced-render-ui-in-a-new-advanced-expander\">Hiding the advanced render UI in a new “Advanced” expander</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The many settings displayed on the render dialog were intimidating to both new and seasoned users. Since many will never be interested in the advanced settings, I introduced an expander which hides the detailed settings of rendering dialog, at the same time keeping them easily accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, I moved the Folder and Filename sections at the bottom, to give more prominence to the render preset which is now at the top. I made the UI follow the <a href=\"https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/visual-layout.html.en\">GNOME Visual layout</a> for an attractive and intuitive design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>MR:</b> <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/319\">link</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>MR status:</b> Merged.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"addition-of-quality-selection-for-supported-encoders\">Addition of Quality selection for supported encoders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the video rendering process, there is a tradeoff between quality of the rendered video and the size of the video and the time it takes to render. If the user requires the video to be in high quality then the size of the video also increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To simplify the user’s choice, a Gtk.Scale widget has been introduced for specifying the desired render quality. The quality setting affects different parameters for different encoders, but this is done in the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://ayush9398.github.io/blog/assets/img/render_settings_quality_1.png\" />\r\n    </p><p align=\"center\" style=\"font-size: 10px;\"> Updated Render Dialog with Quality Scale.</p>\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://ayush9398.github.io/blog/assets/img/render_settings_quality_2.png\" />\r\n    </p><p align=\"center\" style=\"font-size: 10px;\"> Updated Render Dialog with Quality Scale -2.</p>\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n<p><b>MR:</b> <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/323\">link</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>MR status:</b> Work in Progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"work-to-be-done\">Work to be done</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Merge request <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pitivi/-/merge_requests/323\">!323</a> is still being reviewed in the final stages, and shall be merged soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can add more presets, such as high-quality archiving to be able to dispose of the original video material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can show a summary of the render settings so the user can quickly check them and enter in the Advanced settings expander if something looks bad.</p></div>\r\n    ","descriptionType":"xhtml","publishedDate":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 18:30:00 +0000","feedId":10108,"bgimg":"https://ayush9398.github.io/blog/assets/img/render-dialog-old.png","linkMd5":"6c8bc66d0be9fa74aef882673f64294b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn53@2020_5/2020/08/31/08-23-41-479_b40500d586214255.webp","destWidth":472,"destHeight":665,"sourceBytes":48253,"destBytes":20192,"author":"Ayush Mittal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://ayush9398.github.io/blog/assets/img/render-dialog-old.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn53@2020_5/2020/08/31/08-23-41-479_b40500d586214255.webp","https://ayush9398.github.io/blog/assets/img/render-dialog-new2.png":null,"https://ayush9398.github.io/blog/assets/img/render_settings_quality_1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/31/08-24-02-402_2d966d0e09c5c733.webp","https://ayush9398.github.io/blog/assets/img/render_settings_quality_2.png":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598862221270},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","title":"GSoC Ending","link":"https://marianapicolo.com//blog/2020/08/29/gsoc-ending/","description":"<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>During this last month, I've been working to improve the code I've already written and to cover the last details for this feature in order to work like <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/os-mockups/-/raw/master/notifications-calendar/notifications-tbernard.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">previewed in the mockups<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"icon outbound\" height=\"15\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\" width=\"15\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\"><path d=\"M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z\" fill=\"currentColor\"> <polygon fill=\"currentColor\" points=\"45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9\" /></path></svg></a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/mariana.picolo/gnome-shell/-/tree/notification-popover-redesign-final-submission\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Here's the branch of my final submission.</em><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"icon outbound\" height=\"15\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\" width=\"15\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\"><path d=\"M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z\" fill=\"currentColor\"> <polygon fill=\"currentColor\" points=\"45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9\" /></path></svg></a></p> <h2 id=\"what-s-done\"> What's done</h2> <p>This is a summary of all the work I've done so far in my GSoC project.</p> <ul><li><p><a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/mariana.picolo/gnome-shell/-/commit/9e1f3630ca0e8b752cf87b3fe4a07e20a73b072e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">display one forecast in weather;<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"icon outbound\" height=\"15\" viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\" width=\"15\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\"><path d=\"M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z\" fill=\"currentColor\"> <polygon fill=\"currentColor\" points=\"45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9\" /></path></svg></a> -

Yet those days are long gone.</p>\r\n<p>Granted, in the early 90s, I hailed the Internet as humanity’s purest\r\ninnovation. After all, it had enabled a group of global developers to\r\ncollaboratively build the Linux operating system from the ground\r\nup. In my X years of experience as a developer, nothing has come\r\nclose to the good will, success, and optimistic mood of those days.</p>\r\n<p>Upon reflection, everything started to change the day I received my\r\nfirst spam message. It stood out not only because it was the first\r\npiece of unsolicited email I received, but also because it was a\r\nparticularly nasty piece of spam. The advertiser was selling thousands\r\nof email addresses for the purposes of marketing and sales. Without\r\nquestion, I knew that someone would buy that list, and that I would\r\nsoon be on the receiving end of thousands of unwanted pieces of\r\nmail. Just a few months later, my inbox was filled with garbage. Since\r\nthen, the Internet has become increasingly hostile – from\r\nfirewalls, proxies, and sandboxes to high-profile exploits and\r\nattacks.</p>\r\n<p>Hardly a new phenomenon, before the Internet, the disk operating\r\nsystem (DOS) platform was an open system where everyone was free to\r\nbuild and innovate. But soon folks with bad intentions destroyed what\r\nwas a beautiful world of creation and problem solving, and turned it\r\ninto a place riddled with viruses, trojans, and spyware.</p>\r\n<p>Like most of you alive at the time, I found myself using anti-virus\r\nsoftware. In fact, I even wrote a commercial product in Mexico that\r\nperformed the dual task of scanning viruses and providing a Unix-like\r\npermission system for DOS (probably around 1990). Of course, it was\r\npossible to circumvent these systems, considering DOS code had full\r\naccess to the system.</p>\r\n<p>In 1993, Microsoft introduced a family of operating systems that came\r\nto be known as Windows NT. Though it was supposed to be secure from\r\nthe ground up, they decided to leave a few things open due to\r\ncompatibility concerns with the old world of Windows 95 and DOS. Not\r\nonly were there bad faith actors in the space, developers had made\r\nsignificant mistakes. Perhaps not surprisingly, users began to\r\nroutinely reinstall their operating systems following the gradual\r\ndecays that arose from improper changes to their operating systems.</p>\r\n<p>Fast-forward to 2006 when Windows Vista entered the scene – attempting\r\nto resolve a class of attacks and flaws. The solution took many users\r\nby surprise. It’s more apt to say that it was heavily criticized and\r\nregarded as a joke in some circles. For many, the old way of doing\r\nthings had been working just fine and all the additional security got\r\nin the way. While users hated the fact that software no longer worked\r\nout of the box, it was an important step towards securing systems.</p>\r\n<p>With the benefit of hindsight, I look back at the early days of DOS\r\nand the Internet as a utopia, where good intentions, innovation, and\r\nprogress were the norm. Now swindlers, scammers, hackers, gangsters,\r\nand state actors routinely abuse open systems to the point that they\r\nhave become a liability for every user.</p>\r\n<p>In response, Apple introduced iOS – an operating system that was\r\npurpose-build to be secure. This avoided backwards compatibility\r\nproblems and having to deal with users who saw unwanted changes to\r\ntheir environment. In a word, Apple managed to avoid the criticism and\r\npushback that had derailed Windows Vista.</p>\r\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that Apple wasn’t the first to introduce a\r\nlocked-down system that didn’t degrade. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft\r\nconsoles restricted the software that could be modified on their host\r\noperating systems and ran with limited capabilities. This resulted in\r\nfewer support calls, reduced frustration, and limited piracy.</p>\r\n<p>One of Apple’s most touted virtues is that the company creates secure\r\ndevices that respect user’s privacy. In fact, they have even gone to\r\ncourt against the US government over security. Yet iOS remains the\r\nmost secure consumer operating system. This has been made possible\r\nthrough multiple layers of security that address different\r\nthreats. (By referring to Apple’s <a href=\"https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf\">detailed platform\r\nsecurity</a>,\r\nyou can get a clear sense of just how comprehensive it is.)</p>\r\n<p>Offering a window into the development process, security experts need\r\nto evaluate systems from end-to-end and explore how the system can be\r\ntampered with, attacked, or hacked, and then devise both defense\r\nmechanisms and plans for when things will inevitably go\r\nwrong.</p>\r\n<p>Consider the iPhone. The hardware, operating system, and\r\napplications were designed with everything a security professional\r\nloves in mind. Even so, modern systems are too large and too complex\r\nto be bullet-proof. Researchers, practitioners, hobbyists, and\r\nbusinesses all look for security holes in these systems – some with\r\nthe goal of further protecting the system, others for educational\r\npurposes, and still others for profit or to achieve nefarious goals.</p>\r\n<p>Whereas hobbyists leverage these flaws to unlock their devices and get\r\nfull control over their systems, dictatorships purchase exploits in\r\nthe black market to use against their enemies and gain access to\r\ncompromising data, or to track the whereabouts of their targets.</p>\r\n<p>This is where the next layer of security comes in. When a flaw is\r\nidentified – whether by researchers, automated systems, telemetry, or\r\ncrashes – software developers design a fix for the problem and roll\r\nout the platform update. The benefits of keeping software updated\r\nextend beyond a few additional emoji characters; many software updates\r\ncome with security fixes. Quite simply, updating your phone keeps you\r\nmore secure. However, it’s worth emphasizing that this only works\r\nagainst known attacks.</p>\r\n<p>The App Store review process helps in some ways; namely, it can:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><p>Force applications to follow a set of guidelines aimed at protecting\r\nprivacy, the integrity of the system, and meet the bar for\r\nunsuspecting users</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Reduce applications with minimal functionality – yielding less junk\r\nfor users to deal with and smaller attack surfaces</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Require a baseline of quality, which discourages quick hacks</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><p>Prevent applications from using brittle, undocumented, or unsupported capabilities</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Still, the App Store review process is not flawless. Some developers\r\nhave worked around these restrictions by: (1) distributing hidden\r\npayloads, (2) temporarily disabling features while their app was being\r\ntested on Apple’s campus, (3) using time triggers, or (4) remotely\r\ncontrolling features to evade reviewers.</p>\r\n<p>As a case in point, we need look no further than Epic Games. They\r\ndeceptively submitted a “hot fix,” which is a practice used to fix a\r\ncritical problem such as a crash. Under the covers, they added a new\r\npurchasing system that could be remotely activated at the time of\r\ntheir choosing. It will come as no surprise that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1298057300599549953?s=20\">they activated\r\nit</a>\r\nafter they cleared the App Store’s review process.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike a personal computer, the applications you run on your\r\nsmartphone are isolated from the operating system and even from each\r\nother to prevent interference. Since apps run under a “sandbox” that\r\nlimits what they can do, you do not need to reinstall your iPhone from\r\nscratch every few months because things no longer work.</p>\r\n<p>Like the systems we described above, the sandbox is not perfect. In\r\ntheory, a bad actor could include an exploit for an unknown security\r\nhole in their application, slip it past Apple, and then, once it is\r\nused in the wild, wake up the dormant code that hijacks your system.</p>\r\n<p>Anticipating this, Apple has an additional technical and legal\r\nmitigation system in place. The former allows Apple to remotely\r\ndisable and deactivate ill-behaved applications, in cases where an\r\nactive exploit is being used to harm users. The legal mitigation is a\r\ncontract that is entered into between Apple and the software\r\ndeveloper, which can be used to bring bad actors to court.</p>\r\n<p>Securing a device is an ongoing arms race, where defenders and\r\nattackers are constantly trying to outdo the other side, and there is\r\nno single solution that can solve the problem. The battlegrounds have\r\nrecently moved and are now being waged at the edges of the App Store’s\r\nguidelines.</p>\r\n<p>In the same way that security measures have evolved, we need to\r\ntighten the App Store’s guidelines, including the behaviors that are\r\nbeing used for the purposes of monetization and to exploit\r\nchildren. (I plan to cover these issues in-depth in a future post.)\r\nFor now, let me just say that, as a parent, there are few things that\r\nwould make me happier than more stringent App Store rules governing\r\nwhat applications can do. In the end, I value my iOS devices because I\r\nknow that I can trust them with my information because security is\r\nparamount to Apple.</p>\r\n<p>Coming full-circle, Epic Games is pushing for the App Store to be a\r\n<a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.37.4_1.pdf\">free-for-all\r\nenvironment</a>,\r\nreminiscent of DOS. Unlike Apple, Epic does not have an established\r\ntrack record of caring about privacy and security (in fact, their\r\n<a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy\">privacy policy</a>\r\nexplicitly allows them to sell your data for marketing purposes).

The whole application is reincarnated. It is now fulfilling GNOME’s modern Human Interface Guidelines with a new cool look. Alongside this, some other issues are also fixed with the help of Bilal Elmoussaoui.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of my GSoC was to bring Sound Recorder to the current Human Interface Guidelines. When I started looking into the app, it turns out it had a very old codebase that was implemented in the imports.lang module via imports.lang.Class and imports.lang.Interface. The application was so simple and small so we decided to completely rewrite it. Now the question is if we gonna rewrite why not make in modern lang like rust? The answer is GNOME has to have an application written in all those languages where GObject bindings existed and the app is simple to understand so newcomers can easily adapt things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal still was to update Sound Recorder to a more modern interface. And the correct way to make an interface with GTK these days is to use GTK Builder. This allows us to have a separate XML file for the UI. It eases development and minor interface tweaks. This is what I did when rewriting the application. I also used libhandy widgets to make the application adaptive to smaller screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mockups provided by the Design team featured a new waveform to visualize the recordings. When implementing that visualization, I had to consider migrating old recordings so they could use this new waveform representation as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The application now using flatpak portal for new recordings and it can also transfer your old recordings to xdg data dir, and the transition is even seamless that you won’t even feel it. Here’s good <a href=\"https://maex.me/2019/12/the-power-of-the-xdg-base-directory-specification/\">article</a> about XDG Base Directory Specification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also some new features added like Pause/Resume capabilities in recording, playback controls for recorded audio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://kavan.js.org/assets/images/img-9.gif\" />\r\n<em>New Recording View</em>\r\n<img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://kavan.js.org/assets/images/img-6.gif\" />\r\n<em>Seek throught playback</em>\r\n<img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://kavan.js.org/assets/images/img-7.gif\" />\r\n<em>Rename Recording UI</em>\r\n<img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://kavan.js.org/assets/images/img-8.gif\" />\r\n<em>Undo deleted recording notification</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of those are visual changes. During the rewrite, we had to spend time on architecturing the code efficiently. This is a rather technical issue, which I would be happy to discuss with anyone interested in our Matrix channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And don’t forget to look at the new options menu in list row, adopting according to your window side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some changelogs:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>All widgets are transferred to GObject Classes with glade UI resources.</li>\r\n  <li>Reorganized code structure in recording and recording list class.</li>\r\n  <li>Removed preferences dialog and moved settings to the menu button.</li>\r\n  <li>Added a separate view for recording.</li>\r\n  <li>Pause and cancel the recording functionality added.</li>\r\n  <li>HdyApplicationWindow and HdyHeaderBar added for a new look.</li>\r\n  <li>HdyClamp is added for clamping it to max-width.</li>\r\n  <li>New waveform added for recording view and list row.</li>\r\n  <li>HdyWindowHandle added for window dragging during the recording view.</li>\r\n  <li>HdySqueezer added to the buttons to make view adaptive.</li>\r\n  <li>Recording re-naming functionality added to the row.</li>\r\n  <li>Delete and export recording options are added with revealer.</li>\r\n  <li>ListRow waveform dragging capability added for the player to seek through along with seeking buttons.</li>\r\n  <li>GstPlayer is implemented instead of traditional Gst pipelines.</li>\r\n  <li>Flatpak portal (GtkFileChooserNative) implemented for recordings.</li>\r\n  <li>Undo deleted recording notification added.</li>\r\n  <li>Waveform and whole UI adaptable to the Adwaita-dark theme.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the things have done so far in GSoC’20 and issue <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-sound-recorder/-/issues/40\">#40 “Design: Bring Sound Recorder Up To Modern HIG”</a> is now CLOSED.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There can be some bugs, right now we are hunting them down.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is link to all my commits : <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-sound-recorder/-/merge_requests?scope=all&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=merged&amp;author_username=kavanmevada\">gitlab.gnome.org</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you are interested in gjs and GTK application here some learning materials:</em><br />\r\nTutorials: <a href=\"https://readthedocs.org/projects/gjs-tutorial/downloads/pdf/latest/\">readthedocs.org</a>, <a href=\"https://gjs.guide/guides/gtk/gtk-tutorial/\">gjs.guide/tutorials</a><br />\r\nGuides: <a href=\"https://gjs.guide/guides/\">gjs.guide/guides</a><br />\r\nGJS: <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gjs/\">gjs gitlab</a><br />\r\nMost helpful -&gt; <a href=\"https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/\">gjs-docs</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is final look of Sound Recorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://kavan.js.org/assets/images/img-5.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole project is mentored by <strong>Bilal Elmoussaoui</strong> and <strong>Felipe Borges</strong>.

This back-end work involves methods that will be used to add or remove firmware, checking whether the firmware being added is acceptable/supported etc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Update</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of adding drag n drop support would allow addition of firmware through, well, drag n drop. Which would be an added bonus to the firmware UI that will be implemented after translations are taken care of after 3.38 release. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-233\" src=\"https://bloggingbecauseitsneeded.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ezgif-1-915c6499bd21.gif?w=800\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>My work here is to write a widget that can be easily added almost anywhere allowing that area to accept drops and install firmware. Not only that, but also give visual feedback of whether the dropped firmware has been successfully added or not.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The ideal way to do this would be by writing a widget that’s an overlay. Because the widget is an overlay, it would have the area presented to the widget it’s being attached to and would be able to give visual feedback through the shared real estate for better UX.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For any widget to accept drag, </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><code>Gtk.drag_dest_set (widget, dest_default, targets, actions);</code></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>line must be used. Here widget, is the widget surface that’s going to experience drag. The documentation for each parameter here can be read <a href=\"https://valadoc.org/gtk+-3.0/Gtk.drag_dest_set.html\">here</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The argument being passed as <code>dest_default</code> must be chosen carefully in my opinion. That is because, if the <code>dest_default</code> is <code>Gtk.DestDefault.MOTION</code>, whenever something is being dragged on the surface of the widget, this argument will forcefully emit <code>drag_motion</code> signal. But if <code>drag_motion</code> is connected to some other callback, that callback will be called twice due to it being connected to the default signal which would be emitted during a drag motion, and again by the destination default flag. Same with <code>Gtk.DestDefault.DROP</code>. In my widget, the <code>dest_default</code> flag was making the experience very clunky, so I simply passed a 0. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After setting the whole widget surface to accept drag, <code>drag_motion</code> was connected to a callback. This callback checks the target of the drag context. If the target is a list of uris, then the drag data is requested with a <code>checking</code> flag. Otherwise the <code>drag_status</code> is set to <code>0</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then in the callback for <code>drag_data_received</code> (which is called when drag data is requested) when the <code>checking</code> flag is active, the files being dragged on the widget surface are checked for their compatibility. To do this, a function was written in the name space of <code>FirmwareManager</code> class, which takes a <code>File</code> as parameter, and runs for a match for checksums of accepted firmware that are not installed yet, or if they are installed, whether these installed firmware files are corrupt or not. If all these checks are clear the function returns true and the file being dragged is an acceptable file, then the overlay is activated and the <code>drag_status</code> is set to <code>Gdk.DragAction.COPY</code>. Otherwise the function returns false, and the <code>drag_status</code> remains <code>0</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If the data is not dropped and simply leaves the widget surface, <code>drag_leave</code> signal is triggered. This activates a callback that deactivates the overlay if active and the surface reverts back to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If the data is dropped instead, then <code>drag_drop</code> signal is triggered, which again requests for drag data, but this time with a <code>dropped</code> flag. This way, when <code>drag_data_received</code> signal is emitted, the callback rather than checking the file again, simply tries to install the file that was dropped. After the dropped file installed, <code>drag_finished</code> is called. <code>drag_finished</code> is important as it tells the system that the drag n drop action has ended. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-232\" src=\"https://bloggingbecauseitsneeded.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=1024\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When drag action ends, the overlay shows the results of the drag process. If it was a success it shows a 1.5 sec success overlay after which all flags otherwise it shows an error message. After the overlay ends messages and flags are reset to prepare for the next drag.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-230\" src=\"https://bloggingbecauseitsneeded.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-1.png?w=1024\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With drag n drop implemented, the last things that needs to be done is the firmware page in the preferences UI in the user interface. But that needs to wait till the 3.38 release is over, after which translations will be implemented and work on firmware preferences page could be continues.</p></div>\r\n    ","descriptionType":"xhtml","publishedDate":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 22:17:13 +0000","feedId":10108,"bgimg":"https://bloggingbecauseitsneeded.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ezgif-1-915c6499bd21.gif?w=800","linkMd5":"e08eb56377d7f19483af4b493a1565b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/31/08-24-00-236_be8bf0ce1b29a267.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":450,"sourceBytes":6541494,"destBytes":4108866,"author":"Adwait Rawat","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://bloggingbecauseitsneeded.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ezgif-1-915c6499bd21.gif?w=800":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/31/08-24-00-236_be8bf0ce1b29a267.webp","https://bloggingbecauseitsneeded.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-2.png?w=1024":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/31/08-24-02-671_549f357248bc5f54.webp","https://bloggingbecauseitsneeded.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/image-1.png?w=1024":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn70@2020_5/2020/08/31/08-24-02-413_3afadab59ceb5018.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598862221270},{"createdTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-31 16:23:41","title":"How Does it work, A Full guide for EteSync module in Gnome Evolution app","link":"http://nourmat.wordpress.com/?p=303","description":"<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Welcome, in the past months I’ve been working on an <strong>EteSync</strong> module for <strong>Evolution</strong> so <strong>EteSync</strong> users can add their account to <strong>Evolution</strong> and mange all their data from there. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.etesync.com/\">EteSync</a></strong>, it is a secure, end to-end encrypted and FLOSS sync solution for your contacts, calendars and tasks.<br /><strong><a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution\">Evolution</a></strong> is a personal information management application that provides integrated mail, calendaring and address book functionality.<br />You can see all my past posts from <a href=\"https://nourmat.wordpress.com/blog-2/\">here</a> if you want to know more about the module.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is basically a tutorial on how to use the <strong>EteSync</strong> module in <strong>Evolution</strong>.
