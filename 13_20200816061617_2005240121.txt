These suggestions are based on the kinds of things most people write next, and that you yourself have previously written.</p>\n<p>Before the Digital Age, it was possible to take a more romantic view of the individuality and creativity of human beings. But these auto-suggestions remind us that rather than expressing ourselves with frank originality, we largely traffic in stock formulations.</p>\n<p>There is of course an element of efficiency in using language this way, at least when it comes to our more banal communications. But the matter of auto-suggested words parallels the same reality regarding choices with even greater significance.</p>\n<p>Some of society’s options for living represent time-tested traditions — distillations of centuries of experiments in the art of human flourishing. Many of our mores, however, owe their existence to expediency, conformity, laziness. Practices born from once salient but no longer relevant circumstances are continued from sheer inertia, from that flimsiest of rationalizations: “That’s the way it’s always been done.”</p>\n<p>While we want to believe we exercise radical free will, we very seldom create options anew, but rather select them from a predetermined menu of culturally-approved, often strictly dichotomized, choices.</p>\n<p>Right or Left? Urban or suburban? School-school or homeschool (but always something that starts in the fall, ends in the spring, and involves a set curriculum). In-state college or out-of-state college (but always, college).</p>\n<p>Which of these soul-sucking white collar jobs would you like to take?</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Sounds good!</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Awesome, thanks!</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">No problem!</span></p>\n<p>You don’t have to follow the path set out by the masses, or even the groove you’ve worn for yourself in the past. Rather than tapping auto-populated suggestions, author your own hitherto-unconceived possibilities. </p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-resisting-the-auto-suggested-life/\">Sunday Firesides: Resisting the Auto-Suggested Life</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com\">The Art of Manliness</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/YuIZynyd02g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 19:51:02 +0000","feedId":13,"bgimg":"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/Resist-Auto-Suggest-BLANK.jpg","linkMd5":"4acaca220b725a0a5351196595c9e326","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/16/06-15-49-577_36250aa33f3d0362.webp","metaImg":"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/Resist-Auto-Suggest-BLANK.jpg","author":"Brett and Kate McKay","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/Resist-Auto-Suggest-Header-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_2/2020/08/16/06-15-49-666_dd50af9499d38d96.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/YuIZynyd02g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/16/06-16-16-493_a212c120d5886bed.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 14:15:49","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 14:15:49","feedId":13,"fetchDate":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 06:15:49 +0000","fetchMs":91,"handleMs":18553,"totalMs":47031,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"54.171.123.112","hostName":"europe-020.herokuapp.com","requestId":"e7635aa3b0ea4ecea8f3847fa2e461a6_13","bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":2},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 01:23:36","id":13,"name":"The Art of Manliness","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheArtOfManliness","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/wp-content/themes/aom/assets/img/icon.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn32@2020_6/2020/08/16/06-15-30-987_184b6a9bfd562579.webp","description":"Men's Interests and Lifestyle","weekly":null,"link":"https://www.artofmanliness.com"},"extra4":{"start":1597558530688,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":107,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":18553,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":1780,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":28328,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":2,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://ancient-stream-41040.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":0,"successCount":1,"resultList":[200]},"http://hidden-journey-26361.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":0,"successCount":1,"resultList":[200]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/Resist-Auto-Suggest-BLANK.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/16/06-15-49-577_36250aa33f3d0362.webp","sourceBytes":85112,"destBytes":85112,"feedId":13,"totalSpendMs":1585,"convertSpendMs":0,"createdTime":"2020-08-16 14:15:49","host":"vast-inlet-04928.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=114181","linkMd5ListStr":"4acaca220b725a0a5351196595c9e326","extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"83.1 KB","destSize":"83.1 KB","compressRate":"100%"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2020/08/Resist-Auto-Suggest-Header-3.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_2/2020/08/16/06-15-49-666_dd50af9499d38d96.webp","sourceBytes":91834,"destBytes":91834,"feedId":13,"totalSpendMs":1601,"convertSpendMs":0,"createdTime":"2020-08-16 14:15:49","host":"ancient-stream-41040.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=114181","linkMd5ListStr":"4acaca220b725a0a5351196595c9e326","extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"89.7 KB","destSize":"89.7 KB","compressRate":"100%"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheArtOfManliness/~4/YuIZynyd02g","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1,"destHeight":1,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn35@2020_5/2020/08/16/06-16-16-493_a212c120d5886bed.webp","sourceBytes":43,"destBytes":72,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":13,"totalSpendMs":1120,"convertSpendMs":57,"createdTime":"2020-08-16 14:16:16","host":"hidden-journey-26361.herokuapp.com","referer":"https://www.artofmanliness.com/?p=114181","linkMd5ListStr":"4acaca220b725a0a5351196595c9e326","extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"43 B","destSize":"72 B","compressRate":"167.4%"}]}
