But what can we really say about where the vaccines have got us so far and where we are likely to be when the rollout is complete?</p> \n   <div class=\"rightshoutout\"> \n    <p>See <a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/tags/covid-19\">here</a> for all our coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> \n   </div> \n   <p>Recent <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00143-2/fulltext\" target=\"blank\">work</a> by a team from the <a href=\"https://maths.org/juniper/\" target=\"blank\">JUNIPER modelling consortium</a> provides some insight. It suggests that vaccination on its own is highly unlikely to eradicate COVID-19. However, it's got a key role to play in getting us out of the lockdown. Here caution is crucial, the work suggests. The slower the pace of relaxing the rules, the flatter the curves of future infection waves.</p> \n   <p>The team consists of epidemiologists from the University of Warwick: Sam Moore, <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/ed_hill/\" target=\"blank\">Edward Hill</a>, <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/mtildesley/\" target=\"blank\">Michael Tildesley</a>, <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/dyson/\" target=\"blank\">Louise Dyson</a>, and <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/matt_keeling/\" target=\"blank\">Matt Keeling</a>. Most of the team contribute to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-pandemic-influenza-subgroup-on-modelling\" target=\"blank\">Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling Group</a> (SPI-M) and Keeling is also a member of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation\" target=\"blank\">Joint Council for Vaccination and Immunisation</a>.</p> \n   <h3>How good are the vaccines deployed in the UK proving to be?</h3> \n   <p>There's a lot of uncertainty surrounding almost every aspect of the pandemic, and this applies to vaccines too. When they were first approved, <a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/how-were-vaccines-tested\" targe=\"\">clinical trials</a> had shown that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca were <a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/are-vaccines-safe\" target=\"blank\">safe</a> and effective enough to be put to use, but precise figures on just how well they work can only be obtained once large numbers are vaccinated.</p> \n   <div class=\"rightimage\" style=\"max-width: 350px;\"> \n    <img alt=\"Vaccine\" width=\"350\" height=\"239\" class=\"b-lazy\" data-src=\"/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/articles/2020/vaccine/vaccine_normal.jpg\" src=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" /> \n    <p></p> \n   </div> \n   <p>The data that has been collected since the roll-out started has provided a clearer picture. As Keeling reported in a <a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/vaccination-where-do-we-stand-and-where-are-we-going#video\">research talk</a> hosted by the Isaac Newton Institute last week, latest estimates say that the vaccines offer different levels of protection against different aspects of infection.</p> \n   <p> Ideally a vaccine would stop people from even becoming infected, but it's also possible that a vaccine merely stops you from developing symptoms. The crucial difference here is that a vaccine that only stops symptoms wouldn't block the onward transmission of the disease. The infection would still be able to circulate in the population and those who can't (or won't) be vaccinated wouldn't be protected. </p> \n   <p>Although there's still not enough data to be sure, the figures Keeling reported in his talk give ground for optimism. The vaccines appear to be between 50% and 80% effective at stopping people from even catching COVID-19, and therefore in blocking transmission, and around 90% effective in stopping them from developing severe symptoms.</p> \n   <p>The effect of the vaccines also increases from the first to second dose. In Keeling's talk he assumed that the level of protection against disease was 70% two weeks after the first dose, rising to 88% two weeks after the second dose. </p> \n   <p>These percentages are high but they're not maximal, and that's one reason why vaccination alone probably won't eradicate COVID-19. \"Because the shield [provided by the vaccines to the individual] is partial, it can be overcome by increases in the level of infection in the general population,\" says Keeling. In other words, some people will become infected with COVID-19 despite being vaccinated, and the more infection there is in the general population, the more we are likely to see such vaccine failures. </p> \n   <p>Another thing we couldn't possibly know before the vaccines were rolled out was just how many people would agree to be vaccinated. And here the numbers exceed expectations, in a good way: so far uptake in those over 60 is at 95%.</p> \n   <h3>Are we getting it right?</h3> \n   <p>The work of the JUNIPER team helped to inform how the vaccines are being rolled out, both in terms of the order in which groups of the population are being vaccinated, and in terms of the gap that is left between the two jabs. With both aspects there are different approaches that could have been taken: prioritising people with many social contacts over the old and vulnerable, for example, or aiming for fewer people getting both jabs quickly, rather than more people getting the first jab quickly.</p> \n   <p>The JUNIPER team began looking at vaccines strategies last summer (see <a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/who-should-be-vaccinated-first\" target=\"blank\">here</a>), using mathematical models that predict the number of cases, hospital admissions and deaths we are likely to see under various assumptions. There's always uncertainty of course, so the outputs of such models can't be regarded as sure-fire predictions. Instead they allow us to explore possible scenarios in an if-this-then-that kind of way. In the case of the vaccine roll-out, prioritising the old and vulnerable persistently turned out as the optimal strategy in the modelling, even as the underlying assumptions were being varied. This is basically the strategy that has been adopted in the UK. (See <a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/how-can-maths-fight-pandemic\" target=\"blank\">here</a> to find out more about mathematical models used in epidemiology.) </p> \n   <p>As far as the spacing between doses is concerned, <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.15.21253542v1.full.pdf\" target=\"blank\">recent work</a> by Hill and Keeling suggests that prioritising the first dose — giving as many people as possible one jab, rather than fewer people both jabs — is generally the best strategy for the vaccines and vaccine capacity we have. The policy adopted in the UK depended on a number of practical considerations — not least the fact that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is more effective after a 12-week delay between jabs. Hill and Keeling's work shows that the strategy also has benefits in terms of reducing the number of deaths.</p> \n   <h3>Where are we going?</h3> \n   <p> Mathematical models can also be used to explore what might happen in the future. The model employed by the JUNIPER team is detailed, taking into account, for example, the age structure of the population, geography, the B1.1.7 variant, and who has been vaccinated to date. It's one of the models that also helps scientists calculate the value of the famous <a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/maths-minute-r0-and-herd-immunity\" target=\"blank\">reproduction number <em>R</em></a> every week. \"Overall [the model] is supposed to give a fairly complete picture of what has been happening to date, and therefore we hope can give reasonable predictions of what is going to happen going forward in time, although there is always uncertainty with human behaviour,\" says Keeling. </p> \n   <p>The first question you might ask is what vaccination does to <em>R</em> — and the answer, according to the model, is that vaccination on its own is not going to get <em>R</em> to below 1. \"We're in a situation where vaccination can have a significant impact on <em>R</em>, but in these simulations it's not sufficient to drive R below 1. This is really saying that although the vaccine is doing well to control the disease, it's never going to put us in a situation where we can eradicate it without other controls,\" says Keeling.</p> \n   <div class=\"centreimage\"> \n    <img alt=\"Change in R as more doses are given\" width=\"600\" height=\"322\" class=\"b-lazy\" data-src=\"/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/news/2021/vaccines/keeling_r.jpg\" src=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" /> \n    <p style=\"max-width: 600px;\">This figure shows how the value of <em>R</em> is estimated to change as more doses of the vaccine are administered in the population, in the absence of any restrictions. The four different lines correspond to four different assumptions on how much infection the vaccines prevent, as shown in the key.

Even after four months of vaccination, if we stop all controls we get a disastrous result.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"centreimage\"> \n    <img alt=\"daily number of COVID-19 deaths  if restrictions were suddenly lifted in April\" width=\"430\" height=\"322\" class=\"b-lazy\" data-src=\"/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/news/2021/vaccines/keeling_april.jpg\" src=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" /> \n    <p style=\"max-width: 600px;\">This figure explores what might happen to the daily number of COVID-19 deaths if restrictions were suddenly lifted in April.

The JUNIPER team also looked at such gradual relaxation strategies and found that, according to their model, the slower the pace the smaller the outbreaks. \"A five month relaxation still gives a noticeable peak in deaths, even if [the vaccines offer] an 85% protection against infection,\" says Keeling. As we move to slower and slower relaxation, the outbreaks become less threatening.</p> \n   <div class=\"centreimage\"> \n    <img alt=\"daily number of COVID-19 deaths  if restrictions are relaxed over a 5 month period, a 10 month period, and a 14 month period\" width=\"600\" height=\"466\" class=\"b-lazy\" data-src=\"/content/sites/plus.maths.org/files/news/2021/vaccines/keeling_months.jpg\" src=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" /> \n    <p style=\"max-width: 600px;\">This figure explores what might happen to the daily number of COVID-19 deaths if restrictions are relaxed over a 5 month period (top left), a 10 month period (top right) and a 14 month period (bottom).

It's important to remember that things are developing very fast with new data on the efficacy of the vaccines becoming available all the time. \"Everything I tell you this week is likely to be tweaked and modified next week,\" Keeling says. However the general message from the simulations remains the same when the model is run on the latest information — although there is more optimism about how well the vaccine might prevent infection.</p> \n   <a name=\"video\" id=\"video\"></a> \n   <p> In summary, then, the modelling shows that vaccination isn't a silver bullet. It does, however, have a key role to play in helping us come out of lockdown. What exactly is going to happen, the model suggests, will depend critically on exactly how good the vaccines are at blocking infection, how slowly restrictions are released, and how many people agree to be vaccinated. In the longer term, waning immunity and new variants that can evade the vaccine, will change this simple picture — allowing further future waves unless we have repeated booster vaccine programmes.</p> \n   <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"b-lazy\" data-src=\"https://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/3466315/embed\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"></iframe> \n   <hr /> \n   <h3>About this article</h3> \n   <p>This article is based on <a href=\"https://www.newton.ac.uk/seminar/20210322120013001\" target=\"blank\">research talk</a> by <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/matt_keeling/\" target=\"blank\">Matt Keeling</a> hosted by the <a href=\"https://www.newton.ac.uk/\" target=\"blank\">Isaac Newton Institute</a> and a recent paper by Keeling and Sam Moore, <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/ed_hill/\" target=\"blank\">Edward Hill</a>, <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/mtildesley/\" target=\"blank\">Michael Tildesley</a>, <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/dyson/\" target=\"blank\">Louise Dyson</a>. </p> \n   <p>Sam Moore is a postdoctoral research associate who has been working on vaccination modelling for Covid-19 after joining the <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/\" target=\"blank\">SBIDER</a> group within the University of Warwick at the start of the pandemic last year.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/ed_hill/\" target=\"blank\">Edward Hill</a> is a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href=\"https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/\" target=\"blank\">SBIDER</a> group at the University of Warwick.
