Generally locks\n      are used to protect against concurrent modifications. But if the tasks\n      being performed are time consuming, like writing to a file, blocking all\n      the other calling threads until the task is completed can have severe\n      impact on overall system throughput and latency. It is important to make\n      effective use of compute resources, while still maintaining the guarantee\n      of one at a time execution.</p>\n\n<p><a class = 'more' href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/singular-update-queue.html'>more…</a></p>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":2215,"bgimg":"https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/card.png","linkMd5":"c132a5614ab18821a2ba441e573b2ee0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn29@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-40-51-307_75a9cc1b6393d9a1.webp","destWidth":560,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":23416,"destBytes":8996,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/card.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn29@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-40-51-307_75a9cc1b6393d9a1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598380824516}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:40:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-26 02:40:24","feedId":2215,"fetchDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 18:40:24 +0000","fetchMs":1378,"handleMs":5,"totalMs":29298,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":30,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"9128a42e23caa7de0e7439c434c47fc1","hostName":"europe21*","requestId":"739f1e97167e4e258a8abb9ec795d0c2_2215","contentType":"application/atom+xml","totalBytes":8996,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx23":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 21:31:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 23:07:39","id":2215,"name":"Martin Fowler","url":"http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/bliki.atom","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://martinfowler.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/24/15-07-31-098_375bd08801df538f.ico","description":"Master feed of news and updates from martinfowler.com","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":8996,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1598380823028,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":1483,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":5,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/card.png","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":560,"destHeight":300,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn29@2020_1/2020/08/25/18-40-51-307_75a9cc1b6393d9a1.webp","sourceBytes":23416,"destBytes":8996,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":2215,"totalSpendMs":1725,"convertSpendMs":9,"createdTime":"2020-08-26 02:40:50","host":"europe-23*","referer":"https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/singular-update-queue.html","linkMd5ListStr":"c132a5614ab18821a2ba441e573b2ee0,c132a5614ab18821a2ba441e573b2ee0","githubUser":"myreaderx23","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"22.9 KB","destSize":"8.8 KB","compressRate":"38.4%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx23":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
