Discover the improved Endpoints tool window, more informative URL completion, important Spring updates, and more. </p>\n<p>We invite you to test out all the new features by downloading the EAP from our <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/\">website</a>, installing it using the free <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/\">Toolbox App</a>, or updating to this latest EAP using snaps if you’re an Ubuntu user.</p>\n<h2 id=\"endpoints\">Endpoints</h2>\n<h3 id=\"reworked_endpoints_tool_window\">Reworked Endpoints tool window</h3>\n<p>In IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3, the <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/endpoints-tool-window.html\">Endpoints</a> tool window for JVM projects will be significantly redesigned. Starting with this EAP, the Endpoints tool window is now accessible for most projects from the bottom tool window bar by default. If it isn’t there, you can access it via <em>View | Tool Windows | Endpoints.</em> </p>\n<p>The standard view now displays a list of all the project endpoints grouped by module. In this update, you can hide endpoint descriptions to reduce the space the list takes up – click the gear icon and select <em>Compact List Items</em>. You can also use this window as a side panel – just drag and drop it to the left or right sidebar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Endpoints_DnD_Compact.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>You can browse through all the endpoints or use search to find the ones you want. There are Module, Type, and Framework filters to narrow down your search. You can apply these filters either by clicking on them or by typing in the search field. The search field has completion suggestions.. To apply multiple search criteria, click on a filter and choose <em>Select…</em> then tick the checkboxes of the filters you want. If you prefer typing, just put a comma after each search parameter. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Endpoints_Search.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In the redesigned <em>Endpoints</em> tool window, we’ve eliminated a lot of extra horizontal space in favor of providing additional information for each endpoint. We’ve added three new tabs: Documentation, HTTP Client, and Open API. Documentation is available for all endpoints, while the other two tabs are only available for web services that have associated URLs. </p>\n<li>\nDocumentation provides quick documentation for each selected endpoint.\n</li>\n<li>\nHTTP Client is an ad hoc tool that allows you to create requests and receive their results quickly. Click the <em>Submit Request</em> button and the response will appear in the lower part of the screen right away. This feature is primarily for testing HTTP requests, so requests and responses are not saved. If you need to use the whole set of features that the HTTP Client offers, click <em>Open in Editor.</em>\n</li>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Endpoints_HTTPClient-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<li>\nThe Open API tab lets you see how your endpoint looks in terms of the Open API standard. This can be particularly useful for mixed teams that include both backend and frontend developers, as the latter often prefer the Open API format for web services.\n</li>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Endpoints_OpenAPI-3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p> From this tab, you can create an Open API specification to use as a draft for a full description of your web service. To do so, click <em>Export draft of Open API</em> inside the window or select this option from the context menu. The specification will then open in the editor. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Endpoints_ApiSpec-2.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>This new UI is cleaner, faster, more informative, and more discoverable. We hope you like it, and we’re looking forward to getting your feedback. </p>\n<h2 id=\"urls\">URLs</h2>\n<h3 id=\"better_url_completion\">Better URL Completion</h3>\n<p>In IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3, URL completion will become more informative. This EAP introduces changes that give a more complete picture of each URL, including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nIcons that represent the frameworks you used to create a web service.\n</li>\n<li>\nHTTP methods.\n</li>\n<li>\nSource locations of the classes or files in which you declared the endpoint.\n</li>\n<li>\nStrikethrough for deprecated URLs. Deprecated URLs are also struck out in the <em>Search Everywhere</em> dialog and the <em>Endpoints</em> tool window.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/URL_completion-2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>From the completion dialog, you can now invoke the <em>Quick Documentation</em> popup for each suggested URL by pressing <em>Fn+F1</em> on Mac or <em>Ctrl+Q</em> on Windows or Linux. </p>\n<h3 id=\"url_inlay_hints\">URL Inlay Hints </h3>\n<p>This update helps you get the most out of your URLs. Previously you could only navigate to the URL using<em> Ctrl+click</em>. Now we offer more actions that can be accessed by clicking on the <em>globe</em> icon next to the URL. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/URL_inlayHints.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Note that these actions are currently available for the Spring MVC, WebFlux, Feign Client, JAX-RS, Micronaut, and Retrofit frameworks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"url_mapping\">URL Mapping </h3>\n<p>In this EAP, we’ve made it possible to search for URLs. To do so, just go to <em>Navigate | URL Mapping &#8230;</em> , press <em>⇧ + ⌘ + \\ </em> on Mac or <em>Ctrl + Shift + \\ </em>on Windows and Linux, or simply type <em>/url</em> in the <em>Search Everywhere</em> dialog. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/URL_search.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"spring\">Spring </h2>\n<p>We now support code insight for Spring MVC Functional Routing, and we display endpoints declared with it. For example, you can use the following filter in the Endpoints tool window to see functional handlers:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Spring_FunctionalReactive.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>The same support works for RestOperations, Spring WebTestClient, and Spring Reactive WebClient. </p>\n<p>Here is an example using Spring Reactive WebClient:  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Spring_Completion.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"spring_security_for_kotlin\">Spring Security for Kotlin</h3>\n<p>It is now easier to manage roles when using Spring Security for Kotlin projects, as we’ve added code completion and navigation. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Spring.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"http_client\">HTTP Client</h2>\n<h3 id=\"http_request_conversion\">HTTP request conversion</h3>\n<p>Quite a while ago, we introduced a new client for working with HTTP requests. Starting from v2020.3, we will stop supporting the previously accepted file format. If you still have any HTTP requests created in the old format, you’ll need to convert them. There are several ways to do this.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nOpen an HTTP request and click <em>Convert request to the new format. </em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Client_CovertOldHTTP.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nIn the Project view, select an HTTP request, invoke the context menu, and select <em>Convert Legacy REST Client File to New Format</em>.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\nFrom the new HTTP client, click<em> Convert… | Convert Legacy REST Client Files to HTTP Requests </em>and select the local file you want to convert.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/HTTP_convertNew.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"swagger\">Swagger </h2>\n<h3 id=\"external_references_and_other_code_insight_improvements\">External references and other code insight improvements </h3>\n<p>We significantly improved code insight for a number of cases. Of the changes we’ve made, the introduction of external object references was among the most requested. Let’s take a look at them in more detail. </p>\n<p>Now you can reference both local definitions within a current file and external ones kept in separate files. IntelliJ IDEA offers completion for the $ref keyword as you type. Once the reference is added, you can click on it for quick navigation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Swagger_Refs.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"swagger_hub_support\">Swagger Hub support </h3>\n<p>It is now possible to add API specifications from Swagger Hub. To configure this feature, go to <em>Preferences / Settings | Languages &#38; Frameworks | Open API Specifications</em>. </p>\n<p>In the <em>Remote Specifications </em>section, click <em>search SwaggerHub</em>. The IDE will open a search window with several filters. When you find the specification you need, click on it and then click <em>Add Selected</em>. It will then appear in the <em>Endpoints</em> tool window. To find it quickly, select <em>External</em> in the <em>Module </em>filter. </p>\n<p>You can paste an API key in the <em>Swagger Hub </em>section to search for private specifications. You can get your API key from your preferences page on <a href=\"https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/\">Swagger Hub</a>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Swagger_Hub.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"darcula_for_swagger_ui\">Darcula for Swagger UI </h3>\n<p>If you use the Darcula theme, this cute UI update is for you. When you switch on <em>Editor and Preview</em> or <em>Preview only</em> mode, the swagger preview is also displayed in the dark style. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Swagger_DarkUi.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"quarkus\">Quarkus </h2>\n<h3 id=\"run_configurations\">Run configurations</h3>\n<p>When you create a Quarkus project, the IDE automatically creates a Quarkus <em>r</em><em>un configuration</em>, allowing you to run and debug your application right away without any workarounds. To adjust the settings, click<em> Edit Configurations</em>. The settings in the <em>Environment</em> section will vary depending on whether you use Gradle or Maven to build your project. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Quarkus.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"micronaut_data\">Micronaut Data</h2>\n<h3 id=\"code_completion_for_repository_methods\">Code completion for repository methods </h3>\n<p>Micronaut data is an additional toolkit for the Micronaut framework that lets you write neater, more concise database queries. When you create repository interfaces, you must use predefined methods, and this version of IntelliJ 2020.3 EAP introduces completion for these methods. You can use them in sequence to create more complex queries. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Micronaut_Completion.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"query_annotation\">@Query annotation </h3>\n<p>You can use Micronaut  <em>@Query </em>annotation to create customized queries. It allows you to use the JPQL language for code fragments. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Query.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"jpa_console\">JPA Console </h3>\n<p>With <em>JPA Console</em>, you can write and run JPQL queries without having to run your Micronaut application. This console can be reached by opening the <em>Persistence</em> tool window and clicking on the <em>QL </em>icon at the top.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/JPAConsole.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>That’s all for this round of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition updates!
