Really hard.</p>\n<p>Most self-help books out there treat people like machines, blitzing past this difficulty and offering mechanical 5-step formulas for changing your life.</p>\n<p>My guest today says such simplified solutions hugely miss the mark. He argues that if you ever want to change, it’s more fruitful to understand why you don’t, than figure why you do, and to understand that, you’ve got to go deeper, existential even.</p>\n<p>His name is <a href=\"https://www.ellenhorn.com/ross/\">Dr. Ross Ellenhorn</a>, and he’s spent his career facilitating the recovery of individuals diagnosed with psychiatric and substance abuse issues. In his latest book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006296111X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=006296111X&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;tag=stucosuccess&#38;linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>How We Change (And Ten Reasons Why We Don’t)</em></a>, he’s taken what he’s learned in his work and applied it to anyone trying to change their lives.</p>\n<p>Ross and I begin our conversation with some of those reasons we don’t change, including the existential pressure of feeling like you’re solely in charge of making change happen, a dizzying amount of freedom and number of options for what to do with your life, and day-to-day factors which influence our level of motivation. From there we turn to the role of hope and faith in psychology, and how these forces can both boost and restrain your ability to change. We discuss the way a fear of hope can constrain your life, why you sometimes need to embrace staying the same in order to ever change, and the difference between good faith and bad faith. We then discuss the idea that you don’t develop hope, but can develop faith, and how you build your faith in yourself through embracing humility and taking small steps. Ross then explains why he doesn’t really give advice on how to change, beyond finding the good in a bad habit, but how patience and your social environment can also help.</p>\n<p>This show’s got some counterintuitive advice that will help you see your struggles differently</p>\n<p><em>If reading this in an email, click the title of the post to listen to the show.</em></p>\n<h3>Show Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Why is it so hard to make long-lasting personal changes?</li>\n<li>Why hope can be both positive and restrictive </li>\n<li>What is faith?

As Aristotle put it, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“every state is a community of some kind, and every community is established with a view to some good.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this, government is much like the trellises placed in gardens which allow certain plants to grow upwards, and support the weight of their branches and fruit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, however, we seem to be exclusively tending to the trellises in the garden of modern society, rather than its plants. We spend so much energy debating the best way to protect the Good, but insufficient energy investing in a Good worth protecting. We argue relentlessly about the form our political structures should take, but what, exactly, are we trying to grow?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Czech statesman and communist dissident </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Václav Havel</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> observed, “A better system will not automatically ensure a better life. In fact, the opposite is true: only by creating a better life can a better system be developed.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s hard to develop the better life that leads to a better system, when every aspect of the former is tainted by some slant on the latter. When every media outlet, entertainment avenue, celebrity, influencer, brand, and church — regardless of how tenuous their connection to politics — becomes entwined with partisanship, and every human good gets slotted into two artificially bifurcated sides, we lose the raw materials from which we could not only build happiness, but develop a vision of the system we desire, and the humane capacities which would enable it to function. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If everything is about politics, we cannot cultivate a healthy Good, and if we don’t cultivate a healthy Good, we cannot have healthy politics. </span></p>\n<div id=\"pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"
