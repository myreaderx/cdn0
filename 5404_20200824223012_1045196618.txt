For the chronograph crowd, there's not one, but three, including a Tudor Monte Carlo Home Plate, a Universal Genève Compax, and the nicest gold Breitling Chronomat that you ever did see. And as always, we're keeping things interesting with a few picks from left field, like a Ref. 4643 Super Precision from Rolex, and a small, Favre-Leuba dive watch for the female market. </p>\n  \t<h2>Breitling Chronomat Ref. 808</h2>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Breitling\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953194361-0u29jbr5f3x-09da82ae78967a61df7f512cedf45625/1.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>My horological fascination is rooted in the fact that something made up of so many finely crafted mechanical components is also capable of being hidden beneath a cuff, while serving a decently useful purpose in day-to-day life. Fuel was definitely added to the figurative fire upon learning of intricately executed complications, but over time, an appreciation for simpler routes to additional functionality developed. While it might not have involved a demanding, mechanical development, Breitling's Chronomat came into renown thanks to its patent-protected, slide-rule bezel. With top-quality examples becoming increasingly sought after with the passing of each year, it's safe to say that affording the capabilities of a combination chronograph and computer made some serious waves back in 1942. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Breitling\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953215913-sxbuecqk2wq-6196d6f082639a554ce0416ab6f12361/3.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>After first becoming available for purchase in the aforementioned year, the Chronomat enjoyed a relatively long production run comprised of multiple references. The Ref. 808 entered the picture in 1959, modernizing the comparatively antiquated Ref. 769, but it's still instantly recognizable as a Chronomat thanks to that unmistakable slide-rule bezel. As evidenced by the presence of both an arrow-style marker at the 12 o'clock position and a \"beaded\" bezel, this particular example dates back to the second wave of Ref. 808 production in 1966, and what an attractive example it is in 18k yellow gold. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Breitling\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953285152-sq1vgyww3ab-0c02626adf6a32c78642641a163e50e1/5.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The way the design of the bezel, chamfered lugs, and rounded pushers interact is nothing short of genius on this watch, which is why it's such a treat to see one preserved so incredibly well. Every last line on the case remains sharp, along with every hallmark and engraving – still boldly visible. The same sort of cleanliness can be seen on the dial, which is essentially free of any flaws. I've seen a few pretty much perfect Chronomats in my day, but never one of this series cased in yellow gold, and I must say, it's got me thinking. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Breitling\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953240708-psp155r52w-7baa0f2d426f64c019d847988d39e1f0/4.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>An eBay seller based out of Bethesda, Maryland, has this Breitling listed for $6,730.

The way most see it is that these are iconic pieces for a reason, and by wearing one, you're getting in on the history of something special. For others, exclusivity matters, and as a result, the commonplace fare just won't do. On several occasions in the past, having that communicated to me broadened my horizons, forcing me to explore what else the brand had to offer. Here's to hoping this next piece will do the same for you.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Rolex\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953452931-a7qgev35uq9-5258eba0892b9bf0efad323528faeba7/2.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>You're looking at a decidedly different sort of Rolex, which corresponds with the reference number 4643. These emerged during the mid-1940s, which was a somewhat transitional period for the brand, but not in the usual roll-out-the-white-gold-surrounds sense, given that Rolex had yet to establish some of their most impactful collections. Nonetheless, it's nothing short of a stunning watch with an ornately shaped case that ought to satisfy Rolex-curious contrarians and enthusiasts of the mainstream alike. I'd say it boils down to it simply being a watch you rarely see pop up for sale, and that's just the sort of thing that gets collectors going.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Rolex\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953482860-63zk8yrbu3-056c3099d085d4ed72ca72cb8907630b/4.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Measuring 28mm across, you'd be forgiven for thinking it would feel diminutive on the wrist, when in fact, the reference wears quite well. Generally speaking, square-shaped watches tend to wear a bit more substantially by virtue of being square, and this one is no exception. Something to note with this example is the condition of its dial, which, although original, is showing signs of its age. The seller offering the watch has included a second, aftermarket dial should you wish to swap, but I'd advise sticking with the one first fitted to maintain the original charm of the watch. </p>\n  \t<p>An eBay seller in Singapore is offering this Rolex for $6,500.

That's because, over the past decade, we've seen the market for vintage and neo-vintage watches from the Rolex sister brand grow exponentially, making many once alternative choices now quite conventional and obvious. Despite this, there are a select few relics of the back catalog that still stand out.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Tudor\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953626807-xc5nb029r6m-9267dcba98337ee703e40caaffef66ae/2.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>It's not an early Big Crown, but it's definitely one of the more notable vintage Tudors that later become synonymous with the brand and its different approach to the hard-wearing tool watch. In this \"Monte Carlo\"-style configuration, featuring luminous indices reminiscent of baseball's home plate and a funky, 1970s color scheme, the Tudor chronograph is undoubtedly at its best, which the market would agree with. There's still an objective difference in the enthusiasm that surrounds the collecting of these as opposed to Daytonas, but interest in them certainly isn't decreasing any time soon.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Tudor\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953646204-32u6n53cc5n-44d19adb57402c68c8720cd654136b41/4?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>This particular example is likely the nicest one on the market at the moment, and for that reason. If you've got a box, this piece checks it with a worn-though-unpolished case, clean dial, and still vibrant applications of orange found on the chronograph hand and outer tracing dial track. In other words, this is more or less what comes to mind upon mention of the reference, which is exactly what you want in an example of a watch like this. According to the seller, it apparently spent the last five years tucked away in a safe, so hopefully, it'll soon see the light of day on a more regular basis. </p>\n  \t<p>The Parisian dealer Harbor Watches has this Tudor listed for sale at €34,900.

Most of the time, the discovery of one such watch begins with the discovery of a lesser, though still compelling piece. The move isn't to get overexcited at first and pull the trigger, but to recognize the value of a good source and regularly keep tabs on their future offerings. That's what was going through my mind when I came across this piece that's to be sold by an Australian auction house. </p>\n  \t<p>Between all of the lively components that make up this watch, it's an absolute explosion of color. Ironically, the dial itself is a somewhat subdued grey and blue, but when traced by a red seconds hand and accented with a yellow checkerboard bezel, a louder look is the end result. It's a fun design that would surely turn some heads on the wrist. Believe it or not, ladies' variants of popular dive watches were common throughout the 1960s and '70s, and I'd argue this is easily one of the best. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Favre\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597954003990-bjgh9wesrm8-e202928c242028a89aab855df6343897/2?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Apart from its excellent condition, which can be seen best upon inspection of its uniquely shaped case and acrylic bezel, this example stands out as a result of the line in the auction house's lot description that reads \"boxed with papers.\" While it's not a game-changer to have an obscure ladies' dive watch with papers, there's no denying that their presence would be appreciated. In a time when vibrancy and color are so celebrated within the arena of industrial design, I couldn't think of a better watch for someone who's after a bold look. </p>\n  \t<p>This scaled-down Deep Blue is going up for sale at Leonard Joel Auctions of Melbourne, Australia, on September 21, when it'll be offered with an estimate of AUD 1,000-1,500. <a href=\"https://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/a-vintage-wristwatch-by-favre-leuba-243-c-6b549d0a75\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for further details</a>.</p>\n  \t<h2>Universal Genève Compax Ref. 22705-1</h2>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"UG\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597954149485-gsrsp761meq-832e6f5753cc4a4394184ce8c24545a7/1.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>To wrap up the week, we've got one last eBay pick, confirming that after a long drought on the bay, the waters are once again rising. It's a Universal Genève, and a misrepresented one, as contrary to what the seller has stated, this ain't no Tri-Compax. Instead, it's one of the loveliest Compax references to have emerged out of the 1960s – and it's also powered by the most notable sports chronograph caliber of the era. What's more – it makes for a great opportunity to train your eyes. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"UG\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597954178080-gjuywtmaz2m-5876cf3ebfcae1ce96d4e5de95ab2621/2.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>This is another one of those instances where you've gotta make do with what you've got and not allow less-than-ideal photos to stop you from making lemonade. The dial doesn't look 100 percent perfect, but there's one flaw that might not even be one based on my experiences in similar situations. Above the hour marker at 11 o'clock, there's what you might think is a significant mark on the dial, but I'd lean towards saying it's an area of the acrylic crystal that was gouged and now has some sort of dirt on its surface. That's because, in different shots, you can see ever so slightly more of the text below, which wouldn't be the case if it were truly marked. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"UG\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597954222883-ukuve52xxrn-798c10a9eb75c600a765d6debe7b7d25/3.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>I'm excited by the watch itself, but to be perfectly honest, I'm likely more interested in the ridged bracelet it's currently fitted to. It's an American-made J.B. Champion bracelet, but it features a Universal Genève-branded clasp and is similar to the bracelets many Polerouters were originally sold with. If you've seen one with minimal wear, you'll know this one is not that, but knowing the talent that's out there in the field of bracelet restoration, this could be brought back to its original glory if you wanted. All this to say, it's a nice addition to an already nice watch, and to have it included is a nice bonus. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"UG\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597954194675-xufza75hsw-0dd7640c8ec49134ea3526a961b7e7f4/6.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>This UG is being offered by a New Yorker on eBay in a sale ending on Saturday of next week.

This is not to be wondered at. In <i>Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>, the author, Robert Pirsig, is on a long road trip with a friend who has recently purchased a fine BMW motorcycle, the handlebars of which have begun to work loose. Pirsig advises making a shim to slide under the loose handlebar collars to help hold them in place and suggests cutting one out of a beer can. His friend reacts to this suggestion with irritation, despite the fact that sheet aluminum is actually an ideal solution to the problem. </p>\n  \t<p>Pirsig writes, \"But to my surprise he didn’t see the cleverness of this at all. In fact he got noticeably haughty about the whole thing. Pretty soon he was dodging and filling with all kinds of excuses and, before I realized what his real attitude was, we had decided not to fix the handlebars after all.\"</p>\n  \t<p>\"As far as I know those handlebars are still loose. And I believe now that he was actually offended at the time. I had had the nerve to propose repair of his new eighteen-hundred dollar BMW [the book was published in 1974 so don't be pokin' around looking for any $1,800 new BMW bikes today, my friends], the pride of a half-century of German mechanical finesse, with a piece of old beer can!\"</p>\n  \t<p>To me, one of the (many) larger take-aways from the anecdote is that someone who buys a fine mechanical watch, especially from brands which invest heavily in core timekeeping technology like metallurgy and escapement design, may actually be <i>averse </i>to understanding how the watch works – or, if not averse, at least uninterested, as having a grasp of the ins and outs of the mechanism is not the necessarily the owner's primary source of enjoyment in having the watch. There is nothing wrong per se with this, obviously. Plenty of people enjoy their cars immensely and feel perfectly legitimate pride of ownership without understanding how an automatic transmission works.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597855365513-chdmdfn7y4-c4c7672942cdaeea8afd80876d6cfdf7/979839_10200371300059982_1341631499_o.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>Leaving it to the pros: watchmaker at Patek's restoration department.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Moreover, the possibility of tweaking something mechanical is often part of what drives interest in mechanics, and a watch is not something that the average owner generally feels an impulse to tweak. Even back in 1974, when Pirsig lamented his friend's disinterest in the art of motorcycle maintenance, and when probably a lot more people were working on their own motorcycles, cars, and what have you than do so today, fiddling with the gubbins, as they say, was considered something best left to a watchmaker. </p>\n  \t<p>All this tends to set up watch owners and enthusiasts for a certain degree of detachment from the technical, and apparently stone-cold boring, aspects of horology – and especially the rather arcane world of escapements. But there is a great deal of pleasure, if you are inclined to find it there, in understanding escapements, because the principles behind escapement design are universal principles of physics and mechanics. Once you have a sense of what escapements are doing, ticking away in the darkness under the dial, you really don't look at your watch in quite the same way ever again and indeed, you may even look differently at the world. Miracles are usually defined partly by their singular nature. But though the technology of the escapement strives for, and at its best achieves, ubiquity (historically, the most successful escapements are widely adopted), it is nonetheless miraculous for that. Appreciating this fact is by far the most democratic pleasure fine watchmaking offers – why, you don't even have to own a watch to get in on the fun.</p>\n  \t<p>In examining the modern watch escapement, we'll focus on those which are most widely adopted (we will not attempt a general history of the development of escapements; HODINKEE's Nick Manousos has, however, <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/a-brief-history-of-escapement-development\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">provided a useful general overview</a>) . All industrialized watch escapements are attempting to solve the same basic set of problems, and in understanding how they resemble, and differ from, each other, we can come to a new and deeper understanding of what makes a watch a watch. </p>\n  \t<h2>The Escapement: What It Does</h2>\n\n  \t<p>Back to basics. Inside a mechanical watch – <i>every </i>mechanical watch – is a mainspring, which is at one end of a series of gears which transmit energy one to the next. The mainspring barrel is made to rotate by the uncoiling spring, and it in turn drives the center wheel, third wheel, and fourth wheel. The fourth wheel drives the <i>escape wheel, </i>which is the first part of the escapement proper, and the escape wheel and other escapement components work together to drive (or as watchmakers say, give <i>impulse</i> to) the balance.</p>\n  \t<p>Now the balance is a sensitive little thing – I should say the balance and spring because, without the spring, the balance is useless (and the other way around too, come to think of it). The balance is best understood, I've always thought, by looking at what it's trying to imitate, which is the pendulum. </p>\n  \t<p>Think of a pendulum that isn't swinging. The pendulum hangs straight up and down; it is fixed at its <i>point of equilibrium </i>and, like all equilibria, this is a rather boring situation. Leave it alone, and it will hang there for all eternity (or at least <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay\"><u>until the proton decays</u></a>, whichever comes first). </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597855855100-bvam9jdppi8-73e96675f3f81918fa5aeed51df73974/Simple_gravity_pendulum.svg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>An idealized simple gravity pendulum (<a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/admin/articles/8296/By%20Chetvorno%20-%20Own%20work,%20Public%20Domain,%20https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=5276335\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diagram, Wikipedia)</a>. Obviously, in the real world, rods have mass, frictionless pivots exist only at Hogwarts, etc. etc.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Give a pendulum a push, however, and it begins to swing – how long each swing takes depends on one thing only, which is the length of the pendulum. The pendulum will pass through its point of equilibrium at each swing. How far the pendulum swings depends on how hard you push it, natch. But because how hard gravity pulls the pendulum back <i>towards </i>its equilibrium point, depends on how far it swings <i>away</i> from its equilibrium point, the pendulum should be <i>isochronous – </i>the time of each oscillation should be the same, regardless of the amplitude. Isochronism is an essential property for any oscillator expected to act as a timekeeper. As it turns out, practically speaking, the pendulum is only isochronous for small amplitude swings but this basic description is enough to go on with. If the pendulum loses no energy, once set swinging, it will swing forever.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1572550033612-cw4sy75i6za-1deb3e1c88c4d7174cb4243963c4f64d/Mattheus_Hallaycher_Augsburg_1.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>Attempts were made to put pendulums in watches in the early days, with limited success. <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/this-pendulum-watch-from-1680-is-a-terrible-idea-beautifully-executed\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pendulum watch with verge escapement, 1680.</a></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>It will, at this point, have occurred to the alert reader that pendulums rather noticeably do <i>not </i>swing forever. Why? The short answer is friction. Friction can occur in two ways in a pendulum – the first is through air resistance, and the second is at the point where the pendulum is attached to its frame. (There are other extremely small losses – for instance, the frame in which the pendulum is mounted will never be perfectly rigid and, as it flexes, it drains energy from the pendulum into the ground, albeit in homeopathic amounts). You can reduce both to almost nothing, and makers of high precision pendulum clocks mounted their pendulums on knife-edge crystal suspensions in vacuum-sealed canisters, but no practical solution is perfect. Even in these situations, pendulums will still gradually lose energy to the environment as friction converts kinetic energy into minute amounts of heat. So, to keep the pendulum swinging, you must give it a push now and again.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597853735509-i2jol6k9vzp-7dc6a5718ce1818868500fffcbb06aec/Anchor_escapement_animation_217x328px.gif?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>Animation of a pendulum and anchor &#160;escapement; a<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=33176691\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nimation, Chetvorno, for Wikipedia</a></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Now you have created another problem. When you push the pendulum, you interfere with its natural frequency – a little, or possibly a lot, depending on when and how hard you push it. Ideally, the pendulum would be given impulse instantaneously, at its equilibrium point, and there would be no variation in rate. However, anything that actually physically impulses a physical pendulum will introduce errors. The problem is made even more severe if you want to have an actual clock. Now you not only have to keep the pendulum swinging, but you must also count each swing mechanically. You therefore need some sort of mechanism that both gives impulse to the pendulum and which, in doing so, advances a gear train. Such devices do exist – they are called escapements. </p>\n  \t<p>The anchor escapement is an example of this simple but wonderful device. The animation shows only three components. The anchor and pendulum are in grey and the escape wheel in yellow. The escape wheel is made to rotate – maybe by a weight attached to a pulley, or maybe by a mainspring barrel. As the escape wheel rotates, it is alternately locked and unlocked by the anchor, under the impetus of the pendulum. Every time the anchor unlocks the escape wheel, the escape wheel tooth slides along the curved <i>impulse face </i>of the anchor, giving the pendulum a push. You can see the beauty of it – the escape wheel advances one tooth; the pendulum gets an impulse; this is all you need, really, to have a clock. The name \"escapement\" is apt – with each oscillation, it allows one tooth of the driving wheel to \"escape,\" or advance.</p>\n  \t\n\n  \t<h2>Building The Perfect Beat: The Ideal Watch Escapement</h2>\n\n  \t<p>Let us now turn to the balance and spring. In a watch, there is no pendulum; rather, there is a balance and balance spring. The key point here is that the <i>balance </i>stands in for the pendulum, and the <i>balance spring </i>stands in for gravity. The balance is held at <i>its </i>equilibrium point by the spiral balance spring. If you give the balance a push, it will begin to oscillate; in one direction the spring tightens, and then releases energy to push the balance back to its equilibrium point; in the other direction, the spring coils expand, and release <i>that </i>energy to push the balance back in the other direction. The beauty of the spiral balance spring is that ideally, it is like gravity – isochronous, as the force of the spring will be proportional to the force of the impulse.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597855450127-psttbmg2lo-fcf5bfe790f646154e60a27f0fef5acf/1403238_10201479511284570_71387266_o.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>A balance with a rare spherical balance spring.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>If we look at the anchor escapement, however, we can see that it does not fully fit the definition of an ideal escapement. In an ideal escapement (and I owe a lot of this analysis to Daniels' <i>Watchmaking</i>, which for a lucid explanation of the principles of a practical watch escapement is very hard to beat), impulse would be applied instantaneously at the equilibrium point, in both directions, with equal force each time in order to ensure perfect symmetry of motion (especially important in a watch). There would also be no friction involved as this dissipates energy and affects the motion of the oscillator. The anchor escapement fails on both counts – not badly, by the way; you can get excellent performance out of it – but it is not an ideal solution. Moreover, the sliding friction at the escape wheel teeth and <i>pallets, </i>as the curved projections of the anchor are called, requires oil, and any oil will eventually thicken and evaporate over time. The viscosity of oils will also change with temperature, and this means that the ideal escapement would be oil-free as well. A watch escapement should be <i>self-starting</i> – that is, its design should be such that the watch will spontaneously begin to run once a certain amount of energy is wound into the mainspring. The escapement must have good <i>safety </i>– that is, it should not unlock accidentally if the watch is given a shock. And overall, of course, in giving impulse and counting oscillations, the escapement should interfere with the natural harmonic motion of the oscillator as little as possible. So we have a little checklist: </p>\n  \t<ul> <li>Impulse as close to the equilibrium point as possible, in both directions</li> <li>Minimal friction and, ideally, no oil</li> <li>Self-starting</li> <li>Good safety</li> <li>Minimal interference with the natural motion of the balance</li>\n</ul>\n  \t<p>All this means that designing a watch escapement that fits as closely as possible the requirements of an ideal escapement is a very tall order indeed, and if you think about it, you begin to understand why successful, practical escapements are very few and far between. Escapement design is something horologists have been fiddling with for 500 or so years, but while many are called, few are chosen, and the timeline of horology is littered with the sad, silent, inert corpses of escapements which enjoyed, as it were, a brief moment in the sun before fading and falling with all the poignant finality of a cherry blossom (oh, chaff-cutter escapement, we hardly knew ye). With this in mind, we can now look at some examples of escapements in modern watches.</p>\n  \t<h2>The One To Beat: The Classic Lever Escapement</h2>\n\n  \t<p>If you own a watch today, and it doesn't say Omega or Roger Smith on the dial, there is close to a 100 percent chance that you have a watch with a lever escapement. There are a number of very good reasons for this. One of them is simply longevity – the lever escapement, which evolved from the anchor escapement for clocks, appears to have been invented by Thomas Mudge in 1755, and it has been with us in one form or another ever since. It can be made in various configurations – tourbillons often have a side-lever, for instance, in which the ruby pallets are in a radial line to the center of the balance, rather than perpendicular to it, as in conventional lever watches – but the basic principles have been the same for almost 300 years. This means that when you buy a modern lever escapement mechanical watch, even a humble Seiko 5, you are getting the benefit of over three centuries of cumulative research and development, conducted by some of the finest minds in the history of the applied sciences – which is a pretty terrific thing, and the reason that good accuracy and precision are so widespread as to be taken for granted in modern horology.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597854978376-2kapytj7z19-0524ca460a1684df5e93b3a4e9ba8b39/watch101-movement-interior-309f11569c4111a8ee2d841b7a7fe08a1e89baf1e01ca99f8ae884d2190f2155.gif?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>A lever watch movement. Left to right, mainspring barrel, center wheel, third wheel, fourth wheel, escape wheel, and lever; balance not shown, for clarity. The animation is of an ETA 6497 which was originally designed as a pocket watch movement. In a classically set up watch, the center wheel turns once an hour and the fourth wheel, once per minute; the fourth wheel drives the sub-seconds and the center wheel, the motion works for the hour and minute hands.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>So how does the lever escapement stack up when you look at it against our checklist? Not bad, my friends, <i>pas mal. </i>It delivers impulse in both directions, and it is also self-starting. Moreover, the lever has excellent safety. The angle of the impulse and locking faces of the ruby pallets, and the escape wheel teeth, interact in such a way as to press the shaft of the lever firmly against its <i>bankings</i>, which is the term for the pins that prevent the lever from moving any further at either extreme of its swing. The fact that it takes quite a jolt to cause the lever to unlock accidentally gives the escapement great reliability and is a big factor in lever escapements having found their way into wristwatches that have all sorts of adventures, from mountaintop to sea bottom and everything in between. (As a side note, banking pins are usually adjustable, but they can also just be the solid walls of the well in the movement plate in which the escapement sits; these are so-called solid bankings, and they are one of the requirements of the Geneva Seal). </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597858029828-6ok83hqbz9b-0e018a391335c573f378212b7a93705e/Paletteankerhemmung.gif?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>Lever escapement animation; note the two banking pins, left and right.

Well, the lever's not perfect. For one thing, it doesn't deliver impulse completely symmetrically (you'll notice the lever arm is longer on the right than the left). Like any escapement, it introduces its own, characteristic <i>escapement error </i>– impulse is delivered as the impulse jewel on the balance passes through the notch in the upper tip of the lever, and there is a loss of energy as this happens. This, combined with other aspects of the escapement's geometry, tends to introduce a losing error – this losing escapement error is an inherent feature of the lever escapement which must be taken into account in the design and setting up of the rest of the watch.</p>\n  \t<p>The most formidable problem, though, is the sliding friction between the escape wheel teeth and the ruby pallets. Those teeth are scraping along those jewels, and there are no two ways about it. And although the friction isn't all <i>that </i>high – friction is proportional to load, and the loads in a mechanical watch are pretty low – it's not nothing. In a modern lever watch running at 28,800 vph, that scraping friction happens eight times per second. That is 252,288,000 times per year ... scrape scrape scrape. In five years, that's 1,261,440,000 times ... scrape scrape scrape. You need oil, and if the lever has an Achilles' heel, it's that it needs oil on those impulse surfaces, and oil, even the best, breaks down after a while. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1588098323093-y9ezmcj1at-a72c6d71b1c5e5afce5e6255e2967cc7/2020_mvt_crop1?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The two going trains, escapements, and balances of the <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-new-f-p-journe-chronometre-a-resonance-explained-hands-on\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2020 Journe Chronomètre à Résonance</a>, with twin Swiss lever escapements.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Still, the lever is tried and true. Think about it – just about <i>every </i>watch on Earth (except for some exotics, and of course, Omega, which we'll get to in a minute) uses a lever escapement. Even in watches with silicon pallets and escape wheels, the basic principle is the same. It is a somewhat humbling reminder to not get too up on your high horse about your watch – that 5711 you blew the kid's tuition payment this year on is using <i>exactly </i>the same basic mechanism as a Seiko 5. Okay, I'm being a little rhetorical there – after all, there are enormous differences in craft and execution, across the board – but given how many hundreds of escapements have been tried over the centuries, it is a remarkable testimony to the lever escapement that it is, if not the only game in town, still the biggest after so many centuries. </p>\n  \t<h2>Rolex: Chronergy And Chronometry</h2>\n\n  \t<p>Rolex is a funny beast. It's a company with an enormous budget for – well, you name it, they've got a budget for it that's probably bigger than anyone else's, and one place they spend big is on movement R&#38;D. A lot of what they patent never sees the light of day in actual products, but they do put a lot of time and research into making improvements on basic timekeeping technology, and one example of their efforts is the so-called Chronergy escapement. The Chronergy escapement is basically a Swiss lever but with some modifications intended to improve performance and efficiency. It was first introduced <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/a-rolex-patent-the-day-date-40-caliber-3255-and-thoughts-on-what-makes-for-real-advances-in-watchmak\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in the Day-Date 40mm, in 2015</a>, in the then-new caliber 3255. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/content_image/cb48f5d533b2d63ed4b6e931d07a43b4?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The 2015 Day-Date 40mm, with the Chronergy caliber 3255.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1466604898195-5ne437mg26g8nxkq-c034943750d6348e2065d04348b237cc/3255_1502jdm_001.tif?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>Caliber 3255.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Now, if we are being exact about things, and we should be, this is obviously not a new escapement per se. It is, however, an indication that refinements to the lever escapement can and are still being made, even today, and that research into how to refine the escapement further is an active project both at Rolex and elsewhere. The Chronergy escapement introduces a modified lever geometry, which allows more efficient delivery of energy, and the size of the pallet stones is reduced by half in comparison to the standard Swiss lever. The escape wheel is skeletonized to reduce inertial energy losses. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/content_image/4c369f84c984a3ce8186e2d37491ed63?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The Rolex Chronergy escapement. Note the skeletonized escape wheel teeth, reduced size of the ruby pallets, and offset lever geometry.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The lever and escape wheel are both made of a nickel phosphorus alloy, to reduce vulnerability to magnetic fields. One interesting feature of the escapement geometry is the angle of the lever with respect to the escape wheel. In a conventional lever escapement, the lever's centerline is on a direct radial line from the axis of the escape wheel, but in the Chronergy escapement, it's slightly offset. All these changes to the standard lever were made with a view to increasing efficiency – the Chronergy escapement is, according to Rolex, about 15% more efficient than a standard lever. Overall, if we stack up the Chronergy against our checklist, we see that it's still got essentially all the strengths and weaknesses of the standard Swiss lever, but with stronger strengths and diminished weaknesses. It is a testimony to the basic soundness of the lever escapement that working on refining it is still very much a valid strategy horologically.</p>\n  \t<h2>The Nerd Who Hit The Big Time: The Co-Axial Escapement.</h2>\n\n  \t<p>The co-axial escapement is, like the Theory of Special Relativity, the result of a thought experiment. Einstein famously asked, what would the world look like if you rode on a beam of light? George Daniels asked himself a slightly different question: How do you get the benefits of both the lever and the detent escapement into a single escapement design, without having the weaknesses of either?</p>\n  \t<p>Okay, so this is a tricky one. The detent escapement is often also called a chronometer escapement, as you often find them in boxed ship's chronometers. Their history is long and complex and has to be left for another time, but for our purposes, it is enough to understand that the detent escapement is nearly ideal in principle. Most significantly, there is no sliding friction in a detent escapement – in fact, there is no lever or anything like a lever. The escape wheel delivers impulse directly to the balance. This means that the detent escapement does not need to be oiled and so should have superior long-term rate stability in comparison with the lever.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597864863011-iwmnj9uk6qh-049dbcd1a2104dbeaf08f0fc8519016c/Diagram_of_the_chronometer_detent_escapement_Brittens_Clock_and_Watchmakers_Handbook_9th_Edition_1896.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The detent escapement, as designed by Thomas Earnshaw. The detent (flat component, <i>e</i> through <i>h</i>) holds the escape wheel in place via the locking pallet <i>d</i>. As the balance, <i>b</i>, rotates counterclockwise it pushes the detent down, pressing on the tip of the gold spring, <i>i</i>, unlocking the escape wheel <i>a</i>. The escape wheel rotates clockwise, and one tooth pushes on the impulse pallet <i>c</i>, giving impulse to the balance. On the clockwise swing of the balance, the unlocking pallet of the balance lifts the gold spring up but does not unlock the detent, and no impulse is given.

Spherical balance spring on the cut compensation balance.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>So if the detent escapement is the best thing since sliced bread, how come you don't find one in every watch? Well, a cursory inspection of the detent escapement reveals its major weakness – it unlocks if you look at it crosseyed, and for that reason, it is unsuitable in general for use in a wristwatch (now, there have been modern watches <a href=\"http://www.frodsham.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">made with detent escapements</a>, but these are in the minority). George Daniels was not the first watchmaker to whom it had occurred to try and combine the best properties of the lever and detent escapements, but he was the first to make it work in a design that eventually could be adapted, with some modifications, to large scale production.</p>\n  \t<p>Today, there are just two places to get a co-axial escapement – one is Omega, of course, which has been continuing to create new versions of the co-axial escapement since bringing out the first co-axial watch – a limited edition – in 1999, and the other is Roger Smith, who has also been making continual updates and modifications to the original co-axial escapement. Omega's alterations to the design involve modern materials science solutions, while Roger Smith continues to follow an approach which emphasizes classic watchmaking materials and construction, as well as, of course, an extremely artisanal approach to watchmaking vs. the industrial-scale watchmaking taking place at Omega. I would emphasize as well that each has its place and each requires its own idiosyncratic, and I think admirable, set of skills and ways of thinking (that said, if some unknown rich uncle ever dies and leaves me untold lucre, I will bespeak a watch from Roger quicker than you can say lift angle and die a happy man, or at least, less unhappy).</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1557249793310-7nhu05vppz7-669c727bc474c1ca42e16e1f7bda908d/B89A8935.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1557249853315-dc1gpjxin-94ecfd4cf33278544a07fa87a37fdf44/B89A8957.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>Closeup of the co-axial escapement in an <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/george-daniels-watches-phillips-geneva-may-2019\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Anniversary watch made by Roger Smith </a>to George Daniels' design. Note the upper and lower set of escape wheel teeth.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The action of the co-axial escapement can seem quite confusing at first, and if you find it hard to follow even in an animation, believe me, you're not alone. The escapement has two escape wheels – one smaller with half-ogive teeth, and one larger. Both are on the same axis, hence the name \"co-axial\" escapement. As the balance (shown upper right in the schematic animation below) swings clockwise, the smaller jewel on the balance roller unlocks the escape wheels while, at the same time, a tooth on the larger of the two escape wheels impulses the balance directly, via the larger impulse jewel on the balance. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597867077171-eon0pzj881c-3b5bab67cb0b4b4235c56991c0382092/CoaxialEscapement_1.gif?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>Simplified schematic animation of the co-axial escapement; animation, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=69915452\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adithyamc Gaming, Wikipedia.</a></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>As the balance swings counterclockwise, the smaller jewel unlocks the escape wheels again but this time, the smaller wheel with half-ogive teeth pushes on the center pallet on the lever, and the lever gives impulse to the balance <i>indirectly. </i>Interestingly, the only lever pallet which actually transmits impulse to the balance is the central one – the two outer pallets on the lever are there just to lock the escape wheel. The lower pallet locks the escape wheels on the counterclockwise swing of the balance and the upper, on the clockwise swing of the balance. As you can see, it is quite literally half lever escapement, half chronometer escapement – in one direction impulse is indirect, via the lever and in the other, direct via an escape wheel tooth.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1522081275246-asaz39kol0a-5d7ae37be09312ef440be0fe610ca5dc/P3261590.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>An Omega Seamaster 300 <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/omega-seamaster-professional-diver-300m-co-axial-master-chronometer-hands-on\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">co-axial watch, 2018.</a></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>In general outline, the story of the industrialization of the co-axial is well known – it took quite a bit of time and quite a bit of money but, today, the escapement is found in almost the entire Omega product lineup, which is to say, hundreds of thousands of watches a year. Apparently, Omega oiled the first version of the co-axial – a modified ETA 2892 – very lightly on one driving surface, but it was not at the impulse surfaces, and <a href=\"https://www.timezone.com/2002/09/16/the-omega-deville-co-axial-part-4/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">when Walt Odets looked at the escapement back in 2002</a>, he remarked that he felt it was not a critical issue.</p>\n  \t<p>How does the co-axial escapement look, stacked up against our little list of criteria? It looks pretty damned good. The escapement does not require oil, impulse is given in both directions (albeit directly in one and indirectly in the other – I wonder if getting the amount of energy delivered in each direction to match up wasn't a big part of the challenge in making the escapement work, especially given the fact that the two impulse pallets on the balance roller are so far apart) and it is self-starting. Safety appears to be good as well, and long-term rate stability ought to be excellent. Despite some teething problems (which you have to expect) with early versions, Omega seems to have had the the kinks worked out for some time now. And, of course, if you want a different expression entirely of the co-axial, in something which connects more directly to George Daniels' philosophy of watchmaking, there is always Roger Smith. I think the only downside to the co-axial from a broader horological perspective is its complexity. You could make an argument, perhaps, that having an oil-free escapement is of diminished importance when you bear in mind that the watch will have to be serviced sooner or later anyway. But if a wristwatch can run for eight to ten years, say, with unchanged rate stability right up until it's serviced – well, that ain't too shabby.</p>\n  \t<h2>The Contender: The Grand Seiko High Beat Dual Impulse Escapement</h2>\n\n  \t<p>This is the newest escapement among the four we're looking at here, and so far, it exists in only a single caliber, in only a single watch, and so its inclusion ought to be taken as somewhat provisional. The escapement is the <i>only </i>high-beat escapement in this particular roundup. Given the fact that it appears in an entirely new movement, and that the movement can reasonably be expected to show up eventually in other high beat Grand Seiko calibers, I think it is worth looking at a bit more closely. The movement is caliber 9SA5 and <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/grand-seiko-slgh002-9sa5-escapement-in-depth\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the watch is the 60th Anniversary SLGH002</a>. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1588265195435-y9mc7u0nhzl-744820ba3fa577645ecc3cf2d5fbfcfd/IMG_0257.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1588341170263-id5ojzhjrvb-4b847393a9abe940624543a1f38bf495/IMG_0314.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>If we take a look at the escapement more closely, we see a number of interesting features as well as a number of respects in which it relates, from a conceptual if not an actual engineering perspective, to both the lever and co-axial escapements.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1583261016456-tzwodbeq87m-2d8b30292e830ce3cdb01569f37871a7/9SA5_escapement.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The escape wheel can be seen on the left, and you'll immediately see that it is quite different from either the co-axial or lever escape wheels. The escapement gives impulse in two directions – in one direction indirectly, via sliding friction between an escape wheel tooth and a lever pallet, and in the other direction directly, via an escape wheel tooth engaging with the impulse jewel on the balance roller. (For an animation showing the action, check out our earlier coverage of the movement, <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/grand-seiko-slgh002-9sa5-escapement-in-depth\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">right here</a>). The movement also features the use of a freesprung, adjustable mass balance and an overcoil balance spring, and this, in combination with the high frequency and unique escapement design, clearly seems to represent an ambitious step on the part of Grand Seiko to up its horological game and become even more competitive with the major players in Switzerland. It's an ambitious move.</p>\n  \t<p>Judged against our list of criteria for a modern watch escapement, the GS Dual Impulse escapement seems very promising. It is self-starting (this is per Grand Seiko) and gives impulse in two directions; it offers a high-beat solution to the rate stability problem, and it shares the co-axial escapement's basic strategy of giving impulse directly in one direction, and indirectly in the other. One of the many respects in which it <i>differs </i>from the co-axial escapement is in the use of lubricant – the indirect impulse is via sliding friction between an escape wheel tooth and a lever pallet, requiring oiling. However, the escapement is overall more efficient than a standard Swiss lever, and it will be interesting to see how widely it is deployed across the larger GS product lineup – between, this, the MEMS-fabricated escapements used in other mechanical GS watches, and Spring Drive, Grand Seiko is now bringing a diverse range of technologies to the table. </p>\n  \t<h2>The Exotics</h2>\n\n  \t<p>The four escapements mentioned above, for all their differences, have one major feature in common: they are either produced at an industrial scale or are clearly intended to be produce-able at an industrial scale. However, we can't leave the subject of escapements without at least mentioning some more experimental and even exotic escapements, which have all been made in relatively smaller numbers, but which also show that the urge to continue to explore what an escapement is, and how it works, is far from dead in modern horology. Developing new escapements is extremely expensive and very risky, but that has not stopped brands from trying. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1466021516396-1exks5b2klpoj0rj-415f9bd006119cd20cb3506f2164fd43/20010841_copy.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The Ulysse Nardin Anchor escapement,<a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/a-look-toward-the-future-with-the-ulysse-nardin-anchor-tourbillon#&#38;gid=1&#38;pid=2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> in the Anchor Tourbillon, 2016.</a></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1505356490287-ytyfq83t54-0edf347821ee05bc38cdc1e98904fe45/zen_jack.gif?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p><a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/zenith-defy-lab-oscillator-introducing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zenith Oscillator in the Zenith Defy Lab</a>; frequency, 15 hertz, or 108,000 vph.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>A far-from-comprehensive list would include a number of escapements from Ulysse Nardin, since the introduction of the Freak 20 years ago; the Zenith Oscillator <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/zenith-defy-inventor-introducing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in the Zenith Defy Inventor</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/parmigiani-fleurier-senfine-watch-model-to-movement\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Genequand oscillator</a> which Parmigiani Fleurier had under development at one time, and many others. Many of these escapements rely on the elastic properties of silicon. Watchmakers have also produced timepieces that update older escapement designs, using modern engineering methods – one such escapement is Breguet's \"natural\" escapement, with <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/how-modern-watchmakers-are-grappling-with-one-of-breguets-greatest-inventions-and-its-not-the-tourbillon\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">versions made by Kari Voutilainen, Laurent Ferrier, and F. P.

The number of such experimental and concept-watch escapements is bigger than many of us might suspect, and while they tend to be announced with enormous fanfare, for any of them to result in large scale series production is a much rarer event, but there is always a chance a breakthrough might be made and a new escapement that eclipses the lever and its derivatives will take center stage. In the meantime, smaller production watches with non-lever escapements continue to add an enormous amount of interest to the horological landscape.</p>\n  \t<h2>The Future</h2>\n\n  \t<p>That said, the lever is looking pretty solid, and although new materials and tweaks to its geometry continue apace, it's still a tough design to beat, to make a feeble pun. One wonders what Thomas Mudge would think, if he could be brought into the future and shown how many offspring his original idea has birthed. The story of the modern watch escapement is an astonishing saga of flashes of inspiration, centuries of patient refinement, and incredible creativity in mechanical engineering. And while it is easy to think that when it comes to watchmaking, they don't make 'em like they used to, the truth is it is hard to consider the evolution of the modern escapement closely and avoid concluding that we've never had it so good.</p>\n  \t<p><i>I would like to especially acknowledge the work of the various individuals who created the animations in this article and made them available on Wikipedia. I am also indebted very much to the many watchmakers and horologists who have patiently explained their work to me over the years.

in 2017. As it turns out, however, the idea of doing a dive watch was, according to Ming Thein and the company that bears his name, already gestating. In retrospect, there have been, both with the first Ming watch and with subsequent models, clear signs that the company's obvious interest in exploring both the technical possibilities and aesthetic possibilities of its unique approach to watchmaking might well be applied to a diver's watch. The Ming 18.01 H41 launched in its first series earlier this month (and rather predictably, sold out almost immediately), but on August 22 at 2 AM GMT, the second batch will go live. In between the first release and the second, we were able to take a look at the watch in person.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597943059657-cqr7o48yrop-b713fb0ce63945408049a4bbf1995640/729A9449.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>First, right off the bat, this is instantly recognizable as a Ming watch, having the same general design language we've seen in Ming watches going all the way back to the very first. The three key elements found in Ming watches across the board are a copious use of Super-LumiNova for both better legibility and as an abstract design element; the signature flared lugs; and a commitment in general to keeping the size of the watches within reasonable, even classic, parameters. Ming's first dive watch was actually a 10-watch prototype series, <a href=\"https://ming.watch/products/ming-18-01-abyss-concept\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the 18.01 Abyss Concept</a>, which established virtually all of the basic elements of the full production 18.01 H41 with the exception of the case material – while the Abyss Concept had a brushed 316L stainless steel case, the production watches are available in either grade 5 titanium or DLC (diamond-like carbon) treated stainless steel. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597952848945-blh972sy2qi-bd7020e3687a374ae5e122cbd6c219d4/729A9474.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The watch specs belie the very wearable size (40mm diameter, 12.9mm thick, 46mm lug-to-lug) of the watch; water resistance is 1,000 meters/100 atmospheres, or about 3,280 feet – that is about three times the test depth of a modern nuclear attack submarine. It is certainly true that such depth ratings are manifestly overkill and largely serve the function, to the extent they have one, of making the watch a conversation piece, but it is still fun to think that the watch can tolerate pressures that might have made the fictional sub <i>Red October </i>implode. The 18.01 H41 is also the first Ming watch to have a center seconds – in fact, it is the first Ming watch to have any kind of running seconds display at all, but obviously, this is an essential element in a dive watch, where it aids not only in precision timekeeping but also in letting a diver know the watch is functioning, both topside and at depth. </p>\n  \t\n\n  \t<p>The dial is, as is usually the case for Ming, a fairly complex construction; it's a two-level sapphire construction with HyCeram Super-LumiNova XI (this is a luminous ceramic composite). Super-LumiNova XI is applied to the bezel as a liquid epoxy and to the hands as a solid material. There are any number of luminous watches whose lume you don't especially notice unless it's nighttime, but occasionally, you find yourself wearing one (the various Seiko divers have this property) that glows noticeably even in slightly dim ambient light. During the time I've had the 18.01 H41, it has surprised me on several occasions by doing so in an elevator after coming in from a bright afternoon. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597944620761-gg3xkzn7175-4990165d1fd0d6f2670b5cc446d05bbb/729A9466.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The bezel is DLC-treated stainless steel, loaded with copious amounts of lume.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The bracelet is in Grade 5 titanium as well, and both the bezel and caseback have been treated to give them a slightly roughened surface, to ease turning (in the case of the bezel) and to help keep the watch in place on a wet arm or wetsuit sleeve. I'm not a diver, but were I one, I would probably want some sort of micro-adjustment clasp, but the upside to not having one is a very elegant and seamless bracelet.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597943093652-2ra6lehfkly-e5dfa93b805bb9cb0826c6a4dde5ee4d/lumeshot?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597943113298-9vvno7zftvp-4ebe025a5fb6a930899c1d2bdda81b42/729A9456.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953137990-ysiw6zxdwd-2112e46369cb491d1d3028a3ba31cb38/729A9459.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n    <figcaption></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  \t<p>The sixty-click bezel has, in a departure from standard dive-watch practice, no knurling at all; however, the slightly roughened surface provides a good grip, and the bezel feel is pleasantly exact. There is no play to speak of at each detent, and the sound of each bezel click is oddly pleasant to listen to. Weird as this may sound, it has a rich, rounded quality which, when combined with the precision of its operation, makes you feel like you're interacting with a piece of real precision machinery. The only downside to the bezel is that, with no knurling, it's somewhat more difficult to turn with wet hands, although it's still possible. One additional use for the bezel is that you can use it to help set the watch, by turning the bezel so that the inverted triangle at the zero position is on the nearest five-minute mark to the position of the minute hand. The movement, an ETA 2824, is adjusted to five positions but, without minute markers on the dial, setting the watch to the exact minute can require some estimating, and using the bezel as a visual reference helps clarify the actual position of the minute hand.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597944639647-5xsfrf49aew-bfe919d90c458db874a118825d419dfb/729A9468.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>One of the many nice touches in the watch is the visible indicator – a bright red gasket, it looks like, set around the crown tube – which is exposed if the crown is left unscrewed; it is not only practical (diving with a watch with an unscrewed crown could lead to a flooded case), but it is also just fun to look at and adds to the impression that the watch is ready for you to injudiciously submerge yourself beneath 3,000 feet of water at a moment's notice.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597953171257-vrtqihx3dm-9fb451d24a10ff0c1dad12338667dd3a/729A9461.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597945543536-6nu7zn9uszb-cd2a6de45b005a41832581af9ce86efc/729A9475.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Although you probably won't spend a whole lot of time looking at it, the back of the 18.01 gives the same impression of precision and care in manufacturing and design as the front. There are six very deep holes milled out for a caseback wrench, which should give any watchmaker who works on the watch an excellent grip, and verbiage is informative but also, unsurprisingly for a Ming watch, well-integrated as a design element as well. That little crab is a reference to the aquatic, of course, but it's also a little bit of a Ming in-joke about the case shapes of their watches as seen in profile, and there is even a morphology of Ming \"crabs\" <a href=\"https://ming.watch/blogs/news/field-guide-to-the-mingverse-crabs\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on the company's website</a>.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597945564033-hffrozbdj4s-46959b516021697a77a76b4b42fe2325/729A9474.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The Ming 18.01 H41 is a quite exciting watch to wear. Diver's watches have a cookie-cutter similarity, and for a reason – the technical features that make a dive watch both compliant with the specifications of the international dive watch standard, and simply practical from a functional standpoint, tend to create a lot of necessary similarities. Within those constraints, however, I think Ming has managed to produce a dive watch that ticks all of the boxes in terms of functionality and then some. As is usually the case with Ming watches, the pleasure is as much in the abstract properties of the watch as in its utility – that one-kilometer depth spec is an impressive number on its own, but to do it in a watch that doesn't look like it belongs on the tentacle of the Kraken instead of a human arm, is unusual and interesting. And if, like me, you have a helpless love of anything that glows in the dark, you're going to love the 18.01 – it's hard for me to look at it in the dark, with its eerie UFO-like profile and glow, without starting to hear the theme from <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind </i>in my head.</p>\n  \t<p><i>The Ming 18.01 H41: case, grade 5 titanium, 40mm x 12.9mm, and 46mm lug-to-lug. 3.5mm-thick sapphire crystal with double AR coating; DLC coated one way, 60-click stainless steel bezel filled with Super-LumiNova XI.

Equal parts rock 'n' roll and rebellion, the Place Vendôme Tourbillon: Dark Matter is the touted \"bad boy\" of the Place Vendôme Collection – the black sheep of the family, who doesn't care what time mom and dad said curfew is. The Place Vendôme Tourbillon: Dark Matter is named for a substance that is far more unknown than it is known – a mystery in many ways. What we do know is that this is an iteration of an existing Place Vendôme Tourbillon design using sportier materials such as titanium, and ADLC coating. As far as the name goes, you would be far better off asking HODINKEE Editor-in-Chief Jack Forster about the complexities of dark matter than I, so for now, we will just stick to the watch.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597954367519-is2jbbzgzr-9ec24ce4648ab914063bf6f967b74537/15.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>\n\n  \t<p>The Czapek name has some horological history behind it. Czapek was a foundational partner – some 200 years ago – of the brand that would eventually become known as Patek Philippe. The name Czapek went defunct for years before being revived, in its current form, in 2012. Since then, the new Czapek &#38; Cie has made a name for itself, relying heavily on collaboration with artisans at all levels of watchmaking, and delivering serious haute horology timepieces through those partnerships. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598024105903-nht39w1inna-03413c223e3e371d839ecfa21d7114e3/1.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The Place Vendôme Tourbillon: Dark Matter is cased in grade-five titanium, with a black ADLC coating. This same coating was used on Czapek's Faubourg de Cracovie \"Courage Every Second\" chronograph for \"Only Watch\" in 2019. The case size for this new release remains 43.5mm. While this watch is quite similar to its forebearers in many ways (see our Hands-On with the <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/czapek-place-vendome-tourbillon\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Place Vendôme Tourbillon Suspendu 'Ici Et Ailleurs' here</a>), the brand is calling the Dark Matter \"the rebellious brother in the Place Vendôme collection.\" </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598024558934-rk4dsgkjiup-7268fb51305edcd4f321201c0ea753b2/7.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>In terms of functionality, this is a dual-time watch with a tourbillon, day/night indicator, and power-reserve meter. The dial configuration is consistent with – if not identical to – other variants in Place Vendôme collection, with five points of interest. The essential time-telling function is found at the top of the dial, with a power-reserve indicator just beneath it. The righthand section of the dial houses the second time-zone indicator with a grey arrow on the bridge, and the lefthand section houses the tourbillon. The day/night indicator resides at the bottom of the dial. Overall, the dial is finished in black enamel, with polished steel bridges with PVD coating, and an anthracite sand-blasted plate.

In the paradox, a cat is locked inside a sealed box, with a vial of cyanide and a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, the vial is broken and the cat dies; if not, the cat lives. The problem is that atomic decay is a quantum process, meaning that there is at any moment, not a certainty, but a probability, of the atom decaying. Quantum mechanics, unfortunately, seems to say that the cat is both alive and dead at the same time, in what is called a quantum superposition. What exactly the hell that means is something physicists and philosophers have been wondering ever since, and a new very sensitive experiment seems to both confirm many weird aspects of quantum theory as well as leave open the possibility of such apparent absurdities as causality traveling backwards in time. This is done by simulating the heir to the Cat: Wigner's Friend, who is observing a quantum process and who is, in turn, being observed. Things get very strange when the observer is observed in turn. A mind-bending story with a lot of twists and turns, but well worth the effort if you were, you know, getting too complacent about the basic nature of reality.</p>\n<p><i>– Jack Forster, Editor-in-Chief</i></p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Swimpruf\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598042688567-q4tnsnzcoxr-e69977738f7781cd3e1e98dba924d1db/https---bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com-public-images-255cbd1d-1732-4c7b-9a4c-efc541ce6756_6016x4016.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>Image via linked article</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p><a href=\"https://swimpruf.substack.com/p/whats-this-all-about\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>What's This All About? – Swimpruf on Substack</strong></a></p>\n  \t<p>My longtime friend, co-host, compatriot, and colleague Jason Heaton has launched a personal newsletter for all sorts of his writing that exists beyond the topics he commonly covers here on HODINKEE.

No one likes their stuff being taken. And yet, if we were to call the same act a \"heist,\" suddenly, it seems at least a little bit cool, right? For whatever reason, the word \"heist\" will always conjure up slick images of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Eyw-Qiwpj0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Marky Mark and a Mini Cooper</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDRE-S9f-W0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">George Clooney and the Bellagio</a> – even when the heist is about something less obviously glamorous than gold bars or casino cash. This story in <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i> takes a deep dive into the Carnegie Library's Oliver Room Heist, a 25-year con job put together by a man on the inside, stealing high-value items from the library's collection. It's not quite the same level of luxury as the heists from Hollywood, but its perpetrators and aftermath are no less fascinating.</p>\n<p><i>– Dakota Gardner, Web Editor</i></p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Arcade\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598042729965-vhthcpgq6sr-cfabba0b4924820521f1fdea45156560/ArcadeFireSuburbsAt10_NonFeat_Getty_Ringer.0.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p><a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/music/2020/8/3/21352155/arcade-fire-suburbs-10th-anniversary-2011-grammys-album-year\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>How Arcade Fire's 'The Suburbs' Signaled A New Era Of Indie Music – The Ringer</strong></a></p>\n  \t<p>In 2011, Arcade Fire won the Album of the Year Grammy for <i>The Suburbs</i>, an introspective concept album about growing up. That's not particularly newsworthy, or shocking today, but when you look at who they were up against in the category (Lady A, Eminem, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga), it's actually preposterous. This article in <i>The Ringer</i> gives a historical retrospective of that night at the Grammys in 2011, and how it ushered in a new age of indie-rock music going forward.

There are a number of different solutions to the problems of showing the time in more than one time zone and, while some of them resemble each other superficially, each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and each offers its own unique take on showing you what time it is both where you are and where you are not. </p>\n  \t<p>The multi-time-zone watch is an interesting complication – unlike many other complications, such as the moon-phase and equation of time, and even the perpetual calendar, it is not based on recurring natural events, but rather on an invented convention, which is the division of the world into time zones. Each time zone follows a standard <i>mean time </i>across the entire time zone; prior to the development of standard times, the time was simply the local solar mean time. This meant, of course, that every town and village separated by longitude had a slightly different time, which didn't matter very much at all until the invention of the railroad – the first standard time was so-called Railway Time, which was adopted in 1840 by the Great Western Railway in the UK. This time standard used GMT across the entire rail network. In 1879, Scottish-born Canadian engineer Sir Sandford Fleming proposed the division of the world into 24 standard time zones, and by 1900, most countries had adopted some form of standard time, which gradually evolved into the system we know today.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598271606177-ny1o29h7t4n-eba9ed9d4d6c3374b50f81c1989a9f2d/MTB_MB126108_WAT_01_01_T_2047086.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The Montblanc Star Legacy <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/montblanc-star-legacy-orbis-terrarum-introducing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Orbis Terrarum world timer.</a></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The recognition that time is different depending on where you are on Earth is not a new one. I remember being quite surprised to see, in an Antiquorum catalog for a sale of Renaissance clocks which took place many years ago, a spectacular table clock which actually incorporated what looked for all the world like a modern world-time dial, complete with the names of different locations around the world (and which, to my considerable frustration, I have been unable to locate online; it's a remarkable piece of evidence, if any further were needed, that really original ideas in horology are few and far between). However, the time-zone system is entirely modern and very much the consequence of the evolution of travel technology. </p>\n  \t<h2>The Two-Time-Zone Watch With Independently Set 24-Hour Hand</h2>\n\n  \t<p>This is probably the most common implementation of a multi-time-zone watch, thanks to the widely used ETA 2893-2, which offers a two-time-zone function, and its Sellita clone, the SW330-1. Both of these movements have an independently set 24-hour hand and date, as well as hour and minute hands for local time. A couple of years ago, James Stacey referred to this particular implementation of a dual-time-zone watch as a \"caller,\" which gave me a moment of dejection – I'm one of the older writers at HODINKEE, and I felt I had somehow missed a piece of <i>au courant </i>horological vernacular that was all the rage of the younger set (<i>\"I grow old, I grow old, I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled, what the hell's a caller?\"</i>) but as it turns out, the term is apt as we will see in a minute.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1566880840596-xl0yykj73ba-29417a86ca260b31ecd9345e2de9d296/L1080761.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p><a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-monta-atlas\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Monta Atlas</a>.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Local time is read off in the usual fashion, and the second time-zone is read off the 24-hour hand, which makes one revolution per day. Setting up the watch is pretty straightforward. You set the local mean time in the usual fashion by pulling the crown out to its second position. In the first position, the 24-hour hand can be set forward in one-hour increments by turning the crown clockwise, and the date can be quick-set by turning the crown counterclockwise. Date switching is driven by the local time display, not the 24-hour hand.</p>\n  \t<p>If you're traveling from New York to Geneva (today, as I write, the time difference is six hours, with Geneva ahead), when you land at GVA, you have two choices. You can re-set the 24-hour hand to Geneva time and leave the hour and minute hand as they were, showing the time in New York. This, however, means the time display for the whole time you're in Geneva will be a bit counter-intuitive to read – you'll be reading the hour in Geneva off the 24-hour hand, and moreover, the date will not switch over at midnight Geneva time, but rather, six hours too late, because it will change over at midnight in New York. The other option is to re-set the local time to Geneva time, correct the date if necessary, and then re-set the 24-hour hand to the correct hour for New York. This is a bit less convenient than having a watch with an independently set local time hour hand, which you find on watches like the GMT-Master II, and it's the reason James coined the term \"caller\" for such watches – they work better if you're wondering what time it is at a place you call frequently from home. \"Caller\" watches can work just fine for travel, but since you have to reset the local time display <i>and </i>the 24-hour hand, and possibly the date, they're a little less convenient than the next type of two-time-zone watch: what James likes to call the \"flyer.\"</p>\n  \t<h2>The Two-Time-Zone Watch With Independently Set Hour Hand</h2>\n\n  \t<p>This type of two-time-zone watch (or three-time-zone, if it has a turning 24-hour bezel) is what is sometimes called a \"true\" GMT watch, although the term \"true\" implies that all other implementations are false, which seems oddly judgmental. In any case, such watches are sometimes said to be more convenient for travelers than for stay-at-homes wondering what time it is elsewhere in the world – the \"flyer\" counterpart to the \"caller\" two-time-zone watches. The classic example is, of course, the watch that put \"GMT\" into the name of multi-time-zone watches: the Rolex GMT-Master and GMT-Master II (for all you could ever want to know about those watches, <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/rolex-gmt-master-reference-points\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">John Bues' Reference Points</a> is highly recommended).</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1581372418990-ke3zrvvwq2j-859bc663c457090bc21e67f0d11485ae/FAT_LADY_16760_1541.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>Rolex GMT-Master II ref. &#160;16760. Produced from 1982 to 1988, it was the first Rolex GMT-Master model with an independently set hour hand.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Setting up such watches is straightforward. You pull out the crown to the third position; in this position, moving the crown changes the position of both the local time hands and the 24-hour hand. Set the 24-hour hand to the correct position for your local (home) time. Then, push the crown in slightly to the second position and set the date – date switching is via the local time hour hand, so you turn the hour hand forwards or backwards until you reach the current date. You then set the local time hour hand to the same hour as the 24-hour hand, and you're done. Both the 24-hour hand and the 12-hour hand now show the same hour – the time at your current, or home, locale.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1546206901333-1w1ltnljof8-7e6ed1d480515f076289375938eaf714/Jon_B.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The Grand Seiko SBGM221.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>If you're flying from New York to Geneva, once you land, all you have to do is pull out the crown all the way and set the local time hour hand forward to the time in Geneva. Since the date is indexed by the local time hour hand, as long as you remember to set the hour hand forwards instead of backwards (again, Geneva is six hours ahead), the date will automatically update to the correct date for Geneva. The 24-hour hand will continue to show home time. As you can see, this is very convenient for frequent flyers, who will want to easily set their watch to local time without stopping the entire watch or performing several different setting maneuvers.  \"Flyers\" as opposed to the caller-type watches, for obvious reasons.</p>\n  \t\n\n  \t<h2>The \"It Looks Like A World-Timer But It's A Two-Time-Zone Watch\" Wristwatch</h2>\n\n  \t<p>These are kind of a variation on the so-called \"flyer\" GMT watches. Essentially, they're two-time-zone watches, but with the addition of a city ring which resembles the city ring found on true world-time wristwatches. An excellent and very hifalutin' example is the Lange 1 Time Zone; another is the Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Control Geographic. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1593021371972-4hor4qrfha2-dd25c36c676d16e7a8717bb6aca0ad77/ALS_136_029_PR01_Lange1_TimeZone_2020_2044813.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p><a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/lange-1-time-zone-with-caliber-l-1411-introducing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Lange 1 Time Zone.</a></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>As you can see, both of these watches might at a casual glance be mistaken for a world-time complication – the distinctive city ring is usually a dead giveaway that you're looking at a world-time wristwatch. However, in both these cases, the city ring is there to provide a reference for setting the local time if you have just landed at your destination. </p>\n  \t<p>In both instances, you have the main dial, which shows home time, and a smaller dial that shows the time in a second time-zone, along with an AM/PM indicator. Both watches have a separate corrector for the smaller dial as well as correctors for the date (in the case of the Lange, in the form of a pusher at 7-8:00, and in the Jaeger, a corrector at 2:00). </p>\n  \t<p>Let's take our hypothetical little hop to Geneva. When we land, setting the time on the smaller, second time-zone dial is a matter of just pushing (the Lange) or turning (the Jaeger) the corrector at 10:00. This causes the city ring to turn, changing the reference city on the city ring, and at the same time, advancing the hour hand of the smaller dial by one-second jumps. In the case of our trip to Geneva from New York, if we've set the watch up correctly, both dials show the same time, and the city ring pointer is at New York. When we land in Geneva, we just push the corrector until it points to Berlin (the Lange) or Paris (the Jaeger), and the hour hand in the smaller dial will advance to the right hour as the city disk turns.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1588692608188-vc3kxag4g18-040ceb266156377bac6e080f988d4fa8/jaeger-lecoultre-master-control-geographic-2.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The dial of the <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/jaeger-lecoultre-master-control-geographic-introducing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jaeger-LeCoultre Master Control Geographic.</a></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>It is a very attractive and practical system, with just a couple of drawbacks. The first is that the date is synchronized with the larger time display, so while you can see the correct time in Geneva, the date shown will be for New York. The second drawback is that one instinctively tends to perceive the larger dial as local time, rather than home time – this is really a matter of just adjusting to reading the watch differently, although I can certainly envision without too much trouble situations where an evening's genteel carousing (for instance) might cause one to read the time off the wrong dial – and hilarity ensues, or maybe not. Purely from a legibility standpoint, this system seems to suffer a bit in comparison to simpler two-time-zone watches like the GMT-Master II, although what the mechanism loses in straightforward operation, it perhaps gains back a bit in elegance and pleasure of operation.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1506016229261-qexzyaie6tg-69c298bed0f71a0b3d4f922d2128e2e1/nomos_02.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>There are a number of variations on this system. The <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/a-week-on-the-wrist-the-nomos-zurich-weltzeit\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NOMOS Zurich Weltzeit</a> is an interesting example, by the way, of a watch with a full city ring, but which functionally is closer to the GMT-Master II. Home time is shown on a small, rotating hours circle at 3:00, and advancing the city ring actually advances the main dial's hour hand in one-hour increments. The problem of keeping the date coordinated is solved by the simple expedient of not having one.</p>\n  \t<h2>The Aristocratic World Timer</h2>\n\n  \t<p>Interestingly enough, the first wristwatch to show the time in more than one time zone is (as far as I know) the world-time wristwatch. The classic example is from Patek Philippe.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1553169964095-syv3u0s5u4q-947a065a420f8253ac77cbb1015ffe9e/291a9094_copy.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The world-time complication was developed by Louis Cottier and first used in pocket watches, by Patek, in the 1930s. A world-time watch is – well, just what it says on the tin, as the saying goes; it shows the time in all 24 time zones with full-hour offsets from GMT, simultaneously. This is thanks to a moveable cities disk with 24 reference cities on it, and a constantly driven hour disk, which rotates once every 24 hours. To set up the watch, you just press the pusher at 10:00 until your home city is at the top of the dial, and then set the correct time at the crown. If you want to know what time it is in any of the other 23 time zones, all you have to do is look at which number on the hour disk is adjacent to the city in question. If you happen to fly – let's say, from New York to Geneva – all you have to do to show the correct local time is press the pusher until Paris is at the top of the dial. The hour hand will advance in one-hour jumps automatically to the correct local time, while the time in New York – and anywhere else, for that matter – can still be read off the city ring and hour ring.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1553178247718-swozxxjq14-f77fa85790034c2308e5a93ca68a6e65/291a9087_copy.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The system has a lot going for it. It is sipping-tea-with-your-pinky-out elegant, and it is simple, practical, and enjoyable to use. Historically the one mark against it has been its higher complexity and higher cost, however, as with most other complications, it is now possible to find a true world-time complication in a more affordable timepiece as well (a Patek ref. 5230R, without that sexy <i>cloisonné </i>enamel world map, <a href=\"https://www.patek.com/en/collection/complications/5230R-012\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">will set you back $48,540 smackeroos</a>, but c'mon, that enamel world map – I want it, you want it, we all want it).</p>\n  \t<p>The only downside I can see to a world-time watch as a travel companion is that it's not quite as instantly legible, in terms of reading off home and local time specifically, as a \"flyer\" GMT watch. However, what you lose in clarity, as is so often the case, you gain back in baroque old-world charm. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1593462446451-b323d8klfca-8f57be8deafd8d54a6d6a069d63fd003/dragon?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption><p>The Patek 605 HU <a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/patek-philippe/CH080515/164\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"Star Dragon\" world-time pocket watch, 1947.</a></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>This watch and the world-time complication, in general, don't say \"kick the tires and light the fires\" so much as they say, \"Gadzooks! I must hurry to catch the noon Pan Am Clipper Flying Boat to Tahiti! (or wherever).\" But that, to me, is a feature, not a bug. It goes without saying that the romance of travel, even when we could all travel enough to keep our miles topped up, has not been romantic in a long time, and even Business Class feels more like wandering through a gated community than sharing the joy of air travel with like-minded adventurers. Anything that can make the idea of travel seem what it used to be – a gateway to real adventure and, hopefully, to exotic locales and unexpected meetings – is a good thing in my book. I guess what I'm saying is that if the GMT-Master II has my head, the Patek World Timer has my heart. If I were still going to Geneva every time I turned around, I'd prefer a \"flyer\" GMT watch just to keep my jet-lagged head screwed on straight, but if I decided to go home the long way – around the world – I'd take the watch that puts the world on my wrist.</p>\n\n      ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 17:30:00 +0000","feedId":5404,"bgimg":"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598269912278-ut0cbwiuk6n-ee2641caac4985ba180326c80adc7beb/hero?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000","linkMd5":"35785bc57762aba6b791774a6e8807c2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-28-06-520_ff57ac2f6e1ec179.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1125,"sourceBytes":400086,"destBytes":400086,"author":"Jack Forster","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598269912278-ut0cbwiuk6n-ee2641caac4985ba180326c80adc7beb/hero?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-28-06-520_ff57ac2f6e1ec179.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598271606177-ny1o29h7t4n-eba9ed9d4d6c3374b50f81c1989a9f2d/MTB_MB126108_WAT_01_01_T_2047086.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn74@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-28-08-709_080d83bf3110821c.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1566880840596-xl0yykj73ba-29417a86ca260b31ecd9345e2de9d296/L1080761.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn61@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-28-08-714_ffa171e2b969c4f5.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1581372418990-ke3zrvvwq2j-859bc663c457090bc21e67f0d11485ae/FAT_LADY_16760_1541.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn69@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-28-08-774_960c8f96d80b94d3.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1546206901333-1w1ltnljof8-7e6ed1d480515f076289375938eaf714/Jon_B.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn21@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-28-08-731_d16c745802e52d23.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1593021371972-4hor4qrfha2-dd25c36c676d16e7a8717bb6aca0ad77/ALS_136_029_PR01_Lange1_TimeZone_2020_2044813.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn14@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-28-08-774_b49b589a765ad73c.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1588692608188-vc3kxag4g18-040ceb266156377bac6e080f988d4fa8/jaeger-lecoultre-master-control-geographic-2.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-28-10-026_02a4a4b36d8b7ba2.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1506016229261-qexzyaie6tg-69c298bed0f71a0b3d4f922d2128e2e1/nomos_02.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn26@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-28-10-157_e39a41631b9e755e.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1553169964095-syv3u0s5u4q-947a065a420f8253ac77cbb1015ffe9e/291a9094_copy.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn34@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-28-10-471_70b0b264596539d9.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1553178247718-swozxxjq14-f77fa85790034c2308e5a93ca68a6e65/291a9087_copy.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn69@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-28-08-690_680e618281d9ac4c.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1593462446451-b323d8klfca-8f57be8deafd8d54a6d6a069d63fd003/dragon?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn93@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-28-10-044_28925b438525fba0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598308086363},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:28:06","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:28:06","title":"In The Shop -

As a modern take on the original Mido Ocean Star Powerwind 1000 from 1961, it nailed all the little details we look for in a vintage-inspired dive watch. We thought it would make the perfect summer addition to the HODINKEE Shop, which is why we partnered with Mido for a period of global exclusivity, allowing us to offer our customers the very first chance to purchase it. Our enthusiasm for the new watch seems to have been matched by yours, as our initial allocation sold out quickly. </p>\n  \t<p>We have since delivered nearly all of the original orders from late July (if you haven't received your watch yet, it is on its way!), and Mido recently informed us of one more batch of watches, available exclusively to HODINKEE Shop customers. We're thrilled to be able to give those who missed out on the Mido Ocean Star Decompression Timer 1961 Limited Edition the first time around a second chance to purchase this release. Hopefully, we can share what makes this vintage-inspired dive watch so special with a few more people. Today's batch of watches will be delivered in early September 2020, but they are available to purchase right now in the <a href=\"https://shop.hodinkee.com/collections/mido/products/mido-ocean-star-decompression-timer-1961-limited-edition?variant=32412587950155\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HODINKEE Shop</a> (while supplies last). </p>\n  \t<h2>The Mido Ocean Star Decompression Timer 1961 Limited Edition</h2>\n\n  \t<p>When Mido was less than two decades old, in the 1930s, it developed a new type of crown gasket made of natural cork that sealed the stem of the movement from the outside world to protect it from the accidental entry of water and other elements. Mido's sole desire at that point in time was to create the most reliable watch it possibly could, but the decision to focus on water resistance early on led the company down a path that, decades later, resulted in one of the most colorful and uniquely innovative dive watches ever: the Mido Ocean Star Powerwind 1000 ref. 5907.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597863223606-3645nudjygc-13f848ca3f41304b86b241f24a704b2a/M026-007.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Released in 1961 and marketed toward early skin divers, the Powerwind 1000 was a tool that could track elapsed time underwater and help its wearer fight off the onset of decompression sickness, known colloquially as the bends. The multi-color scale on the watch's dial indicated the required length of a decompression stop during dives of varying depths and durations. (You can learn how to use the scale, <a href=\"https://shop.hodinkee.com/collections/mido/products/mido-ocean-star-decompression-timer-1961-limited-edition?variant=32412587950155\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.) This function-first dive watch was produced by Mido for a few short years, from approximately 1961 to 1965. If it wasn't for the cult following it eventually developed among contemporary dive-watch enthusiasts – for its combination of color, rarity, and functionality – the Powerwind 1000 likely would have ended up as a simple footnote in the history of the dive watch.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597863251901-dnbnn7hz3w-b027e573ee08c6df77c974ff048bfb9e/M026-012.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Limited to 1,961 pieces worldwide, the new Mido Ocean Star Decompression Timer 1961 Limited Edition is the result of the Swiss brand listening directly to the desires of today's dive watch lovers and collectors. The colorful vintage diver has been recreated with all the sun-baked charm of the original, with the modern upgrades you'd expect of a contemporary sport watch. That means an automatic movement with 80 hours of running autonomy, a color-matched date window at three o'clock, applied hour markers and diamond-cut hands that are filled with Super-LumiNova, and 200 meters of water resistance. The hands are the same design as those on the original Powerwind 1000: a short, dauphine style for the hour hand and a pencil shape for the minute hand. The dial of the Mido Ocean Star Decompression Timer 1961 Limited Edition is protected by a domed, box-style sapphire crystal, and the closed steel caseback features an engraved starfish logo that is characteristic of the Ocean Star line. The signed, screw-down crown is protected by crown guards, and the unidirectional, 60-minute countdown bezel has a black aluminum insert with a luminous pip at the zero marker.</p>\n  \t  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597865182242-tpxnkjze4ee-e12d39529f63732bbadfc6b2ff1c80b0/M026-009.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n    <figcaption><p>The signed screw-down crown is flanked by crown guards</p></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597865191486-jsxgy4o6y9r-6accc8c7aaccbcdac15d840d513a3429/M026-008.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n    <figcaption><p>The caseback features the starfish logo of the Ocean Star collection in relief. &#160;</p></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n\n  \t<p>The fully polished case of the Mido Ocean Star Decompression Timer 1961 Limited Edition measures in at 40.5mm in diameter and 13.4mm in height, a slight upgrade from the vintage model's 38mm sizing but still quite wearable for today. It helps that the triangular lugs are quite short, ensuring a comfortable fit on most wrists. On the topic of fit, each Ocean Star Decompression Timer 1961 Limited Edition comes with three different straps and bracelets. There's a vintage-style mesh bracelet, a black calfskin leather strap with multi-colored stitching, and a black strap made of synthetic fabric with yellow stitching. All strap and bracelet options come with quick-change, tool-less spring bars. The Mido Ocean Star Decompression Timer 1961 Limited Edition is available for $1,250, a very approachable price tag considering vintage examples in good condition can today fetch close to five figures.</p>\n  \t<h2>Purchase The Mido Ocean Star Decompression Timer Before It's Gone For Good </h2>\n\n  \t<p>Dive watches are a platform built on extreme elements, meant to function in situations that stress the human body to its core, where accurate timekeeping and legibility underwater can save lives. Mido pushed the dive-watch genre further with the original Powerwind 1000 in 1961, by confronting the perils of the bends, a formidable opponent that divers are far more likely to experience than nearly any other underwater obstacle.

It's a partnership between two leaders in distinct facets of the watch industry. Kari Voutilainen has earned a sterling reputation as a master of hand-finishing techniques, and he also creates dials that showcase a bevy of guilloché, enameling, and other techniques. He plays with color in a way that certainly has roots in traditional Swiss high horology, but adds something new to the conversation. While Schwarz Etienne might not be quite as visible as Voutilainen, it's a powerhouse in the industry behind the scenes. The company, over a century old, produces cutting-edge calibers both for its own watches, and others, like rising star <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/ming-1902-worldtimer-hands-on\"><u>MING</u></a>.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597941045135-q9mchz1ber-6db551d2369538b356241f7073d81858/RomaSynergy_01.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The Roma is a staple dress watch in Schwarz Etienne's line-up that serves as the canvas for Voutilainen to apply his craft. Sized at a modest 39mm, the stainless steel case handsomely fits under a cuff with a height of 11mm. Inside is Schwarz Etienne's caliber ASE 200.00, featuring small seconds and a micro-rotor, something the manufacturer has come to specialize in. The micro-rotor sits flush with the movement plate, while still allowing a full 86-hour power reserve and a thin size.</p>\n  \t<p>Another interesting aspect of this particular micro-rotor movement that lends itself well to showcasing finishing is that it's basically almost a full-plate movement, so there's lots of real estate. The micro-rotor is decorated by Les Ateliers Kari Voutilainen, along with snailing and diamond drops on the ratchet wheel (the large visible wheel next to the micro-rotor). Additionally, the bridges are hand beveled. Black polished steel parts tie together the finishing. Black polishing is achieved by applying diamond paste on a tin plate and then, by hand, taking the part being finished and rubbing it on the tin plate until a mirror finish is achieved.</p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597941060540-antg3b205e-51a65ce23d4f608ed33a64f62c4e603d/RomaSynergy_03.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>On the dial side, Voutilainen's signature <i>guilloché</i> is on full display. Part of the magic of the design is the way in which various rose-engine-turned patterns play with each other in a way that creates interesting contrast and depth. The Roma Synergy comes in two dial colors: ocean blue and sand grey. Every dial is treated to a number of contrasting finishes by hand on a rose-engine machine. A <i>soleil</i> (sun) pattern in the hour track frames the <i>écaille de poisson </i>(fish scale) pattern that constitutes most of the dial except for the small seconds, which is treated to a <i>vague</i> (wave) pattern. </p>\n  \t<p>The Schwarz Etienne name appears on a cartouche just below noon, while a silver plaque at six o'clock points to Voutilainen's role in the creation of this piece, of which 50 examples in each color will be made.  </p>\n  \t<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>\n\n  \t<p>It seemed like there wasn't a span longer than 30 minutes at the 2019 GPHG awards ceremony when Kari Voutilainen wasn't walking up to the stage to snag another award. And the Roma Synergy is exactly the type of watch that demonstrates why the community finds his work so exciting and refreshing. A signature aesthetic has come to define Voutilainen's work; it's a style that began when he started at Parmigiani Fleurier. He's since grown to become a darling of the independent world, sweeping the awards ceremonies. A Finn who relocated to Switzerland a number of decades ago, he's quiet, humble, and reserved in person – he lets his work speak for him. At a lunch with him and his daughter, Venla Voutilainen, a horological force in her own right, Kari told me that he gets a great deal of excitement and satisfaction from collaborating with customers and other watchmakers on designs. When I saw the Roma Synergy release, I immediately thought about how exciting of a project this must have been. There's a certain positivity about Voutilainen that's infectious. I suspect that's part of the charm that has spawned his cult following beyond his incredible work. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597943706717-0slu18t0la4d-042d453d247da80261c55db0189ffe1b/RomaSynergy_02.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>Collaborations at this level are already something of a rare occurrence, and to see Voutilainen pair up with a manufacturer like Schwarz Etienne is bound to drum up a great deal of interest among a very specific audience. Who knows, maybe he'll be walking up to snag another award for this very watch come GPHG season.  </p>\n  \t\n\n  \t<h2>The Basics</h2>\n\n  \t<p><strong>Brand:</strong> Schwarz Etienne<br>\n<strong>Model:</strong> Roma Synergy<br>\n<strong>Reference Number: </strong> WROVMA03SSCUBCLTD-A</p>\n<p><strong>Diameter:</strong> 39mm<br>\n<strong>Thickness:</strong> 11mm<br>\n<strong>Case Material:</strong> Stainless Steel<br>\n<strong>Dial Color:</strong> Ocean blue and sand grey<br>\n<strong>Indexes:</strong> Arabic numerals and batons, applied<br>\n<strong>Lume:</strong> Absent<br>\n<strong>Water Resistance:</strong> 50m<br>\n<strong>Strap/Bracelet: </strong>Leather strap</p>\n  \t<h2>The Movement</h2>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597941097568-3t77cbi3xqj-f968638f0ef73ee4511c60c9d8ab978e/RomaSynergy_06.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p><strong>Caliber:</strong>  ASE 200.00<br>\n<strong>Functions:</strong>  Hours, minutes, small seconds at six o'clock <br>\n<strong>Power Reserve:</strong> 86 hours<br>\n<strong>Winding:</strong> Micro-roto self-winding<br>\n<strong>Frequency:</strong> 21,600 VPH<br>\n<strong>Jewels:</strong> 33<br>\n </p>\n  \t<h2>Pricing & Availability</h2>\n\n  \t<p><strong>Price:</strong> CHF 29,500 with Swiss VAT or CHF 27,400 without it. <br>\n<strong>Availability:</strong> Early October<br>\n<strong>Limited Edition: </strong>Limited to 50 pieces for each dial variation. </p>\n<p>For more, <a href=\"https://www.schwarz-etienne.ch/en/home/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n\n      ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 17:32:00 +0000","feedId":5404,"bgimg":"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597939863073-dulmszdzods-d087fddba63b1a904eaed32fa6b67961/hero.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000","linkMd5":"9d46cb48313c01ee0b77826465569cbc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-28-06-610_9376a8610c9913f0.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1127,"sourceBytes":214190,"destBytes":214190,"author":"Cole Pennington","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597939863073-dulmszdzods-d087fddba63b1a904eaed32fa6b67961/hero.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn27@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-28-06-610_9376a8610c9913f0.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597941045135-q9mchz1ber-6db551d2369538b356241f7073d81858/RomaSynergy_01.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn79@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-28-08-676_6aa46bc87fb028b2.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597941060540-antg3b205e-51a65ce23d4f608ed33a64f62c4e603d/RomaSynergy_03.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn18@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-28-10-100_1bbb656f52002808.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597943706717-0slu18t0la4d-042d453d247da80261c55db0189ffe1b/RomaSynergy_02.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn14@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-28-11-737_33d1b4568962005d.webp","https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1597941097568-3t77cbi3xqj-f968638f0ef73ee4511c60c9d8ab978e/RomaSynergy_06.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&fm=jpg&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&fit=crop&w=2000":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn34@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-28-08-774_af3cb5bf0a24f339.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598308086366},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:28:06","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:28:06","title":"HODINKEE Radio: Episode 101: Actor & Entrepreneur Miles Fisher","link":"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hodinkee-radio-episode-101-miles-fisher","description":"\n          <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598020150606-tbszsebn6gk-95d51b70204471c7f702a29401f8b3a2/Miles_Hero.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  \t\n\n  \t<p><i>Subscribe to the show: (</i><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hodinkee-radio/id1412458259\"><u><i>Apple Podcast</i></u></a><u><i>s</i></u><i>,</i> <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/hodinkee-radio?refid=stpr\"><u><i>Stitcher</i></u></a><i>,</i> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7uJbcyr8BrUU9uRb5W7tbd\"><u><i>Spotify</i></u></a><u><i>,</i></u> <a href=\"http://tun.in/pi6n7\"><u><i>TuneIn</i></u></a><i>).

This week, we've got episode 101 for you, kicking off the next season of HODINKEE Radio, and I couldn't be more excited for what we've got coming. We decided to start things off with a bang, so this week's episode is devoted entirely to my conversation with Miles Fisher. Now, if that name sounds familiar to you, it's for good reason. You might know Miles from his viral YouTube channel; you might know Miles from his acting career, which included a prominent one-episode stint on <i>Mad Men</i>; you might know Miles from Bixby Coffee, his direct-to-consumer start-up; or you might know Miles from his latest venture, <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/blamo-media\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Coffee With The Greats</i></a>, a podcast on the Blamo! Media network that he hosts with his dad. Yeah, the guy knows how to keep busy.</p>\n<p>We start our conversation talking about our mutual obsession with podcasts, the proper speed for binge-listening, and why I can't get enough of <i>Coffee With The Greats</i> (Seriously, go subscribe right now. We'll be here when you get back.) We also talk about our shared Texas heritage – spoiler alert: Miles is way more legit in that department than I am – and how important it is to really put all of yourself into a project when you commit to it.</p>\n  \t<p>Don't worry though, we also talk about watches. A lot. Miles has been interested in watches for a long time, but over the last few months, he's gone head-first into the deep end and shows no signs of coming up for air anytime soon. He's engaged in the community, he's listening to, looking at, and reading anything he can find, and he's been steadily building an extremely tasteful collection of pieces that tick different boxes while feeling cohesive as a group. We get into all of that and more. Miles is truly one of us, and a great reminder that if you're in this hobby and not having fun with it, you're doing it super wrong. </p>\n  \t<p>We hope you enjoy Episode 101 of HODINKEE Radio. Check out the show notes below, and let us know what you think in the comments.</p>\n  \t\n\n  \t<h2>Wrist Check</h2>\n\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1598020141046-wa0t05vfk3-b5aad9acf00ac1b6ae3178604f02dbb2/unnamed.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>If you had any doubts that Miles is a full-blown watch nut at this point, I rest my case with this picture. Over the summer, he was able to track down <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/grand-seiko-20th-anniversary-spring-drive-introducing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an SBGY003, the steel version of the 20th anniversary Spring Drive Grand Seiko</a> from last year. This is a real insider's watch if I've ever seen one. It's understated, but full of incredible details like the faceted hands, the sunburst dial, and the subtle lines of the case. It's also a great platform for showing off the beautiful, constant glide of the center seconds hand that's enabled by the Spring Drive caliber. This is a watch I've long lusted after, and seeing it on Miles' wrist certainly doesn't make me want one any less.</p>\n  \t<h2>Show Notes</h2>\n\n  \t<p>11:00 <br>\n<a
