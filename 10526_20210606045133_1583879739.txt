The latter has been done by fellow diamond-level airline, Qatar Airways, which became the first to use </span><a href=\"https://www.qatarairways.com/en/press-releases/2020/september/qatar-airways-becomes-the-first-global-carrier-to-operate-honeyw.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honeywell’s UV Cabin System</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on board. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, RwandAir is using robots for something entirely different.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When I removed my mask, the robot came for me &#38; asked me to adjust it.

Made by Belgian company Zorabots,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urumuri was stationed at Kigali International Airport in July 2020, before its full reopening on August 1. He’s still there today. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The robot’s job is to screen passengers’ temperatures at a rate of between 50 and 150 people per minute. Urumuri can also analyse whether someone is wearing a mask or not.  It is programmed to report any abnormalities to officers on duty. In the event someone isn’t complying with mask rules, Urumuri can approach them and request them to mask up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Urumuri can also identify coughing and other </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signs of possible COVID-19 infection,” adds Robert Gobac, RwandAir’s </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manager, Medical and Occupational Health. “All the information is monitored and processed by Rwanda’s Health Department, with whom we’re always in contact.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But does his presence reassure or intimidate passengers? Gobac hopes it’s the former, as Zorabots has a “humanoid” design, so its shape resembles a human body. “Passengers seem exceptionally curious about him,” Gobac says. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-33063\" src=\"https://simpliflying.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/screenshot-73.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://simpliflying.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/screenshot-73.png 1781w, https://simpliflying.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/screenshot-73-768x362.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" />Having Urumuri at Kigali International Airport is just one of many impressive steps RwandAir has taken to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and advance airline health safety.
