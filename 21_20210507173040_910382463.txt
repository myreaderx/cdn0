It represents an impressive slice of varied films (dramas, action films, animated adventures, comedies, monster movies), all of them unified in being expensive wide releases seen by millions of people. Here&#8217;s a select few: <em>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</em>, <em>X-Men: First Class</em>, <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet</em>, <em>Kong: Skull Island</em>, <em>Detective Pikachu</em>, <em>Captain Phillips</em>, <em>This is the End</em>. And, of course, there&#8217;s his contributions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em> and <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>.</p>\n<p>Jackman&#8217;s work in the MCU continued this year with <strong><em>The Falcon and the Winter Solider</em></strong>, the six-episode Disney+ series following the latest adventures of Captain America&#8217;s best buds. With the series now concluded, I spoke with Jackman about creating music for the series, his creative approach to scoring film and television, and working inside a giant blockbuster machine like Marvel Studios.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670127\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>What makes your score here different from your scores for <i>Civil War</i> and <i>Winter Soldier</i>? At what point did you realize you can’t do the same Captain America thing again and have to find a new identity?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That’s a really good question. I suppose it’s the same in the writing: it’s a combination. It self-evidently isn’t completely new, because we’re dealing with characters we’ve seen before. So it can’t be such a reach from where we’ve come from that they’re unrecognizable. But there’re all heading to different narrative places in their journey. I’d probably start there. Obviously, when you see episode one you don’t know what’s going to happen, but by the time you get to episode six, you’ve seen the full journey of Sam feeling burdened by the legacy of Steve Rogers. Feeling not up to the task of inheriting the shield. Then the whole conversation with Isaiah Bradley, finding out about terrible things in the past. Not in any way diminishing Bucky – who also has an amazingly important journey trying to resolve the person he used to be when he was an assassin, and that’s an incredibly important feature of the show – but I probably started with the track “Louisiana Hero,” which is like a motif that I took from when [Sam] was Falcon in <i>The Winter Soldier</i> and then, knowing where this show was going to go, that was just the beginning of something back then. I wanted to take that motif and turn it into a fully realized superhero thing, but also reflect Sam Wilson’s background, which is why “Louisiana Hero” – there are versions of it in episodes five and six that are the full regular orchestration, but there are moments when I wanted to get some of the fabric of his background in there. Which is why it has this less classical rhythm and guitars and Hammond [organ] and whatnot. But I think knowing where Sam Wilson ends up was a really good starting point. That meant that that track, “Louisiana Hero,” was sort of a destination to get to: the superhero melody is the destination, the Louisiana and the groove part is like where he’s come from.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the case of Bucky, it was a case of finding a musical identity that reflected his de-programmed – there are moments when he has violent outbursts when he gets triggered, but apart from that, Bucky’s journey is really well reflected in that very emotional scene in the last episode. He’s trying to make amends, confess, and explain what he did in his past. So the main Bucky theme, which probably reaches its climax musically in that scene, was another sort of end point to aim for. Narrative end points are a good indication. If you think where Bucky ends up and where Falcon or Sam Wilson ends up, it’s a long way from <i>Civil War </i>and <i>Winter Soldier</i>. Once you know that narratively, [it’s about coming] up with musical identity and theme to take us to those places.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Do you approach character first, or do you break it down by scene or atmosphere? Or is it a combination of the two?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everyone’s different, but I guess I would recommend that in a way, the secret hidden weapon of film scoring and composing is actually literary criticism. It sounds very intellectual and academic, but what I mean by that is, I think it’s a bit more superficial to get distracted by an individual scene. Obviously certain movies have such a visual tone, so of course they’re going to inspire the music. But in a way, you want to put yourself in the mind of a director or a writer, so you really understand the narrative function. Imagine having to do an academic breakdown of: what’s actually going on in this film subtextually? What’s it about? What are the themes of the film? And sometimes it’ll mean that you have to understand the character and a theme particularly pertains to character, but sometimes it can be more conceptual. One of the things I did on <i>Civil War</i>, one of the ways to ruin it, in my opinion, would have been to have like seventeen themes flying around because there are so many superheroes. What was more important intellectually or narratively was the clash. The clash was what was important about it. What you ended up with was two opposing themes. So the big <i>Civil War</i> theme, which shows up a lot in that, denotes that there’s something slightly tragic in there. I’ve used a bit of harmony in there that has tension in it. That’s an example that doesn’t pertain to any particular individual, but to the veering prospect of what happens when two sets of extremely powerful people disagree over those Accords and beat the crap out of each other at an airport, in a highly entertaining way. So it really depends.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In a way, what you should do is come up with a theme such that you’ve got the version that you can use right at the end of the movie. It should be so fully realized in your own imagination, and in a way, what you’ve actually got is probably the version you can only use at the end, and then what you’ve gotta do during the movie is deconstruct it and hint at it and work backwards. In other words, my recommendation is, instead of having a few pork slices and then trying to assemble a pig, is you should roast a whole pig, even though you don’t need that in the beginning. Then you start slicing that and taking bits of it and you’ve got your full meal at the end. Even though it can be frustrating sometimes, because you can write a complete melody. In <i>X-Men: First Class</i>, I was dying to get that [theme in there], but they’re a bunch of incompetent teenagers. For ages, they don’t get it together. There’s all these processes where they’re coming together. It’s like, “Come on! Let me get that tune out in its full context!” But it’s much better to have the fully realized idea in your head and be forced to deconstruct in the early stages, rather than have a few fragments and then suddenly have to pull out a finished, developed thing. I’d much rather have the full cake hidden in the oven and slice it down if need be, but I’ve already figured out the full cake.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Do you look at the footage or read the script and go, “I think Sam is this instrument” or “I think Bucky is this instrument?” Do you think that way?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It’s a really good question, but I don’t know how conscious I am of it. I think in the really early stages of reading scripts, I want – to go back to that remark about literary criticism – I want so to get underneath the skin of the writing that I think I almost willfully read it as if I’m a writer. Imagine a writer going, “Hey, I’ve got this script. Will you read through it and give me [notes]?” Maybe subconsciously things are starting to brew in the back of my head, but in the first couple of reads of the script, I’m really going for the mechanics of what’s happening in the story. At least consciously. Maybe some rumblings happening. Then when I go into the studio, I feel like as I start to explore, which is a very instinctive thing, I think the discipline of having really focused on what’s going on in the story, especially subtextually, you’re more likely to [create] material that’s hitting the sweet spot because you’ve had the discipline not just to have a brief read and then launch into action with some piece that you think is cool. Have you really understood what’s going on? Film music isn’t just about, “Hey, I wrote this piece of music! I like it. Do you like it?” It’s more like, I’ve got this idea of a fracture in music, which was useful for <i>Civil War</i>. And I’ve got this idea of manipulation for Zemo, which is why I used a very serpentine scale. You’ve gotta know why you’re doing something. Otherwise, you could do something interesting that actually doesn’t benefit anybody.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>I’m curious about the collaboration aspect. I spoke with both [creator] Malcolm [Spellman] and [director] Kari [Skogland] a few weeks ago, and they both said that they really tried to respect each other’s space and distance. Who do you collaborate with? What’s the creative process between the three of you making sure you all share the same vision for this score?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It depends completely on different projects. There is no law about how that works. Sometimes you have super interested and invested producers who are obsessed by music. Sometimes you have producers who so trust their director that they don’t even say anything. There are a million and one permutations of this. But in the case of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, I had very detailed conversations with Kari, and early on. What was great was Kari and I were talking way before the music was being written and having discussions about an African-American Captain America, discussions about Flag Smashers, idealism, capitalism – all sorts of heavy duty conversations way before we got into the music. Then once you get into the actual score, despite the efforts of Covid to disrupt everything, there’s pretty slick technology going on. It’s pretty easy to present music, and we can all be [on video] and talk together. Really, the brain trust was [editor] <b>Jeff Ford</b> and Kari and [producer] <b>Nate</b> [<b>Moore</b>], and other producers were really important. I mean, <b>Kevin</b> [<b>Feige</b>] is also really important.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’ve been really lucky to work with some legends – to be in the same room as, and to work with the Katzenbergs, the Bruckheimers, and the Kevin Feiges. And I think one of the biggest geniuses I can see in these people who are operating on a stratospheric level of logistical creativity is they’re really good at putting something together, finding the right people, and having confidence in them. Almost like a family. Giving people sufficient space that he gets the best out of all of their inherent creativity. And then having just enough note giving and entry into the process to come up with some of those critical far-reaching things that sometimes only he can see. So the day-to-day collaboration would be with Kari and Nate and [producer] <b>Zoie</b> [<b>Nagelhout</b>] and Jeff, the picture editor. And the creative watchful eye of Kevin comes in at these key moments to see sequences and patches of things. Trust me: if something isn’t working, you’d never get it past Kevin. Even if everyone else had deluded themselves that something was working, you’d never get it past Kevin. Because he’s got that overarching judgment call and instinct that, if you look at the whole universe created thus far, the Marvel universe has been pretty flawless.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>When you’re writing for a Marvel movie, you’re not just writing for a standalone project – you’re contributing to that larger universe you were talking about. You’re serving not just this TV show, but possibly themes, motifs, ideas that will continue onward. Knowing that <i>Captain America 4</i> has been announced with Malcolm writing it and knowing that these characters will continue, what is it like to serve not just this project, but the larger franchise? Do you think about that when you write? Or do you just focus down on this one project or it gets too overwhelming?</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The latter is true. You just don’t know. Even though you’ve said [<i>Cap 4</i>] has been announced, but I think technically it hasn’t. I think it’s a leak or something. Meaning, with the best will in the world, you really don’t know, and there’s been so many twists and turns that your best bet – if you think of <i>Winter Soldier</i>, <i>Civil War</i>, this six-episode show, they have so many aesthetic, creative, and musical demands, that your best bet is not to get distracted by guessing what may or may not happen in the future. I mean, for example, I was just delighted that the motif of Falcon, eight years later or whatever it was, became the basis of a superhero [project] that’s emerged as Sam Wilson being Captain America. I could never have known that for a fact, and had I speculated, I could have been wrong or it could have been someone else. Like a dog chasing its tail. When I came up with that motif in <i>Winter Soldier</i>, I was really busy and the score was really important. I did for a second think, “Wow, I love that tune. I should develop this because I might need it – it could go somewhere. But I don’t have time. I need to finish the score for <i>Winter Soldier</i>, and maybe I can come back to it one day.” Then you start working on other projects. It’s just something you know is pregnant with musical potential, but it’s only when it comes around, now eight years later, that we’ve seen the show as it is and it becomes creatively clear that this is something that could be resurrected and transformed into a full theme.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But trying to guess? Good luck. Trying to second guess exactly how the Marvel universe plays out is a bit like trying to guess what Apple’s new thing is. In a way, you don’t want to know. You know what I mean? Part of it is unexpected. If you rewound to <i>Iron Man</i>, and then clicked your fingers to where we are now with <i>WandaVision</i> and this show, you’d be like, “How did they get there?” You just have to be patient and see. It’s sort of a minor miracle. I mean, there are graphic novels. It’s not a complete miracle – it’s [based on] material. But nothing like this has ever been achieved in filmmaking. I know people say <i>Star Wars</i>, but it’s not true. In terms of the breadth of the universe and how it links, I honestly don’t think there’s anything comparable.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-composer-interview/\">&#8216;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&#8217; Composer Henry Jackman Shares His Creative Process for Writing a Superhero Score [Interview]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fSGUBWc5wWo:plVkfhWeExA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fSGUBWc5wWo:plVkfhWeExA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fSGUBWc5wWo:plVkfhWeExA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fSGUBWc5wWo:plVkfhWeExA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fSGUBWc5wWo:plVkfhWeExA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fSGUBWc5wWo:plVkfhWeExA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fSGUBWc5wWo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 19:00:43 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-cap-cameras-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"014339b54322d9fe0cdc79e0937d2921","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn51@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-12-705_af7738478a10f5cb.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":36808,"destBytes":23840,"author":"Jacob Hall","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-cap-cameras-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn51@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-12-705_af7738478a10f5cb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-737_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fSGUBWc5wWo:plVkfhWeExA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn80@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-27-807_5f752afd24718048.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fSGUBWc5wWo:plVkfhWeExA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn52@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-27-385_d9067cb143165057.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fSGUBWc5wWo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn83@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-353_32658465358b309d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620408612174},{"createdTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","title":"‘Star Wars: The Bad Batch’ Breakdown: The Details and History That Enrich “Cut and Run”","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670334","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670338 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Bad-Batch-Cut-and-Run-Breakdown-700x295.jpeg\" alt=\"Bad Batch Cut and Run Breakdown\" width=\"700\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Bad-Batch-Cut-and-Run-Breakdown.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Bad-Batch-Cut-and-Run-Breakdown-360x152.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>This post contains <strong>spoilers</strong> for the second episode of </em><strong>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</strong><em>, titled &#8220;Cut and Run.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As the Bad Batch make their way from Kamino following the events of the first episode of <em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</em>, they need somewhere to hide and lay low for a while. We heard them speak about about needing to meet someone on J-19. What J-19 means is dubious, but we know they head to the planet Saluecami. Saluecami was first mentioned by Obi-Wan Kenobi in <i>Revenge of the Sith </i>as a planet that had fallen to the Republic from Separatist control.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here, they learn of the steps the new Empire is taking to control the lives of its citizens, taking a running leap at becoming the fascist dictatorship we know the Empire to be.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670334\"></span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>The Deserter</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The contact the Bad Batch finds on Saleucami is none other than Cut Lawquane, a clone who decided fighting in the Clone war was something he had no interest in doing. He deserted the Grand Army of the Republic and took up the simple life of a farmer on Saleucami. He fell in love with a Twi’lek named Suu Lawquane and adopted her children. They lived a quiet life until the Clone Wars invaded their planet again.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In “The Deserter,” the tenth episode of the second season of <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars, </i>Captain Rex was wounded and found himself in the care of Cut and his family. The two of them had a philosophical debate about the purpose of Clones and their ability to choose. Instead of turning him in, Captain Rex decided to keep Cut’s secret.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In this episode, the Bad Batch and Cut clearly have a past together, but there isn’t more information about that particular moment for now. He does mention, though, that Rex crossed his path again, just the day before, giving us some clue as to what Rex’s next moves were after he and Ahsoka parted ways in the finale of <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars. </i></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Chain Codes</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">One aspect of the world-building that we first really saw with <i>The Mandalorian </i>has revealed its origin in <i>The Bad Batch. </i>Chain codes. In <i>The Mandalorian, </i>they seem like a way to track people wherever they are and are used mainly by Bounty Hunters, but at this point, it seems as though it’s the Empire’s way of tracking <em>everyone</em>. It seems tailor-made to make it difficult for people to leave a planet under the thumb of the Empire without the proper chain code. With Tatooine outside of the Republic and only under Imperial control at the end of the war, it’s no wonder it was a safe place for Luke to live without needing a chain code.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This makes it difficult for Cut and his family, though, as the Bad Batch work to help them get off Saleucami.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Intergalactic Animals</b></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">When Omega is playing on the Lawquane family farm, you can see some livestock hopping in the background. These are nuna, and they first appeared in <i>Star Wars: Episode I &#8211; The Phantom Menace. </i>They’re also known as swamp turkeys. They’re raised as livestock primarily on Naboo, but in other places in the galaxy as well. The Lawquanes raise them on Saleucami as we can see here, but you can also find them on Batuu, the setting of Disney&#8217;s <em>Star Wars</em> theme park lands. You can buy Nuna Turkey Jerky at the Ronto Roasters restaurant on Black Spire Outpost and get a taste of this intergalactic delicacy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Another familiar animal featured in this episode is a Nexu. These cat-like creatures first appeared in <i>Attack of the Clones </i>and were used by the Geonosians to try to kill Padmé Amidala in the arena. They’re vicious and found on a few other planets. Why Saleucami has such a varied diversity of animals native to other planets is unknown.

That&#8217;s why Disney+ is getting the word out about a new <strong><em>Muppets Haunted Mansion</em></strong> special coming to Disney+ this fall, just in time for the spooky season. The streaming service just released the first promo for the new Muppets special with Gonzo and Pepe the King Prawn making the announcement, but one of them isn&#8217;t quite able to muster up the same kind of energy to hype up the show. <span id=\"more-670328\"></span></p>\n<h2>Muppets Haunted Mansion Special</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/obhgH3S23T4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The <em>Muppets Haunted Mansion</em> special takes place on Halloween night, which is a good start. Gonzo gets challenged to spend an entire night in The Haunted Mansion, the iconic Disney theme park attraction, and you can probably guess how that turns out for the famed Muppet performer. Hopefully he&#8217;ll have his trusty chicken Camilla along his side to keep him company. Maybe Rizzo the Rat will get caught up in the terror too.</p>\n<p>Like many Muppet productions before this, <em>Muppets Haunted Mansion</em> will bring in the beloved Muppets gang, along with plenty of celebrity cameos and all-new music. Maybe they&#8217;ll even bring back this classic number from <em>The Muppet Show</em> so many years ago:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mOc04HE7Ne4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Even though the announcement of this <em>Muppets Haunted Mansion</em> is arriving in conjunction with Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Halfway to Halloween&#8221; events at Disney theme parks, the mere existence of this special feels like it came out of left field. It&#8217;s not often that Disney has done holiday specials like this with the Muppets, and the gang hasn&#8217;t exactly been used to their full potential. Maybe this idea came about during the pandemic because Disneyland was shut down for over a year, making it easy to produce something like this using the actual Haunted Mansion.</p>\n<p>In recent years, Disney has proven that they don&#8217;t really know what to do with the Muppets. The film franchise has fallen by the wayside again, the newest attempt at a streaming series <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/muppets-now-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was rather lackluster</a>, and the one idea that sounded good <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/muppets-live-another-day-script-pages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was totally abandoned</a>. Here&#8217;s to hoping that <em>Muppets Haunted Mansion</em> starts a new renaissance for Jim Henson&#8217;s creations.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/muppets-haunted-mansion-special/\">New &#8216;Muppets Haunted Mansion&#8217; Halloween Special is Coming to Disney+ This Fall</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=j8GicB8513E:0juyoitE1DE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=j8GicB8513E:0juyoitE1DE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=j8GicB8513E:0juyoitE1DE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=j8GicB8513E:0juyoitE1DE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=j8GicB8513E:0juyoitE1DE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=j8GicB8513E:0juyoitE1DE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/j8GicB8513E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 15:00:35 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/muppets-hauntedmansnion-firstpromo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"1d183fae6f8c2ab720ae73bd86b3b431","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn8@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-26-469_d56ee9f51e71fffb.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":32858,"destBytes":20592,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/muppets-hauntedmansnion-firstpromo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn8@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-26-469_d56ee9f51e71fffb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-737_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=j8GicB8513E:0juyoitE1DE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn77@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-27-539_42b52dd8de8f722a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=j8GicB8513E:0juyoitE1DE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn1@2020_3/2021/05/07/17-30-27-388_1f52ebe3bd42b7d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/j8GicB8513E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn35@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-27-694_13da4ac3c4938b13.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620408612174},{"createdTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","title":"Amazon Horror Anthology Series Being Developed by ‘Westworld’ Creators Jonathan Nolan & Lisa Joy","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670228","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Amazon-Horror-Anthology-Series.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670240\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Amazon-Horror-Anthology-Series-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Horror Anthology Series\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Amazon-Horror-Anthology-Series-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Amazon-Horror-Anthology-Series-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Amazon-Horror-Anthology-Series-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Amazon-Horror-Anthology-Series.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Westworld</em> creators <strong>Jonathan Nolan</strong> and <strong>Lisa Joy</strong> are teaming with<strong> Craig Macneill</strong> and <strong>Clay Chapman</strong>, the team behind the indie horror film <em>The Boy</em> (no, not the one about the creepy doll, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_(2015_film)\">other one</a>), for a new psychological horror anthology series being developed for Amazon. The series is called <strong><em>Unknown</em></strong>, and &#8220;plunges into the corners of the American landscape, probing the intersection of folklore and our bloody history of true crime.&#8221; The intersection of folklore and our bloody history of true crime is one of my favorite spots to hang out, so this sounds pretty cool to me.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670228\"></span></p>\n<p>This news comes to us via Deadline, which reports that Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy&#8217;s Kilter Films are working with Craig Macneill and Clay Chapman to develop <em>Unknown</em>, a psychological horror anthology series that &#8220;plunges into the corners of the American landscape, probing the intersection of folklore and our bloody history of true crime,&#8221; with the first season &#8220;centered around an estranged brother and sister, who return to the Texas Killing Fields, only to encounter a dark spirit that inhabits the region from their childhood.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Texas Killing Fields, for those who are unaware, is an area bordering the Calder Oil Field, which is a 25-acre patch of land situated a mile from Interstate Highway 45. Since the 1970s, at least 30 bodies – mostly young girls and women between the ages of 12–25 years – have been found in the area. Very few of the murders have been solved, and the common belief is that they&#8217;re the work of multiple serial killers. In other words, it&#8217;s a very good setting for a horror story.</p>\n<p>Macneill and Chapman worked together on the 2015 movie <em>The Boy</em>. Macneill has also directed episodes of the new Amazon series <em>Them</em>, as well as <em>The Twilight Zone</em> and <em>Castle Rock</em>. He also helmed <em>Lizzie</em>, a movie about Lizzie Borden starring Chloe Sevigny and Kristen Stewart. I quite enjoyed that film, although it seemed like I was in the minority there. Chapman has authored several horror novels, including <em>The Remaking</em> and the recently published <em>Whisper Down the Lane</em>. I&#8217;ve read <em>The Remaking</em>, and thought it was a good read.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for horror anthology stuff, so I&#8217;m all-in on <em>Unknown</em> (although that title is a tad generic, and it would be swell if they thought of something better before it premieres). <em>Unknown</em> is just the latest Amazon project for Nolan and Joy. They&#8217;re also working on an adaptation of  William Gibson&#8217;s sci-fi thriller <em>The Peripheral</em> for the streaming service as well.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/amazon-horror-anthology-series/\">Amazon Horror Anthology Series Being Developed by &#8216;Westworld&#8217; Creators Jonathan Nolan &#038; Lisa Joy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kz6RUiSusEo:aK9fVLuFcVU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kz6RUiSusEo:aK9fVLuFcVU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kz6RUiSusEo:aK9fVLuFcVU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kz6RUiSusEo:aK9fVLuFcVU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kz6RUiSusEo:aK9fVLuFcVU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kz6RUiSusEo:aK9fVLuFcVU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kz6RUiSusEo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 23:30:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Amazon-Horror-Anthology-Series-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"f20549cee7ebd35a6d4d62e637ca9ae0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn59@2020_3/2021/05/07/17-30-26-332_3ee81fd43834265d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":30853,"destBytes":17366,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Amazon-Horror-Anthology-Series-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn59@2020_3/2021/05/07/17-30-26-332_3ee81fd43834265d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-737_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kz6RUiSusEo:aK9fVLuFcVU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn59@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-27-397_77d60a6aab410320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kz6RUiSusEo:aK9fVLuFcVU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn24@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-392_6e097a8006de4aba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kz6RUiSusEo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-27-425_ce4b194ba15a2bad.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620408612173},{"createdTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","title":"Owen Wilson to Star in Family Action Movie ‘Secret Headquarters’ For Paramount and Bruckheimer Films","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670217","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670224\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/owen-wilson-e1620324126183-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"secret headquarters\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/owen-wilson-e1620324126183-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/owen-wilson-e1620324126183-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/owen-wilson-e1620324126183-768x328.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>We all know that past attempts to turn <strong>Owen Wilson</strong> into an action hero have fallen flat. But what this news about the <em>Loki</em> actor&#8217;s next project presupposes is&#8230;maybe they didn&#8217;t. Wilson has signed on to star in Paramount&#8217;s <strong><em>Secret Headquarters</em></strong>, a family action movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and helmed by <em>Project Power</em> directing duo <strong>Henry Joost</strong> and <strong>Ariel Schulman</strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670217\"></span></p>\n<p>Fresh off his first jaunt into the superhero genre, Wilson is looking to stay in the territory. Deadline reports that Wilson is set to star in Paramount Pictures and Bruckheimer Films&#8217; <em>Secret Headquarters</em>, described as a &#8220;high-concept family action movie&#8221; which follows &#8220;a kid who discovers the secret headquarters of the world’s most powerful superhero hidden beneath his home and must defend it with his group of friends when villains attack.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are no details yet on who Wilson will be playing.</p>\n<p><em>Secret Headquarters</em> will be helmed by directing duo Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, who recently directed the Netflix 2020 superhero film <em>Project Power</em>, but are best known for helming the 2010 documentary <em>Catfish</em> and several <em>Paranormal Activity </em>sequels. Joost &#38; Schulman, and Josh Koenigsberg are writing the current draft from an original screenplay by Christopher Yost (<em>Thor: Ragnarok, The Mandalorian</em>), who was the sole previous writer on the project. Chad Oman is also producing for Bruckheimer Films.</p>\n<p>Wilson has been relatively MIA from the big screen for the past few years, recently emerging to star opposite Salma Hayek in the Amazon Studios comedy <em>Bliss</em>. He will soon appear in Marvel&#8217;s Disney+ series <em>Loki</em>, Wilson&#8217;s first major brush with the superhero genre. And maybe it&#8217;s about time for the Wilson-aissance. The actor has frequently stolen the show in comedies like <em>Wedding Crashers</em> and <em>Shanghai Noon</em>, and has shown his dramatic chops in many a Wes Anderson film, but his past forays into the action genre have been hit or miss. Mainly miss, like the 2015 action thriller <em>No Escape</em>.</p>\n<p>But after a nearly four-year absence from the big screen, Wilson seems to be in full comeback mode.

Romero</strong> was commissioned by the Lutheran Society to make a movie – the filmmaker&#8217;s only work-for-hire film in his entire career. That film, titled <strong><em>The Amusement Park</em></strong>, was a twisted meditation on ageism, and it was thought to be lost. But recently, Romero&#8217;s <em>Amusement Park</em> was rediscovered and remastered – and now it&#8217;s headed to Shudder. It&#8217;s part of the horror streaming service&#8217;s summer slate, and there&#8217;s a great new trailer for you to watch below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670181\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Amusement Park Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLw_CYP02lg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>By all accounts, <em>The Amusement Park</em> isn&#8217;t a horror movie in the traditional sense. But gosh darn it, this is a well-cut trailer. It sells a surreal, unsettling experience, and I can&#8217;t wait to see it. Here&#8217;s the backstory:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Recently discovered and restored 46 years after its completion by the George A. Romero Foundation and produced by Suzanne Desrocher-Romero, The Amusement Park stars Martin’s Lincoln Maazel as an elderly man who finds himself disoriented and increasingly isolated as the pains, tragedies and humiliations of aging in America are manifested through roller coasters and chaotic crowds. Commissioned by the Lutheran Society, the film is perhaps Romero’s wildest and most imaginative movie, an allegory about the nightmarish realities of growing older, and is an alluring snapshot of the filmmaker&#8217;s early artistic capacity and style and would go on to inform his ensuing filmography. The “lost” film was restored in 4k by IndieCollect in New York City.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;The first and only work-for-hire in Romero’s career sheds a new perspective on an ongoing issue of ageism and Romero’s uncanny sense of reflection on society, and the Romero &#8216;footprint&#8217; is ever present and bodes well for the future of his impact on American cinema,&#8221; said Romero&#8217;s wife Suzanne Desrocher-Romero. The prospect of getting a &#8220;new&#8221; Romero movie some four years after his death is incredibly exciting, and the fact that it&#8217;s headed to Shudder is just more confirmation that the horror streaming service is something of a godsend.</p>\n<p><em>The Amusement Park</em> will haunt Shudder on <strong>June 8</strong>, and it is one of several films headed to the service in June. Here&#8217;s the full line-up.</p>\n<p><strong>Caveat – Premieres June 3 **A Shudder Original Film</strong></p>\n<p>(Available on Shudder US, Shudder CA, Shudder UKI and Shudder ANZ)</p>\n<p>Lone drifter Isaac accepts a job to look after his landlord&#8217;s niece, Olga, for a few days in an isolated house on a remote island.

A rocket car? Slingshotting a car around a cliff? Catching another car with a truck?! Those things couldn&#8217;t be real. And yet, <strong><em>F9</em></strong> shows that at least some of those are more real than expected. A new <em>F9</em> featurette released by Universal showcases the <em>Fast and Furious</em> sequel&#8217;s practical effects, of which there are a surprising number. I guess that&#8217;s what we should expect from <strong>Justin Lin</strong>, a filmmaker who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaHxGu5YeKM&#38;feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">actually strapped a giant, 9,000 pound safe</a> to the back of cars and had his stunt team drag it through the streets of Rio de Janeiro.

We go to see a bunch of cars go boom, and this latest featurette offers a minute and a half of glorious car mayhem. We already got a tease back in February <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/f9-behind-the-scenes/\">of the film&#8217;s practical effects</a>, but there&#8217;s something so ridiculous and giddy about watching the <em>F9</em> team just throw a bunch of cars at a moving tank. And that magnet scene where a truck catches another car? Real. It&#8217;s insane. &#8220;CAR-nage&#8221; indeed.</p>\n<p><em>F9</em> sees the return of many favorite and not-so-favorite characters, with an ensemble that includes <strong>Vin Diesel</strong>, <strong>Michelle Rodriguez</strong>, <strong>Tyrese Gibson</strong>, <strong>Chris &#8220;Ludacris&#8221; Bridges</strong>, <strong>Jordana Brewster</strong>, <strong>Nathalie Emmanuel</strong>, <strong>Helen Mirren</strong>, and <strong>Charlize Theron</strong>. Joining this time around is <strong>John Cena</strong> as Dom Toretto&#8217;s evil brother. And of course, there&#8217;s justice to be served with <strong>Sung Kang</strong>&#8216;s Han.</p>\n<p>Here’s the official synopsis for <em>F9</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Vin Diesel’s Dom Toretto is leading a quiet life off the grid with Letty and his son, little Brian, but they know that danger always lurks just over their peaceful horizon. This time, that threat will force Dom to confront the sins of his past if he’s going to save those he loves most. His crew joins together to stop a world-shattering plot led by the most skilled assassin and high-performance driver they’ve ever encountered: a man who also happens to be Dom’s forsaken brother, Jakob (John Cena, the upcoming The Suicide Squad).</p>\n<p>F9 sees the return of Justin Lin as director, who helmed the third, fourth, fifth and sixth chapters of the series when it transformed into a global blockbuster. The action hurtles around the globe—from London to Tokyo, from Central America to Edinburgh, and from a secret bunker in Azerbaijan to the teeming streets of Tbilisi. Along the way, old friends will be resurrected, old foes will return, history will be rewritten, and the true meaning of family will be tested like never before.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>F9</em> hurtles into theaters on <strong>June 25</strong>,<strong> 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/f9-featurette-practical-effects/\">&#8216;F9&#8217; Featurette Showcases Total &#8220;Car-nage,&#8221; Reveals a Dizzying Number of Practical Car Stunts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2sW99D0KN0w:LaK3mr2-u2A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2sW99D0KN0w:LaK3mr2-u2A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2sW99D0KN0w:LaK3mr2-u2A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2sW99D0KN0w:LaK3mr2-u2A:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2sW99D0KN0w:LaK3mr2-u2A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2sW99D0KN0w:LaK3mr2-u2A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/2sW99D0KN0w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 19:30:28 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/f9-featurette-700x293.jpg","linkMd5":"fd3ca7da90cca998a9af317fb1810466","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn99@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-13-338_0d2c2fd13e274af8.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":293,"sourceBytes":40822,"destBytes":29314,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/f9-featurette-700x293.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn99@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-13-338_0d2c2fd13e274af8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-737_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2sW99D0KN0w:LaK3mr2-u2A:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-27-963_fef96d2051cd79fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2sW99D0KN0w:LaK3mr2-u2A:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn82@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-583_af836b25e3211cb1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/2sW99D0KN0w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn31@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-28-039_5c832860a12fd219.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620408612172},{"createdTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","title":"The Morning Watch: Analyzing the ‘Stranger Things 4’ Teaser Clues, Making of ‘FallonVision’ Parody & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670274","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670283 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/strangerthings4-eleven-eyes-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Stranger Things 4 Trailer Clues\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/strangerthings4-eleven-eyes.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/strangerthings4-eleven-eyes-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/category/features/the-morning-watch/\">The Morning Watch</a> is a recurring feature that highlights a handful of noteworthy videos from around the web.

Considering the kid friendly style of these toys, it was an impressive little vehicle with a surprising number of accessories inspired by the time travel franchise. Now the German toy maker is time traveling again.</p>\n<p>Playmobil is releasing two new<em> Back to the Future</em> playsets. There&#8217;s one inspired by the &#8220;future&#8221; of <strong><em>Back to the Future Part II</em></strong> with a playset inspired by the hoverboard chase in Hill Valley town square, and then we have a new vehicle playset inspired by the end of the original <em>Back to the Future </em>(which is also the beginning of the sequel), when a little change in history back in 1955 made Marty McFly&#8217;s present day life in 1985 a little bit sweeter. Check out the new Playmobil <em>Back to the Future</em> playsets below. <span id=\"more-670293\"></span></p>\n<h2>New Playmobil Back to the Future Playsets</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670297 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtothefuture2-playmobil-hoverboardchase-promo-700x490.jpg\" alt=\"Playmobil Back to the Future Playsets\" width=\"700\" height=\"490\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtothefuture2-playmobil-hoverboardchase-promo-700x490.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtothefuture2-playmobil-hoverboardchase-promo-360x252.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtothefuture2-playmobil-hoverboardchase-promo-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/backtothefuture2-playmobil-hoverboardchase-promo.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>First up, let&#8217;s go into the future with the playset that allows you to recreate one of the most memorable sequences from the sequel. When a meeting between Marty McFly Jr. and Griff Tannen goes south, a hoverboard chase between young Marty McFly and Biff Tannen&#8217;s bionic implanted grandson tears through downtown Hill Valley. This playset delivers figures of both characters and their signature hoverboards, as well as a little piece of the town square.

In this second episode, titled &#8220;Cut and Run&#8221; (directed by Steward Lee and written by Gursiman Sandhu), the trouble with Crosshair on their trail takes a backseat in favor of an introspective glance at the shifting galactic order. The developing Empire is registering civilians. And this puts one clone in special danger since he has long deviated from his Republic service.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670322\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Having few allies to fall back on, the Bad Batch fugitives visit Cut Lawquane (Dee Bradley Baker, again), the clone deserter introduced in the <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars </em>season 2<i> </i>episode<i> </i>“The Deserter,” on his planet of Saleucami. As the only Bad Batch-er who hasn’t acquainted himself with Cut, Echo expresses indignation, asking “You would trust a deserter?” despite being a deserter himself. Brain chip or not, a deserter or not, a clone soldier will internalize his protocol.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There’s no better situation to bring back Cut, his Twi’lek wife Suu (thankfully the animators grant her a less sexualized and a farm-appropriate outfit), and Suu’s two hybrid kids (Nika Futterman and Kath Soucie). Cut is a type of pariah like the Bad Batch, so it feels natural that Hunter and the Bad Batch alumni would feel acquainted with Cut, and Cut was the one who showed Rex that there were other states of beings outside being subservient clone soldiers. (Cut is aware of the “behavioral implant” by this time and his mind seems untouched, but why his biochip doesn’t affect him is not acknowledged, perhaps likely because he never received Palpatine’s Order 66 call.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cut’s family needs to depart the planet to escape the Empire’s grip. But the Empire is shifting the order of the galaxy faster than their escape plan. A consequential economic shift from Republic currency to Imperial currency and tighter restrictions prevent Cut from purchasing a trip out. They have to strategize around the bureaucracy. Cut and his family require chain codes if they’re going to get past the clone-guarded checkpoints and leave the planet. Hunter also decides that Omega must join the Lawquane family off-planet, since she needs family stability, not soldiers to supervise her, although he can’t communicate that with her.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Whereas “kids causing trouble” tropes are tiresome and often a contrived trigger for action, there’s a guardianship moral here at its core, one that’s an interesting evolution of the trope in “The Deserter.” In an innocent attempt to retrieve a toy, Omega breaches a safety wire on the farm and a wild creature nearly mauls her – her Kamino solitude has not taught her to read the room. It’s a heartbreaking contrast from the moment she takes joy in the unfamiliar, the dirt and sunlight and friendly kids that play with her, and now she learns for the first time that there are scary creatures in the universe as often as there is sunlight. Suu and Cut preach the need to be cognizant that children can be a troublesome wild card, and adults should be patient for their emotional welfare. When Omega is rescued, Hunter scolds her, but Cut reminds Hunter that Omega is no soldier. She is not cut out for this lifestyle.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To bypass security, Tech and Echo devise a plan that involves leaving their ship in an Imperial impoundment yard to access an Empire base to attain the chain codes, but their mission is complicated by Omega’s unintentional presence on the ship. Her desire to help causes a hindrance and attracts unwanted enemy attention, but the Batch accommodates her route and she delivers the chain codes. However, she’s flummoxed by the news that Hunter made the decision for her to depart with Cut’s family, and she ends up running back to the Bad Batch’s arms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For many viewers, a precocious kid like Omega is still a make-it-or-break-it character in a series starring adult characters, and this episode will tick off some concerns. Omega, and her voice actress Ang, are no less charming than in her debut last episode since she is believable as a sheltered child and is the appropriate foil to the Bad Batch, one that brings an uncomfortable reckoning for Hunter about how war affected his outlook. Still, the script contrives some dunce decisions here for the Batch that clash with the grimy tone of the overall series in order for Omega to have her moment in the climax. Future episodes will have hopefully be more careful in integrating Omega’s kidishness into the darker storytelling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For an episode that&#8217;s all about the welfare of children, there’s a questionable outcome here, treated in the script as respecting a kid’s agency. Of course, Omega <em>has</em> to stick around with the main characters, and because this show lives a fantasy framework, a child’s decision to stay with fugitive soldiers is treated as what’s best for her welfare. Fellow <em>Star Wars</em> series <i>The Mandalorian</i> devised a more believable scenario where the experienced gunman Din Djarin can’t deposit his charge on an idyllic family life because only he has the skills to protect the young charge  against the galaxy (and bound by his culture to do so). Cut’s family blithely entering the transport with Omega indicates they gave Omega their blessing for her to run back into gunfire to her adoptive brothers, which is a pretty suspect decision for adults to make. But through all that, Hunter is ready to accept the messiness of being a guardian, suggesting a course for the rest of the series.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><b>Other Thoughts</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\">Supplementary materials say the kids are biologically Suu’s and a late human husband, but this plot element isn’t specified here. It feels like a missed opportunity to question if age-accelerated clones have the capacity to breed.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\">The guys also learn that Rex had recently visited Cut and alluded to the brain chips, which Omega seems to be aware of. Although the mystery is saved for later, this also asks the question when and how Rex separated from Ahsoka.</li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-the-bad-batch-aftermath-review/\"><span class=\"s1\">In my previous episode review,</span></a> I mentioned the colorism of the Bad Batch being fairer-skinned while the brute Wrecker is darker-skinned and more based on Temuera Morrison’s Maori profile.

The <em>Tenet</em> and <em>Malcom &#38; Marie</em> actor has signed on to star in the next movie directed by <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> and <em>Godzilla</em> filmmaker <strong>Gareth Edwards</strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670168\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline reports that John David Washington is reuniting with New Regency, which produced the David O. Russell film that Washington recently shot, for <strong><em>True Love</em></strong>, a science-fiction movie from Gareth Edwards. Edwards writes and directs <em>True Love</em>, which is described as a &#8220;near future sci-fi story.&#8221; No other details are provided of the plot. Kiri Hart will serve as a producer on the project along with Edwards. New Regency will produce and finance the film.</p>\n<p>Washington&#8217;s a busy guy lately. After earning Golden Globe and SAG nominations for his breakout performance in Spike Lee&#8217;s 2018 crime film <em>BlacKkKlansman</em>, Washington has been in hot demand as a new Hollywood leading man (his relation to his father, Denzel Washington, probably didn&#8217;t hurt either). In the past year, Washington starred in the Christopher Nolan sci-fi tentpole <em>Tenet</em>, before making another awards season bid with the Netflix black-and-white drama <em>Malcolm &#38; Marie</em>. He&#8217;s also set to star opposite Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, and a whole slew of A-list actors in David O. Russell&#8217;s next film.</p>\n<p>As for Edwards, his career has been relatively quiet since helming 2016&#8217;s <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em>. The film was mired in behind-the-scenes issues, with Tony Gilroy stepping in for <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/rogue-one-reshoots-problems-tony-gilroy/\">extensive reshoots</a> which ended up racking the <em>Rogue One</em>&#8216;s production budget to least $200 million, making it one of the most expensive films ever made. Still, <em>Rogue One</em> ended up grossing $1 billion worldwide, and Edwards still has the box office success of 2014&#8217;s <em>Godzilla</em> under his belt – the Legendary MonsterVerse movie made $524 million globally.</p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Edwards &#8220;had been developing several projects, wanting to make sure his next project was the right one before committing.&#8221; Edwards finally committed to <em>True Love</em> last year, which was swiftly picked up by New Regency after the package hit the market.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m not totally convinced by Washington as a leading man. Whatever charisma he showed in <em>BlacKkKlansman </em>seemed to be curiously missing in <em>Tenet</em>, even though Washington proved himself to be a talented physical performer. That said, sci-fi might be the best home for Washington, and maybe he&#8217;ll prove that he does have those leading-man chops with <em>True Love</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/john-david-washington-true-love-movie/\">&#8216;Tenet&#8217; Star John David Washington and &#8216;Rogue One&#8217; Director Gareth Edwards Teaming Up for New Science Fiction Film</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=r5stBXenMlc:-dWBcoz_C1M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=r5stBXenMlc:-dWBcoz_C1M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=r5stBXenMlc:-dWBcoz_C1M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=r5stBXenMlc:-dWBcoz_C1M:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=r5stBXenMlc:-dWBcoz_C1M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=r5stBXenMlc:-dWBcoz_C1M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/r5stBXenMlc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 18:30:31 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/john-david-washington-e1620314662796-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"bb4be6f6a969a8db4a22543863605679","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn48@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-24-650_69a5373449a1e985.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":25713,"destBytes":14304,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/john-david-washington-e1620314662796-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn48@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-24-650_69a5373449a1e985.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-737_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=r5stBXenMlc:-dWBcoz_C1M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn31@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-27-400_a004359718eb9e66.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=r5stBXenMlc:-dWBcoz_C1M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn73@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-27-538_74fdcf917a6bb5f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/r5stBXenMlc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn67@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-27-742_0aef25b2a708111b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620408612173},{"createdTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","title":"‘Hello Tomorrow!’: Billy Crudup to Star in Retro-Future AppleTV+ Show","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670233","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-670245 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hello-Tomorrow-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Hello Tomorrow\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hello-Tomorrow.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hello-Tomorrow-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>After winning an Emmy for his performance on the AppleTV+ series <em>The Morning Show</em>, <strong>Billy Crudup</strong> is set to headline his own show at the streamer.</p>\n<p>The <em>Watchmen</em> and <em>Almost Famous</em> star will executive produce and star in <em><strong>Hello Tomorrow!</strong></em>, a half-hour dramedy series set in a retro-future world.

Here&#8217;s the official description of the show:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Set in a retro-future world, Hello Tomorrow! centers around a group of traveling salesmen hawking lunar timeshares. Crudup stars as Jack, a salesman of great talent and ambition, whose unshakeable faith in a brighter tomorrow inspires his coworkers, revitalizes his desperate customers, but threatens to leave him dangerously lost in the very dream that sustains him.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s clear Apple wants to be in the Crudup business after seeing him on <em>The Morning Show</em>, and why wouldn&#8217;t they? The dude has been a consistently undervalued and underrated performer for years, but he can do pretty much anything: goofy comedy, heavy drama (remember his supporting role in <em>Spotlight</em>?), romance – he&#8217;s one of those actors who elevates any project he&#8217;s in. I&#8217;m excited to see him step into a lead role in a show like this, which sounds like it will utilize his natural charm and showcase his ability to swing between poles of emotion in the same episode.</p>\n<p><em>Hello Tomorrow!</em> is written and created by <strong>Amit Bhalla</strong> and <strong>Lucas Jansen</strong>, who previously collaborated on things like <em>Deadwood</em> creator David Milch&#8217;s 2014 TV movie <em>The Money</em> and the Netflix drama series <em>Bloodline</em>. They&#8217;ll executive produce along with <strong>Jonathan Entwistle</strong>, who co-created <em>The End of the F***ing World</em>, as well as Crudup, NBA superstar <strong>Blake Griffin</strong>, <strong>Ryan Kalil</strong>, and <strong>Noah Weinstein</strong>. Entwistle is also attached to direct the series, although it&#8217;s unclear exactly where this project falls on his list of priorities: he was previously <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/willow-tv-series-director-jonathan-entwistle/\">tapped</a> to direct the Disney+ TV continuation of the fantasy movie <em>Willow</em>, and he&#8217;s also been hired as the &#8220;conductor of a connected story universe&#8221; centering on the <em>Power Rangers</em>, where he&#8217;ll <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/power-rangers-connected-story-universe/\">oversee and direct</a> new film and television iterations of that franchise.</p>\n<p>Crudup can currently be seen in <em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em>, and will reprise his role as Cory Ellison on season 2 of <em>The Morning Show</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hello-tomorrow-billy-crudup/\">&#8216;Hello Tomorrow!&#8217;: Billy Crudup to Star in Retro-Future AppleTV+ Show</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i3FuB3yhyoM:dqOfc4WfL1w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i3FuB3yhyoM:dqOfc4WfL1w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i3FuB3yhyoM:dqOfc4WfL1w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i3FuB3yhyoM:dqOfc4WfL1w:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i3FuB3yhyoM:dqOfc4WfL1w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i3FuB3yhyoM:dqOfc4WfL1w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/i3FuB3yhyoM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 May 2021 00:30:01 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hello-Tomorrow-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c397dccd591bdc0a98025cb3b50c08c7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn89@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-20-529_34a25c5277420d28.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":35927,"destBytes":21858,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Hello-Tomorrow-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn89@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-20-529_34a25c5277420d28.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-737_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i3FuB3yhyoM:dqOfc4WfL1w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn32@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-27-725_b42d597004b8c524.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i3FuB3yhyoM:dqOfc4WfL1w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn12@2020_5/2021/05/07/17-30-27-605_966fdd8ab4611b90.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/i3FuB3yhyoM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn60@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-28-102_53092a7cd8efd983.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620408612154},{"createdTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","title":"‘Indiana Jones’ Trilogy Prints From Devin Schoeffler and ‘Wonder Woman 3D’ Prints by Juan Burgos Go On Sale Today","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670364","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670365\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/indiana-jones-prints-700x355.jpg\" alt=\"indiana jones prints\" width=\"700\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/indiana-jones-prints-700x355.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/indiana-jones-prints-360x182.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/indiana-jones-prints-768x389.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/indiana-jones-prints.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Bottleneck Gallery is working some magic with its newest prints.

Read on for the plot details about the series.<span id=\"more-670210\"></span></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/ali-wong-brian-k-vaughan-paper-girl-amazon-1234949068/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Ali Wong is heading to Amazon Prime Video to star in <em>Paper Girls</em>, the television adaptation of the Eisner Award-winning comic. The show &#8220;centers on four girls who are delivering newspapers on the day after Halloween in 1988 when they become unwittingly caught in a conflict between warring factions of time-travelers, sending them on an adventure through time that will save the world. As they travel between our present, the past and the future, they encounter future versions of themselves and must choose to embrace or reject their fate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just last week, Amazon announced the casting of its four main characters: <strong>Sofia Rosinsky</strong> (<em>The Other Side of the Door</em>) will play Mac Coyle, <strong>Camryn Jones</strong> (<em>Cherish the Day</em>) will play Tiffany Quilkin, <strong>Riley Lai Nelet</strong> (<em>Altered Carbon</em>) will play Erin Tieng, and <strong>Fina Strazza</strong> (<em>Law and Order: SVU</em>) will play KJ Bradman.</p>\n<p>Wong, whose other credits include <em>Fresh Off the Boat</em>, <em>Tuca &#38; Bertie</em>, <em>Onward</em>, <em>Big Mouth</em>, and <em>American Housewife</em>, is set to play the adult version of Erin, who comes face to face with her 12-year-old younger self. That&#8217;s when the two Erins &#8220;are forced to confront the gap between their childhood hopes, dreams, ambitions and the reality of their grown-up life.&#8221; In the comics, adult Erin is unmarried, struggles with anxiety, and still works at the same newspaper where young Erin recently started her paper route. Doesn&#8217;t sound like a terrible life to me! But this is classic time travel drama: expectations vs. reality, determinism vs. a &#8220;no fate but what we make&#8221; mentality, and maybe even some tinges of tragedy and confusion, all set against an exciting science fiction backdrop of an interplanetary war. I&#8217;ve read the first trade paperback of this series and it&#8217;s wonderful, so I&#8217;m very much looking forward to this adaptation.</p>\n<p><strong>Stephany Folsom</strong> (Amazon&#8217;s much-hyped <em>Lord of the Rings, Toy Story 4</em>) and <strong>Christopher C. Rogers</strong> (<em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>) are the co-showrunners of this adaptation, and they&#8217;re executive producing alongside Vaughan, Chiang, and <strong>Christopher Cantwell</strong>. Production is scheduled to begin this year in Chicago, but there is no premiere date in place yet.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/paper-girls-cast/\">Amazon&#8217;s &#8216;Paper Girls&#8217; Series Adds &#8216;Always Be My Maybe&#8217; Actress Ali Wong in a Lead Role</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CdjUDr6YSYk:SXpY-opl31Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CdjUDr6YSYk:SXpY-opl31Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CdjUDr6YSYk:SXpY-opl31Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CdjUDr6YSYk:SXpY-opl31Y:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CdjUDr6YSYk:SXpY-opl31Y:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CdjUDr6YSYk:SXpY-opl31Y:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/CdjUDr6YSYk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 22:00:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Paper-Girls-cast-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"874c17c65dcfb89a5453991ff869d9f9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn16@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-22-331_a2676996bc97efeb.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":37740,"destBytes":25174,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Paper-Girls-cast-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn16@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-22-331_a2676996bc97efeb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-737_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CdjUDr6YSYk:SXpY-opl31Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn28@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-27-722_de32374110ca59e5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CdjUDr6YSYk:SXpY-opl31Y:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-394_f325fd26c4a2c93c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/CdjUDr6YSYk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn35@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-28-049_5789fb383107e488.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620408612173},{"createdTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","title":"Superhero Bits: ‘The Simpsons’ Likely Doing a Marvel Short, ‘Moon Knight’ Set Photo & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670187","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670258 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/modok-banner-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"MODOK Banner\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/modok-banner.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/modok-banner-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>How is YouTube keeping the legacy of <strong><em>Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark</em></strong> alive?

Gawain contends with ghosts, giants, thieves, and schemers in what becomes a deeper journey to define his character and prove his worth in the eyes of his family and kingdom by facing the ultimate challenger. From visionary filmmaker David Lowery comes a fresh and bold spin on a classic tale from the knights of the round table.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Green Knight</em> arrives on <strong>July 30, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-green-knight-character-posters/\">&#8216;The Green Knight&#8217;

In an  interview with <a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a36330004/dave-bautista-drax-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Digital Spy</a>, Bautista admitted that he&#8217;s not sure where Drax&#8217;s future lies beyond <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the script of the third film is, to be honest with you,&#8221; Bautista said. &#8220;There was a script years ago that obviously is going to have to change because the whole direction of the Marvel universe has changed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So does that new direction for the Marvel Cinematic Universe mean a new direction and new storyline for Drax? In another life, maybe, Bautista said, revealing that, &#8220;There were talks for a while about a Drax and Mantis film.&#8221; The idea was proposed by <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> director <strong>James Gunn</strong>, who &#8220;really wanted to do a Drax and Mantis film. He laid it out to me. I thought it was such a brilliant idea, but I haven&#8217;t heard any follow-up from the studio.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Drax and Mantis made for a charming odd couple in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em>, with Bautista&#8217;s literal alien and Pom Klementieff&#8217;s naive empath delivering some of the funniest scenes from the sequel. But it seems like Marvel doesn&#8217;t have room for a Drax and Mantis spin-off — and Bautista <a href=\"https://www.joblo.com/movie-news/netflix-army-of-the-dead-dave-bautista-zack-snyder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has said</a> there&#8217;s &#8220;not a chance in hell&#8221; he would reprise the role for a TV series — so <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em> might be the last we see of Drax. Bautista said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p data-pw-in-article=\"true\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re very interested, or it doesn&#8217;t fit into the way they have things mapped out. But other than that, no. I mean, as far as my obligations, I&#8217;ve got Guardians 3, and that&#8217;s probably going to be the end of Drax.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-pw-in-article=\"true\">But what does &#8220;the end of Drax&#8221; mean? To take Bautista very literally (as Drax probably would do), we could interpret that as meaning Drax might die in the upcoming Marvel sequel. But maybe he&#8217;ll just fly off with Mantis for some unseen adventures, to pop up in a potential Marvel short or bonus feature down the line. Never say never.</p>\n<p data-pw-in-article=\"true\"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</em> is set to be released in theaters on <strong>May 5, 2023</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-drax-future/\">&#8216;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&#8217; Might Be the Last Time We See Drax, According to Dave Bautista</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AVnc_zIkG0M:qtF_Hs-CahY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AVnc_zIkG0M:qtF_Hs-CahY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AVnc_zIkG0M:qtF_Hs-CahY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AVnc_zIkG0M:qtF_Hs-CahY:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=AVnc_zIkG0M:qtF_Hs-CahY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AVnc_zIkG0M:qtF_Hs-CahY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AVnc_zIkG0M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 23:00:45 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/drax-gotg-e1620329434187-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"49dffb88752f4c6ae3e0a1d61b246c0e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn22@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-24-438_5bafcd3e9598532d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":38415,"destBytes":24956,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/drax-gotg-e1620329434187-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn22@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-24-438_5bafcd3e9598532d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-737_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AVnc_zIkG0M:qtF_Hs-CahY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn23@2020_3/2021/05/07/17-30-28-061_2734214d604f5de5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=AVnc_zIkG0M:qtF_Hs-CahY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn97@2020_3/2021/05/07/17-30-27-411_6e9ca5bb8cd61ac2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/AVnc_zIkG0M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn9@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-422_a3ca888a42e6292d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620408612159},{"createdTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","title":"Here’s Why Dave Bautista Chose ‘Army of the Dead’ Over ‘The Suicide Squad’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670220","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-670226\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"dave bautista army of the dead\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Dave Bautista</strong> was recently faced with an enviable choice: he had to decide to be in one big movie being made by a popular director, or another big movie being made by a popular director. Bautista was offered roles in both <strong>James Gunn</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>The Suicide Squad</em></strong> and <strong>Zack Snyder</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Army of the Dead</em></strong>, and while the actor has a great working relationship with Gunn, he ultimately decided on Snyder&#8217;s zombie movie. Why? Simple: it was the better career move. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Bautista didn&#8217;t feel a little guilty about turning his friend Gunn down.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-670220\"></span></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve long thought Dave Bautista is one of the best wrestlers-turned-actors because he seems to really be interested in acting. Most of the time when wrestlers jump to the big screen they&#8217;re basically playing the same uninspired role over and over again, but Bautista seems to actually want to challenge himself with his acting career, and I&#8217;ve always appreciated that. One of Bautista&#8217;s biggest stepping stones into the world of acting was his work in James Gunn&#8217;s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> films. As Drax, Bautista gets to show off his comedic chops, and he&#8217;s crafted a memorable, much-loved character in the process.</p>\n<p>The experience has made Bautista very appreciative of Gunn, and when Gunn was fired by Disney over some old but admittedly offensive tweets, Bautista was one of the first people to come to Gunn&#8217;s defense and push for him to be rehired. Eventually, Disney wised up and brought Gunn back into the fold. In the midst of all this happening, though, Gunn also was hired by Warner Bros. to direct <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. And as it turned out, Gunn had a role for Bautista in his new WB movie – but this resulted in a conflict.</p>\n<p>&#8220;James Gunn wrote a role for me in <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, which I was all fired up about, not only because he was making a huge comeback. He&#8217;s come back with <em>The Suicide Squad</em> and was rehired by Marvel, and has really been vindicated as far as that whole thing went,&#8221; Bautista told <a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a36329620/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead-suicide-squad-role/\">Digital Spy</a>. &#8220;I was all up for it, and then I got <em>Army of the Dead</em>, which was not only a lead role for me, but also I really wanted to work with Zack Snyder. I&#8217;ve been wanting to work with him for years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As Bautista saw it, he had to make the decision that was best for his career. &#8220;I had <em>The Suicide Squad</em> where I got to work with my boy again, even though it&#8217;s a smaller role, and then I had <em>Army of the Dead</em> on which I get to work with Zack, I get to build a relationship with Netflix, I get a lead role in a great film – and I get paid a lot more money,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Bautista went with <em>Army of the Dead</em>, but he felt bad about turning down Gunn, telling the filmmaker, &#8220;It breaks my heart, because as a friend, I want to be there with you, but professionally, this is the smart decision for me.&#8221; But Gunn, for his part, was completely understanding. &#8220;He said, &#8216;I completely get it. I&#8217;m proud of you that you&#8217;re even in this position. I&#8217;m proud that I had something to do with you being in this position where you have to make these hard decisions.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>And now Bautista gets to lead his own Netflix movie, which is due to arrive in select theaters on May 14, and then digitally on Netflix on May 21.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead/\">Here&#8217;s Why Dave Bautista Chose &#8216;Army of the Dead&#8217; Over &#8216;The Suicide Squad&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Vu8-w9_tPrY:EuKScmGfkN8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Vu8-w9_tPrY:EuKScmGfkN8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Vu8-w9_tPrY:EuKScmGfkN8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Vu8-w9_tPrY:EuKScmGfkN8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Vu8-w9_tPrY:EuKScmGfkN8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Vu8-w9_tPrY:EuKScmGfkN8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Vu8-w9_tPrY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 May 2021 21:30:52 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"01b470e5c6c9dc45388881029c6ad3de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn87@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-13-563_57e14415a4f6e210.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":23914,"destBytes":13862,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dave-bautista-army-of-the-dead-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn87@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-13-563_57e14415a4f6e210.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn48@2020_6/2021/05/07/17-30-27-737_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Vu8-w9_tPrY:EuKScmGfkN8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn52@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-256_a5f87da8c45b88c5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_4/2021/05/07/17-30-28-173_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Vu8-w9_tPrY:EuKScmGfkN8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn4@2020_1/2021/05/07/17-30-27-999_c3e8aa6d9f3b9aed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Vu8-w9_tPrY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn14@2020_2/2021/05/07/17-30-27-355_6324ebf0b369a790.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1620408612159},{"createdTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","updatedTime":"2021-05-08 01:30:12","title":"The Quarantine Stream: ‘Blue Chips’ is One of the Great Basketball Movies of the 1990s","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=670143","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-670151 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bluechips-nicknolte-shouting-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Chips\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bluechips-nicknolte-shouting.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/bluechips-nicknolte-shouting-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/the-quarantine-stream\"><strong>The Quarantine Stream</strong></a>, a new series where the /Film team shares what they’ve been watching while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Movie</strong>: <em>Blue Chips<span class=\"aCOpRe\"><br />\n</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Where You Can Stream It</strong>: Hulu</p>\n<p><strong>The Pitch</strong>: Dedicated college basketball coach Pete Bell (Nick Nolte) has come to the realization that no matter what he does, his team of underdogs at Western University can&#8217;t win – at least not without some new talent. After issuing a national search, Pete makes prospective players promises he knows he can&#8217;t keep. Though he despises what he has done to get them, the new recruits prove to be worth their weight in gold and the answer to all coach Pete&#8217;s prayers. But is it worth it?</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Essential Viewing</strong>: Back in the 1990s, largely thanks to the historic championship run of the Chicago Bulls, basketball was all the rage. A stream of basketball-centric movies clamored for the big screen, and while there are a lot of duds out there among them, <em>Blue Chips</em> and the story of a college coach struggling to balance his passion for the purity of the game, his desire to win, his frustration with losing, and eventually his moral backbone. Oh, and did I mention this movie is directed by <em>The French Connection</em> and <em>The Exorcist</em> filmmaker William Friedkin?<span id=\"more-670143\"></span></p>\n<p>With a script from sports movie screenwriter Ron Shelton (<em>White Men Can&#8217;t Jump</em>, <em>Bull Durham</em>), <em>Blue Chips</em> digs into the college sports world, the title referring to <span class=\"ILfuVd\"><span class=\"hgKElc\">athletes, particularly high school players, who are being targeted for drafting or signing by teams at the college level. As the fictional Western University hunts for players to help them out of their losing streak, coach Pete Bell realizes that the world of college basketball is changing around him, and if he really wants to win, it&#8217;s going to require him to bend some rules and turn his back on his integrity.</span></span></p>\n<p>Nick Nolte plays Coach Pete Bell with such passion and ferocity. Though he&#8217;s an abrasive force on the court, which comes from the actor&#8217;s time shadowing legendary Indiana Hoosiers coach Bobby Knight for the role, he&#8217;s also the kind of coach who actually takes the time to care for his players, makes sure they&#8217;re doing well in school, and wants the best for anyone who&#8217;s on the team. What he doesn&#8217;t want is for them to be corrupted by the &#8220;friends of the program&#8221; who have started to wave their money around in an effort to make the team better, offering all sorts of bribes to entice players.</p>\n<p>The cast utilizes real professional basketball players like Shaquille O&#8217;Neal, Anfernee &#8220;Penny&#8221; Hardaway, and Matt Nover as the rising recruits of Western University, lending an authenticity to the film. In fact, it was Hardaway&#8217;s work on <em>Blue Chips</em> with O&#8217;Neal that led to him being drafted to play with the Man of Steel by the Orlando Magic. Other famous faces from the world of basketball making appearances include Larry Bird, Bob Cousy, Jerry Tarkanian, Matt Painter, Dick Vitale, and even Bobby Knight as himself in the film&#8217;s final game.</p>\n<p><em>Blue Chips</em> brings an intensity to the basketball court and the behind-the-scenes dealings that have corrupted the game that only a director like William Friedkin can deliver. Nick Nolte drives this movie with both ferocity and even a bit of charm. And let&#8217;s not forget J.T. Walsh as the conniving head of the friends of the program, playing the perfect white collar villain.
