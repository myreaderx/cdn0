I apologize for not being super familiar with DIY.</em><br/> <em>I read it all of the time, but first time posting here. I&#39;m not sure why the bot keeps killing my post, but I&#39;ve read all of the rules and am pretty sure I&#39;ve carefully followed them? I&#39;m going to note the specific parts as they relate to the rules so I don&#39;t miss any this time.</em></p> <p>Hi. I have a small tool room in my house (the washer and dryer are in there too). I have a pegboard hanging on both sides of the room. Besides cutting the pegboard to fit the wall space, there are some internal cutouts in the pegboard (for a cleanout pipe, the W/D hookup, a fuse box, and some electrical outlets). I&#39;m trying to find some kind of material that I can use to wrap along of the rough edges (both outer and inner) to make the pegboard look nicer. <em>(rule #4 - specific question).</em> I&#39;m in the process of stacking my W/D and installing cabinets (with a countertop) so that I have room to put all of my powertools, boxes of nails, and etc. The cabinets are all standard kitchen cabinets from IKEA. <em>(rule #1 - self text post)</em></p> <p>I&#39;ve poked around on Pintrest and noticed that a lot of people cut out wooden frames - like they&#39;re framing a picture - and place that around the edges of the pegboard. While it looks nice, I have a few problems with that solution. It would cut into my space (not much, but a bit), it would be fairly involved doing all of the cuts, the inner cuts (like the plug outlet) would be very difficult and again take up a lot of space, and I think it would be hard to attach the edging given I need the pegboard spaced properly from the wall (for hanging the hooks). <em>(rule #5 - previous research)</em></p> <p>I had found a type of vinyl edging that looked nice and I thought would work. It was thin enough where it would almost fit the edges perfectly, but I think it was selling for about $25 per 10 feet? ...something like that. I don&#39;t really want to spend that kind of money just for a pegboard wrapping in a tool room, though I would if it were the only option. There&#39;s about 90 feet of perimeter that needs to be wrapped when you factor all of the inner and outer cuts. <em>(rule #5 - previous research)</em></p> <p>Does anybody have a suggestion of what material I might be able to use? Is there some kind of special material that is perhaps fabricated specifically for this purpose? I&#39;m open to any material. Any suggestions or advice is greatly welcome. I&#39;m fairly handy and and I could probably make most suggestions work (within reason) and will likely have the tools required to fasten everything. And if not, having a need for it is always the best justification for spending money on a new tool, amiright?</p> <p>But really, I&#39;d prefer to find something that requires minimal assembly, but can do whatever is necessary if it turns out that there&#39;s not a lot of options. <em>(rule #4 - specific question).</em></p> <p>I am in Austin, Texas, but the building codes are irrelevant to such a project. <em>(rule #3 - location)</em></p> <p>Here is a photo gallery with both sides of the room and one closeup of an outlet just to illustrate how some of it would have to be installed. <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Jn6SnGa\">https://imgur.com/a/Jn6SnGa</a> <em>(rule #2 - photo)</em></p> <p>Thanks in advance for any help / suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kl0\"> /u/kl0 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imsmf1/help_request_trying_to_figure_out_the_best_way_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imsmf1/help_request_trying_to_figure_out_the_best_way_to/\">[留言]</a></span>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":13046,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4b8d28af553b95f7cda7e8c27e0f2cf2","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"/u/kl0","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295491624},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","title":"Pine Patio Furniture Project","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imnljj/pine_patio_furniture_project/","description":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imnljj/pine_patio_furniture_project/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ozh-K4Yc7rfMU9qXwJ7w8kaO4NMyyoWnTSMwEm1MzUw.jpg\" alt=\"Pine Patio Furniture Project\" title=\"Pine Patio Furniture Project\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SvenGali911\"> /u/SvenGali911 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/LIeQeP9\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imnljj/pine_patio_furniture_project/\">[留言]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":13046,"bgimg":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ozh-K4Yc7rfMU9qXwJ7w8kaO4NMyyoWnTSMwEm1MzUw.jpg","linkMd5":"4592f0b1b67ea5c7ac3a376c608e9275","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn29@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-44-51-828_d42a2e71063067a0.webp","destWidth":140,"destHeight":104,"sourceBytes":6580,"destBytes":5486,"author":"/u/SvenGali911","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Ozh-K4Yc7rfMU9qXwJ7w8kaO4NMyyoWnTSMwEm1MzUw.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn29@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-44-51-828_d42a2e71063067a0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295491624},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","title":"I cannot find a beam in my ceiling.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imri7h/i_cannot_find_a_beam_in_my_ceiling/","description":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I know of the 16 and 28 inch trick but even when tapping there, around it and more, the entire floor sounds the same.

My saga began with a visit to the Donald Judd Chinati compound in Marfa. There he restored several military barracks and added large picture and 4-pane windows to many of the structures that reside on the site. I know he was very hands-on/DIY and have read that he and his builder made many of the doors and windows for the buildings. I was able to snap some pics of what seem to me to be pretty simple frames holding single pane pieces of glass (obviously we will go with double pane/insulated glass for our windows). It sent me down the path of trying to figure out the best way to get large wooden windows for my project at a more (relatively) affordable cost. It seems to me that one could have your double pane glazing made at a glass or window store, build your simple frame, do the required insulation, weather/waterproofing, and end up with some good windows. My question is, has anyone had any experience with creating fixed picture windows, and could you share some insights (maybe instructions) for how you achieved it? The first image I included is of one of the Judd quarter-pane windows that I mentioned. Though there are 4 panes of glass in his windows, we plan to go with one, big single pane. I’m referencing his simply for the frame design. The images following that are of the style of window we plan on having in the house… Large, single pane fixed picture windows. I’ve seen vids on Youtube of people creating their own window frames, but the process they show is very time consuming as it involves a lot of routing and shaping, whereas the Judd frames are a much simpler construction using things like butt joints instead of miter joints. Getting any info on creating simple wood frame picture windows has be like trying to crack some code, so any help on this topic is much appreciated. Thanks!</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5vu50uo3z6l51.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb1d3155cc0f6fdeb56b0e6faf8c65176c46fc7\">https://preview.redd.it/5vu50uo3z6l51.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb1d3155cc0f6fdeb56b0e6faf8c65176c46fc7</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/726e8yo3z6l51.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d463daa66d0f7c7b6c315a1effa66ca5207e5a01\">https://preview.redd.it/726e8yo3z6l51.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d463daa66d0f7c7b6c315a1effa66ca5207e5a01</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rhy7nxo3z6l51.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae335ee7e63969dc14bd9476d0b20fcb488bea0\">https://preview.redd.it/rhy7nxo3z6l51.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cae335ee7e63969dc14bd9476d0b20fcb488bea0</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/gwz6huo3z6l51.jpg?width=468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=464a14e92fd6194bf13e6cfeebf51e5dd4312ee7\">https://preview.redd.it/gwz6huo3z6l51.jpg?width=468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=464a14e92fd6194bf13e6cfeebf51e5dd4312ee7</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/41km2yo3z6l51.jpg?width=468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f9ef9829542a788c089194e42e4bc03927cef13\">https://preview.redd.it/41km2yo3z6l51.jpg?width=468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f9ef9829542a788c089194e42e4bc03927cef13</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/r37v24p3z6l51.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1216db58cccb64c0699428dc8312a35aae16670f\">https://preview.redd.it/r37v24p3z6l51.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1216db58cccb64c0699428dc8312a35aae16670f</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lbhr23p3z6l51.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9926a51221da53d0f1d8911437a5f352604517\">https://preview.redd.it/lbhr23p3z6l51.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9926a51221da53d0f1d8911437a5f352604517</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/msue5yo3z6l51.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f40a5df938fa231a62a082504c34011e670fa92f\">https://preview.redd.it/msue5yo3z6l51.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f40a5df938fa231a62a082504c34011e670fa92f</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v9t1ozo3z6l51.jpg?width=651&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0e66f97209671272556c732f5be07388d4890a0\">https://preview.redd.it/v9t1ozo3z6l51.jpg?width=651&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0e66f97209671272556c732f5be07388d4890a0</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

I hope y&#39;all can help because I&#39;m a novice.</p> <p>I recently installed <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-48-in-x-12-in-Low-Profile-Selectable-LED-Flush-Mount-Ceiling-Flat-Panel-Brushed-Nickel-Rectangle-4000-Lumens-Dimmable-54325111/304621409\">this ceiling light from Home Depot</a> in the kitchen and it&#39;s been working great.</p> <p>I bought <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0771BC2YH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">this dimmer switch</a> from Amazon with admittedly little knowledge on the subject. It seemed alright and I hoped it&#39;d work.</p> <p>Below are some pictures I took of the new and existing switches -</p> <p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JtIE72g.jpg\">Close up of new switch&#39;s wires</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/QVYEvQ8.jpg\">Close up of the side of the new switch&#39;s side</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/1kHxDvr.jpg\">Close up of the back of the old switch</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/eJOKETx.jpg\">Shot of the electrical box&#39;s rats nest</a></p> <p>I connected the existing blue wire (which I believe to ground - it was connected to &quot;common&quot; on the old switch) to the new switch&#39;s green wire.</p> <p>I then randomly connected the orange wires to the new switch&#39;s black and red wire. I left the one with the 3-pole label alone (didn&#39;t cap it either).</p> <p>I&#39;m not getting any power to the ceiling lamp once everything is wired up in the above config. Of note is the ceiling lamp has a switch on either side of the kitchen. They don&#39;t necessarily work independently of each other: I can flip one of them and the light turns on, and then flip the other and it turns off. Both switches are capable of being in on-and-off positions relative to the other. Let me know if I need to clarify. After replacing the old switch the light works again so nothing is &quot;broken&quot;.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know what to say about the black and white wires in the electrical box. It&#39;s a condo in Miami built in 1983. I tried Googling &quot;new dimmer switch doesn&#39;t turn on&quot; but didn&#39;t feel comfortable with the search results.</p> <p>My questions: am I connecting everything correctly, and if so did I simply buy the wrong dimmer? Does the issue look beyond a novice&#39;s skillset and I should hire an electrician?</p> <p>Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this and is kind enough to respond.</p> <p>edit 1: I believe the orange/red and blue wires coming out of the box are 14 gauge copper. The wires coming out of the new switch are composed of a bunch of little silver wires/fibers. I twisted them together and capped them. I connected the orange wires just one way. I didn&#39;t reconnect them in an opposite fashion.</p> <p>edit 2: I messed around with the little adjustment wheel but it had no effect. Also toggled the secondary switch in the kitchen but the light didn&#39;t turn on.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cigquitthrowaway\"> /u/cigquitthrowaway </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imrmby/cant_get_new_dimmer_switch_to_turn_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imrmby/cant_get_new_dimmer_switch_to_turn_on/\">[留言]</a></span>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":13046,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9ed7602a1d27a03e7aca958fab4e1779","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"/u/cigquitthrowaway","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295491624},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","title":"Racking my brain on a custom light diffuser design! Hoping some clever ideas out there.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imtb8r/racking_my_brain_on_a_custom_light_diffuser/","description":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi!</p> <p>This honestly sounded so simple when I started. I’m wondering if it’s deceptively difficult or I’m just making it harder than it needs to be.</p> <p>I’m having difficulty coming up with a method to make in acrylic/plexiglass/lexan, what my 3D printer so easily creates in PLA. Essentially I’m trying to make a light diffusing lid with half-thickness slots. I’m satisfied with my design and my wood/CNC and PLA/3D printed prototypes, and am trying to make a demo out of the legit production material, whatever it might be.</p> <p>For example, a 10mm thick sheet of plywood with 5mm deep square slots cut into it. The slots don’t go all the way through, but are deeper than a simple laser engraving. This is easily done on a CNC, even easier made on a 3D printer, but not so easy with a brittle acrylic/plexiglass material.</p> <p>One solution in my mind is resin casting, which would diffuse light well and allow for such slot modifications. But I don’t think this is a very affordable mass production option.</p> <p>Is there a better material or method?</p> <p>Edit: forgot to mention that it needs to be a diffuser material. Opal acrylic is one good example.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/aslyons001\"> /u/aslyons001 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imtb8r/racking_my_brain_on_a_custom_light_diffuser/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imtb8r/racking_my_brain_on_a_custom_light_diffuser/\">[留言]</a></span>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":13046,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"94d050f2eeb0004527b52cd761dceb0c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"/u/aslyons001","publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295491624},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","title":"Super quick and easy workbench for under $100 with limited tools!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imo8sb/super_quick_and_easy_workbench_for_under_100_with/","description":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imo8sb/super_quick_and_easy_workbench_for_under_100_with/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0H5uojY-btLpxZSp58M7NJS5tJQxVgxA1WmSnqC1BuE.jpg\" alt=\"Super quick and easy workbench for under $100 with limited tools!\" title=\"Super quick and easy workbench for under $100 with limited tools!\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DesignCraft_Workshop\"> /u/DesignCraft_Workshop </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/bBAnbj012p4\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imo8sb/super_quick_and_easy_workbench_for_under_100_with/\">[留言]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","descriptionType":"html","feedId":13046,"bgimg":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0H5uojY-btLpxZSp58M7NJS5tJQxVgxA1WmSnqC1BuE.jpg","linkMd5":"1c736df793d03429c4a1ef1650ed2dd0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn86@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-44-51-829_bd915763884f8786.webp","destWidth":140,"destHeight":105,"sourceBytes":5606,"destBytes":4232,"author":"/u/DesignCraft_Workshop","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/0H5uojY-btLpxZSp58M7NJS5tJQxVgxA1WmSnqC1BuE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn86@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-44-51-829_bd915763884f8786.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295491625},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:44:51","title":"Is it possible to make a desk with no special equipment?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/imly3s/is_it_possible_to_make_a_desk_with_no_special/","description":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I tried looking at some tutorials, but all of them have like $10.000&#39;s worth of tools that they use.<br/> I do have a small circular saw, but not one of those big table ones that they always use.<br/> Do any of you people have expirience making a desk with limited tools and working space?</p> <p>Also, where do I buy the wood for the desk?
