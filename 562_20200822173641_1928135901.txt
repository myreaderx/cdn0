Here’s an overview of new features coming to Chrome this fall. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Keep tabs on your tabs</h3><p>Ever lost track of tabs on your phone? Us too. Over the next few weeks, you’ll see Android’s new grid layout, which helps you select tabs more easily and preview thumbnails of the tabs you have open. (iOS users will already see this tab grid layout). </p><p>There’s also a new way to group tabs on your Android device, which helps you keep track of the tabs that are open. To do this, drag and drop one tab on top of another in the new tab grid layout. After opening one of the grouped tabs, you can easily switch between the tabs in the group using the new tab switcher at the bottom of your screen. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"ChromeSocial_GroupTab_V03.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/ChromeSocial_GroupTab_V03.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>The tab grid layout and tab grouping capabilities make it easier than ever to stay organized in Chrome on your Android device</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>If you have so many tabs open on your laptop that you can’t read the page titles anymore (guilty!), you can now preview your tabs by hovering over them with your cursor.

If plants and nature help you relax and unwind, change the background of your new tab page to a floral design. If you draw energy from the color yellow, use Chrome’s new color customization tool to change the color of your entire browser to the shade that brings you bliss. As for me, my browser color matches my hair—bright pink. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Copy of _ChromeSocial_customizeColors_V02.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Copy_of__ChromeSocial_customizeColors_V02.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Make Chrome yours by customizing the background, color, and theme</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>These features help boost your <a href=\"https://www.google.com/chrome/productivity/?brand=SGME&amp;utm_source=blog.google&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=get-more-done-with-google-chrome&amp;utm_keyword=SGME\">productivity</a>, but these aren’t the only features we’re adding this year.

Along with providing strong default protections, we aim to give you accessible, intuitive, and useful controls so you can make choices that are right for you. So, today we’ve started rolling out new tools and a redesign of Chrome’s privacy and security settings on desktop, to help you control your safety on the web. </p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Easy to understand controls</h3><p>With this redesign, we’ve made the controls even easier to find and understand, with simplified language and visuals:</p><p></p><ul><li>It’s easier to manage <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en-GB\">cookies</a>. You can choose if and how cookies are used by websites you visit, with options to block third-party cookies in regular or Incognito mode, and to block all cookies on some or all websites. </li><li>In Site Settings, we’ve reorganized the controls into two distinct sections to make it easier to find the most sensitive website permissions: access to your location, camera or microphone, and notifications. A new section also highlights the most recent permissions activity.</li><li>At the top of Chrome settings, you’ll see “You and Google” (previously “People”), where you can find <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en-GB\">sync</a> controls. These controls put you in charge of what data is shared with Google to store in your Google Account  and made available across all your devices.</li><li>Because many people regularly delete their browsing history, we’ve moved that control, “Clear browsing data”, to the top of the Privacy &amp; Security section. </li></ul></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"01 Settings_small size.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/01_Settings_small_size.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Clearer, more accessible controls to help you manage cookies.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Safety check in Chrome<b> </b></h3><p>With our new safety check in settings, you can quickly confirm the safety of your experience in Chrome.</p><p></p><ul><li>The new tool will tell you if the passwords you’ve asked Chrome to remember have been compromised, and if so, how to fix them. </li><li>It will flag if Safe Browsing, Google’s technology to warn before you visit a dangerous site or download a harmful app or extension, is turned off. </li><li>The safety check tool also has a new additional way to quickly see if your version of Chrome is up to date, i.e. if it’s updated with the latest security protections. </li><li>If malicious extensions are installed, it will tell you how and where to remove them.</li></ul><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"02 Safety check.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/02_Safety_check.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Check if your passwords have been compromised and if so, fix them with Chrome’s help.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Third-party cookie controls in Incognito mode </h3><p>In Incognito mode, where people come for a more private browsing experience, Chrome doesn’t save your browsing history, information entered in forms or browser cookies. While we continue to work on our long-term effort to make the web more private and secure with <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html\">Privacy Sandbox</a>, we want to strengthen the Incognito protections in the meantime. In addition to deleting cookies every time you close the browser window in Incognito, we will also start blocking third-party cookies by default within each Incognito session and include a prominent control on the New Tab Page. You can allow third-party cookies for specific sites by clicking the “eye” icon in the address bar. This feature will gradually roll out, starting on desktop operating systems and on Android.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"03 Incognito.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/03_Incognito.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Incognito mode blocks third-party cookies within each session.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>A new home for your extensions</h3><p>Starting today you’ll start to see a new puzzle icon for your extensions on your toolbar. It’s a neat way to tidy up your toolbar, and gives you more control over what data extensions can access on sites you visit. With this addition, you’ll still be able to pin your favorite extensions to the toolbar.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"04 Extensions.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/04_Extensions_uoIcO5h.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Opening menu displays your extensions and shows you what data they can currently access.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Upgraded security with Enhanced Safe Browsing protection and Secure DNS</h3><p>We’re bringing you two major security upgrades that you can opt in to. First, <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2020/05/enhanced-safe-browsing-protection-now.html\">Enhanced Safe Browsing</a> gives you more proactive and tailored protections from phishing, malware and other web-based threats. If you turn on Enhanced Safe Browsing, Chrome proactively checks whether pages and downloads are dangerous by sending information about them to Google Safe Browsing.  If you’re signed in to Chrome, then Chrome and other Google apps you use (Gmail, Drive, etc.) will further protect you based on a holistic view of threats you encounter on the web and attacks against your Google Account. Over the next year, we’ll be adding even more protections to this mode including tailored warnings for phishing sites and file downloads, and cross-product alerts.<br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"02 Enhanced Safe Browsing_small size.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/02_Enhanced_Safe_Browsing_small_size.gif\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Enhanced Safe Browsing offers the highest-level of security.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>We’re also launching Secure DNS, a feature designed to improve your security and privacy while browsing the web. When you access a website, your browser first needs to determine which server is hosting it, using a step known as a \"DNS (Domain Name System) lookup.\" Chrome's Secure DNS feature <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/a-safer-and-more-private-browsing-DoH.html\">uses DNS-over-HTTPS to encrypt this step</a>, thereby helping prevent attackers from observing what sites you visit or sending you to phishing websites. By default, Chrome will automatically upgrade you to DNS-over-HTTPS if your current service provider supports it. You can also configure a different secure DNS provider in the Advanced security section, or disable the feature altogether. </p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"DoH_Option 2.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/DoH_Option_2.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Secure DNS can be configured to use your current ISP's service if available (default), another provider from a list, or a custom provider.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>These new updates and features, including our redesigned Privacy and Security settings, will be coming to Chrome on desktop platforms in upcoming weeks. We’ll continue to focus on features that protect your privacy and security as you’re browsing the web with Chrome, in addition to giving you clear and useful choices around managing your
