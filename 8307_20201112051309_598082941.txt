However, the spin-dependent splitting is very tiny due to the weak spin–orbit coupling, and\r\nprevious investigations for enhancing this phenomenon have some serious limitations (e.g.\r\ninconvenient to tune, inadequate attention in terahertz region). Therefore, controlling and\r\nenhancing the photonic SHE in a flexible way is highly desirable, especially for terahertz region.\r\nIn this contribution, we propose a method to manipulate the photonic SHE by taking advantage of\r\ntunable optical properties of graphene via weak optical pumping. We find that photonic SHE of\r\ngraphene-dielectric structure in terahertz region is quite sensitive to the pumping power. The spin\r\nshift for H polarized incident beam can reach its upper limitation under the optimal pumping power,\r\nwhich is related to the zero value of the real part of graphene conductivity. These findings may\r\nprovide a new degree o...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":8307,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2fd893422a3c5ac8fe084de1fde770bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Peng Dong, Jie Cheng, Haixia Da and Xiaohong Yan","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605157989023}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-12 13:13:09","updatedTime":"2020-11-12 13:13:09","feedId":8307,"fetchDate":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 05:13:09 +0000","fetchMs":26621,"handleMs":8,"totalMs":26640,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"c95099efafc17f9e0beaf843cecd5c56","hostName":"us-028*","requestId":"9729a7dea6654bdb98cc9ed3e8adbba9_8307","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:34:16","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 12:32:30","id":8307,"name":"New Journal of Physics - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/?rss=1","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn87@2020_3/2020/09/06/04-32-30-586_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for New Journal of Physics","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605157962391,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":26624,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":8,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
