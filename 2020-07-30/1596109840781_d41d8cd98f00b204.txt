It’s the third-largest state in the country and home to over 40 million people and a range of environments and landscapes: dense forests in the north, rugged mountains in the east, majestic deserts in the south, world-class beaches on the coast, and the fabulous wine regions on the coast and central valley. </p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s perfect for road trips. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/california-road-trip-one-week-itinerary/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">I’ve already outlined an awesome seven-day itinerary for Southern California</a>, but today I wanted to share a longer, more comprehensive route for anyone who has a few weeks to explore more of the state’s cities and landscapes.</p>\n<p>Even with three weeks, you’ll still miss a lot of great spots in this state (I mean you could spend months traveling California) but this suggested itinerary hits some of my favorite major — and not so major — places.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 1–3: San Francisco </h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/calithreeweek2.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The famous Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California\"><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">San Francisco</a> is one of the most recognizable cities in the US. Home to hippies, yuppies, techies, students, and a sizeable immigrant community, it’s a vibrant and diverse city. It is an eclectic destination to visit. Here’s a list of a few of my favorite things to see and do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Walk the Golden Gate Bridge</strong> – When it opened, it was the world’s longest and tallest suspension bridge, stretching some 4,200 feet. It offers incredible views of the bay and the ships coming and going. You can walk across it too. </li>\n<li><strong>Tour Alcatraz</strong> – Alcatraz is one of the most infamous former prisons in the country. It housed some of the nation’s worst criminals, such as Al Capone. Today, it’s a national landmark where you can take tours of the prison, step foot in the cells, and learn about its history.</li>\n<li><strong>Visit the Beat Museum</strong> – Dedicated to the 1950s Beat Generation, this unique museum houses original manuscripts, rare books, letters, and more from authors like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. It also holds regular events, so check the website to see if anything is happening during your visit.</li>\n<li><strong>Take a food tour</strong> – San Francisco is known for its foodie culture. If you want to cast a wide culinary net and try a lot of different cuisines and dishes, consider taking a food tour. Some companies to check out are <a href=\"https://wildsftours.com/tour/food-crawl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wild SF Tours</a>, <a href=\"https://www.secretfoodtours.com/san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Secret Food Tours</a>, and <a href=\"https://tastebudtours.com/food-tours/san-francisco-food-tour-a-taste-of-little-italy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TasteBud Tours</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Explore Chinatown</strong> – When immigrants from China first came to America, many set up shop in San Francisco. Today, in the biggest Chinatown in the U.S., you’ll find some of the best Chinese food in the country, as well as wonderful teahouses, bars, souvenir stalls, and fortune cookie makers.</li>\n<li><strong>Relax at Golden Gate Park</strong> – This gigantic park a great place to walk or relax. It features a Japanese garden, museums, an arboretum, a carousel, and many hiking and walking trails. It’s 20% bigger than New York’s Central Park so you easily could spend an entire day here!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more suggestions, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/things-to-see-and-do-in-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s a detailed list of things to see and do in San Francisco</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHI-San-Francisco-Downtown%2FSan-Francisco%2F4549\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HI San Francisco – Downtown</a> – HI Downtown has some standard perks, like free breakfast and free towels, but the staff also organize a lot of events, including pub crawls, trips to Muir Woods and Yosemite, and bike tours across the Golden Gate Bridge. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FGreen-Tortoise-Hostel%2FSan-Francisco%2F1821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Green Tortoise Hostel</a> – This lively hostel is my favorite in the city. It offers free breakfast, free dinners multiple times per week, and even a free sauna! It’s a party hostel, so be sure to stay here only if you’re looking to meet people and get rowdy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more suggestions, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-hostels-in-san-francisco/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s a full list of my favorite hostels in San Francisco!</a><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Day 4: Big Sur</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/calithreeweek3.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The rugged coasts and blue waters of Big Sur, California\"><br />\nOn the coast just over two hours south of San Francisco is a 90-mile expanse of stunning views and massive redwoods known as Big Sur. There are plenty of beautiful beaches, hiking trails, viewpoints, and campgrounds in case you want to stay overnight (which I recommend). It’s one of the most beautiful stretches of craggy, unspoiled coastline in the state, so take your time exploring as you head south.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong><br />\nI suggest staying at least one night around Big Sur (or just south of the region) to split up the drive to LA. If you don’t have camping gear, <a href=\"http://airbnb.7eer.net/c/214481/264339/4273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbnb</a> has a lot of places around the area. You can also just pop into any of numerous cheap motels in the area too.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 5–7: Los Angeles</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/calithreeweek4.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The picuresque Santa Monica beach and ferris wheel\"><br />\nThough I hated it when I first visited, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/loving-los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I’ve come to love Los Angeles</a>. It’s not a “tourist” city: everything is spread out and there are not many attractions as you’d expect. But, if you come to LA and go with the flow like a local, you’ll see why people love it so much. This is a city where you eat, drink, hike the many trails in the area, and linger in a coffeeshop. </p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions on how to fill your days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hit the beach</strong> – Venice Beach is an iconic LA hotspot where you’ll encounter all kinds of street performers, surfers, rollerskaters, and both locals and tourists alike soaking up the sun. Other beaches worth checking out are Carbon Beach, Santa Monica State Beach, Huntington City Beach, and El Matador.\n<li><strong>See the Le Brea Tar Pits</strong> – Located in Hancock Park, these natural asphalt pits have existed for over 50,000 years. Tons of fossils preserved for centuries have been found in the pits, and there’s a museum nearby that has lots of interesting information about them and how they came to be.\n<li><strong>See the Hollywood Sign</strong> – You can snap pictures of the sign from pretty much anywhere in Hollywood. However, it’s also possible to hike up to the sign itself to take in the view. The three trails that you can take (from easiest to hardest) are the Mt. Hollywood Trail, the Brush Canyon Trail, and the Cahuenga Peak Trail. Bring water, because the hike will take a few hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Visit LACMA</strong> &#8211;  Home to some 150,000 works, the LA County Museum of Art is the largest art museum in the western USA. They have collections from pretty much every era throughout history and every region of the world. Admission is $25 USD.</li>\n<li><strong>Visit The Last Bookstore</strong> &#8211; This is one of my favorite bookstores in the world. It also sells records, has art displays, and features a cool upstairs area with cheap used books. Browse the shelves, grab a coffee, and buy a book for your journey.</li>\n<li><strong>Stroll down Hollywood Boulevard</strong> – Don’t miss the Walk of Fame (where celebrities have their names engraved in the sidewalk) and Grauman’s Chinese Theatre (featuring celebrities’ handprints and footprints). </li>\n<li><strong>Visit the Getty Museum</strong> – This art museum opened in 1997 and boasts a diverse collection paintings, manuscripts, drawings, and other artwork. The collection runs from the eighth century to the present day, so there is something for everyone. Admission is free.</li>\n<li><strong>Go hiking</strong> – Get out and stretch your legs on the city’s hiking trails. Some worth checking out are the Charlie Turner Trail (90 minutes), Baldwin Hills (30 minutes), Runyon Canyon (45 minutes), Portuguese Bend Reserve (3 hours), and Echo Mountain (3-3.5 hours).</li>\n<li><strong>Visit The Broad</strong> – This contemporary art museum is one of the city’s newest. Opened in 2015, it has over 2,000 pieces of art. It also has a rotating series of temporary exhibitions too (check the website to see what’s on during your visit). Admission is free.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a much longer list on what to see and do in LA, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check out my Los Angeles travel guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the city also has innumerable world-class food options. Some places I really like are Musso &#038; Frank Grill, Dan Tana’s, Meals by Genet, The Butcher’s Daughter, Sugarfish, and Thai Pepper. </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FBanana-Bungalow-Hollywood%2FLos-Angeles%2F11182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Banana Bungalow Hollywood</a> – A laid-back but social hostel that organizes lots of activities and makes it easy to meet people.

It’s easier to navigate (it’s smaller), the weather is always perfect, the beaches are better, and it’s cheaper too. After LA, it’s my favorite city in the state. Spend a day or two soaking up the city. </p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions for things to see and do during your visit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Visit the USS Midway Museum</strong> – This aircraft carrier, commissioned right after World War II, was the largest ship in the world until 1955 and saw action in numerous conflicts, including Vietnam. It was decommissioned in 1992 and became a museum. You can explore the flight deck as well as many of the rooms below. </li>\n<li><strong>Hike Point Loma</strong> – This is the peninsula where Europeans first arrived in California. Walk out to the tip and enjoy the serene views, visit the lighthouse (built in 1855), and watch locals climb the rocks and cliffs of Osprey Point.</li>\n<li><strong>Visit the San Diego Zoo</strong> – This is one of the best zoos in the country. Located in Balboa Park (see below), it has over 3,500 animals and 700,000 plant species. It’s a massive, 1,800-acre park where you could easily spend an entire day. If you’re traveling with kids, don’t miss it. </li>\n<li><strong>Explore Balboa Park</strong> – In addition to the zoo, Balboa Park also offers dozens of museums as well as walking paths, sports fields, gardens, greenhouses, stadiums, theatres, and much more. It’s one of the oldest recreational parks in the country.</li>\n<li><strong>Enjoy Pacific Beach</strong> – If you want to soak up the sun, swim, or surf, head to Pacific Beach. If you’re a night owl, the area also has lots of bars, clubs, and restaurants too.</li>\n<li><strong>Go whale watching</strong> – California gray whales, which can grow up to 49 feet and live for over 70 years, migrate from Alaska to Mexico each year between December and April. They are incredible to see up close, and tours are quite affordable (usually around $35 USD).</li>\n<li><strong>Relax in Belmont Park</strong> – This is a kitschy amusement park right next to the ocean. It has a few classic rides, as well as games and lots of greasy (and delicious) snacks. It’s cheesy but fun!</li>\n<li><strong>Go surfing</strong> – Whether you’re a veteran or a newbie, grab a board and hit the waves. There’s some awesome surfing here. You can usually rent a board for around $30 USD a day. Lessons cost around $70 USD and last 90-minutes. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHI-San-Diego-Downtown%2FSan-Diego%2F1856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HI San Diego</a> – HI San Diego organizes lots of events and tours that make it easy to meet other travelers. They include free breakfast and also have a big kitchen so you can cook your own food to save money. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FITH-Adventure-Hostel-San-Diego%2FSan-Diego%2F66491%3FdateFrom%3D2020-08-26%26dateTo%3D2020-08-27%26number_of_guests%3D1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ITH Adventure Hostel</a> – This is an eco-friendly hostel with a vegetable garden (guests get free veggies), a recycling and compost program, and even backyard chickens. There is lots of outdoor common space to relax in too. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re on a budget, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-hostels-san-diego/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s a list of the best hostels in San Diego for you.</a><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 10–12: Joshua Tree National Park</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/calithreeweek6.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The beautiful and unique Joshua trees in Joshua Tree National Park, California\"><br />\nLocated just under three hours from San Diego and sandwiched between the Mojave and Colorado Deserts, this is where you’ll find the iconic Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia), twisted multibranched trees. Towering boulders dot the arid landscape and swaths of cacti poke up from the hard dirt. It’s an otherworldly place perfect for hiking, camping, and escaping the busy cities along California’s coast.</p>\n<p>The park was declared a national monument in 1936 and designated a national park in 1994. There are a lot of trails here, so consult the trail map when you visit. Some of my favorites are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Barker Dam Trail</strong> – A quick 1.1-mile loop on which you can see wildlife such as rabbits, bighorn sheep, and all kinds of birds.</li>\n<li><strong>Wall Street Mill</strong> – An easy 2.8-mile hike that leads to an old mill used to refine ore from nearby gold mines.</li>\n<li><strong>Ryan Mountain</strong> &#8211; A steep 3-mile hike offering some incredible views.</li>\n<li><strong>Split Rock Loop</strong> – A quiet 2-mile hike with lots of neat rock formations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A seven-day vehicle pass for the park is $30 USD (it allows multiple entries in case you stay in one of the nearby towns).</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://airbnb.7eer.net/c/214481/264339/4273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbnb</a> is the best option if you don’t have your own camping gear, although there are also glamping and more rustic options.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 13–15: Sequoia National Park &#038; Kings Canyon National Park</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/calithreeweek7.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The massive redwoods and sequoias in Sequoia National Park, California\"><br />\nSequoia National Park, established in 1890, is where you’ll find the largest single-stem tree in the entire world. Named “General Sherman,” this giant sequoia tree stands a whopping 275 feet tall and has a diameter of 25 feet (that’s a 103-foot circumference). It’s so big that one of its branches is bigger than almost every single tree east of the Mississippi.</p>\n<p>Start your visit at the Giant Forest Museum to learn about the history, geography, and importance of the park and its flora and fauna. Afterward, walk the Big Trees Trail, a short loop that will get you in and amongst the trees so you can see them up close. </p>\n<p>For a sweeping view of the forest and surrounding landscape, hike up Moro Rock, a massive 250-foot granite dome that juts out of the surrounding hills and forest. Stairs and a concrete viewpoint were built into the rock itself, so you can safely climb to the top and enjoy the magnificent vista.</p>\n<p>And for more hiking options and beautiful scenery, visit nearby Kings Canyon National Park. Here you’ll find “General Grant” (the third largest tree in the world). For a scenic drive, cruise along the Kings Canyon Scenic Byway. </p>\n<p>Both parks are around 4-6 hours from Joshua Tree.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong><br />\nThere are tons of places to camp here (both inside and outside of the parks). However, there are also lots of lodges and hotels if camping is not for you. <a href=\"http://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=362916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Booking.com</a> has the best list of them all.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 16–18: Yosemite National Park</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/calithreeweek8.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The beautiful scenery of Yosemite National Park, California\"><br />\nLocated in the Sierra Nevada mountain range two hours from Sequoia National Park and encompassing nearly 750,000 acres, Yosemite is one of the most iconic national parks in the country. It’s where you’ll find El Capitán, the towering granite cliff you’ve likely seen on social media (it was also featured in the movie, <em>Free Solo</em>). It is one of the most popular parks in the US, seeing over four million visitors each year who enjoy hiking, biking, climbing, camping, rafting, canoeing, and kayaking here. </p>\n<p>Here are a few hiking suggestions to help you get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mirror Lake</strong> – An easy 2-mile hike to Mirror Lake. Takes 1-2 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Nevada Fall Trail</strong> – A challenging 5.8-mile hike to the top of the Nevada Falls waterfall. Takes 5–6 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Tuolumne Grove Nature Trail</strong> – An easy 2.5-mile hike around a grove filled with massive giant sequoia trees. Takes 1–2 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Elizabeth Lake Trail</strong> – A moderate 4.8-mile hike that leads to Elizabeth Lake, a glacier-carved lake at the base of Unicorn Peak. Takes 4–5 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Eagle Peak Trail</strong> – A difficult 6.9-mile hike to the top of Eagle Peak and back. Takes 8 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be sure to visit the visitor’s center on arrival to get information on activities, prices, and information on the latest weather.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong><br />\nIf you aren’t planning to camp, there are actually many other options here. Lodges, resorts, and hotels can be found both inside the park and all around it. Use <a href=\"http://airbnb.7eer.net/c/214481/264339/4273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbnb</a> or <a href=\"http://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=362916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Booking.com</a> to find a place to stay.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 19–20: Napa Valley</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/calithreeweek9.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"A hot air balloon floating over vineyards in Napa Valley, California\"><br />\nFinally, head northwest to Napa Valley, one of the world’s premier wine regions, and end your trip relaxing at a vineyard. Napa is just over three hours from Yosemite and offers a plethora of world-class wine and food to indulge in.</p>\n<p>While it’s a particularly expensive region of the state, it is possible to <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/napa-valley-on-a-budget/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit Napa Valley on a budget</a> if you plan ahead and share costs with other people. </p>\n<p>If you’re on a budget, stick to the markets and sandwich shops. Gott’s Roadside has locations in both Napa and St. Helena and serves delicious burgers for under $10 USD, while Ad Hoc runs a delicious food truck offering fried chicken made by a Michelin-star chef for $15 USD with sides. </p>\n<p><strong>Whereto Stay</strong><br />\nWhile some vineyards offer accommodation, they are usually super expensive. Unless you’re looking to splurge, use <a href=\"http://airbnb.7eer.net/c/214481/264339/4273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbnb</a>. I find the best value accommodation in the area on that site.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Day 21: Back to San Francisco</h3>\n<p>It’s time to head back to San Francisco. The drive is around 90 minutes, so you’ll have plenty of time to make stops along the way if you see anything that piques your interest.</p>\n<p><center>***</center></p>\n<p>This three-week itinerary will help you cover a lot of ground without being too rushed. Adjust the route as you go (or based on the amount of time you have). But, no matter the route you pick, the diversity and beauty of California will ensure you&#8217;ll have a wonderful road trip.  </p>\n<div class=\"single-booking\">\n<h4>Book Your Trip to the USA: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>\n<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />\nFind a cheap flight by using <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3032045-12837948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skyscanner</a> or <a href=\"https://www.momondo.com/\">Momondo</a>.

Since that first trip, I&#8217;ve returned a few times, lured in by the friendly people, cloud forests, wildlife, and excellent beaches. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/costa-rica-travel-tips/san-jose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">San José</a> is the starting point for most visitors in the country, owing to the fact that it&#8217;s the nation&#8217;s capital and a major international hub. Chances are you&#8217;ll be here for a few days as you get situated before heading off to hike, lounge on the beach, and enjoy the lush and scenic landscapes. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been staying in hostels for over a decade during my several return visits to Costa Rica. There are <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-pick-a-good-hostel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel</a> in San José. The top four are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Location</strong> – San José is huge, and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites and nightlife you want to see. All the hostels listed here are in good locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong> – In San José, you really get what you pay for, so if you go with a really cheap one, you&#8217;re probably going to get a hostel that is small and cramped and doesn&#8217;t offer great service.</li>\n<li><strong>Amenities</strong> – Every hostel in the city offers free Wi-Fi, and most have a free breakfast, but if you want more than that, be sure to do your research to find the hostel that best meets your needs!</li>\n<li><strong>Staff</strong> – All the hostels listed here have amazing staff! They are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don&#8217;t stay at one of the places listed below, be sure to look up reviews to ensure you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly. They can make or break a hostel!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is my list of the hostels in San José that I like the most. If you don’t want to read the longer list below, the following hostels are the best in each category:</p>\n<p><strong>Best Hostel for Budget Travelers</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FCosta-Rica-Backpackers%2FSan-Jose%2F870\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Costa Rica Backpackers</a><br />\n<strong>Best Hostel for Families</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FIn-The-Wind-Hostel-Guesthouse%2FSan-Jose%2F51566\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">In the Wind Hostel</a><br />\n<strong>Best Hostel for Solo Female Travelers</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FStray-Cat-Hostel%2FSan-Jose%2F285767\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Stray Cat Hostel</a><br />\n<strong>Best Hostel for Digital Nomads</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FCapital-Hostel-de-Ciudad%2FSan-Jose%2F279326\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Capital Hostel de Ciudad</a><br />\n<strong>Best Hostel for Partying</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHostel-Pangea%2FSan-Jose%2F3816\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Hostel Pangea</a> or <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FCosta-Rica-Backpackers%2FSan-Jose%2F870\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Costa Rica Backpackers</a><br />\n<strong>Best Overall Hostel</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FCapital-Hostel-de-Ciudad%2FSan-Jose%2F279326\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Capital Hostel de Ciudad</a></p>\n<p>Want the specifics of each hostel?

It&#8217;s a good hub to base yourself in for a few days while you plan your next steps.</p>\n<p>Since it&#8217;s not as cheap as other cities in the region, you&#8217;ll want to save money by booking yourself a hostel while you&#8217;re here. They&#8217;re the most cost-effective (and fun) way to enjoy the city.</p>\n<p>However, there are <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-pick-a-good-hostel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a lot of things to consider when selecting a hostel</a>. The top four in Panama City are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Location</strong> – Panama City is huge, and it can take some time to get around. Pick a place that is central to the sites you want to see and nightlife you want to enjoy. (All the hostels listed here are in central locations.)</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong> – In Panama City, you really get what you pay for, so if you go with a really cheap place, you&#8217;re probably going to get a hostel that is small and cramped and doesn&#8217;t offer great service.</li>\n<li><strong>Amenities</strong> – Every hostel in town offers free Wi-Fi, and most have a free breakfast, but if you want more than that, be sure to do your research to find the one that best meets your needs!</li>\n<li><strong>Staff</strong> &#8211; All the hostels listed here have amazing staff who are super friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you don&#8217;t end up staying at one of the places listed below, be sure to look up reviews to ensure that you end up somewhere where the staff is helpful and friendly. They can make or break a hostel!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To help you plan your trip, here is my list of the hostels in Panama City that I like the most. If you don’t want to read the longer list below, the following hostels are the best in each category:</p>\n<p><strong>Best Hostel for Budget Travelers</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHostal-Casa-Areka%2FPanama-City%2F43562\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Hostal Casa Areka</a><br />\n<strong>Best Hostel for Families</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FMagnolia-Inn-Casco-Viejo%2FPanama-City%2F59863\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Magnolia Inn Casa Viejo</a><br />\n<strong>Best Hostel for Solo Female Travelers</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FEl-Machico-Hostel%2FPanama-City%2F88333\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">El Machio</a><br />\n<strong>Best Hostel for Digital Nomads</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FSelina-Casco-Viejo-Panama-City%2FPanama-City%2F285048\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Selina Casco Viejo</a><br />\n<strong>Best Hostel for Partying</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHostal-Casa-Areka%2FPanama-City%2F43562\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Hostal Casa Areka</a><br />\n<strong>Best Overall Hostel</strong>: <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FLuna-s-Castle-Hostel%2FPanama-City%2F39099\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">Luna&#8217;s Castle Hostel</a></p>\n<p>Want more specifics for each hostel?

It&#8217;s clean and quiet, making it a good choice for families or travelers looking for some downtime. The hostel is an old French colonial mansion and balances historic charm with modern amenities (like AC, Wi-Fi, and hot showers). The beds are basic and don&#8217;t have curtains, but the mattresses are thick and comfy. There are also a few common areas where you can relax and hang out or watch TV. Since it&#8217;s quiet, I&#8217;d suggest staying here if you want to get a good night&#8217;s sleep. There are several social hostels nearby where you can grab a drink and hang out, so you can enjoy being social before returning to your quiet hostel. </p>\n<p><strong>Magnolia Inn Casco Viejo at a glance</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$$</li>\n<li>Central location in the Old Town</li>\n<li>Clean and quiet</li>\n<li>Beautiful interior</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Beds from $16 USD a night, rooms from $116 USD.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FMagnolia-Inn-Casco-Viejo%2FPanama-City%2F59863\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">—> Book your stay at Magnolia Inn Casco Viejo!</a><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>2.

It&#8217;s also surrounded by bars and restaurants, making it a good choice for those who want to party. There are lots of common areas to relax in. The beds are pretty basic (no curtains for privacy) but are comfortable enough. The dorms also only have eight beds (or fewer), so you&#8217;re never crammed in with other people, and there are female-only dorms too. Only some of the showers have hot water, however, but it is the cheapest hostel in town.</p>\n<p><strong>Hostal Casa Areka at a glance</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$</li>\n<li>Swimming pool</li>\n<li>Super affordable</li>\n<li>Free breakfast</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Beds from $9 USD a night, rooms from $35 USD.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHostal-Casa-Areka%2FPanama-City%2F43562\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">—> Book your stay at Hostal Casa Areka!</a><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>3.

The beds aren&#8217;t the best, but the dorms have lockers to keep your items safe and there&#8217;s hot water in the showers. They also have female-only dorms. Breakfast is included, there&#8217;s a spacious kitchen for cooking, and the surrounding neighborhood is quite safe too. </p>\n<p><strong>El Machio at a glance</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$</li>\n<li>Social atmosphere makes it easy to meet people</li>\n<li>Free brekafast</li>\n<li>Female-only dorms for added privacy and security</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Beds from $13 USD a night, rooms from $50 USD.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FEl-Machico-Hostel%2FPanama-City%2F88333\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">—> Book your stay at El Machio!</a><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>4.

Housed in an old colonial mansion overlooking the ocean, it&#8217;s a cool backpacker hostel with a laid-back vibe. Free breakfast is included, there&#8217;s a bar on-site for having fun, the showers have hot water, and the staff go above and beyond: they organize walking tours and other fun activities to ensure that you have an amazing visit and meet cool people during your stay. There are only large dorms (10 or 12 beds), but the beds have curtains and the mattresses are comfy. It&#8217;s lively, social, and an institution on the Gringo Trail through Central America.</p>\n<p><strong>Luna&#8217;s Castle Hostel at a glance</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$$</li>\n<li>Free breakfast</li>\n<li>Easy to meet people</li>\n<li>Beautiful location by the ocean</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Beds from $16 USD a night.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fpwa%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FLuna-s-Castle-Hostel%2FPanama-City%2F39099\" rel=\"noopener nofollow noreferrer\">—> Book your stay at Luna&#8217;s Castle Hostel!</a><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>5.

Dalene and Pete are Alberta raised and currently living in the province’s third-biggest city, Lethbridge. Alberta is one of the most scenic provinces in Canada and, today, Dalene shares a driving itinerary hitting many of her favorite Alberta sights.</em></p>\n<p>Arguably Canada’s most beautiful province, Alberta is known primarily for the mountain hub of Banff National Park. Millions descend annually on Calgary airport and then high-tail it west for an hour and a half to visit this gem of the Rockies. The draw of Banff is entirely warranted but many of these visitors often miss out on everything else that Alberta has to offer.</p>\n<p>Its cities are dynamic, other mountain towns are just as gorgeous and with fewer tourists, the southeastern side of the province is home to a trove of dinosaur bones, and the north is covered in lush forests and teeming with wildlife and outdoor adventures eager to be had.</p>\n<p>As a born-and-raised Albertan, I left in my early thirties to see more of the world, craving exploration. When I returned almost a decade later, I did so with fresh eyes and an appreciation for the land that shaped me. </p>\n<p>This article outlines a ten-day road trip itinerary shares some of my favorite spots in the province that will help you see more than crowds of tourists in Banff!<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Day 1: Calgary</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/alberta1.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The towering skyline of Calgary, Alberta, Canada in the autumn\"></p>\n<p>Dubbed “Cowtown” due to its roots in the cattle industry, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/canada-travel-tips/calgary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calgary</a> is Alberta’s largest city (1.37 million people). Balancing modern urban architecture with friendly, small-town vibes, Calgary is a curious melting pot of folks from many backgrounds. It’s also home to an array of activities and a trendy food scene that will ensure that your days and tummies are full.</p>\n<p><strong>Start Downtown</strong><br />\nExplore the Bow River’s network of walking and biking trails. See the prime photo spot of the Peace Bridge. For another prime photo op and to gaze upon an architectural wonder, don’t miss the Calgary Public Library, which was named one of the 100 Greatest Places of 2019 by Time magazine.</p>\n<p>Not far from the library is Prince’s Island Park, which is a hub for cultural events. It’s home to the Calgary Folk Music Festival (in late July) and the esteemed River Café (a pricey restaurant but well worth it), and near to Eau Claire Market, which has some mouth-watering eats and specialty merchandise.</p>\n<p><strong>Fuel Up on Good Eats</strong><br />\nDon’t miss out on Tubby Dog for a cheap, delicious, and fun meal? Play some classic arcade games while you try the Sumo (a dog with pickled ginger, Japanese mayo, wasabi, and seaweed salad) or the A-bomb (a dog with all the classic trimmings, plus a healthy dump of potato chips right on top). Another one of my faves is Native Tongues, which offers upscale Mexican food in the city center. </p>\n<p><strong>Consider Planning Your Visit Around These Festivals</strong><br />\nThe Calgary Stampede — also known as “the greatest outdoor show on earth” — takes over the city for ten days in early July. The world-class rodeo is just one facet of the event. There’s also a spectacular grandstand show plus all the rides and deep-fried festival foods you would expect. It’s also a giant, messy party too.</p>\n<p>Beakerhead, held annually in mid-September, brings together the worlds of art, science, and engineering. Imagine a massive party filled with fire-shooting robots, an interactive science lesson on how to make the best chocolate chip cookie, and playing a giant life-sized version of Snakes &#038; Ladders. It’s the best nerd party of the year. </p>\n<p><strong>Where to stay in Calgary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/ca/howard-johnson-express-inn-calgary.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canada’s Best Value Inn Chinook Station</a> &#8211; Located near the Chinook LRT Station, this hotel features a continental breakfast, with rooms available starting as low as $49 CAD/night.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHI-Calgary-City-Centre%2FCalgary%2F2138\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HI Calgary City Centre</a> &#8211; If you happen to be a member of HI Canada, consider this hostel, located in the downtown core, just a two-minute walk to the C-train (local transit) station.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/ca/arts-calgary.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hotel Arts</a> &#8211; For more upscale and eclectic lodging near downtown, this hotel has top-rated amenities for a reasonable price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Day 2: Banff</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/alberta2.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The picturesque city of Banff, Alberta, Canada with mountains in the distance\"><br />\nNext, head from <a href=\"https://roadtripalberta.com/calgary-to-banff/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calgary to Banff</a>, which takes about an hour and a half by car.</p>\n<p>Note: You’ll need to purchase a park pass upon arrival at the gates just outside of town, or you can <a href=\"https://www.banfflakelouise.com/park-pass-purchase\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buy one online</a>. The current daily rate for an adult is $10.00 CAD, and it will expire at 4:00 pm the following day.</p>\n<p>If you’re planning on visiting multiple parks, you might consider a Parks Canada “Discovery Pass” for $69.19 CAD, which can be used for multiple days and will grant you entry to all Canadian national parks for one full year.</p>\n<p>There are too many amazing hikes to list, but start with the iconic Johnston Canyon. Keep it short with a 30-minute walk to the Lower Falls, or plan for a full four-hour trek all the way to the Ink Pots. (For more info, read this <a href=\"https://roadtripalberta.com/best-hikes-in-banff/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guide to hiking in Banff</a>.)</p>\n<p>To really get the adrenaline pumping, head to Mt. Norquay for the Via Ferrata hike. Cross suspension bridges and climb ladders on the edge of a mountain, all while safely harnessed and led by an experienced guide.</p>\n<p>There are also plenty of options for canoeing, kayaking, and stand-up paddleboarding on a number of nearby lakes. Visit the Banff Canoe Club in town for rentals.</p>\n<p>Winter is a prime time to visit if you’re a ski bunny. Three mountains in the area known collectively as Ski Big 3 (Banff Sunshine, the Lake Louise Ski Resort, and Mt. Norquay) are all world-class.</p>\n<p>Be sure to take the Banff Gondola up Sulphur Mountain for some epic views. It’s open year-round, and it has an impressive interpretive center and scenic boardwalk at the top, and even two restaurants.</p>\n<p>Nearby is also the stunning Banff Upper Hot Springs.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Eat</strong><br />\nWild Flour Bakery, known for its nourishing baked goods and good coffee, is an excellent stop to fill your tank at any time of day.</p>\n<p>Eager to try some Canadian wild meats? Head to the Grizzly House to cook up your own bison, elk, or a number of other options using a hot stone at your table. The decor is severely outdated, but the experience is a must-do. Not a meat-eater? Head to Nourish Bistro for the best plant-based food in Banff.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay in Banff</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FBanff-International-Hostel%2FBanff%2F66387\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Banff International Hostel</a> &#8211; Just a few blocks from the heart of downtown, this hostel is a comfortable place to rest your head after a long day of exploring!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/ca/banff-y-mountain-lodge.en.html?aid=1383362&#038;no_rooms=1&#038;group_adults=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YWCA Banff Hotel</a> &#8211; The perfect hideaway in the mountains for those looking for a comfortable and budget-friendly accommodation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHI-Banff-Alpine-Centre%2FBanff%2F1569\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HI Banff Alpine Centre</a> &#8211; If you’re a member of the HI community, you may want to stay at this location, the largest hostel in Alberta.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Day 3: Banff and Lake Louise</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/alberta3.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Lake Louise and Banff at night under a starry sky\"><br />\nIf you’re an early riser, head 15 minutes north to Two Jack Lake to catch a gorgeous sunrise. If it’s a clearer morning, bright red, orange, and purple will stain the sky and lake, silhouetting the mountain and creating a truly epic sight.</p>\n<p>If there was anything left on your to-do list from the day before, finish that up now, but plan for almost a whole day around Lake Louise.</p>\n<p><strong>While in Lake Louise&#8230;.</strong><br />\nThe Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise is the major draw in the area, and walking its halls is a must before you venture on any number of outdoor activities.</p>\n<p>If you are there in summer, consider the Lake Agnes Tea House hike for its views and the unique experience of taking tea on top of the world (remember to bring cash, as they don’t have other payment options on-site). It is a short 2.2mile (3.5 km) hike, but you can also continue on to Lake Agnes itself. </p>\n<p>Feeling adventurous? Then take “the Tea House Challenge” and visit the other one, too, The Plain of Six Glaciers Tea House, for a 9 mile (14.5 km) total hike on the Highline Trail.</p>\n<p>If you are there in winter, skating, snowshoeing, dog-sledding, sleigh rides, and more are all available from the hotel. You will have no problem filling your day in one of the most beautiful spots in all of Canada.</p>\n<p>Dining options are fewer in the very small town of Lake Louise, but find the Trailhead Café for a budget-friendly and supremely delicious meal. There are also several options inside the Chateau itself, but I recommend Alpine Social for its laid-back atmosphere and hearty food.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Day 4: Driving from Banff to Jasper</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/alberta4.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The beautiful landscape of Alberta, Canada between Banff and Jasper\"><br />\nDrive from Banff to Jasper via the Icefields Parkway. The drive itself is about 3.5 hours, but I suggest that you plan for a whole day as there are lots of stops to make along the way. </p>\n<p>The Icefields Parkway is breathtaking. Take it slow and stop often to really absorb the beauty of this day. (Do, however, consult the weather forecast and <a href=\"https://511.alberta.ca/#:Alerts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">road conditions</a>, as it can often be closed in winter.)</p>\n<p><strong>Making the Drive</strong><br />\nFill up the car with gas and pack a picnic lunch before leaving Banff, as there is only one place to stop for snacks en route (Saskatchewan River Crossing) but it is closed in winter. But once you are safely on your way, here are just a few of the stops you can make:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave early to catch sunrise over Vermillion Lakes, just outside of Banff as you begin your journey north.</li>\n<li>Peyto Lake is a must-see. You have undoubtedly seen its image before; now it’s time to see it for yourself! From your car it’s just a short walk up a hill to get to the viewpoint and take in that stark aquamarine water from above.</li>\n<li>The Columbia Icefield, just an hour before Jasper, is the largest in the Canadian Rockies. You can take a tour to walk right on the glacier and/or take a stroll on the glass-floored Icefield Skywalk lookout to see everything from above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is much more to see! This <a href=\"https://roadtripalberta.com/banff-to-jasper/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Banff-to-Jasper article</a> maps it all out for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay in Jasper</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FJasper-Downtown-Hostel%2FJasper%2F263493\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jasper Downtown Hostel</a> &#8211; Conveniently situated in the heart of downtown Jasper, this modern hostel won’t break the bank; its private rooms start as low as $63 CAD/night.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHI-Jasper%2FJasper%2F295773\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HI Jasper</a> &#8211; Just a short walk to downtown, the HI Hostel Jasper was opened in June 2019.

Rougher around the edges than its southern brother Banff, it’s the spot to hit if you’re craving fewer crowds and small-town charm. </p>\n<p>Spirit Island is one of the most photographed spots in Canada. You can canoe out there and reach this spot on Maligne Lake in half a day. If you don&#8217;t feel like doing that, boat cruises are available too! </p>\n<p>Moreover, take advantage of your remote location and book a tour to see some iconic Canadian wildlife (bears, elk, mountain goats, moose, and more). While such encounters may occur by chance on your visit, a guided tour will increase your chances and is a great way to gain local knowledge.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in October, the Jasper Dark Sky Festival takes place.The park has ideal conditions for this given that there is so little light pollution. If you can’t make it there, the Jasper Planetarium is open year-round for star viewing.</p>\n<p>There are so many hiking options. Start with a short jaunt to Athabasca Falls (less than an hour round-trip), and then ramp up according to your fitness level. (See this article about <a href=\"https://roadtripalberta.com/what-to-do-in-jasper/#Hiking\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best Jasper hikes</a> to decide what comes next.)</p>\n<p>Just north of town is Maligne Canyon, and in winter, you can walk on and explore the frozen river (be sure you have ice cleats on). In the summer, you can hike in the canyon, and the winding trail has six suspension bridges spanning the gorge.</p>\n<p>Take a load off and ride up the Jasper Skytram to experience the best mountain views. On a clear day, you can even see peaks in neighboring British Columbia. Enjoy the seven-minute ride up and have a bite at the Summit Restaurant at the top. </p>\n<p><strong>Must-Eats</strong><br />\nStop at the Bright Spot Family Restaurant for the big country breakfast, which will stick to your bones and give you energy for your day. Whistle Stop Pub is also good for a pint and snack. Canada’s very first national park brewery, Jasper Brewing Company, is also here. Along with six signature brews that are made on-site, the large restaurant offers elevated pub fare.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Day 7: Driving from Jasper to Edmonton</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/alberta6.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The stunning vista between Jasper and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada\"><br />\nThe four-hour drive from <a href=\"https://roadtripalberta.com/edmonton-to-jasper/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jasper to Edmonton</a> is not the most exciting (the scenic views drop off quickly outside of the national park), but there are a couple of stops you can make along the way to spice it up.</p>\n<p>If you don’t hit up Miette Hot Springs during your stay in Jasper, then it’s an easy stop on the way out of town. It is home to the hottest spring water in the Canadian Rockies! It requires a little detour off of the main highway, but the drive through the Fiddle Valley alone makes it worth the trip.</p>\n<p>An hour into your journey, you can make a stop in Hinton to see the most iconic of local wildlife: the humble beaver. Stretch your legs along the nearly 2 mile (3 km) Beaver Boardwalk, and hopefully, you’ll spot Canada’s national animal. </p>\n<p>This is also a great place to plan to have lunch: The Old Grind has an extensive menu that includes vegetarian and vegan options.</p>\n<p><strong>Arriving in Edmonton</strong><br />\nDepending on what time you left Jasper, the driving conditions you encountered (add more time in winter!), and how many stops you made along the way, you may arrive with extra time to explore Alberta’s capital city. And my guess is that those car-bound legs are going to need a stretch.</p>\n<p>As you drive into the west side of Edmonton, this would be the perfect occasion to take a long walk in the largest mall in North America. West Edmonton Mall is home to over 800 stories and services, and it contains theme parks, multiple movie theaters, a ridiculously fun indoor water park, and even a large skating rink. </p>\n<p>Enjoying the mall can easily take up the rest of your day (and the next one, if you are a shopper).<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 8 &#038; 9: Edmonton</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/alberta7.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The skyline of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada during autumn\"><br />\nTeeming with history and culture rich as hot chocolate, Alberta’s capital city is the perfect way to finish off your tour of the province. Edmonton has been dubbed “the festival city” on account of its year-round cultural festivals, so you’ll never be short on things to do here. </p>\n<p>The Fringe Festival is the biggest and oldest of its kind in North America and offers a dynamic theater experience. Running annually for ten days in the middle of August, it often attracts more than 1,500 local, national, and international artists, who give well over a thousand performances across the city.</p>\n<p>The Silver Skate Festival is becoming one of the premier events in Alberta to celebrate and embrace winter. One highlight is the opening of the ice castles in Hawrelak Park, typically several weeks before the February festival. During the ten days of the festival itself, expect snow sculpting, skate races, helicopter tours, and more.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t in Edmonton during a festival, take time and stroll through the grounds of the Alberta Legislature. Not only is “the Ledge” an architectural journey into the past (construction was started in 1907) but you can also learn about the Canadian government, Alberta’s political history, and the art and architecture of the building by taking a free tour. </p>\n<p>Edmonton’s river valley is the largest urban park in North America, with 100 miles (160 kms) of maintained paths. So you don’t even have to leave the city itself to explore nature! Walk and cycle as far as you like, taking in any (or all) of the 20 city parks along the river. </p>\n<p>Head for the Neon Sign Museum one night. This collection of 20 functional historic signs tells the story of Edmonton’s neon past al fresco. This exhibit is completely free and open 24/7.</p>\n<p>If you didn’t get your wildlife fill in the Rockies, then head a short distance outside of the city to Elk Island National Park. Elk Island is the only fenced national park in Canada, a conservation effort to help bring the bison population back. </p>\n<p>And you didn’t think I’d go this entire post without mentioning a hockey game, did you? The Edmonton Oilers play in one of the newest arenas in the NHL, so catch a game if you can, especially if they are playing their provincial rivals, the Calgary Flames. </p>\n<p>If you are visiting in summer, you can also watch a heated Canadian football (not soccer) battle between the Edmonton Eskimos and the Calgary Stampeders.</p>\n<p><strong>Can’t-Miss Food and Drink</strong><br />\nStop at Duchess Bake Shop. This Parisian-inspired café blends some of Alberta’s favorite flavors with French pastries, all made from scratch daily.

Use your last day to visit more of Calgary. </p>\n<p>If you have time, visit the Heritage Ranch near Red Deer (about halfway through the drive). A rancher will drop you off in the middle of the wilderness with a map and a compass (or a GPS). Your goal is to remain at large and capture four designated flags within an hour. All the while, you are being hunted by a man on a horse. It is terrifying and exhilarating and everything in between!</p>\n<p>A little closer to <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/canada-travel-tips/calgary/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Calgary</a>, you can turn off the main highway into Torrington and find the Gopher Hole Museum. Gopher overpopulation is a problem in the area, and so the residents wanted to create something quirky to bring in tourists. The museum is one small room of taxidermied rodents staged in a variety of scenes that highlight local life (think curling gophers, beautician gophers, etc.). It will take no more than a half-hour to visit, but it is well worth the detour for all the WTF moments to be had. </p>\n<p><center>***</center></p>\n<p>Alberta is a very big province. By comparison, Texas is only 2% bigger. If it is the mountains that call you here, then that is rightly so, but I hope you will also take the time to explore other parts of this land rich in attractions. They will keep anyone and everyone entertained for ten days and beyond!</p>\n<p><em>Dalene Heck and her husband Pete are behind the blog <a href=\"http://www.hecktictravels.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hecktic Travels</a>, which chronicles their journey since selling all their belongings in 2009.

It’s by far my favorite way to explore the country. </p>\n<p>One state in particular is perfect for road-tripping: California.</p>\n<p>Occupying much of the West Coast, California is home to almost 40 million people. Here you find high mountains, giant trees, deserts, valleys, stunning beaches, and vibrant cities. It’s its own little country in some ways.  </p>\n<p>Since California is so big, I’m going to do a series of posts that cover road trips in the state as it’s better to focus on smaller areas so you can really soak up and enjoy each destination. In travel, less is more. </p>\n<p>To kick off the series, here is a one-week itinerary for Southern California:<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 1–2: Los Angeles</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/californiaroad2.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Looking out over Los Angeles from behind the Hollywood sign\"><br />\nStart in Los Angeles, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/loving-los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a city I’ve come to love</a>. It’s not a city for tourists. Everything is spread out, you need a car, and the traffic makes getting around a pain. But, if you can enjoy its slow pace, diverse food and drink scene, and hikes, you’ll get a taste of what it’s like to live there. You visit LA like how you would spend your Saturday. </p>\n<p>The city has a lot to do. Here are some of my personal favorite activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stroll down Hollywood Boulevard</strong> – Don’t miss the Walk of Fame (where celebrities have their names engraved in the sidewalk) and Grauman’s Chinese Theatre (featuring celebrities’ handprints and footprints). </li>\n<li><strong>Visit LACMA</strong> &#8211;  With over 150,000 works, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is the largest art museum in the western USA. They have collections from pretty much every era throughout history and every region of the world. Admission is $25 USD.</li>\n<li><strong>Hike to the Hollywood Sign</strong> – While you can snap pictures of the sign from pretty much anywhere in the city, it’s also possible to hike up to the sign itself to take in the view. The three trails (from easiest to hardest) are the Mt. Hollywood Trail, the Brush Canyon Trail, and the Cahuenga Peak Trail.</li>\n<li><strong>Browse The Last Bookstore</strong> – This is one of my favorite bookstores in the world. It sells books and records, has art displays, and features a cool upstairs area too with cheap books. Browse the shelves, grab a coffee, and buy a book!</li>\n<li><strong>Hit the beach</strong> – There are a lot of awesome beaches in and around Los Angeles. Some of the best are: Venice Beach, Carbon Beach, Santa Monica State Beach, Huntington City Beach, and El Matador.</li>\n<li><strong>Visit the Getty Museum</strong> – Opened in 1997 as part of the massive Getty Center, this museum has a diverse collection of paintings, manuscripts, drawings, and other artwork from the eighth century to present day. Admission is free.</li>\n<li><strong>Go hiking</strong> – LA has a lot of hiking trails so it’s easy to connect with nature. Some worth checking out are the Charlie Turner Trail (90 minutes), Baldwin Hills (30 minutes), Runyon Canyon (45 minutes), Portuguese Bend Reserve (3 hours), and Echo Mountain (3–3.5 hours).</li>\n<li><strong>See the Le Brea Tar Pits</strong> – These natural asphalt pits are located in Hancock Park and have existed for upwards of 50,000 years. Tons of fossils, preserved for centuries, have been found in them. The museum has lots of interesting information about the pits and how they came to be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more things to see and do, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s my complete guide to Los Angeles</a>.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles also has countless food options. Some places I love are Musso &#038; Frank Grill, Dan Tana’s, Meals by Genet, The Butcher’s Daughter, Sugarfish, and Thai Pepper. </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FBanana-Bungalow-Hollywood%2FLos-Angeles%2F11182\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Banana Bungalow Hollywood</a> – A chill, laid-back hostel that’s super social and organizes lots of activities.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FFreehand-Los-Angeles%2FLos-Angeles%2F272919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freehand Los Angeles</a> – This hostel/hotel features designer rooms with comfortable beds, a rooftop pool and bar with amazing views of the city, a lobby bar, a restaurant, and even a fitness center. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more suggestions, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-hostels-in-los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s my complete list of favorite hostels in Los Angeles!</a><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 2–3: San Diego </h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/sandiegohostel2.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The skyline of San Diego as seen from over the bay\"><br />\nTwo hours down the coast is San Diego. It’s a popular city for sure but not as popular as the others. Personally, after LA, it’s my second favorite spot in the state! It’s easier to navigate, cheaper, has amazing weather, awesome beaches, and plenty of great bars and restaurants. Spend two nights here. </p>\n<p>Here are some things to do during your visit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Visit the USS Midway Museum</strong> – This aircraft carrier was the largest ship in the world until 1955. It saw action in numerous conflicts before being decommissioned in 1992 and turned into a museum. You can explore the flight deck as well as many of the rooms below.</li>\n<li><strong>Have fun at Belmont Park</strong> – This kitschy amusement park is right next to the ocean and perfect for some cheesy fun. It has a few classic rides as well as games and lots of greasy (and delicious) food and snacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Go surfing</strong> – Whether you’re a veteran or a newbie, grab a board and hit the waves. There’s some awesome surfing here. You can usually rent a board for around $30 USD a day. 90-minute lessons cost around $70 USD.</li>\n<li><strong>Visit the San Diego Zoo</strong> – Located in Balboa Park and with over 3,500 animals and 700,000 plant species, the San Diego Zoo is a massive, 1,800-acre park where you could easily spend an entire day. It’s one of the best zoos in the country and a great choice for anyone traveling with kids.</li>\n<li><strong>Explore Balboa Park</strong> – This is one of the oldest recreational parks in the US. In addition to the zoo, there are dozens of museums, as well as gardens, walking paths, sports fields, stadiums, theatres, and more. It’s a massive cultural center and green space with a ton to see and do.</li>\n<li><strong>Enjoy Pacific Beach</strong> – Head to Pacific Beach if you want to soak up the sun, surf, or go for a swim. The area is also known for its nightlife and offers lots of bars, clubs, and restaurants too.</li>\n<li><strong>Go whale watching</strong> – Between December and April, California gray whales migrate from Alaska to Mexico. They can grow up to 49 feet long and are incredible to see up close. Tours usually cost around $35 USD.</li>\n<li><strong>Hike Point Loma</strong> – This peninsula is where Europeans first arrived in California. You can walk out to the tip and enjoy the sweeping views of the ocean, visit the old lighthouse (built in 1855), and watch locals climb the cliffs of Osprey Point.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FHI-San-Diego-Downtown%2FSan-Diego%2F1856\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HI San Diego</a> – This hostel organizes tons of events and tours, includes free breakfast, and has a big kitchen so you can cook your own food to save money. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hostelworld.com%2Fhosteldetails.php%2FITH-Adventure-Hostel-San-Diego%2FSan-Diego%2F66491%3FdateFrom%3D2020-08-26%26dateTo%3D2020-08-27%26number_of_guests%3D1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ITH Adventure Hostel</a> – This eco-hostel has a vegetable garden (and gives free veggies to guests), a recycling and compost program, and even backyard chickens. There is lots of outdoor common space to relax in too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more suggestions, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-hostels-san-diego/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s a list of my favorite hostels in San Diego!</a><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 3–5: Joshua Tree National Park</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/californiaroad3.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The iconic Joshua trees growing in the aria California desert\"><br />\nSandwiched between the Mojave Desert and the Colorado Desert, Joshua Tree National Park offers some of the most incredible landscapes in the country. Swaths of cacti and towering boulders dot the arid panorama, all peppered by the famous Joshua trees and their distinct twisting trunks and branches. </p>\n<p>It’s an otherworldly place, a Martian landscape perfect for hiking, camping, and escaping the busy cities along California’s coast. There are countless trails to enjoy, ranging from short and easy to multiday challenges. Some suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ryan Mountain</strong> – A steep 3-mile hike offering some incredible views.</li>\n<li><strong>Wall Street Mill</strong> – An easy 2.8-mile hike that leads to an old mill used to refine ore during from gold mining.</li>\n<li><strong>Split Rock Loop</strong> – A quiet 2-mile hike with lots of neat rock formations.</li>\n<li><strong>Barker Dam Trail</strong> – A 1.1-mile loop offering a chance to see rabbits, bighorn sheep, and all kinds of birds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The visitor center has more information and trail maps. It’s only $30 USD for a seven-day vehicle pass, which is good for multiple entries in case you stay outside the park itself. The park is three hours from San Diego.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://airbnb.7eer.net/c/214481/264339/4273\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbnb</a> is the best option here if you don’t have your own camping gear, although there are also glamping and more rustic options around the area too.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Days 5–7: Sequoia National Park &#038; Kings Canyon National Park</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/californiaroad4.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"Massive redwood and sequoia trees in Sequoia National park in California, USA\"><br />\nStart early and head to Sequoia National Park. It’s a long drive from Joshua Tree (it takes about 4-6 hours to get there). </p>\n<p>The park itself is comprised of towering redwood and Sequoia trees, some of the biggest trees in the world. I’m talking trees so thick you can drive a car though them and so tall that you can’t see their crown! </p>\n<p>Start things off by visiting the Giant Forest Museum to learn about the geography, history, and importance of the park. Afterward, walk the Big Trees Trail, a short loop that will get you in and amongst the trees. It also has the largest single-stem tree in the world, General Sherman!</p>\n<p>For a sweeping view of the forest, hike up Moro Rock. Standing 250 feet tall, it’s a massive granite dome that juts out of the surrounding hills and forest. Stairs and a viewpoint were built into the rock itself so you can climb to the top safely and enjoy the magnificent vista.</p>\n<p>While you’re here, visit nearby Kings Canyon National Park, a mountainous park with beautiful lakes, valleys to hike, and spectacular views. It’s also where you can see “General Grant” (the third largest tree in the world). For a scenic drive, cruise the Kings Canyon Scenic Byway, a narrow road along the side of a mountain that offers more picturesque views of the rugged landscape. </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Stay</strong><br />\nThere are lots of places to camp here, both inside and outside of the parks. However, if camping isn’t your thing (it’s not really mine), there are plenty of lodges and hotels in the area. You can find them via <a href=\"http://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=362916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Booking.com</a>.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Day 7: Head back to Los Angeles</h3>\n<p>After that, it’s back to LA. It’s only a 3.5-hour drive, so if you’re not in a hurry, enjoy the desert views and stop along the way if you see anything that piques your interest.</p>\n<p><center>***</center></p>\n<p>California is a huge state with unlimited road-tripping potential. And, while there are a million different routes you could take for a seven-day trip, I think this itinerary covers some of the best of SoCal.</p>\n<div class=\"single-booking\">\n<h4>Book Your Trip to the USA: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>\n<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />\nFind a cheap flight by using <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3032045-12837948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skyscanner</a> or <a href=\"https://www.momondo.com/\">Momondo</a>.

Fear. Excitement. Traveling for the first time produced a wave of emotions. </p>\n<p>When I left to travel the world on my first <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/buying-a-rtw-ticket/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">round-the-world trip</a>, I didn’t know what to expect. </p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/ten-years-a-nomad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">with fifteen years of travel experience under my belt</a>, I know better. Traveling is second nature to me now. I land in an airport and I just go on autopilot. </p>\n<p>But, back then, I was as green as they come. </p>\n<p>To compensate for my lack of experience, I followed my guidebooks and wet my feet by going on organized tours. I was young and inexperienced and I made a lot of <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/not-to-do/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rookie travel mistakes</a>.</p>\n<p>I know what it&#8217;s like to just be starting out and have a mind filled with questions, anxieties, and concerns. </p>\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re new to travel and looking for advice to help you prepare, here are 12 tips that I&#8217;d tell a new traveler to help them avoid some of my early mistakes:<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>1. Don’t Be Scared</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-overcome-your-fears/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fear is a powerful deterrent</a>. Taking the leap into the unknown is scary, but remember: you aren’t the first person to travel the world. You aren’t discovering new continents or exploring uncharted territories.</p>\n<p>There is a well-worn travel trail out <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/introducing-the-nomadic-network/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">there and people to help guide you along the way</a>. If millions of people can make their way around the world each year, you can too.</p>\n<p>You’re just as capable as anyone else. After all, you did the hardest part: deciding to go. Having the courage to make that decision is the hardest part.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll make mistakes. Everyone does. But that&#8217;s part of the experience.</p>\n<p>There will be lots of people out there to help you. You&#8217;ll be shocked at just how helpful and kind people are. You&#8217;ll make friends, you&#8217;ll survive, and you&#8217;ll be better for it.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>2. Don’t Live by Your Guidebook</h3>\n<p>Guidebooks are useful for a general overview of a destination. They&#8217;re a great way to learn the basics and get introduced to the cities and countries you plan to visit. But you’ll never find the latest off-the-beaten-path attractions, bars, or restaurants in them. </p>\n<p>For the latest info (as well as insider tips), connect with locals. Use websites like <a href=\"http://meetup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meetup.com</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-crush-it-on-couchsurfing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Couchsurfing</a> to connect directly with local and expats so you can get suggesitons, advice, and tips to make the most of your trip.</p>\n<p>Additionally, ask other travelers you meet or the staff at your hotel/hostel. Visit the local tourist board as well. It&#8217;s a wealth of information that often gets overlooked.</p>\n<p>In short, use a guidebook for the foundation of your plans but fill in the details with up-to-date info from locals. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/my-current-list-of-favorite-blogs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">You can also use travel blogs for planning tips</a> since they are updated more often than guidebooks.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>3. Travel Slow</h3>\n<p>This is something most new long-term travelers learn the hard way (myself included).</p>\n<p>I know it can be tempting to pack in as many cities and activities as possible. (This is especially true if you only have a few weeks of vacation.)</p>\n<p>But rushing from city to city every other day is just going to leave you exhausted and stressed out. You&#8217;ll experience a whirlwind of activity, most of which will remain a blur when you look back on it. Sure, you&#8217;ll have some great pictures for Instagram but is that really why you&#8217;re traveling?</p>\n<p>Travel is about quality, not quantity. Don&#8217;t worry about how much you see. Don&#8217;t worry about trying to impress people with the number of countries you&#8217;ve visited. Slow down and soak up your destinations. You&#8217;ll learn more, enjoy it more, and have a much more memorable experience.</p>\n<p>When it comes to travel, less is more. (Plus, traveling slow helps reduce your transportation costs. It&#8217;s cheaper to go slow!)</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>4. Pack Light</h3>\n<p>When I went to <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/costa-rica-travel-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Costa Rica</a> in 2003, I brought a bag filled with tons of stuff: hiking boots and pants, a fleece jacket, too much clothing, and my bodyweight in toiletries. And it all sat in my bag, mostly unused.</p>\n<p>I was packing for &#8220;just in case&#8221; and &#8220;what if&#8221; instead of the reality of my trip.</p>\n<p>While it can be tempting to bring more than you need &#8220;just in case,&#8221; remember this: you can buy things on the road. Socks, shampoo, jackets, new shoes — you can find it all aborad. There&#8217;s no need to bring everything and the kitchen sink. </p>\n<p>So, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/packing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pack light</a>. You’ll have less to carry, saving you the hassle and stress of lugging a huge backpack around for weeks (or months) on end.</p>\n<p>Unless you are going somewhere cold, a bag around 40 liters will suffice. Bags around this size are easier to carry, don&#8217;t get too unwieldy, and can fit on your flight as carry-on only if need be (a huge perk if you want to save yourself some headaches).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/choosing-the-right-backpack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here&#8217;s everything you need to know to help you find the perfect bag for your budget and your trip</a>.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>5. Get Travel Insurance</h3>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a travel veteran or a brand new backpacker, don&#8217;t leave home without making sure you&#8217;re protected in case something goes wrong. As we learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, sudden emergencies can come out of nowhere. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had my luggage lost. I popped an eardrum in Thailand. <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/getting-stabbed-in-colombia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I was knifed in Colombia</a>. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a friend break bones, need to be helicoptered out of the Amazon, or fly back due to a sudden death. </p>\n<p>Stuff happens. </p>\n<p>To ensure you&#8217;re protected, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/travel-insurance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buy travel insurance</a>.</p>\n<p>I never leave home without it because I know just how quickly things can go sideways.</p>\n<p>You never know what might happen. The road is filled with uncertainty. Make sure you&#8217;re protected. It will also give you peace of mind and help you travel with confidence.</p>\n<p>Here are a few posts worth reading. I know it&#8217;s not a fun or sexy topic, but it&#8217;s an important one!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/is-travel-insurance-worth-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Is Travel Insurance Worth it?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/best-travel-insurance-companies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The 7 Best Travel Insurance Companies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/world-nomads-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">World Nomads Insurance Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>6. Bring a Phone (and Get Local SIM Cards)</h3>\n<p>Having a phone with data means you can look up directions on the fly, make reservations, and contact emergency services if something happens.</p>\n<p>Sure, there is free wifi pretty much everywhere these days so buying a local SIM card for data might seem like a waste of money (especially if you&#8217;re on a really, really tight budget) but having that immediate access to roaming data can be a lifesaver.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re from the US and traveling for less than 3 months, <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/t-mobile-for-travelers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">T-Mobile has reliable data plans</a>. Google Fi is another great option too.</p>\n<p>Additionally, having a phone makes it easier to connect and stay in touch with travelers you meet. </p>\n<p>Simply put: having a phone is really helpful in this day and age. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/travel-phone/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Just don&#8217;t stay glued to it all the time</a>.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>7. Go with the Flow</h3>\n<p>When every day is planned out and there are timetables to follow, you&#8217;ll get stressed. Very stressed. You&#8217;ll rush around and be unhappy if there are any glitches in your well-curated schedule.</p>\n<p>And there will be hiccups. And glitches. And all kinds of inconveniences, both major and minor. Life on the road doesn&#8217;t always go as planned — which is both fun and frustrating.</p>\n<p>When you plan too much, there’s no room to experience the happy accidents of travel. There&#8217;s no room for spontaneous choice, for incorporating new information and advice that you learn.</p>\n<p>When making your plan, make sure that it&#8217;s flexible. <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/going-with-the-flow/\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn to go with the flow</a>. Plan one or two activities and let the rest of the day happen. </p>\n<p>It’ll be a more enjoyable and less stressful experience. You’ll be surprised by what happens. </p>\n<p>Be flexible. Let life unfold the way it should.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>8. Bring Some Extra Money</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/the-ultimate-guide-to-traveling-when-you-have-no-money/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Travel isn’t as expensive as many people think</a> but you still need to create a budget that means your needs. The secret to long term travel is smart money management. </p>\n<p>However, always <em>overestimate</em> the amount you need. You never know what might come up on the road. After all, you didn&#8217;t spend all that time saving every penny and staying home to skip those once in a lifetime activities? </p>\n<p>Maybe you want to try bungee jumping or you discover an amazing restaurant you can&#8217;t pass up. Or maybe you meet some cool people and decide to scrap your plan altogether.</p>\n<p>No matter how well you plan, something can always come up that will throw your budget out of synch.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s fine. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/save-for-trip-advice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Just leave home with a little extra</a>. If you&#8217;re planning says you&#8217;ll need $2,000, bring $2,500. It will give you a buffer for emergencies and spontaneity.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>9. Remember Everyone is in the Same Boat</h3>\n<p>It takes courage to talk to strangers when you&#8217;re new to travel, especially if you&#8217;re an introvert like me. What do you say? Can you just invite people to join you? What if you end up alone? </p>\n<p>These are all questions I had when I first started traveling. The good news? Everyone is in the same boat. All around you are other solo travelers looking for friends. They want to meet new people too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-be-more-interesting-while-traveling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">While there are a few tricks to learn to help you meet people</a>, it mostly just comes down to saying “hello” and taking that first step. Everything else will fall into place after that. You have nothing to lose and, in the process — this is how you&#8217;ll get over your shyness, make new friends, and get better at conversation. </p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>10. Be Adventurous</h3>\n<p>The only time we grow is when we&#8217;re outside of our comfort zones. And travel is about growth. That doesn&#8217;t mean you need to do dangerous things, but it does mean you need to push yourself beyond what you&#8217;re used to.</p>\n<p>Hiking, sky diving, eating new foods, camping, rock climbing, hitchhiking — whatever taking a risk looks like to you is 100% ok. Everyone has different interests and tolerance levels. Push yours. It may be scary and uncomfortable at the time, but you&#8217;ll be glad you did it later.</p>\n<p>Challenge yourself. Try new things. You’ll walk away more self-confident.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>11. It&#8217;s Ok to Change Your Mind</h3>\n<p>If you hate a city, leave and go to another one. If you don&#8217;t enjoy the tour your on, cancel it early. And if you really love the place you&#8217;re visiting, change your plans and stay longer. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s perfectly normal to change your mind on the road.</p>\n<p>Maybe that means extending your trip. Maybe that means going home early. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with either choice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/going-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Always remember you can go home if you aren’t having fun</a>. You aren’t stuck with your decision to travel or your decision to be in a specific place. You&#8217;re the captain on your own ship. Never forget that!<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>12. Remember, You&#8217;re Not Alone</h3>\n<p>Wherever you go, there is a network of travelers who will be your friends, give you advice or tips, and help you out. They will guide you, point you in the right direction, and be your mentors. </p>\n<p>You aren’t out there on your own. </p>\n<p>And you will be OK. </p>\n<p><center>***</center></p>\n<p>I know you’re nervous about heading out into the unknown. It’s human nature to worry. But, if you remember these words of wisdom, you&#8217;ll go into this the right mindset and able to avoid rookie mistakes.</p>\n<p>So take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy your trip!</p>\n<div class=\"single-booking\">\n<h4>Book Your Trip: Logistical Tips and Tricks</h4>\n<p><strong>Book Your Flight</strong><br />\nFind a cheap flight by using <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3032045-12837948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Skyscanner</a> or <a href=\"https://www.momondo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Momondo</a>. They are my two favorite search engines, because they search websites and airlines around the globe so you always know no stone is being left unturned. </p>\n<p><strong>Book Your Accommodation</strong><br />\nYou can book your hostel with <a href=\"https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lHtj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hostelworld</a> as they have the largest inventory. If you want to stay somewhere other than a hostel, use <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=362916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Booking.com</a>, as they consistently return the cheapest rates for guesthouses and hotels. </p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget Travel Insurance</strong><br />\nTravel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It&#8217;s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it, as I&#8217;ve had to use it many times in the past.

True, we shouldn&#8217;t be doing a lot of travel at the moment but you can always use these tips for later! Today, my Creative Director Raimee of <a href=\"http://doitallabroad.com\">All Abroad</a> shares her tips and advice for visiting Detroit, one of the country&#8217;s most underrated cities!</em></p>\n<p>Just north of Lake Erie’s western end, Detroit, Michigan, is a sprawling metropolis home to over four million people. Haunted by the echoes of its past, the city is often overlooked or ignored by domestic and international travelers alike.</p>\n<p>Having grown up in the Detroit area, I can understand why those unaware of its charm consider Detroit a blighted city, burdened by debt, crime, and a fleeing population. I assure you, though, this preconception couldn’t be more wrong.</p>\n<p>The famed “Motor City” has historically been known for its auto manufacturing sector, its contributions to the early music industry, and its beloved sports teams. Today, through its revitalization, Detroit has taken on a new appeal.</p>\n<p>From its world-class museums and its incredible assortment of eateries to its culturally-inspired dive bars and eclectic garage-like music scene, Detroit is one of the most exciting cities in America to both explore and be a part of right now. Its population is motivated, its people are proud, and the suburbs’ rekindled interest in downtown has helped open the door to a new era of prosperity and a growing young population.</p>\n<p>To help inspire you to plan a trip, here is my curated list of things to see and do I’d recommend to anyone visiting Detroit:<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>1. Take a Free Walking Tour</h3>\n<p>Start your visit with a free walking tour. You’ll get an introduction to the city and its past, learn about its evolution and recent developments, and see the main downtown sights. You’ll also get access to an expert local guide who can answer all your questions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://detroitexperiencefactory.org/public-tours\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Detroit Experience Factory</a> offers daily free tours (as well as more in-depth paid tours) that will give you a solid introduction. Just make sure to tip your guide at the end!<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>2. Visit the Detroit Institute of Arts</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/traveldetroit10.jpg\" alt=\"The exterior of the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit, Michigan\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" /><br />\nThe Detroit Institute of Arts is a 130-year-old museum located in the heart of Midtown and has something to offer every visitor.

Relax at Belle Isle</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/traveldetroit2.jpg\" alt=\"The conservatory on Belle Island near Detroit, Michigan\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" /><br />\nYou could easily spend an entire day exploring Belle Isle, a 982-acre island park with a variety of activities and attractions. It’s a popular destination for locals to gather on a sunny day for picnics and barbeques, for hanging out at the beach, or for walking along its various nature trails.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my other favorite things to do at Belle Isle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wander the conservatory</strong> – The Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory is a peaceful botanical garden stretching over 13 acres, with dozens of walking paths and greenhouses to explore. Admission is free.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit the range</strong> – Belle Island Golf Range is driving range with practice areas for driving, putting, and chipping. A bucket of balls is just $5.50 USD.</li>\n<li><strong>Enjoy the beach</strong> – There’s over half a mile of beach where you can swim, lounge, or rent a kayak or paddleboard and soak up the sun.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>4. Explore the Eastern Market</h3>\n<p>The Eastern Market is a huge marketplace with local foods, art, jewelry, artisan crafts, and more. It covers 43 acres and is the largest historic public market district in the <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/united-states-travel-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">United States</a>, dating back over 150 years.</p>\n<p>There are three different market days during the week: Saturdays, Sundays, and Tuesdays.

Along the path, you’ll find all kinds of street art, as well as buskers in the summer. It’s a nice place to walk or jog and take in the city.</p>\n<p>If you plan on visiting the Eastern Market and the Riverfront (which you should!), consider renting a bike (they&#8217;re just $8 USD per day from mogodetroit.com).<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>6. Check Out One of the Largest Bookstores in the World</h3>\n<p>Maybe it’s because I love all bookstores, but this is one of my favorite places to explore in Detroit. John K. King Used &#38; Rare Books, located in an old glove factory, is an enchanting host to over one million books.</p>\n<p>I love spending time wandering through the rows of strange titles and marveling at the rare editions they have in stock — some are so rare, you have to make an appointment to be allowed to view them.</p>\n<p><em>901 W. Lafayette Blvd., +1 313-961-0622, johnkingbooksdetroit.com. Open Tuesday–Saturday 10am–5pm.</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>7.

Built in 1928, and with over 5,000 seats, it continues to host a variety of live productions and events (like concerts, standup comedy, and children’s performances).</p>\n<p>The building is a National Historic Landmark, the highest honor given by the National Park Service, and is open for tours in case you can’t catch a performance during your trip.

Completed in 1929, it is a National Historic Landmark and one of the most important Art Deco skyscrapers in the world!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://detroitexperiencefactory.org/public-tours\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Detroit Experience Factory</a> offers a few free walking tours, including an Art and Architecture tour that covers the Guardian Building if you want to learn more during your visit.</p>\n<p><em>500 Griswold St., +1 313-963-4567, guardianbuilding.com.

Walk Around Campus Martius Park</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/traveldetroit11.jpg\" alt=\"The Campus Martius Park in Detroit, Michigan\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" /><br />\nAfter a devastating fire in 1805, Campus Martius was created as the de facto center of Detroit’s rebuilding efforts. Covering just over an acre, the park features outdoor cafés and bars, a mini beach, green space, food trucks galore, monuments, and a host of weekend festivals and activities.</p>\n<p>In the winter, you’ll find a giant Christmas tree, an ice-skating rink, and a Christmas market. Every time I visit this area of town, I reflect on how far the city has come in the past ten years.</p>\n<p><em>To visit the park, take the light rail to the Campus Martius station.</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>10. Snap Photos at The Belt</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/traveldetroit5.jpg\" alt=\"Street art in an alleyway in The Belt in Detroit, Michigan\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" /><br />\nThe Belt, named after its location in the former downtown garment district, is a culturally redefined alley in the heart of Detroit. Public art is the driving force behind the redevelopment of The Belt, which has murals and installations by local, national, and international artists. It is part of Library Street Collective’s continuous effort to ensure that artists have a space to create and engage with the public.</p>\n<p><em>To visit the Belt, take the light rail to Broadway station.</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>11. See the Motown Museum</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/traveldetroit12.jpg\" alt=\"The exterior of the small Motown Museum in Detroit, Michigan\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" /><br />\nMotown Records is an R&#38;B and soul record label based in Detroit credited with advancing the racial integration of pop music in the 1960s and ’70s. Best-selling artists like the Temptations, the Four Tops, the Miracles, the Supremes, and many others were on the Motown label. (Motown is a portmanteau of “motor” and “town” since Detroit is known as Motor City.)</p>\n<p>Its main office, named Hitsville U.S.A., was converted into a museum in 1985 to highlight the important contributions of Motown to the greater American music scene. It has all sorts of records, awards, and costumes from famous musicians (including Michael Jackson). You can also see one of the recording studios where many of the label’s classic hits were produced.</p>\n<p><em>2648 W. Grand Blvd., +1 313-875-2264, motownmuseum.org.

Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/traveldetroit6.jpg\" alt=\"Old Ford automobiles in the Henry Ford museum in Detroit, Michigan\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" /><br />\nHenry Ford, a Michigan native and founder of the Ford Motor Company (and prominent anti-Semite), was responsible for kick-starting the automobile industry in the US in the early 1900s.</p>\n<p>Today, you can tour the company’s massive museum and learn about the history of the automobile and how it evolved from a novelty to a staple of modern society. The museum has numerous cars (including presidential automobiles), as well as exhibitions on trains, power generation, and much more.</p>\n<p>Additionally, adjacent to the museum is Greenfield Village, a semi-separate museum that hosts all kinds of science and agriculture exhibitions that Ford collected over his lifetime. It’s a great place to visit with kids, as many of the exhibits are interactive and educational.</p>\n<p><em>20900 Oakwood Blvd., Dearborn, +1 313-982-6001, thehenryford.org/visit/henry-ford-museum.

There are tons of delicious restaurants and a growing number of breweries here, kickstarting a foodie renaissance that is putting the city on the map. If you’re looking for an introduction into Detroit’s food and drink scene, take a tour. There are plenty of food and brewery tours that will give you a mouthwatering or thirst-quenching introduction to the culinary and microbrewery scenes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.detroithistorytours.com/shop/order-up-the-detroit-food-tour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Detroit History Tours</a> and <a href=\"https://detroitfoodietours.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Detroit Foodie Tours</a> both offer excellent and insightful food tours to some of the best restaurants, while <a href=\"https://www.motorcitybrewtours.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Motor City Brew Tours</a> will introduce you to the best beers Detroit has to offer. You’ll get to eat some wonderful food, try tasty drinks, and meet the chefs and restaurateurs making it all possible!<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>Where to Eat</h3>\n<p>If you’re looking for some places to grab a bite to eat, here are a few of my favorites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Peterboro</strong> – Mouth watering and inventive Chinese food paired with craft beer and cocktails</li>\n<li><strong>SheWolf</strong> – Trendy and upscale Italian cuisine</li>\n<li><strong>Selden Standard</strong> – Locally grown and seasonal plates</li>\n<li><strong>Gold Cash Gold</strong> – Local food meets Mediterranean-inspired dishes</li>\n<li><strong>Bronx Bar</strong> – A classic dive bar with greasy eats</li>\n<li><strong>Sugar House</strong> – An intimate craft cocktail pub</li>\n<li><strong>Brooklyn Street Diner</strong> – A cozy diner with local food and lots of vegetarian options</li>\n</ul>\n<p><center>***</center>Detroit is one of the best up-and-coming cities in the country.

Come and visit while you can and beat the crowds. I promise Detroit will surpass your expectations!</p>\n<p><em>Raimee is the creative director for Nomadic Matt and runs the remote work and travel blog, <a href=\"https://www.doitallabroad.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">All Abroad</a>.

It&#8217;s small but bursting with things to do: there are countless museums, spacious parks, and delicious restaurants to keep you busy. It&#8217;s close to numerous forests with hiking and biking trails, and there are lots of places to swim in the summer too.</p>\n<p>However, since it&#8217;s expensive, a lot of travelers pass Oslo by. </p>\n<p>While a visit will certainly eat into your budget, Oslo is definitely worth a couple of days. To show precisely why you should add it to your itinerary, here are my favorite things to see and do there:<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>1. Take a Free Walking Tour</h3>\n<p>I always start my trips off with a free walking tour. They&#8217;re a budget-friendly way to see the main sights, learn a little history, meet other travelers, and get access to an expert local guide who can answer all my questions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://freetouroslo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Free Tour Oslo</a> organizes daily tours that last 90 minutes and are a solid introduction to the city. Make sure to tip the guide when the tour ends!<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>2. Enjoy the View at the Opera House</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/oslothings1d.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The famous Oslo Opera House in Norway overlooking the city at sunset\"><br />\nThis massive contemporary theatre sits on the water and is home to the national opera and ballet. Opened in 2007, the building itself is composed of multiple flat levels that essentially act as small plazas, allowing visitors to walk on the roof and enjoy the view of the harbor and city. It&#8217;s a popular spot to watch the sunset when the weather is nice. Check the website to see what performances are happening during your visit.</p>\n<p><em>Kirsten Flagstads Plass 1, +47 21 42 21 21, operaen.no. Open weekdays 10am–7pm, Saturdays 11am–6pm, and Sundays 12pm–6pm. Admission to performances varies.</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>3. See the Viking Museum</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/48osloviking.jpg\" alt=\"Viking Museum, Oslo\" /><br />\nLocated on Bygdøy Island, this museum is home to some of the best-preserved Viking longships in the world. These ships, some of which date back to the ninth century, were found around Norway. There are Viking burial ships here, as well as carts and tools from the Middle Ages. The museum is relatively sparse (the highlight really is the ships), but there is also a short film and some other interesting tidbits of information. Download the free audio guide to make the most of your visit.</p>\n<p><em>Huk Aveny 35, +47 22 13 52 80, khm.uio.no/besok-oss/vikingskipshuset. Open daily 9am–6pm in the summer and 10am–4pm in the winter. Admission is 120 NOK ($12.40 USD) for adults and free for kids under 18.</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>4. Explore the Vigeland Sculpture Park</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/oslothings2.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"A small baby statue in Vigeland Park in Oslo, Norway\"><br />\nThis unique collection of sculptures is located in Frogner Park. It&#8217;s the world’s largest display of sculptures created by a single artist. Gustav Vigeland (1869–1943) created over 200 bronze, iron, and granite statues that now stand in the open-air “gallery” (which covers a whopping 80 acres). The crying baby statue is the most famous. In the summer, there are often events held here as well.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>5. Visit the Historical Museum</h3>\n<p>This museum has lots of artifacts and information about Norway&#8217;s past, including lots of Viking content. There are also exhibitions on ancient Egypt (including mummies), Africa, and the country&#8217;s arctic expeditions. You can also use your ticket to get free entry to the Viking Museum (and vice versa) if done within 48 hours.</p>\n<p><em> Frederiks gate 2, +47 22 85 19 00, khm.uio.no/besok-oss/historisk-museum. Open Tuesday-Sunday 10am–4pm. Admission is 120 NOK ($12.40 USD) for adults and free for kids under 18. Free on the last Saturday of each month.</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>6. Wander Holmenkollen</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/oslothings1a.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"A wintery view of Oslo, Norway and the old Olympic ski jump in Holmenkollen\"><br />\nThe Holmenkollen Ski Jump can be seen from every corner of the city. If you want to see it up close, hop on the subway and get off at the Holmenkollen stop. You can walk up to the jump and visit the Ski Jump Museum (the oldest ski museum in the world) if you want to learn more about this seemingly insane sport. The jump at Holmenkollen is 60 meters high, and there&#8217;s room for some 70,000 spectators (Norwegians love their winter sports!).</p>\n<p>From here you can also wander into Nordmarka for a hike. It&#8217;s a forested area north of the city, with hiking, walking, and cycling trails.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>7. Relax at Aker Brygge</h3>\n<p>Located near the pier, the largest concentration of restaurants in Oslo can be found here, ranging from French cuisine to traditional Nordic dishes. There&#8217;s lots of window-shopping and architecture to admire as well. The wharf has something for everyone and is a great place to spend a couple of hours soaking up life in the city.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>8. See the Royal Palace</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/oslothings3.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The historic Royal Palace in Oslo, Norway in the summer\"><br />\nThe official residence of the monarch, completed in the 1840s, is surrounded by a huge park, and locals can usually be seen in it enjoying what little sun they get throughout the year. During the summer, parts of the palace are also open to visitors. Tours last one hour, and you&#8217;ll be able to see some of the lavish historical rooms and learn about the monarchs who ruled Norway over the centuries.</p>\n<p><em>Slottsplassen 1, +47 22 04 87 00, kongehuset.no/seksjon.html. Summer hours vary. See the website for details. Admission is 140 NOK ($14.50 USD) and includes a tour. </em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>9. Visit the Norwegian Folk Museum</h3>\n<p>The Norsk Folkemuseum (Norwegian Museum of Cultural History) is an open-air museum home to relocated traditional Norwegian buildings. It&#8217;s near the Viking Ship Museum (and several other museums) and showcases over 150 buildings from various periods throughout Norwegian history. The most stunning of its exhibitions is Gol Stave Church, an intricately carved wooden church that dates back to the 13th century. In the summer, you can also feed animals and take carriage rides around the area. </p>\n<p><em>Museumsveien 10, +47 22 12 37 00, norskfolkemuseum.no. Open daily 11am–4pm. Admission is 160 NOK ($16.50 USD).</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>10. Go Swimming</h3>\n<p>Oslo is surrounded by water and nature. It&#8217;s a green capital, too, with many outdoor areas that are ideal for swimming in the summer; the water is clean and safe. Tjuvholmen City Beach, Sørenga Seawater Pool, and Huk are three spots worth checking out if you’re looking to take a dip when the weather is nice.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>11. Visit the Fram Museum</h3>\n<p>This unique museum focuses on polar exploration, a prevalent topic in Norwegian history and culture. The centerpiece is the Fram, the world’s first ice-breaking ship (and the last one made out of wood). In use between 1893 and 1912, the Fram made many trips to the North and South Poles and is said to have sailed farther north and farther south than any other wooden ship in history. The museum is very detailed and offers a lot of history, as well as photographs, tools, and artifacts. </p>\n<p><em>Bygdøynesveien 39, +47 23 28 29 50, frammuseum.no. Open daily 10am–6pm. Admission is 120 NOK ($12.40 USD).</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>12. Learn about the Kon-Tiki Expedition</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/oslothings5.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The famous Kon-Tiki balsa raft in Oslo, Norway\"><br />\nThe Kon-Tiki Museum focuses on the works and expeditions of historian and explorer Thor Heyerdahl. Using a traditional balsa raft, Heyerdahl crossed the Pacific Ocean from South America to Polynesia, proving that the islands were populated from the Americas and not Asia, as had been previously thought. The journey took 101 days and was filmed, winning an Academy Award in 1951.</p>\n<p>The original raft can be found in the museum, along with information on Heyerdahl&#8217;s other expeditions and archeological discoveries. The journey inspired the 2012 historical drama film <em>Kon-Tiki</em> (which is an excellent travel film).</p>\n<p><em>Bygdøynesveien 36, +47 23 08 67 67, kon-tiki.no. Open daily 9:30am–6pm (shorter hours in the autumn and winter). Admission is 120 NOK ($12.40 USD).</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>13. Visit the Holocaust Center</h3>\n<p>The Holocaust Center focuses on the Norwegian experience of the Holocaust, highlighting the tragic fate of Norwegian Jews, as well as the persecution of religious minorities around the world. Established in 2001, it moved from the university to the former residence of Vidkun Quisling, a fascist who headed the Norwegian government under Nazi occupation from 1942 to 1945 (he was executed for war crimes after the war ended). The center has all sorts of exhibitions, photos, films, artifacts, and interviews. It&#8217;s somber and sobering but worth a visit.</p>\n<p><em>Huk Aveny 56, +47 23 10 62 00, hlsenteret.no. Open weekdays 9am–4pm. Admission is 70 NOK ($7.25 USD).</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>14. See City Hall</h3>\n<p>Oslo&#8217;s City Hall is open to the public and free to enter. While it might not sound like an interesting sight, the tours are actually quite informative. There are about 20 murals and works of art inside the building, covering everything from traditional Norwegian life to the Nazi occupation. You&#8217;ll also learn about the history of the Nobel Peace Prize, which is awarded here annually (the other Nobel Prizes are awarded in <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/sweden-travel-tips/stockholm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stockholm</a>).<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>15. Explore Akershus Castle</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/oslothings4.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The exterior of Akershus Castle in Oslo, Norway in the summer\"><br />\nOriginally built in 1290, Akershus Castle is a medieval fortress that later evolved into a Renaissance palace under Danish King Christian IV. It was built both for protection and as a royal residence (currently, it&#8217;s used as an office for the prime minister). The fortress has never successfully been besieged, though it did surrender to the Nazis during World War II. </p>\n<p>Inside, you&#8217;ll find a military museum, as well as one dedicated to the resistance during WWII. Guided tours are available in the summer, and there are often concerts and events held here, so check the website to see if anything is occurring during your visit.</p>\n<p><em>+47 23 09 39 17, forsvarsbygg.no/no/festningene/finn-din-festning/akershus-festning. Open daily in the summers 10am–4pm (winter hours vary). Admission is free.</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>16. Go Tobogganing at Korketrekkeren</h3>\n<p>Tobogganing is a traditional Norwegian winter activity and one you shouldn&#8217;t miss if you&#8217;re here during the winter. Stretching over 2,000 meters long, the Korketrekkeren track is fun for adults and kids alike. Sleds and helmets are available for rent for 150 NOK ($15.50 USD), and you rent them by the day so you can enjoy as many rides as you like.<br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>17. Explore the National Gallery</h3>\n<p>The National Gallery contains Edvard Munch&#8217;s famous painting &#8220;The Scream&#8221; (which was made in 1893 and has been stolen twice). The gallery is small, but there are a lot of artists on display. You&#8217;ll find some Impressionist and Dutch works, as well as some by Picasso and El Greco. It&#8217;s not the most expansive collection, but it is still worth a visit, especially if you&#8217;re a fan of more classical art styles (like me).</p>\n<p><em>The National Gallery is temporarily closed and will reopen in 2021. You can find some of its collection in the National Museum.</em><br />\n&#160;</p>\n<h3>18. Get Off the Beaten Path</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2020/oslothings6.jpg\" width=\"675\" height=\"395\" alt=\"The She Lies sculpture in Oslo, Norway\"><br />\nIf you&#8217;re looking for something more quirky, here are some of the more off-the-beaten path sights and museums the city has to offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Norwegian Museum of Magic</strong> &#8211; A small museum open only on Sundays, with lots of magic memorabilia and props.

Using his advice on leveraging award offers on credit cards, I&#8217;ve been able to avoid having to pay for airfare (other than fees) on trips to great locations in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.

His book was an eye-opener — it explained the concept and language of travel hacking in a way that is easy to read and understand. Since buying his book six months ago, I have accumulated nearly 300,000 points.

After following Matt&#8217;s advice, I now have two free airline tickets to the US Virgin Islands and I am asking myself, why didn&#8217;t I start doing this years ago?! I used to be a real skeptic, but I see that it really does work and it doesn&#8217;t ruin your credit!!!&#8221;\n</div>\n<hr class=\"style-two\">\n<div style=\"margin: 20px;\">\n<div><img class=\"headshot-right\" src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2018/tonia.jpg\" alt=\"tonia testimonial\" /></div>\n<p><strong>Tonia:</strong> &#8220;I was already dabbling in travel hacking, but this book contained ideas that I hadn&#8217;t thought about. Matt&#8217;s book helped me get two first-class tickets to Australia and 10 nights in hotels for free for my 40th birthday. My husband and I honestly thought we would have to wait until we were retired to be able to afford this trip, but because of Matt&#8217;s advice, we will travel there for free!&#8221;\n</div>\n<hr class=\"style-two\">\n<div style=\"margin: 20px;\">\n<div><img class=\"headshot-right\" src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/bookimages/hs-esteban.jpeg\" alt=\"esteban\" /></div>\n<p><strong>Esteban:</strong> &#8220;I always thought all the frequent-flyer miles stuff was all a big scam, but after reading this book, I see that is definitely not a scam at all. I’ve already gotten a few free hotel stays. With Matt&#8217;s tips, I’ve earned enough miles to fly to South America for a three-month trip with my wife!

The guide served as the perfect template to get started, and honestly, if you don’t buy this book, you’re saying no to free money!&#8221;\n</div>\n<hr class=\"style-two\">\n<div style=\"margin: 20px;\">\n<div><img class=\"headshot-right\" src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2018/carrie.jpg\" alt=\"carrie\" /></div>\n<p><strong>Carrie:</strong> &#8220;I bought this book because wanted a more in-depth guide to travel hacking than what you can find online. By following Matt&#8217;s tips, I earned 100,000 miles within the first couple months. I&#8217;ve saved thousands of dollars so far and seen my credit score rise to over 800, and I get to take more trips over the next year than I have in the last ten without altering my normal spending habits.&#8221;\n</div>\n<p>And, if you get lost on the way, I’ll be here to help you.
