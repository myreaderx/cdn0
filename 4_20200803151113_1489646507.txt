Recently, that’s included <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21346648/valorant-killjoy-character-cute-robot-release-date\">a stylish German hacker with adorable robots</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317375/valorant-elderflame-dragon-skin\">guns that transform into dragons</a>. Now the developer has revealed its “glitchpop” skin line, which basically turns your weapons into cyberpunk sticker books.</p>\n<p id=\"RXI2zF\">Really, the name says it all: all the weapon skins have a glitchy look out of a far-out dystopia but with bright colors to liven them up. A big collection of stickers adds more personality, giving the guns the feel of a DJ’s laptop. The weapons can also be leveled up to earn different color schemes, sound effects, and even a holographic projector.</p>\n<div id=\"sBDnZx\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Eat more noodles.

The company claims the final version of the vehicle could carry between nine and 19 passengers and reach Mach 3, or three times faster than the speed of sound.</p>\n<p id=\"QA18B4\">Virgin Galactic’s primary focus is its space tourism business, which strives to send paying customers to the edge of space and back on the company’s spaceplane. But for years, Virgin Galactic has also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552856/virgin-galactic-saudi-arabia-investment-spaceshiptwo-launcherone\">signaled its interest in leveraging its space technology</a> to develop high-speed, point-to-point travel.
