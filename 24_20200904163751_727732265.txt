Here&#8217;s a guide to all the essential horror streaming in September 2020.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Happy Halloween!</p>\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right, Halloween: the 61-day holiday that begins on September 1st and ends on October 31st. Am I misremembering how holidays work? Of course not! I simply subscribe to the notion that October has subsumed September into its spooky clutches. Like some ravenous extra-terrestrial goo or assimilating pod person, September belongs to October now! All hail Septober!</p>\n<p>So, you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> the permission of a holiday to watch ungodly amounts of horror films. But there&#8217;s certainly something special about queueing up a scary flick during the designated spooky season. Which, as mentioned, is now two glorious months long. The leaves are dying, the days are getting shorter, it&#8217;s time to stare death in the face!</p>\n<p>This month, I&#8217;ve highlighted a handful of frightening films from across the world of streaming to ease you into the Halloween spirit. We&#8217;ve got a Canadian horror-comedy of errors, a making-of documentary that will make you believe in curses, a campy love-letter to the &#8217;70s, and an atmospheric slow-burn about baby murder.</p>\n<p>Be sure to peruse the complete list below, calendar in hand, for a full picture of what horror flicks are coming and going form your favorite streaming services this month.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Pick of the Month: <em>Tucker &#38; Dale vs. Evil</em> (2010)</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-356812 alignnone\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tucker-and-dale-vs.-evil.jpg\" alt=\"Tucker And Dale Vs Evil\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tucker-and-dale-vs.-evil.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tucker-and-dale-vs.-evil-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tucker-and-dale-vs.-evil-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tucker-and-dale-vs.-evil-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Synopsis: <em>Best friends Tucker and Dale are on-route to a weekend getaway to their fixer-upper lakehouse. Along the way, they run into a group of out-of-town teens who unfairly stereotype the completely harmless duo as backwoods killers. A series of accidents (involving woodchippers, nail guns, and sheer dumb luck) escalate the misunderstanding into an all-out bloodbath. </em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Tucker &#38; Dale vs. Evil </em></strong>does not have a bad bone in its body. Which is saying something for a film this dedicated to murdering teens. As the eponymous Tucker and Dale, <strong>Alan Tudyk</strong> and <strong>Tyler Labine</strong> give two of the most endearing performances in genre film. Fussy and attentive, Tudyk is a pitch-perfect compliment to Labine&#8217;s interminable softness. As things escalate from casual prejudice to out-and-out violence, you desperately hope the pair will make it out alive and well &#8212; and that they finally get to renovate their lakehouse in peace!</p>\n<p>The film joyfully subverts the long-held horror trope of sinister, xenophobic rural folk. And while admittedly it&#8217;s a one-note critique, the film is having so much fun it doesn&#8217;t really matter. <em>Tucker &#38; Dale vs. Evil </em>is a horror-comedy that delivers on gore, heart, and two fantastic central performances. This is a must-watch &#8212; and a damn fine re-watch &#8212; for any fan of the genre.</p>\n<p><strong>Leaves Netflix on September 28th.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>A <em>wild</em> documentary about Richard Stanley&#8217;s doomed attempt to adapt Dr. Moreau</h2>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-356811 alignnone\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lost-soul-the-doomed-journey-of-richard-stanleys-island-of-dr-moreau.jpg\" alt=\"Lost Soul The Doomed Journey Of Richard Stanleys Island Of Dr Moreau\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lost-soul-the-doomed-journey-of-richard-stanleys-island-of-dr-moreau.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lost-soul-the-doomed-journey-of-richard-stanleys-island-of-dr-moreau-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lost-soul-the-doomed-journey-of-richard-stanleys-island-of-dr-moreau-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lost-soul-the-doomed-journey-of-richard-stanleys-island-of-dr-moreau-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Synopsis: <em>A &#8220;wait, it gets worse&#8221; making-of documentary detailing the disastrous production of the 1996 remake of The Island of Dr. Moreau.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley&#8217;s Island of Dr. Moreau</strong> </em>is <a href=\"https://nonfics.com/documentaries-about-the-struggles-and-triumphs-of-filmmaking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">such a good making-of documentary</a> that it eclipses its source material. The 1996 version of <em>The Island of Dr. Moreau </em>is one of the most chaotic productions of all time. Famously so. But trust me, even if you have a passing knowledge that its production was &#8220;troubled,&#8221; what really happened was so much worse. From hurricanes to studio-meddling and Marlon Brando trolling the ever-living hell out of the entire production, the production was the Mount Everest of clusterfucks. The doc also features some truly exquisite talking-head storytelling from <em>The Island of Dr. </em><em>Moreau</em>&#8216;s initial director, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/richard-stanley-career/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Richard Stanley</strong></a>. If anyone is going to convince you that magic exists, it is this man.</p>\n<p>Stanley&#8217;s latest, <em>Color Out of Space, </em>is also coming to Shudder this month. The film marks the director&#8217;s return to feature filmmaking after his self-imposed exile following the heartbreak of being elbowed off <em>The Island of Dr. </em><em>Moreau. </em>If you&#8217;re going to watch <em>Color Out of Space </em>(<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/color-out-of-space-review/\">which is&#8230;<em>fine</em></a>), <em>Lost Soul</em> is necessary and wildly entertaining context.</p>\n<p><strong>Available on Shudder beginning September 2nd.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Rob Zombie&#8217;s road trip from hell</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-356810 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/house-of-1000-corpses-sid-haig.jpg\" alt=\"horror streaming in september 2020 House Of Corpses Sid Haig\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/house-of-1000-corpses-sid-haig.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/house-of-1000-corpses-sid-haig-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/house-of-1000-corpses-sid-haig-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/house-of-1000-corpses-sid-haig-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Synopsis:<em> After four friends stumble across a horror-themed roadside attraction, the proprietor reluctantly directs them to the final resting place of Dr. Satan, a local legend renowned for his human experiments. En route, their car breaks down and the gang finds themselves at the Firefly residence in search of a phone. Sure enough, the whole thing was a setup, and the group is slowly tortured and sacrificed one-by-one (in order of who&#8217;s most annoying, of course). Oh, right, and it turns out that Dr. Satan is more than just a legend.</em></p>\n<p>I find <strong>Rob Zombie</strong> does his best work when he doesn&#8217;t take himself too seriously. And I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that <em><strong>House of 1000 Corpses</strong> </em>is an acquired taste. However, if you take it for what it is (an extraordinarily silly, stylish, and loving pastiche of &#8217;70s road-horrors), this film can blow your socks off. <em>House of 1000 Corpses</em> punctuates a major character death with a yodling ballad. There is a character named &#8220;Dr. Satan&#8221; for chrissakes. This film has an intentionally goofy gait, which invariably enables some of Zombie&#8217;s wackier flourishes. Luckily, <i>House of 1000 Corpses </i>is so obviously made with love, it&#8217;s hard not to nod along. Throw in some delightfully off the rails performances from Karen Black and the late Sid Haig and you&#8217;ve got yourself a one-way-ticket to camp town.</p>\n<p><strong>Leaves Hulu on September 30th.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>A delicious New-England folktale</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-356809 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-witch-blood.jpg\" alt=\"horror streaming in september 2020 The Witch Blood\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-witch-blood.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-witch-blood-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-witch-blood-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-witch-blood-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Synopsis: <em>Set in primeval 17th Century New England, a banished Puritan family sets up a farm by the edge of a definitely evil, remote forest. As the sinister occurrences begin to pile up, the family begins to unravel.</em></p>\n<p>There are two ways to watch <strong><em>The VVitch</em></strong>. The first is to revel in the astonishing atmosphere of <strong>Robert Eggers</strong>&#8216; feature film debut. The mounting paranoia, scapegoating, and (wait for it) scary goat-ing. Long live Black Phillip; we stan a legend. The second way to watch <em>The VVitch</em> is to turn the closed captioning on, which immediately diffuses all tension with such bangers as &#8220;spooky wind&#8221; and &#8220;ominous thud.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t watched <em>The Lighthouse </em>with closed captions yet, but if <em>The VVitch </em>is anything to go by, it shouldn&#8217;t disappoint. All told: <em>The VVitch </em>is a modern classic and one of the few examples of &#8220;elevated horror&#8221; (literally) making good on its promise.</p>\n<p><strong>Leaves Netflix on September 16th.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"tablepress-table-name tablepress-table-name-id-18\">Streamable Horror Incoming This Month</h2>\n\n<table id=\"tablepress-18\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-18\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Streaming Service</th><th class=\"column-2\">Movie</th><th class=\"column-3\">Date</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Amazon Prime</td><td class=\"column-2\">Die, Monster, Die!

Today, we&#8217;re watching a video that explores courtroom scenes.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The verdict is in: courtroom scenes <em>rule</em>.</p>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s the expert testimony of Mona Lisa Vito in <strong><em>My Cousin Vinny</em></strong>, Elle Woods teasing out a perm-related confession in <strong><em>Legally Blonde</em></strong>, or Col. Jessup blowing up on the witness stand in <strong><em>A Few Good Men</em></strong>, courtroom scenes are hotbeds of drama, tension, and high stakes storytelling.</p>\n<p>Courtroom scenes are also a great technical test in terms of staging. While different courtroom scenes have different dramatic needs, all courtroom scenes face the same obstacle. Namely: how to manage a big space full of a lot of characters with wildly different motivations. Spatially, courtrooms are vast, static arenas.</p>\n<p>Complicating matters, most audiences come to courtroom scenes with expectations of the legal song and dance. There&#8217;s an established order of proceedings, etiquette, and report that must be balanced with the narrative and visual needs of the story. So that&#8217;s the challenge for filmmakers: if the camera can be anywhere, and everywhere is interesting, what do you focus on?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the question at hand in the following video essay from <strong>Now You See It. </strong>With so many perspectives to explore, how does one convey a focused emotional and spatial understanding of the courtroom?

We&#8217;re used to attending in person in beautiful Montreal, Canada, but we&#8217;re excited to cover this fantastic festival virtually too. Our coverage of this year&#8217;s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/fantasia/\">Fantasia Festival</a> continues with our review of Anthony Scott Burns&#8217; Come True.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>There may only be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Basic_Plots\">seven basic story plots</a> in fiction and film, but there is a myriad of ways in which to tell them. While some stories unfold in a straight line, clear to viewers paying even the slightest attention, others require something more from audiences &#8212; attention, yes, but also a willingness to be led on an unexpected and atypical journey. <strong><em>Come True</em></strong> belongs in the latter camp as it takes what feels like a straightforward horror premise and instead delivers something far more ambitious, challenging, and exciting.</p>\n<p>Sarah (Julia Sarah Stone) is a young woman in distress. On the outs with her mother over some unspecified conflict, she spends her nights sleeping at a friend&#8217;s house or hidden away somewhere on the street. She&#8217;s also suffering from nightmares, and when an opportunity arrives addressing both issues she jumps at the chance. A small sleep study welcomes her in, and while they don&#8217;t reveal what it is exactly they&#8217;re studying, they do offer Sarah a safe, warm bed for the night. What she doesn&#8217;t know is that they&#8217;re testing a device that let&#8217;s them see a rough and fuzzy picture of what she&#8217;s dreaming &#8212; and it doesn&#8217;t portend well for any of them.</p>\n<p>The past few years have seen several horror films on the subject of sleep paralysis &#8212; <em>Dead Awake</em> (2016), <em>Slumber</em> (2017), <em>Mara</em> (2018) &#8212; with the second common element between them being that they&#8217;re pretty terrible. Part of the issue has been a dull, traditional approach to the topic, but the same can&#8217;t be said for writer/director Anthony Scott Burns&#8217; <em>Come True</em>. The film wisely keeps the sleep paralysis angle to the periphery for much of the running time and instead finds conflict, drama, and wonder elsewhere in Sarah&#8217;s journey. Once it does turn its attention back towards the sleep ailment it&#8217;s with fascinating ideas and observations. It&#8217;s as captivating as it is confusing at times, and it risks failing to satisfy with its tricky but daring denouement, but at least <em>Come True</em> is never dull.</p>\n<p>Sarah&#8217;s situation quickly endears her to viewers, and Burns punctuates her drama with brief, nightmarish visuals teasing something just beyond our understanding. This isn&#8217;t a film for jump-scare fans as it instead lets its unsettling imagery and dark wonders unfold far more methodically. The camera gives viewers a POV into Sarah&#8217;s dreams and moves us forward, away from safety and towards uncertainty. A figure awaits, but who or what it is sits continually outside our reach.</p>\n<p>Burns acts as his own cinematographer and, as he did with his phenomenal &#8220;Father&#8217;s Day&#8221; segment in 2016&#8217;s <em>Holidays</em>, he effortlessly creates an atmosphere of dreamy movement and intent. There are moments that thrill through aggression and terror, but the bulk of this journey is captured with a deceptive lack of focus. Don&#8217;t be fooled, though, as Burns knows exactly what he&#8217;s doing right up through an ending guaranteed to absolutely delight some genre fans while frustrating others. There&#8217;s a <em>Prince of Darkness</em> (1987) vibe to some of it, so it&#8217;s safe to say I land squarely with the delighted. The evocative synth score by Pilot Priest (Burns again!) and Electric Youth adds to the feeling of being pulled through an atmosphere thick with precarious reality.</p>\n<p>While many of the film&#8217;s threads are left intentionally vague and uncertain, only one risks being disturbing beyond the confines of the movie itself. Stone herself is in her twenties, but the character she&#8217;s playing is never given a specific age (unless I missed it, which is more than possible). The assumption, though, from the class we see her in to her and her friend living at home, is that she&#8217;s a teenager still in high school &#8212; which makes a mildly graphic sex scene she&#8217;s a part of more than a little off-putting. The only argument that she&#8217;s older is in the assumption that a sleep study wouldn&#8217;t allow a minor to participate. It&#8217;s not a deal-breaker, but some clarity here would have been beneficial.</p>\n<p><em>Come True</em> might not work in its entirety for some viewers, but it would be irresponsible to ignore its ambition and artistry in service of such a meticulous vision. It&#8217;s a film that sits with you, floating around in your brain for days and weeks after watching it, and that&#8217;s far too rare of a joy to pass by. Those on its wavelength are in for an exhilarating, perplexing, and sublime journey that&#8217;s as fresh in its execution as it is in its narrative. If the rest of you find yourself sleeping through it instead, well, good luck with that.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/zGZc4-fdC1g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 10:08:06 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e90d0196be76576b5048882e89d8cf3d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Rob Hunter","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/zGZc4-fdC1g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn14@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-37-29-321_5edfe243fdedf8e7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237439778},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:19","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:19","title":"The Sound of Trauma: The Aural Storytelling of ‘Jackie’","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=356787","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web. Today, we&#8217;re watching a video that explores sound in Pablo Larraín&#8217;s Jackie.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>At the end of the day, a movie is just two things: what we see and what we hear.</p>\n<p>The former tends to hog the bulk of attention. Images, after all, are immediate and assertive. They&#8217;re easier to describe in isolation, as is their impact on us as viewers. I can confidently gush about an amusing whip-pan, a heartbreaking long take, or an exhilarating crane shot. I can parse the narrative punch of thematic colors, cut-away close-ups, and evocative mise-en-scène.</p>\n<p>We tend to recall scenes and setpieces with visual touchstones. But for the untrained ear, sound has more subconscious rhythms. Its methods are less overt and more opaque, and sound design is often considered a success when it goes unnoticed. So it&#8217;s always a good reminder that, indeed, sound is working away in the wings. It plays a vital and complex role in how we digest stories.</p>\n<p>The video essay below offers a marvelous breakdown of the narrative power of sound, unpacking the aural elements of <strong>Pablo Larraín</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Jackie</em></strong>. The film follows Jackie Kennedy  (Natalie Portman) before, during, and after the assassination of her husband. And the essay unpacks how the film uses sound to impart the evolving grief, hope, and trauma of the former First Lady, from the alterations of her voice to the aural intimacy of nonverbal sounds and the emotional coloring of short motifs that unite moments of loneliness across the film.</p>\n<p>Watch &#8220;<strong>The Sound of <em>Jackie</em></strong>&#8220;<strong>:</strong></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"The Sound of JACKIE\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/225106434?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n<p><strong>Oswald Iten</strong> is a Swiss freelance illustrator, animator, and film critic.

They have movies, too, though, and more than a few of them are gems that make Hulu a destination beyond last night’s TV shows. The complete list of new movies and shows available to stream on Hulu for September 2020 is below, but I wanted to highlight the best of the bunch along with several others worth seeking out.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Hulu Pick of the Month for September 2020</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-356852\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pen15.jpg\" alt=\"The girls of Pen15\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pen15.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pen15-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pen15-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pen15-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>I typically reserve this spot for movies as films &#62; shows more often than not, but the return of one of last year&#8217;s best new series deserves to be highlighted. <strong><em>Pen15: Complete Season 2</em></strong> (Hulu Original) arrives on 9/18 with all the awkward, uncomfortable, highly relatable comedy intact. Leads and co-creators Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle return as middle-schoolers &#8212; acting opposite actual teens and pre-teens &#8212; and their show is as hilarious as it is heartbreakingly honest.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Second Chances</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-356853\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gemini-man.jpg\" alt=\"Will Smith in Gemini Man\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gemini-man.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gemini-man-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gemini-man-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gemini-man-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Look, I get it. All the tech talk about 60 frames per second weirded you out. And the reviews were especially harsh (outside of <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/gemini-man-review/\">our own</a>). But I&#8217;m suggesting you give <strong><em>Gemini Man</em></strong> (2019) a second chance starting on 9/18. Will Smith and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are having a great time, and you will too as Ang Lee delivers some terrific action sequences. Sure the plot is familiar, but so what. Enjoy the visual splendor and gunplay.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>&#8217;70s Cinema</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-356854\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-mechanic.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Bronson in The Mechanic\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-mechanic.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-mechanic-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-mechanic-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-mechanic-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Ah, the 70s. Unlike Netflix, Hulu brings on more than one &#8220;older&#8221; film each month, and here are three worth highlighting. <strong><em>The Last House on the Left</em></strong> (1972) isn&#8217;t among my favorite Wes Craven films (I actually prefer the remake), but it was a game-changer for him and the indie horror genre. <strong><em>The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane</em></strong> (1976) isn&#8217;t nearly as well known, but little Jodie Foster delivers another stunner of a child-performance against a creepy Martin Sheen making for a compelling thriller. And finally, <strong><em>The Mechanic</em></strong> (1972) received a lesser remake that can&#8217;t touch this original &#8212; Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent as two hitmen are gold.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>&#8217;80s Antics</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-356855\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/criminal-law.jpg\" alt=\"Big hair in Criminal Law\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/criminal-law.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/criminal-law-768x576.jpg 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/criminal-law-160x120.jpg 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/criminal-law-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Get a load of that hair in <strong><em>Criminal Law</em></strong> (1988)! Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon play opposite each other in this grim, suspenseful tale of a serial killer and a criminal justice system he&#8217;s mastered. Chuck Norris headlines <strong><em>Invasion U.S.A.</em></strong> (1985), but don&#8217;t hold that against it. The film delivers some over the top Cannon fun that absolutely wouldn&#8217;t get green-lit today.

A car your dad bragged about owning in the &#8217;70s. Dudes with long hair. Bell-bottom jeans. And pot. So much pot. That’s our introduction to </span><b>Richard Linklater</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s cult-classic reflection of Austin in the summer of &#8217;76. The dreamy mix of lethargic, cinema verité-style interactions. The fanciful, idealized versions of a past that is often met with conflicting sentiments of romanticism and criticism. That is <strong><em>Dazed and Confused</em></strong>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The film t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">akes place on the last day of school for the students of Lee High. It&#8217;s a time when the older kids ritualistically get ready for their senior year by violently hazing wide-eyed, soon-to-be-freshmen. Those junior-high grads burst with excitement &#8212; for better or for worse &#8212; at the prospect of finally joining this otherworldly cosmos also known as the American High School scene. “School’s Out” by Alice Cooper plays as students joyously race down the hallways in anticipation of what will hopefully be a sex-drugs-and-rock-and-roll-filled summer. And anyone who&#8217;s experienced that last-day-of-school rush can agree: as far as the sensation of nostalgia goes, this moment always takes first prize. </span></p>\n<p>In <em>Dazed and Confused</em>, Linklater feeds on audiences&#8217; desire for that nostalgia by presenting a romanticized version of the past. But, at the same time, he subverts the common theme to emphasize the importance of change. Indeed, his characters indulge in the tropes of the &#8217;70s, yet when you look closer, there’s more to the film than meets the eye. And at the end of <em>Dazed and Confused</em>, you’ll inevitably come away with a sense that, more important than a penchant for the past, there is a commitment to moving forward.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American media has long capitalized on audiences’ infatuation with nostalgia. <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/best-coming-of-age-movies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coming-of-age films</a> like <em>Stand by Me</em> (1986) and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sandlot</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (also released in 1993 just six months ahead of <em>Dazed and Confused</em>) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">captivate us because we miss the simpler, more adventurous years of our childhoods. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linklater grips onto the unique emotional experience that accompanies such longing in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dazed and Confused</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the result offers insight into nostalgia’s role in our society, with all of its problems and its positives alike. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What ultimately makes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dazed and Confused </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so rich with nostalgia is the fact that, at its core, it </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a film about an affirmation of traditional values. Although the film begins with the filtering out of the “old,” via the inevitable seasonal cycle of high school, it also begins with the matriculation of the “new,” with the incoming freshmen bound to repeat the same mistakes and successes as their predecessors. We see this in the hazing rituals: senior boys beat freshman boys with paddles; senior girls humiliate freshman girls with pacifiers and condiments. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dreamy and idealized atmosphere of the film might indicate that, in some sense, there isn’t really anything wrong with what is being portrayed. The bad accompanies the good; every little newcomer has to pay his or her dues. And, from one perspective, this is problematic: perhaps Linklater should have offered more of a critique of this callous behavior. But, on the other hand, it’s important to be honest about the past, for better or for worse. Sugarcoating doesn’t do anyone any good. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s more, although </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dazed and Confused</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might cement these problematic perspectives at times, Linklater makes sure to end the film by boldly stating that, yes, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">there is hope in the future</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. We can argue that the reason this film in particular captures our need for nostalgia has to do with it being a high school film. High school is the last time in our lives when we don’t have a clear conception of the world, and &#8212; still &#8212; anything is possible. That is likely why it is often coined “the best years of our lives.” So, through this trip down memory lane, we can capture that wistful, heartwarming glance back at the past, while simultaneously looking toward the future. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The title of the film itself, adapted from a Led Zeppelin song that came out a couple of years before </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dazed and Confused</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is set, offers additional insight into this strange, liminal state: to be “dazed and confused” is to exist in a dreamlike mode with no concept of what’s around you. This offers some insight into the hazing process depicted, too. The rising seniors know that their time of being dazed and confused will be up when the year is over &#8212; their years in nirvana will soon reach their end. And so, the jaded torture the innocent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitch Kramer (</span>Wiley Wiggins<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), an incoming freshman, is an unlikely candidate for the “cool kid,” to say the least. He’s small, shy, and quiet. He’s nothing like Randall “Pink” Floyd (</span>Jason London<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), the handsome, charismatic star quarterback, or even O’Bannion (</span>Ben Affleck<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), the commanding school bully. But his admiration of the older kids indicates that he would like to be. These are our high school “stars,” and, as far as the world of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dazed and Confused</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is concerned, Mitch doesn’t have a spot anywhere near that crowd; he’s probably better suited with the resident “nerds,” Mike (</span>Adam Goldberg<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), Tony (</span>Anthony Rapp<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), and Cynthia (</span>Marissa Ribisi<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, at the end of the film, Mitch comes home in the early morning still buzzed from the shenanigans of the night before, and he lies in bed listening to “Slow Ride” by Foghat with his over-ear headphones. He smiles. He’s made it. The future is his, and he already has fond memories to look back on. And he’s not Randall, and he’s not O’Bannion. He’s Mitch. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we have a penchant for nostalgia, looking to the past can be a good thing, but sticking to it can’t possibly be. We have no choice but to move forward. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is exemplified best in the iconic character of Wooderson (</span>Matthew McConaughey), a much older guy who still hangs around with the high school kids. High school was obviously his heyday, but he sticks out like a sore thumb, and when he hits on young girls, it’s creepy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linklater went on to make another nostalgia period piece more than two decades years later with the 1980s-set college baseball film </span><b><i>Everybody Wants Some!!</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which largely delivers the same message in a different time period: the film’s hero, Jake (</span>Blake Jenner<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), spends the entirety of the film feeding into stereotypes of the time and attempting desperately to fit in. But ultimately he realizes, like Mitch, that he needs to make his own way in the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it’s safe to say, then, that Linklater is absolutely an advocate for all things Aerosmith and big-hair. But he’s also an advocate for breaking the mold and not clinging too fiercely onto the past. </span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/l_qCOaIFHbQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 11:16:59 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6e16f04370eac1692fb629318c44d24e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Aurora Amidon","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/l_qCOaIFHbQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn28@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-29-437_f2db18f8deea6219.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237439778},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:19","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:19","title":"Disney’s ‘Mulan’ Balances the Epic and the Intimate","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=356933","description":"<p>Remakes are always tricky business, as filmmakers must decide how faithful they want to be to the original. It&#8217;s even more of a challenge when you&#8217;re retelling not just a single film but a familiar tale known to generations around the world. The story of <em>Mulan</em> is best-known to many as a 1998 animated film from Disney, but the legend has been shared for centuries, both in and out of China where it originates. It&#8217;s been told on-screen via live-action as recently as 2009&#8217;s <em>Mulan: Rise of a Warrior</em>, and now Disney has returned with their own live-action epic remake titled, simply, <strong><em>Mulan</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>A ruthless band of warriors leaves a trail of carnage and carcasses throughout China, and the emperor decrees the mandatory military service of one male from each family. Gifted only with a wife and two daughters, elderly veteran Zhou (<strong>Tzi Ma</strong>) answers the call, but before he can report for duty his eldest, Mulan (<strong>Liu Yifei</strong>), beats him to it. Dressed and bound like a man, she takes her father&#8217;s armor and sword and heads to war. Combat skills, of which she&#8217;s undeniably gifted, are championed among the new trainees, but the military leaders make it clear that honor and honesty are every bit as important. As the battle draws closer to home, Mulan is forced to decide if lying about who she really is serves a greater purpose&#8230; or if there&#8217;s no greater purpose than being true to yourself.</p>\n<p>The Disney empire&#8217;s continued effort to bring each of their animated hits to live-action life continues with <em>Mulan</em>, and it&#8217;s easily one of their most accomplished and affecting efforts to date. It&#8217;s more <em>The Jungle Book</em> (2016) than <em>The Lion King</em> (2019) in that it&#8217;s both quite good and not the first live-action version of the tale to hit screens. But unlike both of those films, its success rests squarely on the shoulders of human characters rather than chatty animals. Happily, the humans both in front of and behind the camera are more than up to the task at hand.</p>\n<p>The two women deserving of the most immediate credit are director <strong>Niki Caro</strong> and lead Liu. Caro revisits the promise and themes of her breakout film, 2002&#8217;s <em>Whale Rider</em>, with this tale of a young woman fighting against sexist expectations and traditions. She&#8217;s working on a far larger scale, but she does a fantastic job marrying the epic nature of battle scenes, stunts, and special effects with the more intimate character moments between Mulan and those around her. Caro and the film&#8217;s four credited writers (Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Elizabeth Martin, Lauren Hynek) bring nothing new really to the already familiar story, but they succeed in delivering perhaps its most thrilling and affecting adaptation.</p>\n<p>Liu is a central part of that as she&#8217;s tasked with convincing viewers of both her emotional journey of self-discovery and her bad-assery. The latter is accomplished through athletic skill, appealing choreography, and elaborate wire-work. The former, though, is all Liu. We see her struggle early on to meet the standards expected of young women &#8212; a wife must be silent and invisible &#8212; and she doesn&#8217;t take her intentional deception lightly. She&#8217;s conflicted, and Liu&#8217;s performance makes it clear that Mulan is a woman who values family and honor at the detriment of her own truth. Her dawning realization and subsequent turning point are effective and affecting while still feeling subtle and personal. It&#8217;s an epic tale, but much of the journey is hers alone.</p>\n<p>While Liu gets the emotional beats and narrative arc, the supporting cast is equally strong starting with Ma as Mulan&#8217;s father. The two only share scenes that bookend the film, but their chemistry and bond are undeniable. The same can&#8217;t necessarily be said for <strong>Yoson An</strong> as Mulan&#8217;s potential love interest, but thankfully the film minimizes that angle and allows mutual respect to build between them instead. <strong>Donnie Yen</strong> appears as Commander Tung and reminds the world just how charismatic and physically capable he is, <strong>Jet Li</strong> shows up as the emperor, <strong>Jason Scott Lee</strong> delivers with an intense lead villain, and Disney&#8217;s OG Mulan, <strong>Ming Na-Wen</strong>, even pops in for a quick cameo. <strong>Gong Li</strong> stands out with a wonderfully conflicted turn as a witch tasked with aiding the villains, and she manages to be an impressively imposing presence with an emotional arc.</p>\n<p>While not the first live-action adaptation of the tale, Disney&#8217;s film is certainly the most epic (read expensive-looking). The production design, costumes, and period detail help create a captivating world, and the landscapes, both real and realized, add to the grandeur. From the architecture to the advancing armies, the film&#8217;s visuals are striking, energetic, and colorful. Some of the early wire-work seems a bit janky, but like Mulan herself, it finds its footing in battle and thrilling action set-pieces. The CG adds depth to the landscapes but is kept to a relative minimum up close &#8212; it&#8217;s used to erase more elements than it is to add them &#8212; with only a handful of exceptions usually involving Gong Li&#8217;s costume changes (and species swaps).</p>\n<p>As mentioned, <em>Mulan</em> doesn&#8217;t really bring much new to the table even as it delivers a powerful lesson in female empowerment. The story hews closely to its animated predecessor but jettisons the songs which even die-hard fans won&#8217;t miss here when the visuals, themes, and <strong>Harry Gregson-Williams</strong>&#8216; score are every bit as dazzling.

Today, we&#8217;re watching a video about the movie Bronson.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">There is a delicious paradox about hypermasculinity. If you tilt your head the right way, macho trappings can, and often do, read as effeminate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">A marvelous example of this is last year&#8217;s <strong><em>True History of the Kelly Gang</em></strong>, a re-telling of the life and crimes of Australia&#8217;s most famous outlaw, Ned Kelly. The film doesn&#8217;t shy away from the ambiguous flavor of Kelly&#8217;s real-life antics. These included, among other things, wearing dresses to frighten his opponents. The film leans further into Kelly&#8217;s ambiguous persona by intentionally blurring fact and fiction and introducing a gaze that frequently challenges its ostensibly hyper-masculine subject. </span></p>\n<p>If I were to place another film into this subversive subgenre it would, of course, be <em><strong>Bronson.</strong></em> Another biography of a campy criminal, <strong>Nicolas Winding Refn</strong>&#8216;s film paints a portrait of Michael Peterson, a.k.a. Charles Bronson (as portrayed by <strong>Tom Hardy</strong>), Britain&#8217;s most famous, and most violent, prisoner.</p>\n<p>As the video essay below explains, <em>Bronson</em> is a prison film that brazenly upends the conventions of its own genre. Even (and perhaps especially) behind bars, Bronson is always in control of his own story, interrupting the narrative with vignettes, asides, and even drag performances. Rather than a static victim of an oppressive system, <em>Bronson</em> offers a slippery and intangible protagonist, deviating from the macho code and embracing a queer gaze with disarming results. By unsettling all of its assumed trappings, the film, like its subject, becomes an outsider in its own genre. It&#8217;s a fitting ambiguity for a character at his freest behind bars.</p>\n<p>Watch &#8220;<strong><em>Bronson: </em>A Subversion of the Conventions of the Prison Film</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Bronson: A Subversion of the Conventions of the Prison Film\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/118152112?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"700\" height=\"376\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n<p class=\"p4\">Observant and whip-smart, the Glasgow-based <strong>Jessica McGoff</strong> is a worthy watch.

The setup of a couple who&#8217;ve been dating six or seven weeks embarking on a little road trip seems simple enough, but it is anything but. The further into the blizzard they travel, the more bizarre the journey becomes.</p>\n<p>The literal story on-screen involves an unnamed young woman &#8212; she is literally credited as &#8220;Young Woman&#8221; (played by Jessie Buckley) &#8212; who agrees to a short trip with her boyfriend, Jake (Jesse Plemons), to meet his parents at their family farm. The snowfall rages on around them as they slowly drive in the middle of nowhere. “I’m thinking of ending things,” she repeats over and over again to herself, as she contemplates the doomed relationship.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just the narrator who sees the lack of chemistry between herself and Jake. Road trips force conversation; and their attempt at discussion is contrived and awkward. Jake asks her if she would like to listen to some music and turns on the radio. A woman’s singing voice and passé music can be heard through the car speakers. The Young Woman laughs and Jake looks at her. “It&#8217;s an odd song out here in the middle of nothing,” she says.</p>\n<p>The tune is &#8220;Many a New Day,&#8221; from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical <a href=\"https://stageagent.com/shows/musical/322/oklahoma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong><em>Oklahoma!</em></strong></a>, and it&#8217;s the first major clue to understanding the film. Jake reveals to his girlfriend that he likes musicals, but <em>Oklahoma!</em> is the one he knows best because &#8220;they do it every few years.&#8221; When the Young Woman inquires whom he is talking about, Jake continues to ramble on.</p>\n<p>The movie cuts to an older man (Guy Boyd), who is quietly sweeping a high school auditorium while students on stage rehearse the same song that is heard by the couple in the car. The janitor looks on until the student playing the female lead, Laurey, notices his gaze. A slight tinge of disgust stretches across her face as she continues singing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Many a new face will please my eye,</em><br />\n<em>Many a new love will find me.</em><br />\n<em>Never have I once looked back to sigh,</em><br />\n<em>Over the romance behind me.</em></p>\n<p>Back in the car, the couple listens for a second before discussing the lyrics, which are overly optimistic (in the song, Laurey is claiming to not care about her true love, Curly, leaving open a chance for another beau, who turns out to be the loner, Jud Fry). Following the lyrics provides a guide for how the musical&#8217;s characters perceive life, which contrasts with the Young Woman&#8217;s current thoughts. “That’s why I like road trips,” he says. “It&#8217;s good to remind yourself the world’s larger than the inside of your own head.”</p>\n<p>A little more driving leads the small sedan to the house. Before going inside, Jake insists on taking his girlfriend to the barn where he shows her some frozen dead lambs and the aftermath of some pigs that were eaten alive by maggots. Romantic date, if you ask me.</p>\n<p>Finally, they go inside. Jake puts on a record as they wait for his parents to come downstairs. The music inspires the movie to cut back to the janitor who is walking through the halls of the school with his cart, past a long row of lockers, before coming upon two students who are rehearsing a dance duet. The costumes include a cowboy hat and a prairie dress, indicating the same production of <em>Oklahoma!</em> as before. The moment is shadowed with longing for human connection from a man who has been shunned by a majority of the humans around him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Many a new face will please my eye. </em></p>\n<p>As if the tension inside this cinematic universe wasn’t as thick as a good buttercream icing, everything becomes more outlandish the moment Jake’s parents appear on screen. His mother (Toni Collette) is loud and overly doting towards her son, and his father (David Thewlis) enjoys hinting that he was once good at athletics, unlike his offspring. As the chaos heightens during dinner, Jake’s mood becomes more hostile to the other three characters. At one point, he becomes so irate that he slams his fists on the table. The lack of unity within Jake’s family is obvious, with the frustrated son being the misunderstood outcast.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Many a new love will find me.</em></p>\n<p>Jake’s attitude isn’t the only detail that is inconsistent. The young girl’s outfit changes as constantly as her profession or her name. Is she Lucy or Louisa or Amy? Is she a painter, a poet, a physicist? And what about Jake’s parents?</p>\n<p>After dessert, the Young Woman walks up the stairs to find Jake and instead finds his childhood bedroom. Inside, she notices an urn with a picture of a dog, Jimmy, the one she just saw downstairs. The camera follows her gaze as she turns to the corner where stacks of books, videotapes, and DVDs include a light green edition of Wordsworth’s work, the film review collection <em>For Keeps</em> by Pauline Kael, and several self-labeled items that include “Unforgettable Mishaps” and “Last/Abandoned Friendships.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Never have I once looked back to sigh,</em></p>\n<p>The exploration inside Jake’s childhood room is soon interrupted by his father, who is older than before and struggling with dementia. Downstairs, Jake’s mother can barely sit up due to her old age and is now in need of spoon-feeding. Then, the next time she appears, she is young and complaining about Baby Jake’s toys being left all over the place. The non-linear use of time and age is jarring, and the Young Woman is just as confused as those of us who made it this far into the movie. “I don’t even know who I am in this whole thing anymore,” she says to herself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Over the romance behind me.</em></p>\n<p>Behind the scratched up door that leads to the basement is another important piece to understanding how all of this mess fits together. The young woman walks down the stairs and looks inside the washing machine to find multiple pieces of work clothing, all marked with a logo. This is the same logo seen on the uniform of the unexplained janitor who&#8217;s been appearing in intercut moments. Suddenly it&#8217;s clear: the main events are all a part of Jake’s psyche.</p>\n<p>The farmhouse does not exist, and the Young Woman doesn’t exist either, at least not in the realm of physical reality. What has been experienced so far is a catalog of Jake’s pain, traumas, knowledge, inspirations, and memories. Ultimately, it is a reflection of his forced reclusion and the inability for anyone around him to embrace his individuality.</p>\n<p>The Young Woman is made up of parts from several past and probably failed relationships or romantic interactions that are glued together with what Jake perceives a perfect partner to be. This explains why neither her name nor her occupation is consistent and why she is made up of poetry, Pauline Kael&#8217;s movie reviews, and facts that he enjoys along with the qualities he lacks. Her outsider perspective shows Jake’s own self-consciousness, insecurity, and inability to find success in any friendship or relationship with another human being. He is the stereotypical loser. She is a musical, a spectacular performance of gleeful show tunes and choreography in his mind.</p>\n<p>As if the story up until the final moments isn&#8217;t enough of a surrealist maze, the last twenty minutes are hypnagogic. Dancers dressed exactly like the young couple dances a slow, poetic ballet around the high school, really bringing home that <em>Oklahoma!</em> thread that Kaufman has stitched throughout. In the musical, dream versions of the main characters, Curly and Laurey, appear and dance a spectacular ballet sequence. The artistic rendition includes a wedding that is interrupted by Jud Fry, the outcast who is in love with Laurey. The same beats happen in this ballet interpretation, but Jake, the lonely janitor, is the outcast who comes in after the bride and groom say “I do.”</p>\n<p><em>Oklahoma!</em> is again referenced in the final scene. Young Jake in full old age stage makeup appears in front of a full auditorium as he accepts an award. The set around him on the stage &#8212; a field of corn and a windmill, surrounded by a white picket fence and a farmhouse &#8212; looks ready for the very musical to start at any moment.</p>\n<p>As Jake looks out into the crowd of people, who are also made up in old age stage makeup, he states, “I’m only here tonight because of you. You are the reason I am. You are all my reasons.” While the camera seems to focus on a figure who appears like the Young Woman from the road trip, the other familiar faces in the audience stand-in for other aspects that have molded Jake throughout his life.</p>\n<p>A prop set that is recognized as a rendition of Jake’s childhood bedroom from earlier is rolled out onto the stage. And then, he sings. Of course, Jake doesn’t just sing any song. He sings &#8220;Lonely Room,&#8221; the solo number that Jud Fry sings in the stage version of <em>Oklahoma! </em>(if you&#8217;ve only seen the movie version, you might not be familiar with it) about how he&#8217;s going to make Laurey his girl.</p>\n<p>Met with a standing ovation, Jake sobs. He has completed his performance.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/nggL_fKdNt8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 11:16:35 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"99133959775356130e83ec3aabb85515","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Shea Vassar","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/nggL_fKdNt8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-37-29-343_27fc5cfe90bd66a9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237439779},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:19","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:19","title":"How TCM’s ‘Women Make Film’ Makes Up for Film Education’s Exclusivity","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=356816","description":"<p><strong>Mark Cousins</strong>&#8216; extensive fourteen-hour documentary <strong><em>Women Make Film </em></strong>receives the showcase it deserves courtesy of <strong>Turner Classic Movies</strong> starting the first week of September. As part of a four-month-long program, the documentary has been split into episodes focused on different aspects of filmmaking, and it feels like the most exciting lecture you could ever have in film school. If only any film school was so exhaustive. Fortunately, TCM has been educating viewers on film history for years, and this new program expands that reach to filmmakers who tend to be left out by most curriculums.</p>\n<p>Cousins&#8217; concept for <em>Women Make Film </em>is to take audiences on a road trip through cinema by exploring film theory and filmmaking techniques using only clips from <a href=\"https://womenmakefilm.tcm.com/filmmakers/\">movies made by women</a>, including <strong>Claire Denis</strong>&#8216; <em><strong>Beau Travail</strong> </em>(1999) and <strong>Vera Chytilová</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Daisies </em></strong>(1966), as examples. With lovely narration by <strong>Tilda Swinton</strong>, <strong>Jane Fonda</strong>, <strong>Sharmila Tagore</strong>, and others (rather than Cousins doing voiceover himself as usual), aspects of filmmaking normally limited to formal film school courses are discussed in an accessible, yet fascinating way. And women who are usually left out of documentaries about movies and moviemaking are given the spotlight they&#8217;ve never received before.</p>\n<p>Beyond seeing the clips that are featured in the documentary, viewers also get a chance to see one-hundred movies from among those highlighted in the series in their entirety via TCM. <span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">For many of the slated movies, this will be their first time on the cable channel.</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">And some of the films, such as <strong>Ana Mariscal</strong>&#8216;s </span><em style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\"><strong>El Camino</strong></em> (1963), <span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\"><strong>Nadine Trintignant</strong>&#8216;s </span><strong><em style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">Crime </em></strong><i><strong>Thief </strong></i>(1969), and <strong>Gilda de Abreu</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>O Ebrio </em></strong>(1946), will be making their US debut during this programming. <span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">Hosts <strong>Alicia Malone</strong> and <strong>Jacqueline Stewart</strong> will be showing up between episodes and films with talks featuring special guest filmmakers, as well. </span><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\">This in-depth look at the process of filmmaking will educate its audience while also exposing them to movies they may have never heard of let alone seen before.</span></p>\n<p>While the documentary is comprised of only movies directed by women, the works are showcased and discussed independently of the context of their director&#8217;s gender. Cousins doesn&#8217;t insert that perspective into the consideration of a specific scene or camera technique but rather just appreciates each film for how impressive it is in general, regardless of who made it. The focus is always on the films themselves. Often when we talk about movies made by women, we make the distinction between cinema made by women and just cinema. But that&#8217;s not the case here.</p>\n<p>As Sydney Urbanek points out in her essay <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-muff-society/4-ways-film-schools-can-do-more-for-female-students-606fc76f85e6\">4 Ways Film Schools Can Do More for Female Students</a>, most film programs around the US limit their attention to women filmmakers to an elective course. (There is a similar distancing between English language movies and those dubbed &#8220;international films&#8221; as well.) Separating filmmakers like <strong>Ava DuVernay</strong> or <strong>Ida Lupino</strong> from the core classes in filmmaking further isolates their great movies from the legends that always occupy film classes. It makes learning about them supplemental to general film knowledge when they are also key figures to the understanding of cinema. In some ways, that distinction can separate the work that women do from the filmmaking industry as a whole and makes them an outlier.</p>\n<p>The documentary mentions the filmmakers in context to their movies, but its main focus is on how their work exemplifies an aspect of moviemaking. This helps us understand how films work since movies made by women like <strong>Kelly Reichardt</strong>, <strong>Larisa Shepitko</strong>, and <strong>Lizzie Borden</strong> can show how films are produced just as well a movie made by anyone else. Each chapter of the documentary revolves around one part of filmmaking, from framing a shot to building relationships between characters. Using scenes from such movies as <strong>Barbara Loden</strong>&#8216;s <em><strong>Wanda</strong> </em>(1970) and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/daughters-of-the-dust-color-theory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Julie Dash</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Daughters of the Dust</em></strong></a> (1991), the documentary connects these filmmaking tools with how they are achieved in these movies. There is little to no comparison to how the tools are used in movies made by women versus movies made by men. This puts the emphasis on the work itself, just like when we talk about a movie made by a man.</p>\n<p>Movies made by men have long been the blueprint for how films are made, for future filmmakers to learn the basics. It&#8217;s unlikely for someone to go through an introductory course about film without hearing about how <em>Casablanca </em>is an example of subtextual dialogue or how Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut spearheaded the French New Wave. These examples are worthy of recognition, of course, but they don&#8217;t have to be the only examples that we use. We could easily use <strong>Dorothy Arzner</strong> when discussing subtext in early Hollywood or <strong>Agnès Varda</strong> when talking about the creation of the French New Wave. By always mentioning the typical classics when explaining how movies are made, we never leave room for movies made by women or other minorities to be the learning example for filmmaking. It also erases the innovations that female filmmakers like <strong>Alice Guy Blaché</strong> and <strong>Leni Reifenstahl</strong> are responsible for, which garner just as much recognition in the grand scheme of film history.</p>\n<p><em>Women Make Film </em>shows that movies made by women, including <strong>Maya Deren</strong>&#8216;s <em><strong>Meshes of the Afternoon</strong> </em>(1943) and <strong>Wanuri Kahiu</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Rafiki </em></strong>(2018), can show the filmmaking process in its entirety on their own. The documentary takes the audience through every step of the narrative process, as well as highlights of specific concentrations in filmmaking and numerous genres. If it is able to cover so much with only movies made by women, then those women can hold a place in regular film education as well.</p>\n<p>Another way this documentary outshines conventional film education is how accessible it is to the general public. TCM has long been the best place to get acquainted with classic Hollywood cinema. Hosts provide historical context for the movies they show and go beyond just scheduling the classics. The programming of select films surrounding <em>Women Make Film </em>is yet another effort from TCM to bring film history to the everyday viewer. There are special programs that go beyond the regular programming, including Silent Sundays, Noir Alley, and the cult films of TCM Underground. Since <em>Women Make Film </em>is a documentary that hinges on teaching film in an accessible and new way, it fits perfectly on TCM.</p>\n<p>We need to look beyond the conventional places for movies made by women in order to include them in film education. Similarly, we also need to educate in places not normally viewed as venues for film education in order to include a wider variety of future filmmakers. While women make up about fifty percent of film school graduates, not everyone considering making movies or even just fascinated by cinema can access those college programs.</p>\n<p>By showing and explaining the filmmaking process through a television program, this documentary takes away the exclusivity of film education that was put into place to keep minorities like women out of the industry. Hopefully, the wider reach that <em>Women Make Film</em> can have, by airing on TV, will mean it can inspire those left out of typical avenues of film education and encourage the making of more movies like <strong>Li Shaohong</strong>&#8216;s <em><strong>Stolen Life</strong> </em>(2005) or <strong>Jacqueline Audry</strong>&#8216;s <strong><em>Olivia </em></strong>(1951).</p>\n<p><em>Women Make Film </em>will captivate anyone interested in a greater understanding of movies, but the programming that TCM has created around it elevates it to a level comparable to other avenues of learning about film. Film educators around the world should take note of what this program does and what their own education is lacking if they want to improve on the ways we not only make films but how we cultivate filmmakers as well.</p>\n<p>TCM will air each episode of <em>Women Make Film </em>on Tuesdays starting on September 1st. You can view the whole schedule of episodes and movies <a href=\"https://womenmakefilm.tcm.com/schedule/\">here</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/mg81F0MxQaw\"
