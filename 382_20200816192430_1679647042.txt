But after learning about the new company Elon Musk was starting, I’ve come to realize that that’s exactly what he’s trying to do.</p> \n<p>When I wrote about <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tesla</a> and <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SpaceX</a>, I learned that you can only fully wrap your head around certain companies by zooming both way, way in <em>and</em> way, way out. In, on the technical challenges facing the engineers, out on the existential challenges facing our species. In on a snapshot of the world right now, out on the big story of how we got to this moment and what our far future could look like.</p> \n<p>Not only is Elon’s new venture—Neuralink—the same type of deal, but six weeks after first learning about the company, I’m convinced that it somehow manages to eclipse Tesla and SpaceX in both the boldness of its engineering undertaking and the grandeur of its mission. The other two companies aim to redefine what future humans will do—Neuralink wants to redefine what future humans will <em>be</em><em>.</em></p> \n<p>The mind-bending <em>bigness </em>of Neuralink’s mission, combined with the labyrinth of impossible complexity that is the human brain, made this the hardest set of concepts yet to fully wrap my head around—but it also made it the most exhilarating when, with enough time spent zoomed on both ends, it all finally <em>clicked</em>. I feel like I took a time machine to the future, and I’m here to tell you that it’s even weirder than we expect.</p> \n<p>But before I can bring you in the time machine to show you what I found, we need to get in our zoom machine—because as I learned the hard way, Elon’s wizard hat plans cannot be properly understood until your head’s in the right place.</p> \n<p>So wipe your brain clean of what it thinks it knows about itself and its future, put on soft clothes, and let’s jump into the vortex.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-size: 20pt;\">Contents</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#part1\">Part 1: The Human Colossus</a> </strong></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#part2\">Part 2: The Brain</a> </strong></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#part3\">Part 3: Brain-Machine Interfaces</a> </strong></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#part4\">Part 4: Neuralink’s Challenge</a> </strong></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#part5\">Part 5: The Wizard Era</a></strong></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><a name=\"part1\"></a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#part6\">Part 6: The Great Merger</a> </strong></span></p> \n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6480 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Notes-Key.png\" alt=\"Notes key: Type 1 are fun notes for fun facts, extra thoughts, or further explanation.

allowed it to collect important information from the world around it—like where there were objects, predators, or food—and pass that information along, through a big game of telephone, to all parts of its body.

So instead of arranging themselves in a net shape, the flatworm’s nervous system all revolved around a central highway of messenger nerves that would pass messages back and forth between the boss and everyone else:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-1-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6377\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-1-2.jpg 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-1-2-300x220.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-1-2-768x563.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-1-2-600x440.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-2-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6378\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-2-2.jpg 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-2-2-300x220.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-2-2-768x563.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Flatworm-brain-2-2-600x440.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The flatworm’s boss-highway system was the world’s first central nervous system, and the boss in the flatworm’s head was the world’s first brain.</p> \n<p>The idea of a nervous system boss quickly caught on with others, and soon, there were thousands of species on Earth with brains.</p> \n<p>As time passed and Earth’s animals started inventing intricate new body systems, the bosses got busier.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/frog-1-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6320 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/frog-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"246\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/frog-1-1.png 404w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/frog-1-1-300x288.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" /></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-1-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6368\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-1-1.jpg 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-1-1-300x220.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-1-1-768x563.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-1-1-600x440.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-2-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6460\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-2-2.jpg 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-2-2-300x220.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-2-2-768x563.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frog-brain-2-2-600x440.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p>A little while later came the arrival of mammals. For the Millennials of the Animal Kingdom, life was complicated. Yes, their hearts needed to beat and their lungs needed to breathe, but mammals were about a lot more than survival functions—they were in touch with complex feelings like love, anger, and fear.</p> \n<p>For the reptilian brain, which had only had to deal with reptiles and other simpler creatures so far, mammals were just…a lot. So a second boss developed in mammals to pair up with the reptilian brain and take care of all of these new needs—the world’s first limbic system.</p> \n<p><a

the point where it could understand that even though the sound “rock” was not <em>itself</em> a rock, it could be used as a <em>symbol</em> of a rock—it was a sound that <em>referred</em> to a rock. The early human had invented language.</p> \n<p>Soon there were words for all kinds of things, and by 50,000 BC, humans were speaking in full, complex language with each other.</p> \n<p>The neocortex had turned humans into magicians. Not only had he made the human head a wondrous internal ocean of complex thoughts, his latest breakthrough had found a way to translate those thoughts into a symbolic set of sounds and send them vibrating through the air into the heads of other humans, who could then decode the sounds and absorb the embedded idea into their own internal thought oceans. The human neocortex had been thinking about things for a long time—and he finally had someone to talk about it all with.</p> \n<p>A neocortex party ensued. Neocortexes—fine—neocortices shared everything with each other—stories from their past, funny jokes they had thought of, opinions they had formed, plans for the future.</p> \n<p>But most useful was sharing what they had <em>learned</em>. If one human learned through trial and error that a certain type of berry led to 48 hours of your life being run by diarrhea, they could use language to share the hard-earned lesson with the rest of their tribe, like photocopying the lesson and handing it to everyone else. Tribe members would then use language to pass along that lesson to their children, and their children would pass it to their own children. Rather than the same mistake being made again and again by many different people, one person’s “stay away from that berry” wisdom could travel through space and time to protect everyone else from having their bad experience.</p> \n<p>The same thing would happen when one human figured out a new clever trick. One unusually-intelligent hunter particularly attuned to both star constellations and the annual migration patterns of wildebeest<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-1-6120\" id=\"note-1-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> herds could share a system he devised that used the night sky to determine exactly how many days remained until the herd would return. Even though very few hunters would have been able to come up with that system on their own, through word-of-mouth, all future hunters in the tribe would now benefit from the ingenuity of one ancestor, with that one hunter’s crowning discovery serving as every future hunter’s <em>starting point</em> of knowledge.</p> \n<p>And let’s say this knowledge advancement makes the hunting season more efficient, which gives tribe members more time to work on their weapons—which allows one extra-clever hunter a few generations later to discover a method for making lighter, denser spears that can be thrown more accurately. And just like that, every present and future hunter in the tribe hunts with a more effective spear.</p> \n<p>Language allows the best epiphanies of the very smartest people, through the generations, to accumulate into a little collective tower of tribal knowledge—a “greatest hits” of their ancestors’ best “aha!” moments. Every new generation has this knowledge tower installed in their heads as their starting point in life, leading them to new, even better discoveries that build on what their ancestors learned, as the tribe’s knowledge continues to grow bigger and wiser. Language is the difference between this:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6474\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b.png\" alt=\"minimal tribal knowledge growth before language\" width=\"800\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b.png 1220w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b-300x133.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b-768x341.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-1b-600x266.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>And this:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6458\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"894\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1.png 1318w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1-268x300.png 268w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1-768x858.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Knowledge-growth-graph-2-1-537x600.png 537w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The major trajectory upgrade happens for two reasons. Each generation can learn a lot more new things when they can talk to each other, compare notes, and combine their individual learnings (that’s why the blue bars are so much higher in the second graph). And each generation can successfully pass a higher percentage of their learnings on to the next generation, so knowledge <em>sticks</em> better through time.</p> \n<p>Knowledge, when shared, becomes like a grand, collective, inter-generational collaboration. Hundreds of generations later, what started as a pro tip about a certain berry to avoid has become an intricate system of planting long rows of the stomach-friendly berry bushes and harvesting them annually. The initial stroke of genius about wildebeest migrations has turned into a system of goat domestication. The spear innovation, through hundreds of incremental tweaks over tens of thousands of years, has become the bow and arrow.</p> \n<p>Language gives a group of humans a <em>collective intelligence </em>far greater than individual human intelligence and allows each human to benefit from the collective intelligence as if he came up with it all himself. We think of the bow and arrow as a primitive technology, but raise Einstein in the woods with no existing knowledge and tell him to come up with the best hunting device he can, and he won’t be <em>nearly </em>intelligent or skilled or knowledgeable enough to invent the bow and arrow. Only a <em>collective </em>human effort can pull that off.</p> \n<p>Being able to speak to each other also allowed humans to form complex social structures which, along with advanced technologies like farming and animal domestication, led tribes over time to begin to settle into permanent locations and merge into organized super-tribes. When this happened, each tribe’s tower of accumulated knowledge could be shared with the larger super-tribe, forming a super-tower. Mass cooperation raised the quality of life for everyone, and by 10,000 BC, the first cities had formed.</p> \n<p>According to Wikipedia, there’s something called Metcalfe’s law, which states that “the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.” And they include this little chart of old telephones:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-1-6120\" id=\"note2-1-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6121\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_.png 476w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_-131x300.png 131w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Metcalfe-Network-Effect.svg_-261x600.png 261w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></a></p> \n<p>But the same idea applies to people. Two people can have one conversation. Three people have four unique conversation groups (three different two-person conversations and a fourth conversation between all three as a group). Five people have 26. Twenty people have 1,048,555.</p> \n<p>So not only did the members of a city benefit from a <em>huge </em>knowledge tower as a foundation, but Metcalfe’s law means that the number of conversation possibilities now skyrocketed to an unprecedented amount of variety. More conversations meant more ideas bumping up against each other, which led to many more discoveries clicking together, and the pace of innovation soared.</p> \n<p>Humans soon mastered agriculture, which freed many people up to think about all kinds of other ideas, and it wasn’t long before they stumbled upon a new, giant breakthrough: writing.</p> \n<p>Historians think humans first started writing things down about 5 – 6,000 years ago. Up until that point, the collective knowledge tower was stored only in a network of people’s memories and accessed only through livestream word-of-mouth communication. This system worked in small tribes, but with a vastly larger body of knowledge shared among a vastly larger group of people, memories alone would have had a hard time supporting it all, and most of it would have ended up lost.</p> \n<p>If language let humans send a thought from one brain to another, writing let them stick a thought onto a physical <em>object</em>,<em> </em>like a stone, where it could live forever. When people began writing on thin sheets of parchment or paper, huge fields of knowledge that would take weeks to be conveyed by word of mouth could be compressed into a book or a scroll you could hold in your hand. The human collective knowledge tower now lived in physical form, neatly organized on the shelves of city libraries and universities.</p> \n<p>These shelves became humanity’s grand instruction manual on everything. They guided humanity toward new inventions and discoveries, and those would in turn become new books on the shelves, as the grand instruction manual built upon itself. The manual taught us the intricacies of trade and currency, of shipbuilding and architecture, of medicine and astronomy. Each generation began life with a higher floor of knowledge and technology than the last, and progress continued to accelerate.</p> \n<p>But painstakingly handwritten books were treated like treasures,<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-2-6120\" id=\"note-2-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> and likely only accessible to the extreme elite (in the mid 15th century, there were only <a href=\"http://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-gutenberg-bible\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">30,000 books</a> in all of Europe). And then came another breakthrough: the printing press.</p> \n<p>In the 15th century, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg#/media/File:Gutenberg.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beardy</a> Johannes Gutenberg came up with a way to create multiple identical copies of the same book, much more quickly and cheaply than ever before. (Or, more accurately, when Gutenberg was born, humanity had already figured out the first 95% of how to invent the printing press, and Gutenberg, with that knowledge as his starting point, invented the last 5%.) (Oh, also, Gutenberg didn’t invent the printing press, <a href=\"http://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-gutenberg-bible\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Chinese did</a> a bunch of centuries earlier. Pretty reliable rule is that everything you think was invented somewhere other than China was probably actually invented in China.) Here’s how it worked:</p> \n<div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n <p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>It Turns Out Gutenberg Isn’t Actually Impressive Blue Box</strong></span></p> \n <p>To prepare to write this blue box, I found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ojyCDRc8uc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video</a> explaining how Gutenberg’s press worked and was surprised to find myself unimpressed. I always assumed Gutenberg had made some genius machine, but it turns out he just created a bunch of stamps of letters and punctuation and manually arranged them as the page of a book and then put ink on them and pressed a piece of paper onto the letters, and that was one book page. While he had the letters all set up for that page, he’d make a bunch of copies. Then he’d spend forever manually rearranging the stamps (this is the “movable type” part) into the next page, and then do a bunch of copies of that. His first project was 180 copies of the Bible,<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-3-6120\" id=\"note-3-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> which took him and his employees two years.</p> \n <p><em>That</em>‘<em>s </em>Gutenberg’s thing? A bunch of stamps? I feel like I could have come up with that pretty easily. Not really clear why it took humanity 5,000 years to go from figuring out how to write to creating a bunch of manual stamps. I guess it’s not that I’m unimpressed with Gutenberg—I’m neutral on Gutenberg, he’s fine—it’s that I’m unimpressed with everyone else.</p> \n</div> \n<p>Anyway, despite how disappointing Gutenberg’s press turned out to be, it was a <em>huge </em>leap forward for humanity’s ability to spread information. Over the coming centuries, printing technology rapidly improved, bringing the number of pages a machine could print in an hour from about 25 in Gutenberg’s time<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-4-6120\" id=\"note-4-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> up 100-fold to 2,400 by the early 19th century.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-2-6120\" id=\"note2-2-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a></p> \n<p>Mass-produced books allowed information to spread like wildfire, and with books being made increasingly affordable, no longer was education an elite privilege—millions now had access to books, and literacy rates shot upwards. One person’s thoughts could now reach millions of people. The era of mass communication had begun.</p> \n<p>The avalanche of books allowed knowledge to transcend borders, as the world’s regional knowledge towers finally merged into one species-wide knowledge tower that stretched into the stratosphere.</p> \n<p>The better we could communicate on a mass scale, the more our species began to function like a single organism, with humanity’s collective knowledge tower as its brain and each individual human brain like a nerve or a muscle fiber in its body. With the era of mass communication upon us, the collective human organism—the Human Colossus—rose into existence.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6209\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"704\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus.png 1096w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-213x300.png 213w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-768x1082.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-426x600.png 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p>With the entire body of collective human knowledge in its brain, the Human Colossus began inventing things no human could have dreamed of inventing on their own—things that would have seemed like absurd science fiction to people only a few generations before.</p> \n<p>It turned our ox-drawn carts into speedy locomotives and our horse-and-buggies into shiny metal cars. It turned our lanterns into lightbulbs and written letters into telephone calls and factory workers into industrial machines. It sent us soaring through the skies and out into space. It redefined the meaning of “mass communication” by giving us radio and TV, opening up a world where a thought in someone’s head could be beamed instantly into the brains of a billion people.</p> \n<p>If an individual human’s core motivation is to pass its genes on, which keeps the species going, the forces of macroeconomics make the Human Colossus’s core motivation to create value, which means it tends to want to invent newer and better technology. Every time it does that, it becomes an even better inventor, which means it can invent new stuff even faster.</p> \n<p>And around the middle of the 20th century, the Human Colossus began working on its most ambitious invention yet.</p> \n<p>The Colossus had figured out a long time ago that the best way to create value was to invent value-creating <em>machines</em>. Machines were better than humans at doing many kinds of work, which generated a flood of new resources that could be put towards value creation. Perhaps even more importantly, machine labor freed up huge portions of human time and energy—i.e. huge portions of the Colossus itself—to focus on innovation. It had already outsourced the work of our arms to factory machines and the work of our legs to driving machines, and it had done so through the power of its brain—now what if, somehow, it could outsource the work of the brain <em>itself </em>to a machine?</p> \n<p>The first digital computers sprung up in the 1940s.</p> \n<p>One kind of brain labor computers could do was the work of information storage—they were <em>remembering</em> machines. But we already knew how to outsource our memories using books, just like we had been outsourcing our leg labor to <a href=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">horses</a> long before cars provided a far better solution. Computers were simply a memory-outsourcing upgrade.</p> \n<p>Information-<em>processing </em>was a different story—a type of brain labor we had never figured out how to outsource. The Human Colossus had always had to do all of its own computing. Computers changed that.</p> \n<p>Factory machines allowed us to outsource a physical process—we put a material in, the machines physically processed it and spit out the results. Computers could do the same thing for information processing. A software program was like a factory machine for information processes.</p> \n<p>These new information-storage/organizing/processing machines proved to be useful. Computers began to play a central role in the day-to-day operation of companies and governments. By the late 1980s, it was common for individual people to own their own personal brain assistant.</p> \n<p>Then came another leap.</p> \n<p>In the early 90s, we taught millions of isolated machine-brains how to communicate with one another. They formed a worldwide computer network, and a new giant was born—the Computer Colossus.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6444\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1.png 1096w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1-219x300.png 219w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1-768x1051.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-1-438x600.png 438w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The Computer Colossus and the great network it formed were like popeye spinach for the Human Colossus.</p> \n<p>If individual human brains are the nerves and muscle fibers of the Human Colossus, the internet gave the giant its first legit nervous system.

It made internet faster and wireless. It made computing chips smaller and smaller until there was a powerful computer in everyone’s pocket.</p> \n<p>Each innovation was like a new truckload of spinach for the Human Colossus.</p> \n<p>But today, the Human Colossus has its eyes set on an even bigger idea than more spinach. Computers have been a game-changer, allowing humanity to outsource many of its brain-related tasks and better function as a single organism. But there’s one kind of brain labor computers still can’t quite do. <em>Thinking.</em></p> \n<p>Computers can compute and organize and run complex software—software that can even learn on its own. But they can’t <em>think </em>in the way humans can. The Human Colossus knows that everything it’s built has originated with its ability to reason creatively and independently—and it knows that the <em>ultimate </em>brain extension tool would be one that can really, actually, legitimately <em>think</em>. It has no idea what it will be like when the Computer Colossus can think for itself—when it one day opens its eyes and becomes a <em>real </em>colossus—but with its core goal to create value and push technology to its limits, the Human Colossus is determined to find out.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p>We’ll come back here in a bit. First, we have some learning to do.</p> \n<p>As we’ve discussed <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">before</a>, knowledge works like a tree. If you try to learn a branch or a leaf of a topic before you have a solid tree trunk foundation of understanding in your head, it won’t work. The branches and leaves will have nothing to stick to, so they’ll fall right out of your head.</p> \n<p>We’ve established that Elon Musk wants to build a wizard hat for the brain, and understanding why he wants to do that is the key to understanding Neuralink—and to understanding what our future might actually be like.</p> \n<p>But none of that will make much sense until we really get into the truly mind-blowing concept of what a wizard hat is, what it might be like to wear one, and how we get there from where we are today.</p> \n<p>The foundation for <em>that </em>discussion is an understanding of what brain-machine interfaces are, how they work, and where the technology is today.</p> \n<p>Finally, BMIs themselves are just a larger branch—not the tree’s trunk.

The dura is flush with the skull. I’ve heard it said that the brain has no pain sensory area, but the dura actually does—it’s about as sensitive as the skin on your face—and pressure on or contusions in the dura often account for people’s bad headaches.</p> \n<p>Then below that there’s the <strong>arachnoid mater </strong>(“spider mother”), which is a layer of skin and then an open space with these stretchy-looking fibers. I always thought my brain was just floating aimlessly in my head in some kind of fluid, but actually, the only real space gap between the outside of the brain and the inner wall of the skull is this arachnoid business. Those fibers stabilize the brain in position so it can’t move too much, and they act as a shock absorber when your head bumps into something. This area is filled with spinal fluid, which keeps the brain mostly buoyant, since its density is similar to that of water.</p> \n<p>Finally you have the <strong>pia mater </strong>(“soft mother”), a fine, delicate layer of skin that’s fused with the outside of the brain. You know how when you see a brain, it’s always covered with icky blood vessels? Those aren’t actually on the brain’s surface, they’re embedded in the pia. (For the non-squeamish, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak1FWodg5Nw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here’s a video</a> of a professor peeling the pia off of a human brain.)</p> \n<p>Here’s the full overview, using the head of what looks like probably a pig:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6125 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"530\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b.jpg 530w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b-150x150.jpg 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/338317926b0c5edcd883a0ff35fa3f2b-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" /></a></p> \n<p>From the left you have the skin (the pink), then two scalp layers, then the skull, then the dura, arachnoid, and on the far right, just the brain covered by the pia.</p> \n<p>Once we’ve stripped everything down, we’re left with this silly boy:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-5-6120\" id=\"note2-5-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6126 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"618\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1.jpg 660w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1-300x240.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain1-600x480.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px\" /></a></p> \n<p>This ridiculous-looking thing is the most complex known object in the universe—three pounds of what neuroengineer Tim Hanson calls “<span class=\"s1\">one of the most information-dense, structured, and self-structuring matter known.”<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-6-6120\" id=\"note2-6-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a> All while operating on only <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2009-11/neuron-computer-chips-could-overcome-power-limitations-digital\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">20 watts</a> of power (an <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-supercomputer-idUSKCN0J11VV20141117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">equivalently powerful computer</a> runs on 24,000,000 watts).</span></p> \n<p>It’s also what MIT professor Polina Anikeeva <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qi5uoNYXqg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">calls</a> “soft pudding you could scoop with a spoon.” Brain surgeon Ben Rapoport described it to me more scientifically, as “somewhere between pudding and jello.” He explained that if you placed a brain on a table, gravity would make it lose its shape and flatten out a bit, kind of like a jellyfish.

You know a brain part is going through some shit when almost all its functions are already another brain part’s thing. In the case of the midbrain, it deals with vision, hearing, motor control, alertness, temperature control, and a bunch of other things that other people in the brain already do. The rest of the brain doesn’t seem very into the midbrain either, given that they created a ridiculously uneven “forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain” divide that intentionally isolates the midbrain all by itself while everyone else hangs out.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-12-6120\" id=\"note2-12-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CNX_Psych_03_04_FMHBrain.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6130 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CNX_Psych_03_04_FMHBrain.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CNX_Psych_03_04_FMHBrain.jpg 487w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CNX_Psych_03_04_FMHBrain-300x219.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" /></a></p> \n<p>One thing I’ll grant the pons and midbrain is that it’s the two of them that control your voluntary eye movement, which is a pretty legit job.

A decent rule of thumb is that whenever you’re doing something that your dog might also do—eating, drinking, having sex, fighting, hiding or running away from something scary—your limbic system is probably behind the wheel. Whether it feels like it or not, when you’re doing any of those things, you’re in primitive survival mode.</p> \n<p>The limbic system is also where your emotions live, and in the end, emotions are also all about survival—they’re the more advanced mechanisms of survival, necessary for animals living in a complex social structure.</p> \n<p>In other posts, when I refer to your <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instant Gratification Monkey</a>, your <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Survival Mammoth</a>, and <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all your other animals</a>—I’m usually referring to your limbic system. Anytime there’s an internal battle going on in your head, it’s likely that the limbic system’s role is urging you to do the thing you’ll later regret doing.</p> \n<p>I’m pretty sure that gaining control over your limbic system is both the definition of maturity and the core human struggle. It’s not that we would be better off without our limbic systems—limbic systems are half of what makes us distinctly human, and most of the fun of life is related to emotions and/or fulfilling your animal needs—it’s just that your limbic system doesn’t get that you live in a civilization, and if you let it run your life too much, it’ll quickly ruin your life.</p> \n<p>Anyway, let’s take a closer look at it. There are a lot of little parts of the limbic system, but we’ll keep it to the biggest celebrities:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The amygdala</strong> </span> <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Amygdala.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6392 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Amygdala10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"234\" /></a></p> \n<p>The amygdala is kind of an emotional wreck of a brain structure. It deals with anxiety, sadness, and our responses to fear. There are two amygdalae, and oddly, the left one has been shown to be more balanced, sometimes producing happy feelings in addition to the usual angsty ones, while the right one is always in a bad mood.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The hippocampus</strong> </span> <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hippocampus.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6391 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/large.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></a></p> \n<p>Your hippocampus (Greek for “seahorse” because it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus#/media/File:Hippocampus_and_seahorse_cropped.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">looks like one</a>) is like a scratch board for memory. When rats start to memorize directions in a maze, the memory gets encoded in their hippocampus—quite literally. Different parts of the rat’s two hippocampi will fire during different parts of the maze, since each section of the maze is stored in its own section of the hippocampus. But if after learning one maze, the rat is given other tasks and is brought back to the original maze a year later, it will have a hard time remembering it, because the hippocampus scratch board has been mostly wiped of the memory so as to free itself up for new memories.</p> \n<p>The condition in the movie <em>Memento</em> is a real thing—anterograde amnesia—and it’s caused by damage to the hippocampus. Alzheimer’s also starts in the hippocampus before working its way through many parts of the brain, which is why, of the slew of devastating effects of the disease, diminished memory happens first.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The t</strong><strong>halamus</strong></span> <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Thalamus.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6388 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/article_codev-2015-10-30-608d7118d8-Thalamus_small.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" /></a></p> \n<p>In its central position in the brain, the thalamus also serves as a sensory middleman that receives information from your sensory organs and sends them to your cortex for processing. When you’re sleeping, the thalamus goes to sleep with you, which means the sensory middleman is off duty. That’s why in a deep sleep, some sound or light or touch often will not wake you up. If you want to wake someone up who’s in a deep sleep, you have to be aggressive enough to wake their thalamus up.</p> \n<p>The exception is your sense of smell, which is the one sense that bypasses the thalamus. That’s why smelling salts are used to wake up a passed-out person. While we’re here, cool fact: smell is the function of the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_bulb#/media/File:Head_olfactory_nerve_-_olfactory_bulb_en.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">olfactory bulb</a> </strong>and is the most ancient of the senses. Unlike the other senses, smell is located deep in the limbic system, where it works closely with the hippocampus and amygdala—which is why smell is so closely tied to memory and emotion.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>The Neo-Mammalian Brain: The Cortex</strong></span></p> \n<p>Finally, we arrive at the cortex. The cerebral cortex. The neocortex. The cerebrum. The pallium.</p> \n<p>The most important part of the whole brain can’t figure out what its name is. Here’s what’s happening:</p> \n<div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n <p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The What the Hell is it Actually Called Blue Box</strong></span></p> \n <p>The<strong> cerebrum </strong>is the whole big top/outside part of the brain but it also technically includes some of the internal parts too.</p> \n <p><strong>Cortex </strong>means “bark” in Latin and is the word used for the outer layer of many organs, not just the brain. The outside of the cerebellum is the cerebellar cortex. And the outside of the cerebrum is the <strong>cerebral cortex.</strong> Only mammals have cerebral cortices. The equivalent part of the brain in reptiles is called the <strong>pallium. </strong></p> \n <p>The <strong>neocortex </strong>is often used interchangeably with “cerebral cortex,” but it’s technically the outer layers of the cerebral cortex that are especially developed in more advanced mammals. The other parts are called the allocortex.</p> \n <p>In the rest of this post, we’ll be mostly referring to the neocortex <strong>but we’ll just call it the cortex, </strong>since that’s the least annoying way to do it for everyone.</p> \n</div> \n<p>The cortex is in charge of basically everything—processing what you see, hear, and feel, along with language, movement, thinking, planning, and personality.</p> \n<p>It’s divided into four lobes:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-14-6120\" id=\"note2-14-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">14</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6256\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2.jpg 800w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2-300x211.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2-768x540.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lobes2-600x422.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p>It’s pretty unsatisfying to describe what they each do, because they each do so many things and there’s a lot of overlap, but to oversimplify:</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Frontal_lobe.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>frontal lobe </strong></a>(click the words to see a gif)<strong> </strong>handles your personality, along with a lot of what we think of as “thinking”—reasoning, planning, and executive function. In particular, a lot of your thinking takes place in the front part of the frontal lobe, called the <strong>prefrontal cortex</strong>—the adult in your head. The prefrontal cortex is the other character in those internal battles that go on in your life. The rational decision-maker trying to get you to do your work. The authentic voice trying to get you to stop worrying so much what others think and just be yourself. The higher being who wishes you’d stop sweating the small stuff.</p> \n<p>As if that’s not enough to worry about, the frontal lobe is also in charge of your body’s movement. The top strip of the frontal lobe is your <strong>primary motor cortex.</strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-15-6120\" id=\"note2-15-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">15</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.getbodysmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Primary-Motor-Cortex-Labeled-713x550.png\"><img class=\"alignnone \" src=\"https://www.getbodysmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Primary-Motor-Cortex-Labeled-713x550.png\" width=\"363\" height=\"280\" /></a></p> \n<p>Then there’s the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Parietal_lobe_animation.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>parietal lobe</strong></a> which, among other things, controls your sense of touch, particularly in the <strong>primary somatosensory cortex</strong>, the strip right next to the primary motor cortex.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-16-6120\" id=\"note2-16-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">16</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.getbodysmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Primary-Other-Somatosenory-Cortex-Areas-695x550.png\"><img class=\"alignnone \" src=\"https://www.getbodysmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Primary-Other-Somatosenory-Cortex-Areas-695x550.png\" width=\"361\" height=\"286\" /></a></p> \n<p>The motor and somatosensory cortices are fun because they’re well-mapped.

The larger the body part in the diagram, the more of the cortex is dedicated to its movement or sense of touch. A couple interesting things about this:</p> \n<p>First, it’s amazing that more of your brain is dedicated to the movement and feeling of your face and hands than to the rest of your body combined. This makes sense though—you need to make incredibly nuanced facial expressions and your hands need to be unbelievably dexterous, while the rest of your body—your shoulder, your knee, your back—can move and feel things much more crudely. This is why people can play the piano with their fingers but not with their toes.</p> \n<p>Second, it’s interesting how the two cortices are basically dedicated to the same body parts, in the same proportions. I never really thought about the fact that the same parts of your body you need to have a lot of movement control over tend to also be the most sensitive to touch.</p> \n<p>Finally, I came across this shit and I’ve been living with it ever since—so now you have to too.

But actually, the cortex is just the outer <em>two</em><em> millimeters </em>of the brain—the thickness of a nickel—and the meat of the space underneath is mostly just wiring.</p> \n<div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n <p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The Why Brains Are So Wrinkly Blue Box</strong></span></p> \n <p>As we’ve discussed, the evolution of our brain happened by building outwards, adding newer, fancier features on top of the existing model. But building outwards has its limits, because the need for humans to emerge into the world through someone’s vagina puts a cap on how big our heads could be.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-9-6120\" id=\"note-9-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></p> \n <p>So evolution got innovative. Because the cortex is so thin, it scales by increasing its surface area. That means that by creating lots of folds (including both sides <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Frontal_lobe_animation.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">folding down into the gap</a> between the two hemispheres), you can more than triple the area of the brain’s surface without increasing the volume too much.

We also have a decent understanding of the little picture. Let’s check it out:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>The brain, zoomed in</strong></span></p> \n<p>Even though we figured out that the brain was the seat of our intelligence a long time ago, it wasn’t until pretty recently that science understood what the brain was made of. Scientists knew that the body was made of cells, but in the late 19th century, Italian physician Camillo Golgi figured out how to use a <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnana.2016.00038/full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">staining method</a> to see what brain cells actually looked like. The result was surprising:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/220px-GolgiStainedPyramidalCell.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6138 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/220px-GolgiStainedPyramidalCell.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"338\" height=\"224\" /></a></p> \n<p>That wasn’t what a cell was supposed to look like. Without quite realizing it yet,<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-11-6120\" id=\"note-11-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> Golgi had discovered the neuron.</p> \n<p>Scientists realized that the neuron was the core unit in the vast communication network that makes up the brains and nervous systems of nearly all animals.</p> \n<p>But it wasn’t until the 1950s that scientists worked out <em>how </em>neurons communicate with each other.</p> \n<p>An axon, the long strand of a neuron that carries information, is normally microscopic in diameter—too small for scientists to test on until recently. But in the 1930s, English zoologist J. Z. Young discovered that the squid, randomly, could change everything for our understanding, because squids have an unusually huge axon in their bodies that could be experimented on. A couple decades later, using the squid’s giant axon, scientists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley definitively figured out how neurons send information: the action potential. Here’s how it works.</p> \n<p>So there are a lot of different kinds of neurons—<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-19-6120\" id=\"note2-19-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">19</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neuron_types.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6139 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neuron_types.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"608\" height=\"367\" /></a></p> \n<p>—but for simplicity, we’ll discuss the cliché textbook neuron—a pyramidal cell, like one you might find in your motor cortex.

We’ll go through the very basic ideas that are relevant for our purposes.</p> \n<p>So our guy’s body stem—the neuron’s <strong>axon</strong>—has a negative “resting potential,” which means that when it’s at rest, its electrical charge is slightly negative.

Their feet drop chemicals called <strong>neurotransmitters</strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-13-6120\" id=\"note-13-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a> onto his hair—which pass through his head (the cell body, or<strong> soma</strong>) and, depending on the chemical, raise or lower the charge in his body a little bit. It’s a little unpleasant for our neuron guy, but not a huge deal—and nothing else happens.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6340 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"672\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4.png 1430w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4-300x252.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4-768x644.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-4-600x503.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>But if enough chemicals touch his hair to raise his charge over a certain point—the neuron’s “threshold potential”—then it triggers an <strong>action potential</strong>, and our guy is electrocuted.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6341 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"672\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5.png 1429w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5-300x252.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5-768x645.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-5-600x504.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>This is a binary situation—either <em>nothing </em>happens to our guy, or he’s fully electrocuted.

When the action potential reaches his feet, it causes them to release chemicals onto the people’s hair they’re touching, which may or may not cause those people to be electrocuted, just like he was.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6342\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"759\" height=\"641\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6.png 1421w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6-300x253.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6-768x649.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuron-guy-6-600x507.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px\" /></a></p> \n<p>This is usually how info moves through the nervous system—chemical information sent in the tiny gap between neurons triggers electrical information to pass <em>through </em>the neuron—but sometimes, in situations when the body needs to move a signal extra quickly, neuron-to-neuron connections can themselves be electric.</p> \n<p>Action potentials move at between 1 and 100 meters/second. Part of the reason for this large range is that another type of cell in the nervous system—a Schwann cell—acts like a super nurturing grandmother and constantly wraps some types of axons in layers of fat blankets called <strong>myelin sheath.</strong> Like this (takes a second to start):<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-20-6120\" id=\"note2-20-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">20</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Myelinani.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6144 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Myelinani.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a></p> \n<p>On top of its protection and insulation benefits, the myelin sheath is a major factor in the pace of communication—action potentials travel <em>much </em>faster through axons when they’re covered in myelin sheath:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-14-6120\" id=\"note-14-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-21-6120\" id=\"note2-21-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">21</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ezgif.com-optimize-2.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-6255 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ezgif.com-optimize-2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a></p> \n<p>One nice example of the speed difference created by myelin: You know how when you stub your toe, your body gives you that one second of reflection time to think about what you just did and what you’re about to feel, before the pain actually kicks in? What’s happening is you feel both the sensation of your toe hitting against something and the sharp part of the pain right away, because sharp pain information is sent to the brain via types of axons that are myelinated. It takes a second or two for the dull pain to kick in because dull pain is sent via <em>unmyelinated</em> “C fibers”—at only around one meter/second.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Neural Networks</strong></span></p> \n<p>Neurons are similar to computer transistors in one way—they also transmit information in the binary language of 1’s (action potential firing) and 0’s (no action potential firing). But unlike computer transistors, the brain’s neurons are constantly changing.</p> \n<p>You know how sometimes you learn a new skill and you get pretty good at it, and then the next day you try again and you suck again? That’s because what made you get good at the skill the day before was adjustments to the amount or concentration of the <em>chemicals</em> in the signaling between neurons. Repetition caused chemicals to adjust, which helped you improve, but the next day the chemicals were back to normal so the improvement went away.</p> \n<p>But then if you <em>keep </em>practicing, you eventually get good at something in a lasting way. What’s happened is you’ve told the brain, “this isn’t just something I need in a one-off way,” and the brain’s neural network has responded by making <em>structural changes</em> to itself that last. Neurons have shifted shape and location and strengthened or weakened various connections in a way that has built a hard-wired set of pathways that know how to do that skill.</p> \n<p>Neurons’ ability to alter themselves chemically, structurally, and even functionally, allow your brain’s neural network to optimize itself to the external world—a phenomenon called <em>neuroplasticity. </em>Babies’ brains are the most neuroplastic of all. When a baby is born, its brain has no idea if it needs to accommodate the life of a medieval warrior who will need to become incredibly adept at sword-fighting, a 17th-century musician who will need to develop fine-tuned muscle memory for playing the harpsichord, or a modern-day intellectual who will need to store and organize a tremendous amount of information and master a complex social fabric—but the baby’s brain is ready to shape itself to handle whatever life has in store for it.</p> \n<p>Babies are the neuroplasticity superstars, but neuroplasticity remains throughout our whole lives, which is why humans can grow and change and learn new things. And it’s why we can form new habits and break old ones—your habits are reflective of the existing circuitry in your brain. If you want to change your habits, you need to exert a lot of willpower to override your brain’s neural pathways, but if you can keep it going long enough, your brain will eventually get the hint and alter those pathways, and the new behavior will stop requiring willpower. Your brain will have physically built the changes into a new habit.</p> \n<p>Altogether, there are around 100 billion neurons in the brain that make up this unthinkably vast network—similar to the number of stars in the Milky Way and over 10 times the number of people in the world. Around 15 – 20 billion of those neurons are in the cortex, and the rest are in the animal parts of your brain (surprisingly, the random cerebellum has more than three times as many neurons as the cortex).</p> \n<p>Let’s zoom back out and look at another cross section of the brain—this time cut not from front to back to show a single hemisphere, but from side to side:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-22-6120\" id=\"note2-22-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">22</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-white-matter-grey-matter-cross-section.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6262 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-white-matter-grey-matter-cross-section.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-white-matter-grey-matter-cross-section.jpg 510w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brain-white-matter-grey-matter-cross-section-300x226.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Brain material can be divided into what’s called <strong>gray matter </strong>and <strong>white matter.</strong> Gray matter actually looks darker in color and is made up of the cell bodies (somas) of the brain’s neurons and their thicket of dendrites and axons—along with a lot of other stuff. White matter is made up primarily of wiring—axons carrying information from somas to other somas or to destinations in the body. White matter is white because those axons are usually wrapped in myelin sheath, which is fatty white tissue.</p> \n<p>There are two main regions of gray matter in the brain—the internal cluster of limbic system and brain stem parts we discussed above, and the nickel-thick layer of cortex around the outside. The big chunk of white matter in between is made up mostly of the axons of cortical neurons.

The axons of sensory neurons head down from the somatosensory cortex, through the brain’s white matter, and into the spinal cord (which is just a massive bundle of axons). From the spinal cord, they head out to all parts of your body. Each part of your skin is lined with nerves that originate in the somatosensory cortex. A <strong>nerve</strong>, by the way, is a few bundles of axons wrapped together in a little cord. Here’s a nerve up close:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-26-6120\" id=\"note2-26-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">26</a></p> \n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6143 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/perner004os-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/perner004os-1.jpg 400w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/perner004os-1-240x300.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></p> \n<p>The nerve is the whole thing circled in purple, and those four big circles inside are bundles of many axons (here’s a helpful <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/main-qimg-3f670c6ad3bb29728c912a1abbec2d26.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cartoony drawing</a>).</p> \n<p>So if a fly lands on your arm, here’s what happens:</p> \n<p>The fly touches your skin and stimulates a bunch of sensory nerves. The axon terminals in the nerves have a little fit and start action potential-ing, sending the signal up to the brain to tell on the fly. The signals head into the spinal cord and up to the somas in the somatosensory cortex.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-18-6120\" id=\"note-18-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a> The somatosensory cortex then taps the motor cortex on the shoulder and tells it that there’s a fly on your arm and that it needs to deal with it (lazy). The particular somas in your motor cortex that connect to the muscles in your arm then start action potential-ing, sending the signals back into the spinal cord and then out to the muscles of the arm. The axon terminals at the end of those neurons stimulate your arm muscles, which constrict to shake your arm to get the fly off (by now the fly has already <a href=\"http://www.womansday.com/food-recipes/food-drinks/news/a50683/the-disgusting-reason-you-should-never-eat-something-a-fly-landed-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thrown up</a> on your arm), and the fly (whose nervous system now goes through its own whole thing) flies off.</p> \n<p>Then your amygdala looks over and realizes there was a bug on you, and it tells your motor cortex to jump embarrassingly, and if it’s a spider instead of a fly, it also tells your vocal cords to yell out involuntarily and ruin your reputation.</p> \n<p>So it seems so far like we do kind of actually understand the brain, right? But then why did that professor ask that question—<em>If everything you need to know about the brain is a mile, how far have we walked in this mile?</em>—and say the answer was <em>three inches?</em></p> \n<p>Well here’s the thing.</p> \n<p>You know how we totally get how an individual computer sends an email and we totally understand the broad concepts of the internet, like how many people are on it and what the biggest sites are and what the major trends are—but all the stuff in the middle—the inner workings of the internet—are pretty confusing?</p> \n<p>And you know how economists can tell you all about how an individual consumer functions and they can also tell you about the major concepts of macroeconomics and the overarching forces at play—but no one can really tell you all the ins and outs of how the economy works or predict what will happen with the economy next month or next year?</p> \n<p>The brain is kind of like those things. We get the little picture—we know all about how a neuron fires. And we get the big picture—we know how many neurons are in the brain and what the major lobes and structures control and how much energy the whole system uses. But the stuff in between—all that <em>middle </em>stuff about how each part of the brain actually does its thing?</p> \n<p>Yeah we don’t get that.</p> \n<p>What really makes it clear how confounded we are is hearing a neuroscientist talk about the parts of the brain we understand <em>best</em>.</p> \n<p>Like the visual cortex. We understand the visual cortex pretty well because it’s easy to <em>map</em>.</p> \n<p>Research scientist Paul Merolla described it to me:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>The visual cortex has very nice anatomical function and structure. When you look at it, you literally see a map of the world. So when something in your visual field is in a certain region of space, you’ll see a little patch in the cortex that represents that region of space, and it’ll light up. And as that thing moves over, there’s a topographic mapping where the neighboring cells will represent that. It’s almost like having Cartesian coordinates of the real world that will map to polar coordinates in the visual cortex. And you can literally trace from your retina, through your thalamus, to your visual cortex, and you’ll see an actual mapping from this point in space to this point in the visual cortex.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">So far so good. But then he went on:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>So that mapping is really useful if you want to interact with certain parts of the visual cortex, but there’s many regions of vision, and as you get deeper into the visual cortex, it becomes a little bit more nebulous, and this topographic representation starts to break down. … There’s all these levels of things going on in the brain, and visual perception is a great example of that. We look at the world, and there’s just this physical 3D world out there—like you look at a cup, and you just see a cup—but what your eyes are seeing is really just a bunch of pixels. And when you look in the visual cortex, you see that there are roughly 20-40 different maps. V1 is the first area, where it’s tracking little edges and colors and things like that. And there’s other areas looking at more complicated objects, and there’s all these different visual representations on the surface of your brain, that you can see. And somehow all of that information is being bound together in this information stream that’s being coded in a way that makes you believe you’re just seeing a simple object.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And the motor cortex, another one of the best-understood areas of the brain, might be even more difficult to understand on a granular level than the visual cortex. Because even though we know which <em>general </em>areas of the motor cortex map to which areas of the body, the individual neurons in these motor cortex areas <em>aren’t</em> topographically set up, and the specific way they work together to create movement in the body is anything but clear. Here’s Paul again:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>The neural chatter in everyone’s arm movement part of the brain is a little bit different—it’s not like the neurons speak English and say “move”—it’s a pattern of electrical activity, and in everyone it’s a little bit different. … And you want to be able to seamlessly understand that it means “Move the arm this way” or “move the arm toward the target” or “move the arm to the left, move it up, grasp, grasp with a certain kind of force, reach with a certain speed,” and so on. We don’t think about these things when we move—it just happens seamlessly. So each brain has a unique code with which it talks to the muscles in the arm and hand.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The <em>neuroplasticity </em>that makes our brains so useful to us also makes them incredibly difficult to understand—because the way each of our brains works is based on how that brain has shaped itself, based on its particular environment and life experience.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And again, those are the areas of the brain we understand the <em>best. </em>“When it comes to more sophisticated computation, like language, memory, mathematics,” one expert told me, “we really don’t understand how the brain works.” He lamented that, for example, the concept of one’s mother is coded in a different way, and in different parts of the brain, for every person. And in the<em> </em>frontal lobe—you know, that part of the brain where <em>you </em>really live—”there’s no topography at all.”<em> </em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But somehow, <em>none of this </em>is why building effective brain-computer interfaces is so hard, or so daunting. What makes BMIs so hard is that the engineering challenges are <em>monumental</em>. It’s <em>physically </em>working with the brain that makes BMIs among the hardest engineering endeavors in the world.</p> \n<p><a name=\"part3\"></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">So with our brain background tree trunk built, we’re ready to head up to our first branch.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 28pt;\"><strong>Part 3: Brain-Machine Interfaces</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6437\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-3.png 747w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-3-290x300.png 290w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-3-580x600.png 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Let’s zip back in time for a second to 50,000 BC and kidnap someone and bring him back here to 2017.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-6263 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"243\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok.png 345w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bok-202x300.png 202w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This is Bok.

We’ve conquered the world many times over with our technology, but when it comes to our brains—our most central tool—the tech world has for the most part been too daunted to dive in.</p> \n<p>That’s why we still communicate using technology Bok invented, it’s why I’m typing this sentence at about a 20th of the speed that I’m thinking it, and it’s why brain-related ailments still leave so many lives badly impaired or lost altogether.</p> \n<p>But 50,000 years after the brain’s great “aha!” moment, that may finally be about to change. The brain’s next great frontier may be itself.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p>There are many kinds of potential brain-machine interface (sometimes called a brain-computer interface) that will serve many different functions. But everyone working on BMIs is grappling with either one or both of these two questions:</p> \n<p><strong>1) How do I get the right information out of the brain?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>2) How do I send the right information into the brain?</strong></p> \n<p>The first is about capturing the brain’s <em>output</em>—it’s about <strong>recording</strong> what neurons are saying.</p> \n<p>The second is about <em>inputting </em>information into the brain’s natural flow or altering that natural flow in some other way—it’s about <strong>stimulating </strong>neurons.</p> \n<p>These two things are happening naturally in your brain all the time. Right now, your eyes are making a specific set of horizontal movements that allow you to read this sentence. That’s the brain’s neurons outputting information to a machine (your eyes) and the machine receiving the command and responding. And as your eyes move in just the right way, the photons from the screen are entering your retinas and stimulating neurons in the occipital lobe of your cortex in a way that allows the image of the words to enter your mind’s eye. That image then stimulates neurons in another part of your brain that allows you to process the information embedded in the image and absorb the sentence’s meaning.</p> \n<p>Inputting and outputting information is what the brain’s neurons <em>do</em>. All the BMI industry wants to do is get in on the action.</p> \n<p>At first, this seems like maybe not <em>that </em>difficult a task? The brain is just a jello ball, right? And the cortex—the part of the brain in which we want to do most of our recording and stimulating—is just a napkin, located conveniently right on the outside of the brain where it can be easily accessed. Inside the cortex are around 20 billion firing neurons—20 billion oozy little transistors that if we can just learn to work with, will give us an entirely new level of control over our life, our health, and the world. Can’t we figure that out? Neurons are small, but we know how to split an atom. A neuron’s diameter is about 100,000 times as large as an atom’s—if an atom were a marble, a neuron would be a kilometer across—so we should probably be able to handle the smallness. Right?</p> \n<p>So what’s the issue here?</p> \n<p>Well on one hand, there’s something to that line of thinking, in that because of those facts, this <em>is </em>an industry where immense progress can happen. We <em>can </em>do this.</p> \n<p>But only when you understand what actually goes on in the brain do you realize why this is probably the hardest human endeavor in the world.</p> \n<p>So before we talk about BMIs themselves, we need to take a closer look at what the people trying to make BMIs are dealing with here. I find that the best way to illustrate things is to scale the brain up by exactly 1,000X and look at what’s going on.</p> \n<p>Remember our cortex-is-a-napkin demonstration earlier?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6302\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin.png 796w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin-300x254.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin-768x651.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-on-napkin-600x509.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Well if we scale that up by 1,000X, the cortex napkin—which was about 48cm / 19in on each side—now has a side the length of six Manhattan street blocks (or two avenue blocks). It would take you about 25 minutes to walk around the perimeter. And the brain as a whole would now fit snugly inside a two block by two block square—just about the size of Madison Square Garden (this works in length and width, but the brain would be about double the height of MSG).</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/outline-on-manhattan.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6272\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/outline-on-manhattan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"587\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/outline-on-manhattan.jpg 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/outline-on-manhattan-300x220.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/outline-on-manhattan-768x563.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/outline-on-manhattan-600x440.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>So let’s lay it out in the actual city.

One is that we can all instantly convert the sizes in our heads. Every millimeter of the actual brain is now a meter. And in the much smaller world of neurons, every micron is now an easy-to-conceptualize millimeter. Secondly, it conveniently brings the cortex up to human size—its 2mm thickness is now two meters—the height of a tall (6’6”) man.</p> \n<p>So we could walk up to 29th street, to the edge of our giant cortex napkin, and easily look at what was going on inside those two meters of thickness. For our demonstration, let’s pull out a cubic meter of our giant cortex to examine, which will show us what goes on in a typical cubic millimeter of real cortex.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6301\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"413\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1.png 1000w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1-290x300.png 290w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1-768x793.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-cube-1-581x600.png 581w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p> \n<p>What we’d see in that cubic meter would be a <em>mess. </em>Let’s empty it out and put it back together.</p> \n<p>First, let’s put the somas<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-19-6120\" id=\"note-19-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a> in—the little bodies of all the neurons that live in that cube.</p> \n<p>Somas range in size, but the neuroscientists I spoke with said that the somas of neurons in the cortex are often around 10 or 15µm in diameter (µm = micrometer, or micron: 1/1,000th of a millimeter). That means that if you laid out 7 or 10 of them in a line, that line would be about the diameter of a human hair (which is about 100µm). On our scale, that makes a soma 1 – 1.5cm in diameter. A marble.</p> \n<p>The volume of the whole cortex is in the ballpark of 500,000 cubic millimeters, and in that space are about 20 billion somas. That means an average cubic millimeter of cortex contains about 40,000 neurons. So there are 40,000 marbles in our cubic meter box. If we divide our box into about 40,000 cubic spaces, each with a side of 3cm (or about a cubic inch), it means each of our soma marbles is at the center of its own little 3cm cube, with other somas about 3cm away from it in all directions.</p> \n<p>With me so far? Can you visualize our meter cube with those 40,000 floating marbles in it?</p> \n<p>Here’s a microscope image of the somas in an actual cortex, using techniques that block out the other stuff around them:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-27-6120\" id=\"note2-27-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">27</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/B9781416050094500182_f10-06-9781416050094.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6146 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/B9781416050094500182_f10-06-9781416050094.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"369\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/B9781416050094500182_f10-06-9781416050094.jpg 312w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/B9781416050094500182_f10-06-9781416050094-216x300.jpg 216w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Okay not too crazy so far. But the soma is only a tiny piece of each neuron. Radiating out from each of our marble-sized somas are twisty, branchy dendrites that in our scaled-up brain can stretch out for three or four meters in many different directions, and from the other end an axon that can be over 100 meters long (when heading out laterally to another part of the cortex) or as long as a <em>kilometer</em> (when heading down into the spinal cord and body). Each of them only about a millimeter thick, these cords turn the cortex into a dense tangle of electrical spaghetti.</p> \n<p>And there’s a lot going on in that mash of spaghetti. Each neuron has synaptic connections to as many as 1,000—sometimes as high as 10,000—other neurons. With around 20 billion neurons in the cortex, that means there are over 20 <em>trillion </em>individual neural connections in the cortex (and as high as a quadrillion connections in the entire brain). In our cubic meter alone, there will be over 20 million synapses.</p> \n<p>To further complicate things, not only are there many spaghetti strands coming out of <em>each</em> of the 40,000 marbles in our cube, but there are thousands of other spaghetti strings passing through our cube from <em>other </em>parts of the cortex. That means that if we were trying to record signals or stimulate neurons in this particular cubic area, we’d have a lot of difficulty, because in the mess of spaghetti, it would be very hard to figure out which spaghetti strings belonged to <em>our </em>soma marbles (and god forbid there are <a href=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Purkinje_cell_by_Cajal.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Purkinje</em> cells</a> in the mix).</p> \n<p>And of course, there’s the whole neuroplasticity thing. The voltages of each neuron would be constantly changing, as many as hundreds of times per second. And the tens of millions of synapse connections in our cube would be regularly changing sizes, disappearing, and reappearing.</p> \n<p>If only that were the end of it.</p> \n<p>It turns out there are other cells in the brain called <strong>glial cells</strong>—cells that come in many different varieties and perform many different functions, like mopping up chemicals released into synapses, wrapping axons in myelin, and serving as the brain’s immune system.

Our 1,000X brain that also happens to be a nice flat napkin. That’s not how it normally works—usually, the napkin is up on top of our Madison Square Garden brain and full of deep folds (on our scale, between five and 30 meters deep). In fact, less than a <em>third </em>of the cortex napkin is up on the surface of the brain—most is buried inside the folds.</p> \n<p>Also, engineers are not operating on a bunch of brains in a lab. The brain is covered with all those Russian doll layers, including the skull—which at 1,000X would be around seven meters thick. And since most people don’t really want you opening up their skull for very long—and ideally not at all—you have to try to work with those tiny marbles as non-invasively as possible.</p> \n<p>And this is all assuming you’re dealing with the cortex—but a lot of cool BMI ideas deal with the structures down below, which if you’re standing on top of our MSG brain, are buried 50 or 100 meters under the surface.</p> \n<p>The 1,000X game also hammers home the sheer scope of the brain. Think about how much was going on in our cube—and now remember that that’s only<em> one 500,000th of the cortex</em>. If we broke our whole giant cortex into similar meter cubes and lined them up, they’d stretch 500km / 310mi—all the way to Boston and beyond. And if you made the trek—which would take over 100 hours of brisk walking—at any point you could pause and look at the cube you happened to be passing by and it would have all of this complexity inside of it. <em>All </em>of this is currently in your brain.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Part 3A: How Happy Are You That This Isn’t Your Problem</strong></span></p> \n<p>Totes.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Back to Part 3: Brain-Machine Interfaces</strong></span></p> \n<p>So how do scientists and engineers begin to manage this situation?</p> \n<p>Well they do the best they can with the tools they currently have—tools used to record or stimulate neurons (we’ll focus on the recording side for the time being). Let’s take a look at the options:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>BMI Tools</strong></span></p> \n<p>With the current work that’s being done, three broad criteria seem to stand out when evaluating a type of recording tool’s pros and cons:</p> \n<p><strong>1) Scale </strong>– how many neurons can be simultaneously recorded</p> \n<p><strong>2) Resolution </strong>– how detailed is the information the tool receives—there are two types of resolution, <strong>spatial</strong> (how closely your recordings come to telling you how individual neurons are firing) and <strong>temporal </strong>(how well you can determine <em>when </em>the activity you record happened)</p> \n<p><strong>3) Invasiveness </strong>– is surgery needed, and if so, how extensively</p> \n<p>The long-term goal is to have all three of your cakes and eat them all. But for now, it’s always a question of “which one (or two) of these criteria are you willing to completely fail?” Going from one tool to another isn’t an overall upgrade or downgrade—it’s a tradeoff.</p> \n<p>Let’s examine the types of tools currently being used:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>fMRI</strong></span></p> \n<p><strong>Scale: </strong>high (it shows you information across the whole brain)</p> \n<p><strong>Resolution: </strong>medium-low spatial, very low temporal</p> \n<p><strong>Invasiveness: </strong>non-invasive</p> \n<p>fMRI isn’t typically used for BMIs, but it is a classic <em>recording </em>tool—it gives you information about what’s going on inside the brain.</p> \n<p>fMRI uses MRI—magnetic resonance imaging—technology. MRIs, invented in the 1970s, were an evolution of the x-ray-based CAT scan. Instead of using x-rays, MRIs use magnetic fields (along with radio waves and other signals) to generate images of the body and brain.

Why? Because when areas of the brain become more active, they use more energy, so they need more oxygen—so blood flow increases to the area to deliver that oxygen. Blood flow indirectly indicates where activity is happening. Here’s what an fMRI scan might show:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-32-6120\" id=\"note2-32-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">32</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"wp-image-6156 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"323\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520.jpg 520w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520-150x150.jpg 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/7728527_f520-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Of course, there’s always blood throughout the brain—what this image shows is where blood flow has <em>increased</em> (red/orange/yellow) and where it has <em>decreased </em>(blue). And because fMRI can scan through the whole brain, results are 3-dimensional:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fmriHeadCrossSection.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6157 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/fmriHeadCrossSection.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /></a></p> \n<p>fMRI has many medical uses, like informing doctors whether or not certain parts of the brain are functioning properly after a stroke, and fMRI has taught neuroscientists a ton about which regions of the brain are involved with which functions. Scans also have the benefit of providing info about what’s going on in the whole brain at any given time, and it’s safe and totally non-invasive.</p> \n<p>The big drawback is resolution. fMRI scans have a literal resolution, like a computer screen has with pixels, except the pixels are three-dimensional, cubic volume pixels—or “voxels.”</p> \n<p>fMRI voxels have gotten smaller as the technology has improved, bringing the spatial resolution up. Today’s fMRI voxels can be as small as a cubic millimeter. The brain has a volume of about 1,200,000mm<sup>3</sup>, so a high-resolution fMRI scan divides the brain into about one million little cubes. The problem is that on neuron scale, that’s still pretty huge (the same size as our scaled-up cubic meter above)—each voxel contains tens of thousands of neurons. So what the fMRI is showing you, at best, is the average blood flow drawn in by each group of 40,000 or so neurons.</p> \n<p>The even bigger problem is temporal resolution. fMRI tracks blood flow, which is both imprecise and comes with a delay of about a second—an eternity in the world of neurons.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>EEG</strong></span></p> \n<p><strong>Scale: </strong>high</p> \n<p><strong>Resolution: </strong>very low spatial, medium-high temporal</p> \n<p><strong>Invasiveness: </strong>non-invasive</p> \n<p>Dating back almost a century, EEG (electroencephalography) puts an array of electrodes on your head.

EEG has none. Each electrode only records a broad average—a vector sum of the charges from millions or billions of neurons (and a blurred one because of the skull).</p> \n<p>Imagine that the brain is a baseball stadium, its neurons are the members of the crowd, and the information we want is, instead of electrical activity, vocal cord activity. In that case, EEG would be like a group of microphones placed outside the stadium, against the stadium’s outer walls. You’d be able to hear when the crowd was cheering and maybe predict the type of thing they were cheering about. You’d be able to hear telltale signs that it was between innings and maybe whether or not it was a close game. You could probably detect when something abnormal happened.

So the sound is much crisper than what EEG mics get from outside the stadium, and ECoG mics can better distinguish the sounds of individual sections of the crowd. But the improvement comes at a cost—it requires invasive surgery. In the scheme of invasive surgeries, though, it’s not so bad. As one neurosurgeon described to me, “You can slide stuff underneath the dura relatively non-invasively. You still have to make a hole in the head, but it’s relatively non-invasive.”</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Local Field Potential</strong></span></p> \n<p><strong>Scale: </strong>low</p> \n<p><strong>Resolution: </strong>medium-low spatial, high temporal</p> \n<p><strong>Invasiveness: </strong>very invasive</p> \n<p>Okay here’s where we shift from surface electrode discs to microelectrodes—tiny needles surgeons stick into the brain.</p> \n<p>Brain surgeon Ben Rapoport described to me how his father (a neurologist) used to make microelectrodes:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>When my father was making electrodes, he’d make them by hand. He’d take a very fine wire—like a gold or platinum or iridium wire, that was 10-30 microns in diameter, and he’d insert that wire in a glass capillary tube that was maybe a millimeter in diameter. Then they’d take that piece of glass over a flame and rotate it until the glass became soft. They’d stretch out the capillary tube until it’s incredibly thin, and then take it out of the flame and break it. Now the capillary tube is flush with and pinching the wire. The glass is an insulator and the wire is a conductor. So what you end up with is a glass-insulated stiff electrode that is maybe a few 10s of microns at the tip.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Today, while some electrodes are still made by hand, newer techniques use silicon wafers and manufacturing technology borrowed from the integrated circuits industry.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The way local field potentials (LFP) work is simple—you take one of these super thin needles with an electrode tip and stick it one or two millimeters into the cortex. There it picks up the average of the electrical charges from all of the neurons within a certain radius of the electrode.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">LFP gives you the not-that-bad spatial resolution of the fMRI combined with the instant temporal resolution of an ECoG. Kind of the best of all the worlds described above when it comes to resolution.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Unfortunately, it does badly on both other criteria.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Unlike fMRI, EEG, and ECoG, microelectrode LFP does not have scale—it <em>only</em> tells you what the little sphere surrounding it is doing. And it’s far more invasive, actually entering the brain.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">In the baseball stadium, LFP is a single microphone hanging over a single section of seats, picking up a crisp feed of the sounds in that area, and maybe picking out an individual voice for a second here and there—but otherwise only getting the general vibe.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">A more recent development is the <strong>multielectrode array, </strong>which is the same idea as the LFP except it’s about 100 LFPs all at once, in a single area of the cortex. A multielectrode array looks like this:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-37-6120\" id=\"note2-37-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">37</a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Focus-stack-penny_sm.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6162 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Focus-stack-penny_sm-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"549\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Focus-stack-penny_sm.jpg 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Focus-stack-penny_sm-300x200.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Focus-stack-penny_sm-103x70.jpg 103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">A tiny 4mm x 4mm square with 100 tiny silicon electrodes on it.

This wipes out most of the noise and leaves the electrode picking up almost nothing—until it finds itself <em>so </em>close to a neuron (maybe 50µm away) that the signal from that neuron is strong enough to make it past the electrode’s high resistance wall. With distinct signals from one neuron and no background noise, this electrode can now voyeur in on the private life of a single neuron.

But this is a short-term technique—a punctured neuron won’t survive long.</p> \n<p>In our stadium, a single unit recording is a one-directional microphone clipped to a single crowd member’s collar. A patch clamp or sharp recording is a mic in someone’s throat, registering the exact movement of their vocal cords. This is a great way to learn about that person’s experience at the game, but it also gives you no context, and you can’t really tell if the sounds and reactions of that person are representative of what’s going on in the game.</p> \n<p>And that’s about what we’ve got, at least in common usage. These tools are simultaneously unbelievably advanced and what will seem like Stone Age technology to future humans, who won’t believe you had to choose <em>either </em>high-res <em>or </em>a wide field and that you actually had to open someone’s <em>skull </em>to get high-quality brain readouts or write-ins.</p> \n<p>But given their limitations, these tools have taught us worlds about the brain and led to the creation of some amazing early BMIs. Here’s what’s already out there—</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>The BMIs we already have</strong></span></p> \n<p>In 1969, a researcher named Eberhard Fetz connected a single neuron in a monkey’s brain to a dial in front of the monkey’s face. The dial would move when the neuron was fired. When the monkey would think in a way that fired the neuron and the dial would move, he’d get a banana-flavored pellet. Over time, the monkey started getting <em>better </em>at the game because he wanted more delicious pellets. The monkey had learned to make the neuron fire and inadvertently became the subject of the first real brain-machine interface.</p> \n<p>Progress was slow over the next few decades, but by the mid-90s, things had started to move, and it’s been quietly accelerating ever since.</p> \n<p>Given that both our understanding of the brain and the electrode hardware we’ve built are pretty primitive, our efforts have typically focused on building straightforward interfaces to be used with the areas of the brain we understand the best, like the motor cortex and the visual cortex.</p> \n<p>And given that human experimentation is only really possible for people who are trying to use BMIs to alleviate an impairment—and because that’s currently where the market demand is—our efforts have focused so far almost entirely on restoring lost function to people with disabilities.</p> \n<p>The major BMI industries of the future that will give all humans magical superpowers and transform the world are in their fetal stage right now—and we should look at what’s being worked on as a set of clues about what the mind-boggling worlds of 2040 and 2060 and 2100 might be like.</p> \n<p>Like, check this out:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NV_0215_Hood_alan-turing-first-computer.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6175 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NV_0215_Hood_alan-turing-first-computer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"654\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NV_0215_Hood_alan-turing-first-computer.jpg 800w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NV_0215_Hood_alan-turing-first-computer-300x178.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NV_0215_Hood_alan-turing-first-computer-768x456.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NV_0215_Hood_alan-turing-first-computer-600x356.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px\" /></a></p> \n<p>That’s a computer built by Alan Turing in 1950 called the Pilot ACE.

And we’ll come back to the blank later in the post.</p> \n<p>Anyway, from everything I’ve read about and discussed with people in the field, there seem to be three major categories of brain-machine interface being heavily worked on right now:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Early BMI type #1: Using the motor cortex as a remote control</strong></span></p> \n<p>In case you forgot this from 9,000 words ago, the motor cortex is this guy:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ucNSNTDc4yMxayeRNXNlpw_m.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6133 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ucNSNTDc4yMxayeRNXNlpw_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"210\" /></a></p> \n<p>All areas of the brain confuse us, but the motor cortex confuses us less than almost all the other areas. And most importantly, it’s <em>well-mapped</em>, meaning specific parts of it control specific parts of the body (remember the upsetting <a href=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/152-KB-Homonculus-Sensory-and-Motor-Cortex.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"” noopener noreferrer\">homunculus?</a>).</p> \n<p>Also importantly, it’s one of the major areas of the brain in charge of our <em>output</em>. When a human <em>does </em>something, the motor cortex is almost always the one pulling the strings (at least for the physical part of the doing). So the human brain doesn’t really have to <em>learn </em>to use the motor cortex as a remote control, because the brain already uses the motor cortex as its remote control.</p> \n<p>Lift your hand up. Now put it down. See? Your hand is like a little toy drone, and your brain just picked up the motor cortex remote control and used it to make the drone fly up and then back down.</p> \n<p>The goal of motor cortex-based BMIs is to tap into the motor cortex, and then when the remote control fires a command, to <em>hear </em>that command and then send it to some kind of machine that can respond to it the way, say, your hand would. A bundle of nerves is the middleman between your motor cortex and your hand. BMIs are the middleman between your motor cortex and a computer. Simple.</p> \n<p>One barebones type of interface allows a human—often a person paralyzed from the neck down or someone who has had a limb amputated—to move a cursor on a screen with only their thoughts.</p> \n<p>This begins with a 100-pin multielectrode array being implanted in the person’s motor cortex. The motor cortex in a paralyzed person usually works just fine—it’s just that the spinal cord, which had served as the middleman between the cortex and the body, stopped doing its job. So with the electrode array implanted, researchers have the person <em>try </em>to move their arm in different directions. Even though they can’t do that, the motor cortex still fires normally, as if they can.</p> \n<p>When someone moves their arm, their motor cortex bursts into a flurry of activity—but each neuron is usually only interested in one type of movement. So one neuron might fire whenever the person moves their arm to the right—but it’s bored by other directions and is less active in those cases. That neuron alone, then, could tell a computer when the person wants to move their arm to the right and when they don’t. But that’s all. But with an electrode <em>array</em>, 100 single-unit electrodes each listen to a different neuron.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-24-6120\" id=\"note-24-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a> So when they do testing, they’ll ask the person to try to move their arm to the right, and maybe 38 of the 100 electrodes detect their neuron firing. When the person tries to go left with their arm, maybe 41 others fire. After going through a bunch of different movements and directions and speeds, a computer takes the data from the electrodes and synthesizes it into a general understanding of which firing patterns correspond to which movement intentions on an X-Y axis.</p> \n<p>Then when they link up that data to a computer screen, the person can use their mind, via “trying” to move the cursor, to really control the cursor. And this actually works. Through the work of motor-cortex-BMI pioneer company <a href=\"https://www.braingate.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BrainGate</a>, here’s a guy playing a video game using only his mind.</p> \n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TJJPbpHoPWo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p> \n<p>And if 100 neurons can tell you where they want to move a cursor, why couldn’t they tell you when they want to pick up a mug of coffee and take a sip?

Brazilian BMI pioneer <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/miguel_nicolelis_brain_to_brain_communication_has_arrived_how_we_did_it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Miguel Nicolelis</a> and his team built an entire <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=76&amp;v=mg8TAJdQKyY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exoskeleton</a> that allowed a paralyzed man to make the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inCvbDLfXBo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">opening kick</a> of the World Cup.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-25-6120\" id=\"note-25-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></p> \n<div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n <p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The Proprioception Blue Box</strong></span></p> \n <p>Moving these kinds of “neuroprosthetics” is all about the recording of neurons, but for these devices to be truly effective, this needs to not be a one-way street, but a <em>loop </em>that includes recording <em>and </em>stimulation pathways. We don’t really think about this, but a huge part of your ability to pick up an object is all of the incoming sensory information your hand’s skin and muscles send back in (called “proprioception”). In one video I saw, a woman with numbed fingers tried to light a match, and it was almost impossible for her to do it, despite having no other disabilities. And the beginning of <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x12647t_the-man-who-lost-his-body-bbc-documentary_tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this video</a> shows the physical struggles of a man with a perfectly functional motor cortex but impaired proprioception. So for something like a bionic arm to really feel like an arm, and to really be useful, it needs to be able to send sensory information back in.</p> \n <p>Stimulating neurons is even harder than recording them. As researcher Flip Sabes explained to me:</p> \n <p><em>If I record a pattern of activity, it doesn’t mean I can readily recreate that pattern of activity by just playing it back. You can compare it to the planets in the Solar System. You can watch the planets move around and record their movements. But then if you jumble them all up and later want to recreate the original motion of one of the planets, you can’t just take that one planet and put it back into its orbit, because it’ll be influenced by all the other planets. Likewise, neurons aren’t just working in isolation—so there’s a fundamental irreversibility there. On top of that, with all of the axons and dendrites, it’s hard to just stimulate the neurons you want to—because when you try, you’ll hit a whole jumble of them.</em></p> \n <p>Flip’s lab tries to deal with these challenges by getting the brain to help out. It turns out that if you reward a monkey with a succulent sip of orange juice when a single neuron fires, eventually the monkey will learn to make the neuron fire on demand. The neuron could then act as another kind of remote control. This means that normal motor cortex commands are only one possibility as a control mechanism. Likewise, until BMI technology gets good enough to perfect stimulation, you can use the brain’s neuroplasticity as a shortcut. If it’s too hard to make someone’s bionic fingertip touch something and send back information that feels just like the kind of sensation their own fingertip used to give them, the arm could instead send some <em>other </em>signal into the brain. At first, this would seem odd to the patient—but eventually the brain can learn to treat that signal as a new sense of touch. This concept is called “sensory substitution” and makes the brain a collaborator in BMI efforts.</p> \n</div> \n<p>In these developments are the seeds of other future breakthrough technologies—like brain-to-brain communication.</p> \n<p>Nicolelis created an <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3584574/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">experiment</a> where the motor cortex of one rat in Brazil was wired, via the internet, to the motor cortex of another rat in the US. The rat in Brazil was presented with two transparent boxes, each with a lever attached to it, and inside one of the boxes would be a treat. To attempt to get the treat, the rat would press the lever of the box that held the treat. Meanwhile, the rat in the US was in a similar cage with two similar boxes, except unlike the rat in Brazil, the boxes weren’t transparent and offered him no information about which of his two levers would yield a treat and which wouldn’t. The only info the US rat had were the signals his brain received from the Brazil rat’s motor cortex. The Brazil rat had the key knowledge—but the way the experiment worked, the rats only received treats when the US rat pressed the correct lever. If he pulled the wrong one, neither would. The amazing thing is that over time, the rats got <em>better</em> at this and began to work together, almost like a single nervous system—even though neither had any idea the other rat existed. The US rat’s success rate at choosing the correct lever with no information would have been 50%. With the signals coming from the Brazil rat’s brain, the success rate jumped to 64%. (Here’s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2_1dzwnNwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> of the rats doing their thing.)</p> \n<p>This has even worked, crudely, in people. Two people, in separate buildings, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111332\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">worked together</a> to play a video game. One could <em>see </em>the game, the other had the controller. Using simple EEG headsets, the player who could see the game would, without moving his hand, <em>think </em>about moving his hand to press the “shoot” button on a controller. Because their brains’ devices were communicating with each other, the player with the controller would then feel a twitch in his finger and press the shoot button.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Early BMI type #2: Artificial ears and eyes</strong></span></p> \n<p>There are a couple reasons giving sound to the deaf and sight to the blind is among the more manageable BMI categories.</p> \n<p>The first is that like the motor cortex, the sensory cortices are parts of the brain we tend to understand pretty well, partly because they too tend to be well-mapped.</p> \n<p>The second is that in many early applications, we don’t <em>really </em>need to deal with the brain—we can just deal with the place where ears and eyes <em>connect </em>to the brain, since that’s often where the impairment is based.</p> \n<p>And while the motor cortex stuff was mostly about <em>recording </em>neurons to get information <em>out</em> of the brain, artificial senses go the other way—<em>stimulation</em> of neurons to send information <em>in.</em></p> \n<p>On the ears side of things, recent decades have seen the development of the groundbreaking <strong>cochlear implant</strong>. <strong> </strong></p> \n<div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n <p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The How Hearing Works Blue Box</strong></span></p> \n <p>When you think you’re “hearing” “sound,” here’s what’s actually happening:</p> \n <p>What we think of as sound is actually patterns of vibrations in the air molecules around your head. When a guitar string or someone’s vocal cords or the wind or anything else makes a sound, it’s because it’s vibrating, which pushes nearby air molecules into a similar vibration and that pattern expands outward in a sphere, kind of like the surface of water expands outward in a circular ripple when something touches it.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-26-6120\" id=\"note-26-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></p> \n <p>Your ear is a machine that converts those air vibrations into electrical impulses. Whenever air (or water, or any other medium whose molecules can vibrate) enters your ear, your ear translates the precise way it’s vibrating into an electrical code that it sends into the nerve endings that touch it. This causes those nerves to fire a pattern of action potentials that send the code into your auditory cortex for processing. Your brain receives the information, and we call the experience of receiving that particular type of information “hearing.”</p> \n <p>Most people who are deaf or hard of hearing don’t have a nerve problem or an auditory cortex problem—they usually have an ear problem. Their brain is as ready as anyone else’s to turn electrical impulses into hearing—it’s just that their auditory cortex isn’t <em>receiving</em> any electrical impulses in the first place, because the machine that converts air vibrations into those impulses isn’t doing its job.</p> \n <p>The ear has a lot of parts, but it’s the cochlea in particular that makes the key conversion. When vibrations enter the fluid in the cochlea, it causes thousands of tiny hairs lining the cochlea to vibrate, and the cells those hairs are attached to transform the mechanical energy of the vibrations into electrical signals that then excite the auditory nerve. Here’s what it all looks like:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-40-6120\" id=\"note2-40-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">40</a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6170 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"577\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna.jpg 800w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna-300x256.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna-768x655.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/otitis-interna-600x512.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" /></a></p> \n <p>The cochlea also sorts the incoming sound by frequency.

He knows that large-scale world change happens quickest when the whole world—the Human Colossus—is working on it. And he knows that the Human Colossus will work toward a goal if (and only if) there’s an economic forcing function in place—if it’s a good business decision to spend resources innovating toward that goal.</p> \n<p>Often, before a booming industry starts booming, it’s like a pile of logs—it has all the ingredients of a fire and it’s ready to go—but there’s no match. There’s some technological shortcoming that’s preventing the industry from taking off.</p> \n<p>So when Elon builds a company, its core initial strategy is usually to create the match that will ignite the industry and get the Human Colossus working on the cause. This, in turn, Elon believes, will lead to developments that will change the world in the way that increases the likelihood of humanity having the best possible future. But you have to look at his companies from a zoomed-out perspective to see all of this. If you don’t, you’ll mistake what they do as their business for what they <em>do</em>—when in fact, what they do as their business is usually a mechanism to sustain the company while it innovates to try to make that critical match.</p> \n<p>Back when I was working on the Tesla and SpaceX posts, I asked Elon why he went into engineering and not science, and he explained that when it comes to progress, “engineering is the limiting factor.” In other words, the progress of science, business, and industry are all at the whim of the progress of engineering. If you look at history, this makes sense—behind each of the greatest revolutions in human progress is an engineering breakthrough.

Elon being CEO makes this different from other recent things he’s started and puts Neuralink on the top tier for him, where only SpaceX and Tesla have lived. When it comes to neuroscience, Elon has the least technical knowledge on the team—but he also started SpaceX without very much technical knowledge and quickly became a certifiable rocket science expert by reading and by asking questions of the experts on the team. That’ll probably happen again here. (And for good reason—he pointed out: “Without a strong technical understanding, I think it’s hard to make the right decisions.”)</p> \n</div> \n<p>I asked Elon about how he brought this team together. He said that he met with literally over 1,000 people in order to assemble this group, and that part of the challenge was the large number of totally separate areas of expertise required when you’re working on technology that involves neuroscience, brain surgery, microscopic electronics, clinical trials, etc. Because it was such a cross-disciplinary area, he looked for cross-disciplinary experts. And you can see that in those bios—everyone brings their own unique crossover combination to a group that together has the rare ability to think as a single mega-expert. Elon also wanted to find people who were totally on board with the zoomed-out mission—who were more focused on industrial results than producing white papers. Not an easy group to assemble.</p> \n<p>But there they were, sitting around the table looking at me, as it hit me 40 seconds in that I should have done a lot more research before coming here.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6412\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2.png 1239w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2-300x275.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2-768x705.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dumbest-person-2-600x551.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p>They took the hint and dumbed it down about four notches, and as the discussion went on, I started to wrap my head around things. Throughout the next few weeks, I met with each of the remaining Neuralink team members as well, each time playing the role of the dumbest person in the room. In these meetings, I focused on trying to form a comprehensive picture of the challenges at hand and what the road to a wizard hat might look like. I really wanted to understand these two boxes:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6450\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02.png 1800w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02-300x207.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02-768x529.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02-600x413.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-v2_02-103x70.png 103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The first one was easy. The <em>business </em>side of Neuralink is a brain-machine interface development company. They want to create cutting-edge BMIs—what one of them referred to as “micron-sized devices.” Doing this will support the growth of the company while also providing a perfect vehicle for putting their innovations into practice (the same way SpaceX uses their launches both to sustain the company and experiment with their newest engineering developments).</p> \n<p>As for what kind of interface they’re planning to work on first, here’s what Elon said:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">We are aiming to bring something to market that helps with certain severe brain injuries (stroke, cancer lesion, congenital) in about four years. </span></em></p> \n<p>The second box was a lot hazier. It seems obvious to us today that using steam engine technology to harness the power of fire was the thing that had to happen to ignite the Industrial Revolution. But if you talked to someone in 1760 about it, they would have had a lot less clarity—on exactly which hurdles they were trying to get past, what kinds of innovations would allow them to leap over those hurdles, or how long any of this would take. And that’s where we are here—trying to figure out what the match looks like that will ignite the neuro revolution and how to create it.</p> \n<p>The starting place for a discussion about innovation is a discussion about hurdles—what are you even trying to innovate <em>past? </em>In Neuralink’s case, a whole lot of things. But given that, here too, engineering will likely prove to be the limiting factor, here are some seemingly large challenges that probably <em>won’t</em> end up being the major roadblock:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Public skepticism </strong></span></p> \n<p>Pew recently conducted a <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/07/26/u-s-public-wary-of-biomedical-technologies-to-enhance-human-abilities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">survey</a> asking Americans about which future biotechnologies give them the shits the most.

We have deep brain stimulation to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, we have early trials of chips to restore vision, we have the cochlear implant—so to us it doesn’t seem like that big of a stretch to put devices into a brain to read information out and to read information back in.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And after learning all about chips in the brain, I agree—and when Americans eventually learn about it, I think they’ll change their minds.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">History supports this prediction. People were super timid about Lasik eye surgery when it first became a thing—20 years ago, 20,000 people a year had the procedure done. Then everyone got used to it and now 2,000,000 people a year get laser eye surgery. Similar story with pacemakers. And defibrillators. And organ transplants—which people at first considered a freakish Frankenstein-esque concept. Brain implants will probably be the same story.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Our non-understanding of the brain</strong></span></p> \n<p>You know, the whole “if understanding the brain is a mile, we’re currently three inches in” thing. Flip weighed in on this topic too:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>If it were a prerequisite to understand the brain in order to interact with the brain in a substantive way, we’d have trouble. But it’s possible to decode all of those things in the brain without truly understanding the dynamics of the computation in the brain. Being able to read it out is an engineering problem. Being able to understand its origin and the organization of the neurons in fine detail in a way that would satisfy a neuroscientist to the core—that’s a separate problem. And we don’t need to solve all of those scientific problems in order to make progress.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">If we can just use engineering to get neurons to talk to computers, we’ll have done our job, and machine learning can do much of the rest. Which then, ironically, <em>will </em>teach us about the brain. As Flip points out:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>The flip side of saying, “We don’t need to understand the brain to make engineering progress,” is that making engineering progress will almost certainly advance our scientific knowledge—kind of like the way Alpha Go ended up teaching the world’s best players better strategies for the game. Then this scientific progress can lead to more engineering progress. The engineering and the science are gonna ratchet each other up here.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Angry giants</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Tesla and SpaceX are both stepping on some very big toes (like the auto industry, the oil and gas industry, and the military-industrial complex). Big toes don’t like being stepped on, so they’ll usually do whatever they can to hinder the stepper’s progress. Luckily, Neuralink doesn’t really have this problem. There aren’t any massive industries that Neuralink is disrupting (at least not in the foreseeable future—an eventual neuro revolution would disrupt almost <em>every </em>industry).</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Neuralink’s hurdles are technology hurdles—and there are many. But two challenges stand out as the largest—challenges that, if conquered, may be impactful enough to trigger all the other hurdles to fall and totally change the trajectory of our future.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>Major Hurdle 1: Bandwidth</strong></span></p> \n<p>There have never been more than a couple hundred electrodes in a human brain at once. When it comes to vision, that equals a super low-res image. When it comes to motor, that limits the possibilities to simple commands with little control. When it comes to your thoughts, a few hundred electrodes won’t be enough to communicate more than the simplest spelled-out message.</p> \n<p>We need higher bandwidth if this is gonna become a big thing. <em>Way</em> higher bandwidth.</p> \n<p>The Neuralink team threw out the number “one million simultaneously recorded neurons” when talking about an interface that could really change the world. I’ve also heard 100,000 as a number that would allow for the creation of a wide range of incredibly useful BMIs with a variety of applications.</p> \n<p>Early computers had a similar problem. Primitive transistors took up a lot of space and didn’t scale easily. Then in 1959 came the integrated circuit—the computer chip. Now there was a way to scale the number of transistors in a computer, and Moore’s Law—the concept that the number of transistors that can fit onto a computer chip doubles every 18 months—was born.</p> \n<p>Until the 90s, electrodes for BMIs were all made by hand. Then we started figuring out how to manufacture those little 100-electrode <a href=\"https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/electrodex299.jpg?sw=280\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">multielectrode arrays</a> using conventional semiconductor technologies. Neurosurgeon Ben Rapoport believes that “the move from hand manufacturing to Utah Array electrodes was the first hint that BMIs were entering a realm where Moore’s Law could become relevant.”</p> \n<p>This is everything for the industry’s potential. Our maximum today is a couple hundred electrodes able to measure about 500 neurons at once—which is either super far from a million or really close, depending on the kind of growth pattern we’re in. If we add 500 more neurons to our maximum every 18 months, we’ll get to a million in the year 5017. If we <em>double </em>our total every 18 months, like we do with computer transistors, we’ll get to a million in the year 2034.</p> \n<p>Currently, we seem to be somewhere in between. Ian Stevenson and Konrad Kording published a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n2/abs/nn.2731.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">paper</a> that looked at the maximum number of neurons that could be simultaneously recorded at various points throughout the last 50 years (in <em>any </em>animal), and put the results on this graph:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-45-6120\" id=\"note2-45-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">45</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mooreslaw.chartx2400.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6178 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mooreslaw.chartx2400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"555\" height=\"616\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mooreslaw.chartx2400.jpg 1200w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mooreslaw.chartx2400-270x300.jpg 270w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mooreslaw.chartx2400-768x853.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mooreslaw.chartx2400-540x600.jpg 540w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Sometimes called Stevenson’s Law, this research suggests that the number of neurons we can simultaneously record seems to consistently double every 7.4 years. If that rate continues, it’ll take us till the end of this century to reach a million, and until 2225 to record every neuron in the brain and get our totally complete wizard hat.</p> \n<p>Whatever the equivalent of the integrated circuit is for BMIs isn’t here yet, because 7.4 years is too big a number to start a revolution. The breakthrough here isn’t the device that can record a million neurons—it’s the paradigm shift that makes the future of that graph look more like Moore’s Law and less like Stevenson’s Law. Once that happens, a million neurons will follow.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>Major Hurdle 2: Implantation</strong></span></p> \n<p>BMIs won’t sweep the world as long as you need to go in for skull-opening surgery to get involved.</p> \n<p>This is a major topic at Neuralink. I think the word “non-invasive” or “non-invasively” came out of someone’s mouth like 42 times in my discussions with the team.</p> \n<p>On top of being both a major barrier to entry and a major safety issue, invasive brain surgery is expensive and in limited supply. Elon talked about an eventual BMI implantation process that could be automated: “The machine to accomplish this would need to be something like Lasik, an automated process—because otherwise you just get constrained by the limited number of neural surgeons, and the costs are very high. You’d need a Lasik-like machine ultimately to be able to do this at scale.”</p> \n<p>Making BMIs high-bandwidth alone would be a huge deal, as would developing a way to non-invasively implant devices. But doing <em>both </em>would start a revolution.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Other hurdles</strong></span></p> \n<p>Today’s BMI patients have a wire coming out of their head. In the future, that certainly won’t fly. Neuralink plans to work on devices that will be wireless. But that brings a lot of new challenges with it. You’ll now need your device to be able to send and receive a lot of data wirelessly. Which means the implant also has to take care of things like signal amplification, analog-to-digital conversion, and data compression on its own. Oh and it needs to be powered inductively.</p> \n<p>Another big one—biocompatibility. Delicate electronics tend to not do well inside a jello ball. And the human body tends to not like having foreign objects in it. But the brain interfaces of the future are intended to last forever without any problems. This means that the device will likely need to be hermetically sealed and robust enough to survive decades of the oozing and shifting of the neurons around it. And the brain—which treats today’s devices like invaders and eventually covers them in scar tissue—will need to somehow be tricked into thinking the device is just a normal brain part doing its thing.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-29-6120\" id=\"note-29-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></p> \n<p>Then there’s the space issue. Where exactly are you gonna put your device that can interface with a million neurons in a skull that’s already dealing with making space for 100 billion neurons? A million electrodes using today’s multielectrode arrays would be the size of a baseball. So further miniaturization is another dramatic innovation to add to the list.</p> \n<p>There’s also the fact that today’s electrodes are mostly optimized for simple electrical recording or simple electrical stimulation. If we really want an effective brain interface, we’ll need something other than single-function, stiff electrodes—something with the mechanical complexity of neural circuits, that can both record and stimulate, and that can interact with neurons chemically and mechanically as well as electrically.</p> \n<p>And just say all of this comes together perfectly—a high-bandwidth, long-lasting, biocompatible, bidirectional communicative, non-invasively-implanted device. Now we can speak back and forth with a million neurons at once! Except this little thing where we actually don’t know how to talk to neurons. It’s complicated enough to decode the static-like firings of 100 neurons, but all we’re really doing is learning what a set of specific firings corresponds to and matching them up to simple commands. That won’t work with millions of signals. It’s like how Google Translate essentially uses two dictionaries to swap words from one dictionary to another—which is very different than <em>understanding language. </em>We’ll need a pretty big leap in machine learning before a computer will be able to actually know a language, and we’ll need just as big a leap for machines to understand the language of the brain—because humans certainly won’t be learning to decipher the code of millions of simultaneously chattering neurons.</p> \n<p>How easy does colonizing Mars seem right now.</p> \n<p>But I bet the telephone and the car and the moon landing would have seemed like insurmountable technological challenges to people a few decades earlier.

I also focused a large portion of my talks with Elon on the far future possibilities and had other helpful discussions with Moran Cerf, a neuroscientist friend of mine who <a href=\"http://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-if-we-could-look-inside-human-brains-moran-cerf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">works on BMIs</a> and thinks a lot about the long-term outlook. Finally, one reluctant-to-talk-about-his-predictions Neuralink team member told me that of course, he and his colleagues <em>were</em> dreamers—otherwise they wouldn’t be doing what they’re doing—and that many of them were inspired to get into this industry by science fiction. He recommended I talk to Ramez Naam, writer of the popular <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2pqeLNy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Nexus Trilogy</em></a>, a series all about the future of BMIs, and also someone with a hard tech background that includes 19 software-related patents. So I had a chat with Ramez to round out the picture and ask him the 435 remaining questions I had about everything.</p> \n<p>And I came out of all of it utterly blown away. I wrote <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">once</a> about how I think if you went back to 1750—a time when there was no electricity or motorized vehicles or telecommunication—and retrieved, say, George Washington, and brought him to today and showed him our world, he’d be so shocked by everything that he’d die. You’d have killed George Washington and messed everything up. Which got me thinking about the concept of how many years one would need to go into the future such that the ensuing shock from the level of progress would kill you. I called it a Die Progress Unit, or DPU.</p> \n<p>Ever since the Human Colossus was born, our world has had a weird property to it—it gets more <em>magical</em> as time goes on. That’s why DPUs are a thing. And because advancement begets more rapid advancement, the trend is that as time passes, the DPUs get <em>shorter</em>. For George Washington, a DPU was a couple hundred years, which is outrageously short in the scheme of human history. But we now live in a time where things are moving <em>so </em>fast that we might experience one or even multiple DPUs <em>in our lifetime</em>. The amount that changed between 1750 and 2017 might happen again between now and another time when you’re still alive. This is a <em>ridiculous</em> time to be alive—it’s just hard for us to notice because we live life so zoomed in.</p> \n<p>Anyway, I think about DPUs a lot and I always wonder what it would feel like to go forward in a time machine and experience what George would experience coming here. What kind of future could blow my mind so hard that it would kill me? We can talk about things like AI and gene editing—and I have no doubt that progress in those areas could make me die of shock—but it’s always, “Who knows what it’ll be like!” Never a descriptive picture.</p> \n<p><a name=\"part5\"></a>I think I might finally have a descriptive picture of a piece of our shocking future. Let me paint it for you.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 28pt;\"><strong>Part 5: The Wizard Era</strong></span></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-5.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6439\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"238\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-5.png 747w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-5-243x300.png 243w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Brain-tree-Parts-5-487x600.png 487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The budding industry of brain-machine interfaces is the seed of a revolution that will change just about everything. But in many ways, the brain-interface future isn’t really a new <em>thing</em> that’s happening. If you take a step back, it looks more like the next big chapter in a trend that’s been going on for a long time. Language took forever to turn into writing, which then took forever to turn into printing, and that’s where things were when George Washington was around. Then came electricity and the pace picked up. Telephone. Radio. Television. Computers. And just like that, everyone’s homes became magical. Then phones became cordless. Then mobile. Computers went from being devices for work and games to windows into a digital world we all became a part of. Then phones and computers merged into an everything device that brought the magic out of our homes and put it into our hands. And on our wrists. We’re now in the early stages of a virtual and augmented reality revolution that will wrap the magic around our eyes and ears and bring our whole being into the digital world.</p> \n<p>You don’t need to be a futurist to see where this is going.</p> \n<p>Magic has worked its way from industrial facilities to our homes to our hands and soon it’ll be around our heads. And then it’ll take the next natural step. The magic is heading into our brains.</p> \n<p>It will happen by way of a “whole-brain interface,” or what I’ve been calling a wizard hat—a brain interface so complete, so smooth, so biocompatible, and so high-bandwidth that it feels as much a part of you as your cortex and limbic system. A whole-brain interface would give your brain the ability to communicate wirelessly with the cloud, with computers, and with the brains of anyone with a similar interface in their head. This flow of information between your brain and the outside world would be so effortless, it would feel similar to the thinking that goes on in your head today. And though we’ve used the term brain-machine interface so far, I kind of think of a BMI as a specific brain interface to be used for a specific purpose, and the term doesn’t quite capture the everything-of-everything concept of the whole-brain interface. So I’ll call that a wizard hat instead.</p> \n<p>Now, to fully absorb the implications of having a wizard hat installed in your head and what that would change about you, you’ll need to wrap your head around (no pun intended) two things:</p> \n<p><strong>1) The intensely <strong>mind-bending</strong> idea</strong></p> \n<p><strong>2) The super ridiculously intensely <strong>mind-bending</strong> idea</strong></p> \n<p>We’ll tackle #1 in this section and save #2 for the last section after you’ve had time to absorb #1.</p> \n<p>Elon calls the whole-brain interface and its many capabilities a “digital tertiary layer,” a term that has two levels of meaning that correspond to our two mind-bending ideas above.</p> \n<p>The first meaning gets at the idea of physical brain parts. We discussed three layers of brain parts—the brain stem (run by the frog), the limbic system (run by the monkey), and the cortex (run by the rational thinker). We were being thorough, but for the rest of this post, we’re going to leave the frog out of the discussion, since he’s entirely functional and lives mostly behind the scenes.</p> \n<p>When Elon refers to a “digital tertiary layer,” he’s considering our existing brain having two layers—our animal limbic system (which could be called our primary layer) and our advanced cortex (which could be called our secondary layer). The wizard hat interface, then, would be our tertiary layer—a new physical brain part to complement the other two.</p> \n<p>If thinking about this concept is giving you the willies, Elon has news for you:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>We already have a digital tertiary layer in a sense, in that you have your computer or your phone or your applications. You can ask a question via Google and get an answer instantly. You can access any book or any music. With a spreadsheet, you can do incredible calculations. If you had an Empire State building filled with people—even if they had calculators, let alone if they had to do it with a pencil and paper—one person with a laptop could outdo the Empire State Building filled with people with calculators. You can video chat with someone in freaking Timbuktu for free. This would’ve gotten you burnt for witchcraft in the old days. You can record as much video with sound as you want, take a zillion pictures, have them tagged with who they are and when it took place. You can broadcast communications through social media to millions of people simultaneously for free. These are incredible superpowers that the President of the United States didn’t have twenty years ago.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>The thing that people, I think, don’t appreciate right now is that they are already a cyborg. You’re already a different creature than you would have been twenty years ago, or even ten years ago. You’re already a different creature. You can see this when they do surveys of like, “how long do you want to be away from your phone?” and—particularly if you’re a teenager or in your 20s—even a day hurts. If you leave your phone behind, it’s like missing limb syndrome. I think people—they’re already kind of merged with their phone and their laptop and their applications and everything.</em></p> \n<p>This is a hard point to really absorb, because we don’t <em>feel </em>like cyborgs. We feel like humans who use devices to do things. But think about your digital self—you when you’re interacting with someone on the internet or over FaceTime or when you’re in a YouTube video. Digital you is fully you—as much as in-person you is you—right? The only difference is that you’re not there in person—you’re using magic powers to send yourself to somewhere far away, at light speed, through wires and satellites and electromagnetic waves. The difference is the medium.</p> \n<p>Before language, there wasn’t a good way to get a thought from your brain into my brain. Then early humans invented the technology of language, transforming vocal cords and ears into the world’s first communication devices and air as the first communication medium. We use these devices every time we talk to each other in person. It goes:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6307 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"617\" height=\"104\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1.png 617w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1-300x51.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-1-600x101.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Then we built upon that with another leap, inventing a second layer of devices, with its own medium, allowing us to talk long distance:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6308\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"69\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2.png 1322w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2-300x23.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2-768x59.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-2-600x46.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Or maybe:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6309\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"66\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3.png 1242w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3-300x23.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3-768x60.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Flow-3-600x47.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /></a></p> \n<p>In that sense, your phone is as much “you” as your vocal cords or your ears or your eyes. All of these things are simply tools to move thoughts from brain to brain—so who cares if the tool is held in your hand, your throat, or your eye sockets? The digital age has made us a dual entity—a physical creature who interacts with its physical environment using its biological parts and a digital creature whose digital devices—whose digital <em>parts</em>—allow it to interact with the digital world.</p> \n<p>But because we don’t think of it like that, we’d consider someone with a phone in their head or throat a cyborg and someone else with a phone in their hand, pressed up against their head, not a cyborg. Elon’s point is that the thing that makes a cyborg a cyborg is their capabilities—not from which side of the skull those capabilities are generated.</p> \n<p>We’re already a cyborg, we already have superpowers, and we already spend a huge part of our lives in the digital world. And when you think of it like that, you realize how obvious it is to want to upgrade the medium that connects us to that world. This is the change Elon believes is actually happening when the magic goes into our brains:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>You’re already digitally superhuman. The thing that would change is the interface—having a high-bandwidth interface to your digital enhancements. The thing is that today, the interface all necks down to this tiny straw, which is, particularly in terms of output, it’s like poking things with your meat sticks, or using words—either speaking or tapping things with fingers. And in fact, output has gone backwards. It used to be, in your most frequent form, output would be ten-finger typing. Now, it’s like, two-thumb typing. </em><em>That’s crazy slow communication. We should be able to improve that by many orders of magnitude with a direct neural interface.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">In other words, putting our technology into our brains isn’t about whether it’s good or bad to become cyborgs. It’s that we <em>are </em>cyborgs and we will <em>continue </em>to be cyborgs—so it probably makes sense to upgrade ourselves from primitive, low-bandwidth cyborgs to modern, high-bandwidth cyborgs.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">A whole-brain interface is that upgrade. It changes us from creatures whose primary and secondary layers live inside their heads and whose tertiary layer lives in their pocket, in their hand, or on their desk—</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-using-computer-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6264\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-using-computer-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"477\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-using-computer-1.png 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-using-computer-1-300x220.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-using-computer-1-768x563.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-using-computer-1-600x440.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p> \n<p>—to creatures whose three layers all live together.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6457\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"477\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer.jpg 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-300x220.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-768x563.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-600x440.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Your life is full of devices, including the one you’re currently using to read this.

Interface bandwidth allows incoming images to be HD, incoming sound to be hi-fi, and motor movement commands to be tightly controlled—but it’s also a huge factor in communication. If information were a milkshake, bandwidth would be the width of the straw. Today, the bandwidth-of-communication graph looks something like this:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communication-Speed-GRAPH-1.png\"

straw and typing (let alone texting) would be like trying to drink a milkshake through a syringe needle—you might be able to get a drop out once a minute.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Moran Cerf has gathered data on the actual bandwidth of different parts of the nervous system and on this graph, he compares them to equivalent bandwidths in the computer world:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a

here on Moran’s graph that the disparity in bandwidth between the ways we communicate and our thinking (which is at 30 bits/second on this graph) is even starker than my graph above depicts.</p> \n<p

class=\"p1\">We’d still be using straws, but <em>far </em>bigger, more effective ones.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But it’s not just about the speed of communication. As Elon points out, it’s about the <em>nuance </em>and <em>accuracy</em> of communication as well:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>There are a bunch of concepts in your head that then your brain has to try to compress into this incredibly low data rate called speech or typing. That’s what language is—your brain has executed a compression algorithm on thought, on concept transfer. And then it’s got to listen as well, and decompress what’s coming at it. And this is very lossy as well. So, then when you’re doing the decompression on those, trying to understand, you’re simultaneously trying to model the other person’s mind state to understand where they’re coming from, to recombine in your head what concepts they have in their head that they’re trying to communicate to you. … If you have two brain interfaces, you could actually do an uncompressed direct conceptual communication with another person.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This makes sense—nuance is like a <em>high-resolution thought</em>, which makes the file simply too big to transfer quickly through a coffee straw. The coffee straw gives you two bad options when it comes to nuance: take a <em>lot </em>of time saying a lot of words to really depict the nuanced thought or imagery you want to convey to me, or save time by using succinct language—but inevitably fail to transfer over the nuance. Compounding the effect is the fact that language itself is a low-resolution medium. A word is simply an <em>approximation</em> of a thought—buckets that a whole category of similar-but-distinct thoughts can all be shoved into. If I watch a horror movie and want to describe it to you in words, I’m stuck with a few simple low-res buckets—“scary” or “creepy” or “chilling” or “intense.” My actual impression of that movie is very specific and not exactly like any other movie I’ve seen—but the crude tools of language force my brain to “round to the nearest bucket” and choose the word that most closely resembles my actual impression, and that’s the information you’ll receive from me. You won’t receive the thought—you’ll receive the <em>bucket</em>—and now you’ll have to guess which of the <em>many </em>nuanced impressions that all approximate to that bucket is the most similar to my impression of the movie. You’ll decompress my description—“scary as shit”—into a high-res, nuanced thought that <em>you </em>associate with “scary as shit,” which will inevitably be based on your own experience watching other horror movies, and your own personality. The end result is that a lot has been lost in translation—which is exactly what you’d expect when you try to transfer a high-res file over a low-bandwidth medium, quickly, using low-res tools. That’s why Elon calls language data transfer “lossy.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">We do the best we can with these limitations—and over time, we’ve supplemented language with slightly higher-resolution formats like video to better convey nuanced imagery, or music to better convey nuanced emotion. But compared to the richness and uniqueness of the ideas in our heads, and the large-bandwidth straw our internal <em>thoughts</em> flow through, all human-to-human communication is very lossy.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Thinking about the phenomenon of communication as what it is—brains trying to share things with each other—you see the history of communication not as this:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6305 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"405\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-1.png 592w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-1-211x300.png 211w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-1-421x600.png 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">As much as this:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6306 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"424\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-2.png 592w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-2-300x208.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-2-103x70.png 103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Or it could be put this way:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-3.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6465\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"424\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-3.png 592w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-3-300x208.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communcation-Hacks-3-103x70.png 103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">It really may be that the second major era of communication—the 100,000-year Era of Indirect Communication—is in its very last moments. If we zoom out on the timeline, it’s possible the entire last 150 years, during which we’ve suddenly been <em>rapidly </em>improving our communication media, will look to far-future humans like one concept: the transition from Era 2 to Era 3. We might be living <em>on </em>the line that divides timeline sections.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6464\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline.png 1545w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline-300x109.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline-768x280.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Communications-hacks-timeline-600x219.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And because indirect communication requires third-party body parts or digital parts, the end of Era 2 may be looked back upon as the era of physical devices. In an era where your brain is the device, there will be no need to carry anything around. You’ll have your body and, if you want, clothes—and that’s it.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">When Elon thinks about wizard hats, this is usually the stuff he’s thinking about—communication bandwidth and resolution. And we’ll explore why in Part 6 of this post.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">First, let’s dig into the mind-boggling concept of your brain becoming a device and talk about what a wizard hat world might be like.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">One thing to keep in mind as we think about all of this is that none of it will take you by surprise. You won’t go from having nothing in your brain to a digital tertiary layer in your head, just like people didn’t go from the Apple IIGS to using Tinder overnight. The Wizard Era will come gradually, and by the time the shift actually begins to happen, we’ll all be very used to the technology, and it’ll seem normal.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Supporting this point is the fact the staircase up to the Wizard Era has already started, and you haven’t even noticed. But there are thousands of people currently walking around with electrodes in their brain, like those with cochlear implants, retinal implants, and deep brain implants—all benefiting from early BMIs.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The next few steps on the staircase will continue to focus on restoring lost function in different parts of the body—the first people to have their lives transformed by digital brain technology will be the disabled. As specialized BMIs serve more and more forms of disability, the concept of brain implants will work its way in from the fringes and become something we’re all used to—just like no one blinks an eye when you say your friend just got Lasik surgery or your grandmother just got a pacemaker installed.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Elon talks about some types of people early BMIs could help:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>The first use of the technology will be to repair brain injuries as a result of stroke or cutting out a cancer lesion, where somebody’s fundamentally lost a certain cognitive element. It could help with people who are quadriplegics or paraplegics by providing a neural shunt from the motor cortex down to where the muscles are activated. It can help with people who, as they get older, have memory problems and can’t remember the names of their kids, through memory enhancement, which could allow them to function well to a much later time in life—the medically advantageous elements of this for dealing with mental disablement of one kind or another, which of course happens to all of us when we get old enough, are very significant.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">As someone who lost a grandfather to dementia five years before losing him to death, I’m excited to hear this.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And as interface bandwidth improves, disabilities that hinder millions today will start to drop like flies. The concepts of complete blindness and deafness—whether centered in the sensory organs or in the brain<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-31-6120\" id=\"note-31-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a>—are already on the way out. And with enough time, perfect vision or hearing will be restorable.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Prosthetic limbs—and eventually sleek, full-body exoskeletons underneath your clothes—will work so well, providing both outgoing motor functions and an incoming sense of touch, that paralysis or amputations will only have a minor long-term effect on people’s lives.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">In Alzheimer’s patients, memories themselves are often not lost—only the bridge to those memories. Advanced BMIs could help restore that bridge or serve as a new one.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">While this is happening, BMIs will begin to emerge that people <em>without</em> disabilities want. The very early adopters will probably be pretty rich. But so were the early cell phone adopters.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-52-6120\" id=\"note2-52-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">52</a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gordon-gekko-RS.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6189 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gordon-gekko-RS.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"308\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gordon-gekko-RS.jpg 405w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gordon-gekko-RS-150x150.jpg 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gordon-gekko-RS-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">That’s Gordon Gekko, and that 1983, two-pound cell phone cost almost <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2010/09/23/gordon_gekko_s_cell_phone.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$9,000</a> in today’s dollars. And now over half of living humans own a mobile phone—all of them far less shitty than Gordon Gekko’s.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">As mobile phones got cheaper, and better, they went from new and fancy and futuristic to ubiquitous. As we go down the same road with brain interfaces, things are going to get <em>really </em>cool.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Based on what I learned from my conversations with Elon, Ramez, and a dozen neuroscientists, let’s look at what the world might look like in a few decades. The timeline is uncertain, including the order in which the below developments may become a reality. And, of course, some of the below predictions are sure to be way off the mark, just as there will be other developments in this field that won’t be mentioned here because people today literally can’t imagine them yet.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But some version of a lot of this stuff probably<em> will</em> happen, at <em>some </em>point, and a lot of it could be in your lifetime.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Looking at all the predictions I heard, they seemed to fall into two broad categories: communication capabilities and internal enhancements.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>The Wizard Era: Communication</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6473\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading.png 818w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading-273x300.png 273w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading-768x843.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Communication-Heading-547x600.png 547w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Motor communication</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">“Communication” in this section can mean human-to-human or human-to-computer. Motor communication is all about human-to-computer—the whole “motor cortex as remote control” thing from earlier, but now the unbelievably rad version.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Like many future categories of brain interface possibility, motor communication will start with restoration applications for the disabled, and as those development efforts continually advance the possibilities, the technology will begin to be used to create <em>augmentation </em>applications for the non-disabled as well. The same technologies that will allow a quadriplegic to use their thoughts as a remote control to move a bionic limb can let anyone use their thoughts as a remote control…to move anything. Well not <em>anything—</em>I’m not talking about telekinesis—anything built to be used with a brain remote. But in the Wizard Era, <em>lots </em>of things will be built that way.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Your car (or whatever people use for transportation at that point) will pull up to your house and your mind will open the car door. You’ll walk up to the house and your mind will unlock and open the front door (all doors at that point will be built with sensors to receive motor cortex commands). You’ll think about wanting coffee and the coffee maker will get that going. As you head to the fridge the door will open and after getting what you need it’ll close as you walk away. When it’s time for bed, you’ll decide you want the heat turned down and the lights turned off, and those systems will feel you make that decision and adjust themselves.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">None of this stuff will take any effort or thought—we’ll all get very good at it and it’ll feel as automatic and subconscious as moving your eyes to read this sentence does to you now.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">People will play the piano with their thoughts. And do building construction. And steer vehicles. In fact, today, if you’re driving somewhere and something jumps out in the road in front of you, what neuroscientists know is that your brain sees it and begins to react well before your consciousness knows what’s going on or your arms move to steer out of the way. But when your brain is the one steering the car, you’ll have swerved out of the way before you even realize what happened.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Thought communication</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This is what we discussed up above—but you have to resist the natural instinct to equate a thought conversation with a normal language conversation where you simply hear each other’s voices in your head. As we discussed, words are compressed approximations of uncompressed thoughts, so why would you ever bother with any of that, or deal with lossiness, if you didn’t have to? When you watch a movie, your head is buzzing with thoughts—but do you have a compressed spoken word dialogue going on in your head? Probably not—you’re just <em>thinking</em>. Thought conversations will be like <em>that</em>.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Elon says:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>If I were to communicate a concept to you, you would essentially engage in consensual telepathy. You wouldn’t need to verbalize unless you want to add a little flair to the conversation or something (laughs), but the conversation would be conceptual interaction on a level that’s difficult to conceive of right now.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">That’s the thing—it’s difficult to really understand what it would be like to <em>think </em>with someone. We’ve never been able to try. We communicate with ourselves through thought and with everyone else through symbolic representations of thought, and that’s all we can imagine.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Even weirder is the concept of a <em>group </em>thinking together. This is what a group brainstorm could look like in the Wizard Era.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/thinking-brainstorm-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener

of course, they wouldn’t need to be in the same room. This group could have been in four different countries while this was happening—with no external devices in sight.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Ramez has <a href=\"http://rameznaam.com/2015/05/15/the-ultimate-interface-your-brain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">written about</a> the effect group thinking might have on the world:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">That type of communication would have a huge impact on the pace of innovation, as scientists and engineers could work more fluidly together. And it’s just as likely to have a transformative effect on the public sphere, in the same way that email, blogs, and Twitter have successively changed public discourse.</span></em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The idea of collaboration today is <em>supposed </em>to be two or more brains working together to come up with things none of them could have on their own. And a lot of the time, it works pretty well—but when you consider the “lost in transmission” phenomenon that happens with language, you realize how much more effective group thinking would be.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">I asked Elon a question that pops into everyone’s mind when they first hear about thought communication:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">“So, um, will everyone be able to know what I’m thinking?”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">He assured me they would not. “People won’t be able to read your thoughts—you would have to will it. If you don’t will it, it doesn’t happen. Just like if you don’t will your mouth to talk, it doesn’t talk.” Phew.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">You can also think with a computer. Not just to issue a command, but to actually brainstorm something with a computer. You and a computer could strategize something together. You could compose a piece of music together. Ramez talked about using a computer as an imagination collaborator: “You could imagine something, and the computer, which can better forward predict or analyze physical models, could fill in constraints—and that allows you to get feedback.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">One concern that comes up when people hear about thought communication in particular is a potential loss of individuality. Would this make us one great hive mind with each individual brain as just another bee? Almost across the board, the experts I talked to believed it would be the opposite. We could act as one in a collaboration when it served us, but technology has thus far enhanced human individuality. Think of how much easier it is for people today to express their individuality and customize life to themselves than it was 50 or 100 or 500 years ago. There’s no reason to believe that trend won’t continue with more progress.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Multimedia communication</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Similar to thought communication, but imagine how much easier it would be to describe a dream you had or a piece of music stuck in your head or a memory you’re thinking about if you could just beam the thing into someone’s head, like showing them on your computer screen. Or as Elon said, “I could think of a bouquet of flowers and have a very clear picture in my head of what that is. It would take a lot of words for you to even have an approximation of what that bouquet of flowers looks like.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">How much faster could a team of engineers or architects or designers plan out a new bridge or a new building or a new dress if they could beam the vision in their head onto a screen and others could adjust it with their minds, versus sketching things out—which not only takes far longer, but probably is inevitably lossy?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">How many symphonies could Mozart have written if he had been able to think the music in his head onto the page? How many Mozarts are out there right now who never learned how to play instruments well enough to get their talent out?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">I watched this <em>delightful</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_MSFkZHNi4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">animated short movie</a> the other day, and below the video the creator, Felix Colgrave, said the video took him two years. How much of that time was spent dreaming up the art versus painstakingly getting it from his head into the software? Maybe in a few decades, I’ll be able to watch animation streaming live out of Felix’s head.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Emotional communication</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Emotions are the quintessential example of a concept that words are poorly-equipped to accurately describe. If ten people say, “I’m sad,” it actually means ten different things. In the Wizard Era, we’ll probably learn pretty quickly that the specific emotions people feel are as unique to people as their appearance or sense of humor.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This could work as communication—when one person communicates just what they’re feeling, the other person would be able to access the feeling in their own emotional centers. Obvious implications for a future of heightened empathy. But emotional communication could also be used for things like entertainment, where a movie, say, could also project out to the audience—directly into their limbic systems—certain feelings it wants the audience to feel as they watch. This is already what the film score does—another hack—and now it could be done directly.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Sensory communication</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This one is intense.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Right now, the only two microphones that can act as inputs for the “speaker” in your head—your auditory cortex—are your two ears. The only two cameras that can be hooked up to the projector in your head—your visual cortex—are your two eyes. The only sensory surface that you can feel is your skin. The only thing that lets you experience taste is your tongue.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But in the same way we can currently hook an implant, for example, into someone’s cochlea—which connects a <em>different </em>mic to their auditory cortex—down the road we’ll be able to let sensory input information stream into your wizard hat wirelessly, from anywhere, and channel right into your sensory cortices the same way your bodily sensory organs do today. In the future, sensory organs will be only one set of inputs into your senses—and compared to what our senses will have access to, not a very exciting one.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Now what about output?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Currently, the only speaker your ear inputs can play <em>out</em> of is your auditory cortex. Only <em>you</em> can see what your eye cameras capture and only you can feel what touches your skin—because only you have access to the particular cortices those inputs are wired to. With a wizard hat, it would be a breeze for your brain to beam those input signals out of your head.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">So you’ll have sensory input capabilities and sensory output capabilities—or both at the same time. This will open up all <em>kinds </em>of amazing possibilities.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Say you’re on a beautiful hike and you want to show your husband the view. No problem—just think out to him to request a brain connection. When he accepts, connect your retina feed to his visual cortex. Now his vision is filled with exactly what your eyes see, as if he’s there. He asks for the other senses to get the full picture, so you connect those too and now he hears the waterfall in the distance and feels the breeze and smells the trees and jumps when a bug lands on your arm. You two share the equivalent of a five-minute discussion about the scene—your favorite parts, which other places it reminds you of, etc. along with a shared story from his day—in a 30-second thought session. He says he has to get back to what he was working on, so he cuts off the sense connections except for vision, which he reduces to a little picture-in-picture window on the side of his visual field so he can check out more of the hike from time to time.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">A surgeon could control a machine scalpel with her motor cortex instead of holding one in her hand, and she could receive sensory input from that scalpel so that it would feel like an 11th finger to her. So it would be as if one of her fingers <em>was </em>a scalpel and she could do the surgery without holding any tools, giving her much finer control over her incisions. An inexperienced surgeon performing a tough operation could bring a couple of her mentors into the scene as she operates to watch her work through her eyes and think instructions or advice to her. And if something goes really wrong, one of them could “take the wheel” and connect their motor cortex to her outputs to take control of her hands.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">There would be no more need for screens of course—because you could just make a virtual screen appear in your visual cortex. Or jump into a VR movie with all your senses. Speaking of VR—Facebook, the maker of the Oculus Rift, is diving into this too. In an interview with Mark Zuckerberg about VR (for an upcoming post), the conversation at one point turned to BMIs. He said: “Touch gives you input and it’s a little bit of haptic feedback.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Over the long term, it’s not clear that we won’t just like to have our hands in no controller, and maybe, instead of having buttons that we press, we would just <em>think</em> something.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The ability to record sensory input means you can also record your memories, or share them—since a memory in the first place is just a not-so-accurate playback of previous sensory input. Or you could play them back as live experiences. In other words, that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw3GIR70HAY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black Mirror episode</a> will probably actually happen.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">An NBA player could send out a livestream invitation to his fans before a game, which would let them see and hear through his eyes and ears while he plays. Those who miss it could jump into the recording later.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">You could save a great sex experience in the cloud to enjoy again later—or, if you’re not too private a person, you could send it over to a friend to experience. (Needless to say, the porn industry will thrive in the digital brain world.)</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Right now, you can go on YouTube and watch a first-hand account of almost anything, for free. This would have blown George Washington’s mind—but in the Wizard Era, you’ll be able to actually<em> experience</em> almost anything for free. The days of fancy experiences being limited to rich people will be long over.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another idea, via the imagination of Moran Cerf: Maybe player brain injuries will drive the NFL to alter the rules so that the players’ biological bodies stay on the sidelines, while they play the game with an artificial body whose motor cortex they control and whose eyes and ears they see and hear through. I like this idea and think it would be closer to the current NFL than it seems at first. In one way, you’ll still need to be a great athlete to play, since most of what makes a great athlete great is their motor cortex, their muscle memory, and their decision-making. But the other component of being a great athlete—the physical body itself—would now be artificial. The NFL could make all of the artificial playing bodies identical—this would be a cool way to see whose skills were actually best—or they could insist that artificial body matches in every way the biological body of the athlete, to mimic as closely as possible how the game would go if players used their biological bodies like in the old days. Either way, if this rule change happened, you can imagine how <em>crazy</em> it would seem to people that players used to have their actual, fragile brains <em>on the field</em>.</span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">I could go on. The communication possibilities in a wizard hat world, especially when you combine them with each other, are endless—and damn fun to think about.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>The Wizard Era: Internal Control</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6441\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading.png 523w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading-166x300.png 166w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Wizard-Tinkering-Heading-331x600.png 331w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Communication—the flow of information into and out of your brain—is only one way your wizard hat will be able to serve you.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">A whole-brain interface can stimulate any part of your brain in any way—it has to have this capability for the input half of all the communication examples above. But that capability also gives you a whole new level of control over your brain. Here are some ways people of the future might take advantage of that:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Win the battle in your head for both sides</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Often, the battle in our heads between our prefrontal cortex and limbic system comes down to the fact that both parties are trying to do what’s best for us—it’s just that our limbic system is wrong about what’s best for us because it thinks we live in a tribe 50,000 years ago.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Your limbic system isn’t making you eat your ninth Starburst candy in a row because it’s a dick—it’s making you eat it because it thinks that A) any fruit that sweet and densely chewy must be <em>super </em>rich in calories and B) you might not find food again for the next four days so it’s a good idea to load up on a high-calorie food whenever the opportunity arises.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, your prefrontal cortex is just watching in horror like “WHY ARE WE DOING THIS.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But Moran believes that a good brain interface could fix this problem:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-53-6120\" id=\"note2-53-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">53</a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Consider eating a chocolate cake. While eating, we feed data to our cognitive apparatus. These data provide the enjoyment of the cake. The enjoyment isn’t in the cake, per se, but in our neural experience of it. Decoupling our sensory desire (the experience of cake) from the underlying survival purpose (nutrition) will soon be within our reach.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This concept of “sensory decoupling” would make <em>so </em>much sense if we could pull it off. You could get the <em>enjoyment </em>of eating like shit without actually putting shit in your body. Instead, Moran says, what would go in your body would be “nutrition inputs customized for each person based on genomes, microbiomes or other factors. Physical diets released from the tyranny of desire.”<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-54-6120\" id=\"note2-54-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">54</a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The same principle could apply to things like sex, drugs, alcohol, and other pleasures that get people into trouble, healthwise or otherwise.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Ramez Naam talks about how a brain interface could also help us win the discipline battle when it comes to time:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-55-6120\" id=\"note2-55-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">55</a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">We know that stimulating the right centers in the brain can induce sleep or alertness, hunger or satiation, ease or stimulation, as quick as the flip of a switch. Or, if you’re running code, on a schedule. (Siri: Put me to sleep until 7:30, high priority interruptions only. And let’s get hungry for lunch around noon. Turn down the sugar cravings, though.)</span></em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Take control of mood disorders</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Ramez also emphasized that a great deal of scientific evidence suggests that moods and disorders are tied to what the chemicals in your brain are doing. Right now, we take drugs to alter those chemicals, and Ramez explains why direct neural stimulation is a far better option:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote2-56-6120\" id=\"note2-56-6120\" rel=\"footnote2\">56</a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Pharmaceuticals enter the brain and then spread out randomly, hitting whatever receptor they work on all across your brain. Neural interfaces, by contrast, can stimulate just one area at a time, can be tuned in real-time, and can carry information out about what’s happening.</span></em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Depression, anxiety, OCD, and other disorders may be easy to eradicate once we can take better control of what goes on in our brain.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Mess with your senses</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Want to hear what a dog hears? That’s easy. The pitch range we can hear is limited by the dimensions of our cochlea—but pitches out of the ear’s range can be sent straight into our auditory nerve.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-32-6120\" id=\"note-32-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Or maybe you want a new sense. You love bird watching and want to be able to sense when there’s a bird nearby. So you buy an infrared camera that can detect bird locations by their heat signals and you link it to your brain interface, which stimulates neurons in a certain way to alert you to the presence of a bird and tell you its location. I can’t describe what you’d experience when it alerts you, so I’ll just say words like “feel” or “see,” because I can only imagine the five senses we have. But in the future, there will be more words for new, useful types of senses.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">You could also dim or shut off parts of a sense, like pain perhaps. Pain is the body’s way of telling us we need to address something, but in the future, we’ll elect to get that information in much less unpleasant formats.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-33-6120\" id=\"note-33-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Increase your knowledge </strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">There’s evidence from experiments with rats that it’s possible to boost how fast a brain can learn—sometimes by 2x or even 3x—just by priming certain neurons to prepare to make a long-term connection.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Your brain would also have access to all the knowledge in the world, at all times. I talked to Ramez about how accessing information in the cloud might work. We parsed it out into four layers of capability, each requiring a more advanced brain interface than the last:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Level 1:</strong> I want to know a fact. I call on the cloud for that info—like Googling something with my brain—and the answer, in text, appears in my mind’s eye. Basically what I do now except it all happens in my head.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Level 2: </strong>I want to know a fact. I call on the cloud for that info, and then a second later I just <em>know </em>it. No reading was involved—it was more like the way I’d recall something from memory.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Level 3: </strong>I just know the fact I want to know the second I want it. I don’t even know if it came from the cloud or if it was stored in my brain. I can essentially treat the whole cloud like my brain. I don’t know all the info—my brain could never fit it all—but any time I want to know something it downloads into my consciousness so seamlessly and quickly, it’s as if it were there all along.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Level 4: </strong>Beyond just knowing facts, I can deeply <em>understand</em> anything I want to, in a complex way. We discussed the example of <em>Moby Dick</em>. Could I download <em>Moby Dick</em> from the cloud into my memory and then suddenly have it be the same as if I had read the whole book? Where I’d have thoughts and opinions and I could cite passages and have discussions about the themes?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Ramez thinks all four of these are possible with enough time, but that the fourth in particular will take a very long time to happen, if ever.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">So there are about 50 delightful potential things about putting a wizard hat on your brain. Now for the undelightful part.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>The scary thing about wizard hats</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">As is always the case with the advent of new technologies, when the Wizard Era rolls around, the dicks of the world will do their best to ruin everything.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And this time, the stakes are extra high. Here are some things that could suck:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Trolls can have an even fielder day. </strong>The troll-type personalities of the world have been having a field day ever since the internet came out. They literally can’t believe their luck. But with brain interfaces, they’ll have an even fielder day. Being more connected to each other means a lot of good things—like empathy going up as a result of more exposure to all kinds of people—but it also means a lot of bad things. Just like the internet. Bad guys will have more opportunity to spread hate or build hateful coalitions. The internet has been a godsend for ISIS, and a brain-connected world would be an even more helpful recruiting tool.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Computers crash. </strong>And they have bugs. And normally that’s not the end of the world, because you can try restarting, and if it’s really being a piece of shit, you can just get a new computer. You can’t get a new head. There will have to be a way <em>way </em>higher number of precautions taken here.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Computers can be hacked. </strong>Except this time they have access to your thoughts, sensory input, and memories. Bad times.</p> \n<p><strong>Holy shit computers can be hacked. </strong>In the last item I was thinking about bad guys using hacking to <em>steal</em> information from my brain. But brain interfaces <em>can also put information in. </em>Meaning a clever hacker might be able to change your thoughts or your vote or your identity or make you want to do something terrible you normally wouldn’t ever consider. And you wouldn’t know it ever happened. You could feel strongly about voting for a candidate and a little part of you would wonder if someone manipulated your thoughts so you’d feel that way. The darkest possible scenario would be an ISIS-type organization actually influencing millions of people to join their cause by altering their thoughts. This is definitely the scariest paragraph in this post. Let’s get out of here.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Why the Wizard Era will be a good thing anyway even though there are a lot of dicks</strong></span></p> \n<p>Physics advancements allow bad guys to make nuclear bombs. Biological advancements allow bad guys to make bioweapons. The invention of cars and planes led to crashes that kill over a million people a year. The internet enabled the spread of fake news, made us vulnerable to cyberattack, made terrorist recruiting efforts easier, and allowed predators to flourish.</p> \n<p>And yet—</p> \n<p>Would people choose to reverse our understanding of science, go back to the days of riding horses across land and boats across the ocean, or get rid of the internet?</p> \n<p>Probably not.</p> \n<p>New technology also comes along with real dangers and it always <em>does </em>end up harming a lot of people. But it also always seems to help a lot <em>more </em>people than it harms. Advancing technology almost always proves to be a net positive.</p> \n<p>People also love to hate the <em>concept</em> of new technology—because they worry it’s unhealthy and makes us less human. But those same people, if given the option, usually wouldn’t consider going back to George Washington’s time, when half of children died before the age of 5, when traveling to other parts of the world was impossible for almost everyone, when a far greater number of humanitarian atrocities were being committed than there are today, when women and ethnic minorities had <em>far </em>fewer rights across the world than they do today, when far more people were illiterate and far more people were living under the poverty line than there are today. They wouldn’t go back 250 years—a time right before <em>the biggest explosion of technology in human history</em> <em>happened.</em> Sounds like people who are immensely <em>grateful </em>for technology. And yet their opinion holds—our technology is ruining our lives, people in the old days were much wiser, our world’s going to shit, etc. I don’t think they’ve thought about it hard enough.</p> \n<p>So when it comes to what will be a long list of dangers of the Wizard Era—they suck, and they’ll continue to suck as some of them play out into sickening atrocities and catastrophes. But a vastly larger group of good guys will wage war back, as they always do, and a giant “brain security” industry will be born. And I bet, if given the option, people in the Wizard Era wouldn’t for a second consider coming back to 2017.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20pt;\"><strong>The Timeline</strong></span></p> \n<p>I always know when humanity doesn’t know what the hell is going on with something when all the experts are contradicting each other about it.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-34-6120\" id=\"note-34-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></p> \n<p>The timeline for our road to the Wizard Era is one of those times—in large part because no one knows to what extent we’ll be able to make Stevenson’s Law look more like Moore’s Law.</p> \n<p>My conversations yielded a wide range of opinions on the timeline. One neuroscientist predicted that I’d have a whole-brain interface in my lifetime. Mark Zuckerberg said: “I would be pretty disappointed if in 25 years we hadn’t made some progress towards thinking things to computers.” One prediction on the longer end came from Ramez Naam, who thought the time of people beginning to install BMIs for reasons other than disability might not come for 50 years and that mass adoption would take even longer.</p> \n<p>“I hope I’m wrong,” he said. “I hope that Elon bends the curve on this.”</p> \n<p>When I asked Elon about his timeline, he said:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">I think we are about 8 to 10 years away from this being usable by people with no disability … It </span>is important to note that this depends heavily on regulatory approval timing and how well our devices work on people with disabilities.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">During another discussion, I had asked him about why he went into this branch of biotech and not into genetics. He responded:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Genetics is just too slow, that’s the problem. For a human to become an adult takes twenty years. We just don’t have that amount of time.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">A lot of people working on this challenge have a lot of different motivations for doing so, but rarely did I talk to people who felt motivated by <em>urgency.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Elon’s urgency to get us into the Wizard Era is the final piece of the Neuralink puzzle.

The first happens to be identical to the way Earth was in 10 million BC. The second happens to be identical to Earth in 50,000 BC. And the third happens to be identical to Earth in 2017 AD.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The alien is no expert on primitive biological life but circles around all three planets, peering down at each with his telescope. On the first, he sees lots of water and trees and mountains and some little signs of animal life. He makes out a herd of elephants on an African plain, a group of dolphins skipping along the ocean’s surface, and a few other scattered critters living out their Tuesday.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">He moves on to the second planet and looks around. More critters, not too much different. He notices one new thing—occasional little points of flickering light dotting the land.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Bored, he moves on to the third planet. Whoa. He sees planes crawling around above the land, vast patches of gray land with towering buildings on them, ships of all kinds sprinkled across the seas, long railways stretching across continents, and he has to jerk his spaceship out of the way when a satellite soars by him.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">When he heads home, he reports on what he found: “Two planets with primitive life and one planet with intelligent life.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">You can understand why that would be his conclusion—but he’d be wrong.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">In fact, it’s the first planet that’s the odd one out. Both the second and third planets have intelligent life on them—equally intelligent life. So equal that you could kidnap a newborn baby from Planet 2 and swap it with a newborn on Planet 3 and both would grow up as normal people on the other’s planet, fitting in seamlessly. Same people.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And yet, how could that be?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanets.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6318\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanets.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanets.png 1559w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanets-300x117.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanets-768x299.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanets-600x233.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The Human Colossus. That’s how.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Ever wonder why you’re so often unimpressed by humans and yet so blown away by the accomplishments of humanity?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">It’s because <em>humans</em> are still, deep down, those people on Planet 2.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Plop a baby human into a group of chimps and ask them to raise him, Tarzan style, and the human as an adult will know how to run around the forest, climb trees, find food, and masturbate. That’s who each of us actually is.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Humanity</em>, on the other hand, is a superintelligent, tremendously-knowledgeable, millennia-old Colossus, with 7.5 billion neurons. And that’s who built Planet 3.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The invention of language allowed each human brain to dump its knowledge onto a pile before its death, and the pile became a tower and grew taller and taller until one day, it became the brain of a great Colossus that built us a civilization. The Human Colossus has been inventing things ever since, getting continually better at it with time. Driven only by the desire to create value, the Colossus is now moving at an unprecedented pace—which is why we live in an unprecedented and completely anomalous time in history.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">You know how I said we might be living literally <em>on </em>the line between two vast eras of communication?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Well the truth is, we seem to be on a <em>lot </em>of historic timeline boundaries. After 1,000 centuries of human life and 3.8 billion years of Earthly life, it seems like <em>this </em>century will be the one where Earth life makes the leap from the Single-Planetary Era to the Multi-Planetary Era. This century may be the one when an Earthly species finally manages to wrest the genetic code from the forces of evolution and learns to reprogram itself. People alive today could witness the moment when biotechnology finally frees the human lifespan from the will of nature and hands it over to the will of each individual.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The Human Colossus has reached an entirely new level of power—the kind of power that can overthrow 3.8-billion-year eras—positioning us on the verge of <em>multiple </em>tipping points that will lead to unimaginable change. And if our alien friend finds a fourth planet one day that happens to be identical to Earth in 2100, you can be pretty damn sure it’ll look nothing to him like Planet 3.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">I hope you enjoyed Planet 3, because we’re leaving it. Planet 4 is where we’re headed, whether we like it or not.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanet-4.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\" wp-image-6317 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanet-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"313\" height=\"385\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanet-4.png 419w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Exoplanet-4-244x300.png 244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">__________</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">If I had to sum up the driving theme behind everything Elon Musk does, it would be pretty simple:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">He wants to prepare us for Planet 4.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">He lives in the big picture, and his only lens is the maximum zoom-out. That’s why he’s such an unusual visionary. It’s also why he’s so worried.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">It’s not that he thinks Planet 4 is definitely a bad place—it’s that he thinks it <em>could be </em>a bad place, and he recognizes that the generations alive today, whether they realize it or not, are the first in history to face real, hardcore existential risk.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">At the same time, the people alive today also are the first who can live with the actually realistic hope for a genuinely utopian future—one that defies even death and taxes. Planet 4 could be our promised land.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">When you zoom way out, you realize how unfathomably high the stakes actually are.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And the outcome isn’t at the whim of chance—it’s at the whim of the Human Colossus. Planet 4 is only coming because the Colossus is building it. And whether that future is like heaven or hell depends on what the Colossus does—maybe over the next 150 years, maybe over only the next 50. Or 25.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But the unfortunate thing is that the Human Colossus isn’t optimized to maximize the chances of a safe transition to the best possible Planet 4 for the most possible humans—it’s optimized to build Planet 4, in any way possible, as quickly as possible.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Understanding all of this, Elon has dedicated his life to trying to influence the Human Colossus to bring its motivation more in line with the long-term interests of humans. He knows it’s not possible to rewire the Human Colossus—not unless existential risk were suddenly directly in front of each human’s face, which normally doesn’t happen until it’s already too late—so he treats the Colossus like a pet.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">If you want your dog to sit, you correlate sitting on command with getting a treat. For the Human Colossus, a treat is a ripe new industry simultaneously exploding in both supply and demand.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Elon saw the Human Colossus dog peeing on the floor in the form of continually adding ancient, deeply-buried carbon into the carbon cycle—and rather than plead with the Colossus to stop peeing on the floor (which a lot of people waste their breath doing) or try to threaten the Colossus into behaving (which governments try to do, with limited success), he’s creating an electric car so rad that everyone will want one. The auto industry sees the shift in consumer preferences this is beginning to create, and in the nine years since Tesla released its first car, the number of major car companies with an electric car in their line went from zero to almost all of them. The Colossus seems to be taking the treat, and a change in behavior may follow.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Elon saw the Human Colossus dog running into traffic in the form of humanity keeping all of its eggs on one planet, despite all of those tipping points on the horizon, so he built SpaceX to learn to land a rocket, which will cut the cost of space travel by about 99% and make dedicating resources to the space industry a much tastier morsel for the Colossus. His plan with Mars isn’t to try to convince humanity that it’s a good idea to build a civilization there in order to buy life insurance for the species—it’s to create an affordable regular cargo and human transit route to Mars, knowing that once that happens, there will be enough value-creation opportunity in Mars development that the Colossus will become determined to make it happen.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But to Elon, the scariest thing the Human Colossus is doing is teaching the Computer Colossus to think. To Elon, and many others, the development of superintelligent AI poses by far the greatest existential threat to humanity. It’s not that hard to see why. Intelligence gives us godlike powers over all other creatures on Earth—which has not been a fun time for the creatures. If any of their body parts are possible value creators, we have major industries processing and selling those body parts. We sometimes kill them for sport. But we’re probably the least fun all the times we’re just doing our thing, for our own reasons, with no hate in our hearts or desire to hurt anyone, and there are creatures, or ecosystems, that just <em>happen </em>to be in our way or in the line of fire of the side effects of what we’re doing. People like to get all mad at humanity about this, but really, we’re just doing what species do—being selfish, first and foremost.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The issue for other creatures isn’t our selfishness—it’s the immense damage our selfishness can do because of the tremendous power we have over them. Power that comes from our intelligence advantage.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">So it’s pretty logical to be apprehensive about the prospect of intentionally creating something that will have (perhaps far) more intelligence than we do—especially since every human on the planet is an amateur at creating something like that, because no one has ever done it before.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And things are progressing quickly. Elon talked about the rapid progress made by Google’s game-playing AI:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>I mean, you’ve got these two things where AlphaGo crushes these human players head-on-head, beats Lee Sedol 4 out of 5 games and now it will beat a human every game all the time, while playing the 50 best players, and beating them always, all the time. You know, that’s like one year later. </em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>And it’s on a harmless thing like AlphaGo right now. But the degrees of freedom at which the AI can win are increasing. So, Go has many more degrees of freedom than Chess, but if you take something like one of the real-time strategy competitive games like League of Legends or Dota 2, that has vastly more degrees of freedom than Go, so it can’t win at that yet. But it will be able to. And then there’s reality, which has the ultimate number of degrees of freedom.</em><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#footnote-35-6120\" id=\"note-35-6120\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And for reasons discussed above, that kind of thing worries him:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>What I came to realize in recent years—the last couple years—is that AI is obviously going to surpass human intelligence by a lot. … There’s some risk at that point that something bad happens, something that we can’t control, that humanity can’t control after that point—either a small group of people monopolize AI power, or the AI goes rogue, or something like that. It may not, but it could.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But in typical Human Colossus form, “the collective will is not attuned to the danger of AI.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">When I interviewed Elon in 2015, I asked him if he would ever join the effort to build superintelligent AI. He said, “My honest opinion is that we shouldn’t build it.” And when I later commented that building something smarter than yourself did seem like a basic Darwinian error (a phrase I stole from Nick Bostrom), Elon responded, “We’re gonna win the Darwin Award, collectively.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Now, two years later, here’s what he says:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>I was trying to really sound the alarm on the AI front for quite a while, but it was clearly having no impact (laughs) so I was like, “Oh fine, okay, then we’ll have to try to help develop it in a way that’s good.”</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">He’s accepted reality—the Human Colossus is not going to quit until the Computer Colossus, one day, wakes up. This is happening.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6442\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker.png 1096w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker-219x300.png 219w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker-768x1051.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Computer-Colossus-tinker-438x600.png 438w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">No matter what anyone tells you, no one knows what will happen when the Computer Colossus learns to think. In my <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long AI explainer</a>, I explored the reasoning of both those who are convinced that superintelligent AI will be the solution to every problem we have, and those who see humanity as a bunch of kids playing with a bomb they don’t understand. I’m personally still torn about which camp I find more convincing, but it seems pretty rational to plan for the worst and do whatever we can to increase our odds. Many experts agree with that logic, but there’s little consensus on the best strategy for creating superintelligent AI safely—just a whole lot of ideas from people who acknowledge they don’t really know the answer. How could anyone know how to take precautions for a future world they have no way to understand?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Elon also acknowledges he doesn’t know the answer—but he’s working on a plan he thinks will give us our best shot.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Elon’s Plan</strong></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"text-align: center;\">Abraham Lincoln was pleased with himself when he came up with the line:</span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Fair—it’s a good line.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The whole idea of “of the people, by the people, for the people” is the centerpiece of democracy.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Unfortunately, “the people” are unpleasant. So democracy ends up being unpleasant. But unpleasant tends to be a dream compared to the alternatives. Elon talked about this:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>I think that the protection of the collective is important. I think it was Churchill who said, “Democracy’s the worst of all systems of government, except for all the others.” It’s fine if you have Plato’s incredible philosopher king as the king, sure. That would be fine. Now, most dictators do not turn out that way. They tend to be quite horrible.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">In other words, democracy is like escaping from a monster by hiding in a sewer.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">There are plenty of times in life when it’s a good strategy to take a risk in order to give yourself a chance for the best possible outcome, but when the stakes are at their absolute highest, the right move is usually to play it safe. Power is one of those times. That’s why, even though democracy essentially guarantees a certain level of mediocrity, Elon says, “I think you’re hard-pressed to find many people in the United States who, no matter what they think of any given president, would advocate for a dictatorship.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And since Elon sees AI as the ultimate power, he sees AI development as the ultimate “play it safe” situation. Which is why his strategy for minimizing existential AI risk seems to essentially be that AI power needs to be of the people, by the people, for the people.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">To try to implement that concept in the realm of AI, Elon has approached the situation from multiple angles.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">For the<strong> by the people</strong> and <strong>for the people</strong><strong> </strong>parts, he and Sam Altman created <a href=\"https://openai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenAI</a>—a self-described “non-profit AI research company, discovering and enacting the path to safe artificial general intelligence.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Normally, when humanity is working on something new, it starts with the work of a few innovative pioneers. When they succeed, an industry is born and the Human Colossus jumps on board to build upon what the pioneers started, en masse.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But what if the thing those pioneers were working on was a magic wand that might give whoever owned it immense, unbreakable power over everyone else—including the power to prevent anyone else from making a magic wand? That would be kinda stressful, right?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Well that’s how Elon views today’s early AI development efforts. And since he can’t stop people from trying to make a magic wand, his solution is to create an open, collaborative, transparent magic wand development lab. When a new breakthrough innovation is discovered in the lab, instead of making it a tightly-kept secret like the other magic wand companies, the lab publishes the innovation for anyone to see or borrow for their own magic-wand-making efforts.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">On one hand, this could have drawbacks. Bad guys are out there trying to make a magic wand too, and you <em>really </em>don’t want the first magic wand to end up in the hands of a bad guy. And now the bad guys’ development efforts can benefit from all of the innovations being published by the lab. This is a serious concern.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But the lab also boosts the efforts of millions of other people trying to create magic wands. This generates a ton of competition for the secretive early pioneers, and it becomes less likely that any one inventor can create a magic wand long before others also do. More likely is that when the first magic wand is eventually created, there are thousands of others near completion as well—different wands, with different capabilities, made by different people, for different reasons. If we have to have magic wands on Earth, Elon thinks, let’s at least make sure they’re in the hands of a large number of people across the world—not one all-powerful sorcerer. Or as he puts it:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Essentially, if everyone’s from planet Krypton, that’s great. But if only one of them is Superman and Superman also has the personality of Hitler, then we’ve got a problem.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">More broadly, a single pioneer’s magic wand would likely have been built to serve that inventor’s own needs and purposes. But by turning the future magic wand industry into a collective effort, a wide variety of needs and purposes will have a wand made for them, making it more likely that the capabilities of the world’s aggregate mass of magic wands will overarchingly represent the needs of the masses.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">You know, like democracy.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">It worked fine for Nikola Tesla and Henry Ford and the Wright Brothers and Alan Turing to jump-start revolutions by jumping way out ahead of the pack. But when you’re dealing with the invention of something <em>unthinkably</em> powerful, you can’t sit back and let the pioneers kick things off—it’s leaving too much to chance.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">OpenAI is an effort to democratize the creation of AI, to get the entire Human Colossus working on it during its pioneer phase. Elon sums it up:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>AI is definitely going to vastly surpass human abilities. To the degree that it is linked to human will, particularly the sum of a large number of humans, it would be an outcome that is desired by a large number of humans, because it would be a function of their will.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">So now you’ve maybe got early human-level-or-higher AI superpower being made by the people, for the people—which brings down the likelihood that the world’s AI ends up in the hands of a single bad guy or a tightly-controlled monopoly.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Now all we’ve got left is <strong>of the people.</strong></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This one should be easy. Remember, the Human Colossus is creating superintelligent AI for the same reason it created cars, factory machines, and computers—to serve as an extension of itself to which it can outsource work. Cars do our walking, factory machines do our manufacturing, and computers take care of information storage, organization, and computation.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Creating computers that can think will be our greatest invention yet—they’ll allow us to outsource our most important and high-impact work. Thinking is what built everything we have, so just imagine the power that will come from building ourselves a superintelligent thinking <em>extension. </em>And extensions of the people by definition belong to the people—they’re <em>of </em>the people.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">There’s just this one thing—</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">High-caliber AI isn’t quite like those other inventions. The rest of our technology is great at the thing it’s built to do, but in the end, it’s a mindless machine with narrow intelligence. The AI we’re trying to build will be <em>smart, </em>like a person—like a <em>ridiculously </em>smart person. It’s a fundamentally different thing than we’ve ever made before—so why would we expect normal rules to apply?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">It’s always been an automatic thing that the technology we make inherently belongs to us—it’s such an obvious point that it almost seems silly to make it. But could it be that if we make something smarter than a person, it might not be so easy to control?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Could it be that a creation that’s better at thinking than any human on Earth might not be fully content to serve as a human extension, even if that’s what it was built to do?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">We don’t know how issues will actually manifest—but it seems pretty safe to say that yes, these possibilities <em>could be.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And if what could be turns out to <em>actually </em>be<em>, </em>we may have a serious problem on our hands.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Because, as the human history case study suggests, when there’s something on the planet way smarter than everyone else, it can be a really bad thing for everyone else. And if AI becomes the new thing on the planet that’s way smarter than everyone else, and it turns out <em>not </em>to clearly belong to us—it means that it’s its <em>own thing</em>. Which drops us into the category of “everyone else.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">So <em>people </em>gaining monopolistic control of AI is its own problem—and one that OpenAI is hoping to solve. But it’s a problem that may pale in comparison to the prospect of AI being uncontrollable.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This is what keeps Elon up at night. He sees it as only a matter of time before superintelligent AI rises up on this planet—and when that happens, he believes that it’s critical that we don’t end up as part of “everyone else.”</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">That’s why, in a future world made up of AI and everyone else, he thinks we have only one good option:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">To be AI.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Remember before when I said that there were two things about wizard hats we had to wrap our heads around?</p> \n<p><strong>1) The intensely <strong>mind-bending</strong> idea</strong></p> \n<p><strong>2) The super ridiculously intensely <strong>mind-bending</strong> idea</strong></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This is where #2 comes in.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">These two ideas are the two things Elon means when he refers to the wizard hat as a digital tertiary layer in our brains. The first, as we discussed, is the concept that a whole-brain interface is kind of the same thing as putting our devices in our heads—effectively making your <em>brain </em>the device. Like this: <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6471\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2.png 1390w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2-300x224.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2-768x573.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-brain-using-computer-2-600x448.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Your devices give you cyborg superpowers and a window into the digital world. Your brain’s wizard hat electrode array is a new brain structure, joining your limbic system and cortex.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But your limbic system, cortex, and wizard hat are just the hardware systems. When you experience your limbic system, it’s not the physical system you’re interacting with—it’s the <em>information flow </em>within it. It’s the <em>activity</em> of the physical system that bubbles up in your consciousness, making you feel angry, scared, horny, or hungry.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Same thing for your cortex. The napkin wrapped around your brain stores and organizes information, but it’s the information itself that you experience when you think something, see something, hear something, or feel something. The visual cortex in itself does nothing for you—it’s the stream of photon information flowing through it that gives you the experience of having a visual cortex. When you dig in your memory to find something, you’re not searching for <em>neurons</em>, you’re searching for information stored in the neurons.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The limbic system and cortex themselves are just gray matter. The flow of activity within the gray matter is what forms your familiar internal characters, the monkey brain and the rational human brain.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">So what does that mean about your digital tertiary layer?</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">It means that while what’s actually in your brain is the physical device—the electrode array itself—the component of the tertiary layer that you’ll experience and get to know as a character is the information that flows through the array.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And just like the feelings and urges of the limbic system and the thoughts and chattering voice of the cortex all feel to you like <em>parts </em>of you—like your inner essence—the activity that flows through your wizard hat will feel like a part of you and your essence.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Elon’s vision for the Wizard Era is that among the wizard hat’s many uses, one of its core purposes will be to serve as the interface between your brain and a cloud-based customized AI system. That AI system, he believes, will become as present a character in your mind as your monkey and your human characters—and it will feel like <em>you </em>every bit as much as the others do. He says:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>I think that, conceivably, there’s a way for there to be a tertiary layer that feels like it’s part of you. It’s not some thing that you offload to, it’s you.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">This makes sense on paper. You do most of your “thinking” with your cortex, but then when you get hungry, you don’t say, “My limbic system is hungry,” you say, “I’m hungry.” Likewise, Elon thinks, when you’re trying to figure out the solution to a problem and your AI comes up with the answer, you won’t say, “My AI got it,” you’ll say, “Aha! I got it.” When your limbic system wants to procrastinate and your cortex wants to work, a situation I <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">might</a> be familiar with, it doesn’t feel like you’re<em> </em>arguing with some external being, it feels like a singular <em>you</em> is struggling to be disciplined. Likewise, when you think up a strategy at work and your AI disagrees, that’ll be a genuine disagreement and a debate will ensue—but it will feel like an <em>internal </em>debate, not a debate between you and someone else that just happens to take place in your thoughts. The debate will feel like <em>thinking. </em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">It makes sense on paper.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But when I first heard Elon talk about this concept, it didn’t really feel right. No matter how hard I tried to get it, I kept framing the idea as something familiar—like an AI system whose <em>voice </em>I could hear in my head, or even one that I could think together with. But in those instances, the AI still seemed like an external system I was communicating with. It didn’t seem like <em>me</em>.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But then, one night while working on the post, I was rereading some of Elon’s quotes about this, and it suddenly <em>clicked. </em>The AI <em>would </em>be me. <em>Fully</em>. I <em>got </em>it.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Then I lost it. The next day, I tried to explain the epiphany to a friend and I left us both confused. I was back in “Wait, but it kind of wouldn’t really <em>be </em>me, it would be <em>communicating </em>with me” land. Since then, I’ve dipped into and out of the idea, never quite able to hold it for long. The best thing I can compare it to is having a moment when it actually makes <em>sense </em>that time is relative and space-time is a single fabric. For a second, it seems <em>intuitive </em>that time moves slower when you’re moving really fast. And then I lose it. As I typed those sentences just now, it did <em>not </em>seem intuitive.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The idea of <em>being </em>AI is especially tough because it combines <em>two </em>mind-numbing concepts—the brain interface and the abilities it would give you, and artificial general intelligence. Humans today are simply not equipped to understand either of those things, because as imaginative as we think we are, our imaginations only really have our life experience as their toolkit, and these concepts are both totally novel. It’s like trying to imagine a color you’ve never seen.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">That’s why when I hear Elon talk with conviction about this stuff, I’m somewhere in between deeply believing it myself and taking his word for it. I go back and forth. But given that he’s someone who probably found space-time intuitive when he was seven, and given that he’s someone who knows how to colonize Mars, I’m inclined to listen hard to what he says.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And what he says is that this is all about bandwidth. It’s obvious why bandwidth matters when it comes to making a wizard hat useful. But Elon believes that when it comes to interfacing with AI, high bandwidth isn’t just <em>preferred,</em> but actually <em>fundamental </em>to the prospect of being AI, versus simply <em>using </em>AI. Here he is walking me through his thoughts:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>The challenge is the communication bandwidth is extremely slow, particularly output. When you’re outputting on a phone, you’re moving two thumbs very slowly. That’s crazy slow communication. … If the bandwidth is too low, then your integration with AI would be very weak. Given the limits of very low bandwidth, it’s kind of pointless. The AI is just going to go by itself, because it’s too slow to talk to. The faster the communication, the more you’ll be integrated—the slower the communication, the less. And the more separate we are—the more the AI is “other”—the more likely it is to turn on us. If the AIs are all separate, and vastly more intelligent than us, how do you ensure that they don’t have optimization functions that are contrary to the best interests of humanity? … If we achieve tight symbiosis, the AI wouldn’t be “other”—it would be you and with a relationship to your cortex analogous to the relationship your cortex has with your limbic system.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Elon sees communication bandwidth as the key factor in determining our level of integration with AI, and he sees that level of integration as the key factor in how we’ll fare in the AI world of our future:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>We’re going to have the choice of either being left behind and being effectively useless or like a pet—you know, like a house cat or something—or eventually figuring out some way to be symbiotic and merge with AI.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Then, a second later:</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>A house cat’s a good outcome, by the way.</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Without really understanding what kinds of AI will be around when we reach the age of superintelligent AI, the idea that human-AI integration will lend itself to the protection of the species makes intuitive sense. Our vulnerabilities in the AI era will come from bad people in control of AI or rogue AI not aligned with human values. In a world in which millions of people control a little piece of the world’s aggregate AI power—people who can think with AI, can defend themselves with AI, and who fundamentally understand AI because of their own integration with it—humans are less vulnerable. People will be a lot more powerful, which is scary, but like Elon said, if everyone is Superman, it’s harder for any one Superman to cause harm on a mass scale—there are lots of checks and balances. And we’re less likely to lose control of AI in general because the AI on the planet will be so widely distributed and varied in its goals. </span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But time is of the essence here—something Elon emphasized:</span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><em>The pace of progress in this direction matters a lot. We don’t want to develop digital superintelligence too far before being able to do a merged brain-computer interface.</em></span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When I thought about all of this, one reservation I had was whether a whole-brain interface would be enough of a change to make integration likely. I brought this up with Elon, noting that there would still be a vast difference between our thinking speed and a computer’s thinking speed. He said:</span></p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Yes, but increasing bandwidth by orders of magnitude would make it better. And it’s directionally correct. Does it solve all problems? No. But is it directionally correct? Yes. If you’re going to go in some direction, well, why would you go in any direction other than this?</em></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">And that’s why Elon started Neuralink.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6448\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"548\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1.png 2240w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1-300x183.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1-768x468.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Neuralink-formula-5-1-600x365.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\">He started Neuralink to accelerate our pace into the Wizard Era—into a world where he says that “everyone who wants to have this AI extension of themselves could have one, so there would be billions of individual human-AI symbiotes who, collectively, make decisions about the future.” A world where AI really could be of the people, by the people, for the people.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6445\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"704\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1.png 1096w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1-213x300.png 213w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1-768x1082.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Human-Colossus-with-hat-1-426x600.png 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">I’ll guess that right now, some part of you believes this insane world we’ve been living in for the past 38,000 words could really maybe be the future—and another part of you refuses to believe it. I’ve got a little of both of those going on too.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">But the <em>insanity</em> part of it shouldn’t be the reason it’s hard to believe. Remember—George Washington died when he saw 2017. And our future <em>will </em>be unfathomably shocking to us. The only difference is that things are moving even faster now than they were in George’s time.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The concept of being blown away by the future speaks to the magic of our collective intelligence—but it also speaks to the naivety of our intuition. Our minds evolved in a time when progress moved at a snail’s pace, so that’s what our hardware is calibrated to. And if we don’t actively override our intuition—the part of us that reads about a future this outlandish and refuses to believe it’s possible—we’re living in denial.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">The reality is that we’re whizzing down a <em>very </em>intense road to a very intense place, and no one knows what it’ll be like when we get there. A lot of people find it scary to think about, but I think it’s exciting. Because of when we happened to be born, instead of just living in a normal world like normal people, we’re living inside of a <em>thriller </em>movie. Some people take this information and decide to be like Elon, doing whatever they can to help the movie have a happy ending—and thank god they do. Because I’d rather just be a gawking member of the audience, watching the movie from the edge of my seat and rooting for the good guys.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\">Either way, I think it’s good to climb a tree from time to time to look out at the view and remind ourselves what a time this is to be alive. And there are a <em>lot</em> of trees around here.

Gray and white matter have different densities. So when your head is punched hard, or you get a really bad concussion, what can happen if your head snaps back and forth really sharply is that the gray and white matter accelerate at different velocities, which can make the gray matter of your cortex slide a bit over the white matter, or the white matter slide a bit over the gray matter of the brain stem. In the latter case, for a brief moment, your cortex is separated from being able to communicate with your brainstem. And since your consciousness resides in the brain stem, it makes you go unconscious. When either type of sliding happens, it can tear a bunch of axons. In a minor axon tear where the myelin sheath is still intact, the axon can grow back and heal. But if it’s a sharp enough blow, the myelin sheaths can tear too and the axons will never grow back—permanent brain damage. Concussions are really, really bad. This is also why an uppercut to the bottom of the chin or a blow to the back of the head can cause loss of consciousness—because those blows make the head snap back and forth sharply—while a punch to the side of the head or to the forehead won’t cause loss of consciousness.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#note-16-6120\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li>\n  <!--/#footnote-16.footnote-->\n  <li id=\"footnote-17-6120\" class=\"footnote\"><p>If our stick guy neuron were one of those sensory neurons, drawn to scale, his torso-axon would have been about a kilometer long.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6120#note-17-6120\" class=\"footnote-return\">↩</a></p></li>\n  <!--/#footnote-17.footnote-->\n  <li id=\"footnote-18-6120\" class=\"footnote\"><p>Sometimes, like when you step on a nail or touch a hot stove, the sensory axons will communicate with relevant motor neurons directly in the spinal cord to create an immediate reflex to pull your foot or hand away.

It all amounts to a new lens. Looking through this lens out at the world, and inward at myself, things make more sense to me now. … In the early parts of the series, we’ll get familiar with the new lens, and as the series moves on, we’ll start using the lens to look at all of those topics a sane blogger isn’t supposed to write about. If I can do my job well, by the end of the journey, everything will make more sense to you too. There’s a pretty worrisome trend happening in many of our societies right now, but I’m pretty sure that if we can just see it all with clear eyes, we can fix it.</em></p> \n<p>Nine chapters later, here we are. There are a few new terms and visuals still to come, but for the most part, we now have our lens.</p> \n<p>At the heart of the lens is the notion of “seeing in 3D,” which involves two ideas:</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">1) Seeing in 2D.</span></strong> Getting to know what I see as the core human struggle: the tension between our genes’ will to survive—a primal flame that burns brightly in everyone—and the human capacity to override that flame when it makes sense to do so, with rationality, self-awareness, and wisdom. I personify this tension with two characters—the Primitive Mind and the Higher Mind—whose struggle for control is a bit like a tug-of-war. Seeing in 2D means learning to consider this tug-of-war when thinking about anything human: ourselves and others, our interactions, our communities and societies and our politics, our personal and collective histories, and our prospects for the future.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">2) Seeing in 3D.</span></strong> Remembering to remember not only the Psych Spectrum tug-of-war but also <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1.2-emergence-tower-comparison.png\">Emergence Tower</a>. Ants are cells in a giant colony “organism.” Polar bears are individual organisms in themselves. Humans are weird because we can be like ants sometimes and polar bears other times<em>, </em>making the human species kind of like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fractal</a>. The individual human is an organism, but in many ways so is a human community, and even a whole society. The reason I see humanity like a fractal is that these different-order organisms are similar in a lot of ways. Namely, I see them as all enduring the same 2D struggle. I freely alternate between psychology and sociology in this series, because in 3D, it’s all one big multi-tiered system. Psychology is just a microcosm of sociology. And sociology is higher-emergence psychology—it’s the psychology of giants.</p> \n<p>Putting the two ideas together, it’s as if the tug-of-war is itself a fractal that scales up and down. There’s a tug-of-war in every human’s head, as we struggle for self-control and try our best to think and behave wisely. That same tug-of-war takes place on a macro scale in large and small groups of humans. When couples, communities, and societies let control of the rope slip towards the Primitive Mind, they end up playing out an ancient pre-programmed skit, falling into what I call the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/stories.html#cudgel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Power Games</a>—the most primitive format of human interaction, where the only rule is: “Everyone can do whatever they want, if they have the power to pull it off.” When their collective Higher Minds regain an edge, they’re able to live within a wiser and more grown-up structure made up of consciously chosen principles. Tug-of-war shifts are also contagious. The state of each person’s tug-of-war influences both the psychology of the people around them and the collective tug-of-war of groups the person is a part of. In turn, shifts in a society’s collective mindset exert a pull on the communities and individuals within it.</p> \n<p>Which brings us to the next part of what I said in the series intro: the worrisome trend.</p> \n<p>I’ve alluded to the trend a few times in the series so far, but I didn’t want to get fully into it until our lens had been sufficiently developed. My hope is that the lens can A) help me get my point across, and B) help us all see a baggage-laden story with fresh eyes and communicate about it with fresh words. Clarity is the name of the game—if we can see a bad trend for what it is and why it is, we can put our efforts toward reversing it. If we can’t, we’ll unwittingly perpetuate it.</p> \n<p>Blogging about current events is a bad idea. It’s less fun than blogging about rockets or cryonics or Panic Monsters and much more likely to make people mad at you. But this is too important, with stakes too high, not to talk about. The fact that there are such strong social incentives to avoid the topic is itself a huge part of the problem and why it’s particularly important to talk about. For the rest of this series (this chapter and two more), we’ll discuss the worrisome trend I think is happening, the consequences at play, and how I think we can work toward changing our trajectory.</p> \n<p style=\"font-size:26px\"><strong>Sliding Downward</strong></p> \n<p>The tug-of-war in our heads ebbs and flows on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis. You wake up feeling fine until you log onto Twitter—i.e. Primitive Mind land—where exposure to all the low-rung-ness jolts your Primitive Mind awake, dragging your psyche downward. You head to work, which let’s say is a place with a generally high-minded, grown-up culture, and it elevates your psyche a bit. While at work, you pick up a call from your mom, who makes a subtle jab about the career path she wishes you weren’t on, which infuriates you and leaves you finishing the call sounding like a 16-year-old, lower on the Psych Spectrum than you were a few minutes ago. A minute later, with your Primitive Mind now all riled up, you snap at your boyfriend in a text conversation, only to apologize a few hours later, when the tug-of-war in your head has come back up to its default position.</p> \n<p>If there were Fitbits that could track Psych Spectrum levels, we’d each see that we have our own graph.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.1-wave.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8760 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.1-wave-750x544.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.1-wave-750x544.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.1-wave-600x435.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.1-wave-768x557.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.1-wave.png 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> \n<div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n <h3><strong>The While We’re Here, My Recent Airplane Story Blue Box</strong></h3> \n <p>I recently engaged in a fun, joint Psych Spectrum roller coaster with a stranger on an airplane. We were on the runway, getting ready to take off, and I was doing my typical “I know the flight attendant said to turn all phones onto airplane mode but the whole policy is really quite inane so I’m just gonna keep texting until we take off and I lose service” thing, and a woman next to me decided I was an asshole and <em>loudly</em> <em>told on me</em> to the flight attendant, who was busy and didn’t hear her. So I did the only reasonable thing—I stealthily turned my phone onto airplane mode, re-opened my texts, and very out in the open, started typing a long text. The woman—my new eternal arch-nemesis—took the bait. She saw me texting and <em>again </em>got the flight attendant’s attention, saying, “Excuse me but he’s <em>still</em> texting.” When the flight attendant asked me to turn airplane mode on, I showed her my phone and calmly explained that airplane mode has been on this whole time and I just like to get some texting out of the way during flights—texts that don’t send until I land and re-connect to the internet. The flight attendant said, “Oh then that’s totally fine—my apologies.” I replied, “that’s okay,” and did a little “it’s amazing how awful people can be right?” sigh. Satan watched the whole thing and then just sat there silently, hopefully very embarrassed. It was an unbelievably satisfying, triumphant moment.</p> \n <p>Here’s how that interaction looks in 2D. I was hovering somewhere in the middle of the Psych Spectrum, around my default level. The woman next to me either has a particular pet peeve about people not following rules, or she was in a bad mood and low down on her Psych Spectrum and took her shit out on me. Had I remained in a Psych Spectrum middle-ground, my Higher Mind would have thought, “whoa that was aggressive…but I am kind of a cock about this kind of thing, so whatever it’s fair. Plus she’s a stranger and it would certainly be silly to take this personally.” I’d have smiled, said a little “oops, sorry about that,” and that would have been that.</p> \n <p>But that’s not what happened, because her aggressive tattletale move immediately threw my Primitive Mind into a rage, plummeting me down the Psych Spectrum. This banished my Higher Mind to the closet of my subconscious, allowing my Primitive Mind to come up with a genius-yet-psychotic plan for revenge. Which worked, and made my Primitive Mind feel deeply satisfied in a very not-grown-up way.</p> \n <p>Flash to two hours later. We’re in the air somewhere. The woman and I obviously haven’t spoken or made eye contact since the incident. Then she drops her glasses on the ground. I pick them up and hand them to her. She replies, “Thank you……hey by the way I’m sorry about before, that was totally wrong of me.” I immediately reply back, “Oh don’t worry about it, I totally understand!” For the rest of the flight, we’re best friends. She’s a lovely person and I just want her to be happy in life.</p> \n <p>In 2D: Thinking (incorrectly) that she had falsely accused me of something, she feels bad, and uses the glasses interaction as a chance to make amends. My Primitive Mind, sitting smugly in the driver’s seat of my mind, had spent the flight assuming that this woman <em>hated </em>me and in turn, she remained my lifelong nemesis. Then she apologized. In that instant, my Primitive Mind deflated like a balloon and my Higher Mind burst out of the closet, suddenly fully empowered. My hatred of this random woman evaporated as I was reminded that she is a human, not Satan, and all of my satisfied anger transformed into regret for the sneaky trick I pulled on her.</p> \n <p>Our little fight dragged both of our tugs-of-war downward, and then later, with a single positive interaction, we both snapped back upward. These kinds of Psych Spectrum roller coasters happen all the time.</p> \n</div> \n<p>Over the span of a week, your Psych Spectrum Fitbit might show you a graph like this:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.2-wave.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8761 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.2-wave-750x548.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"548\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.2-wave-750x548.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.2-wave-600x438.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.2-wave-768x561.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.2-wave.png 1227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> \n<p>But that’s just the micro picture.

In most cases, I think we grow up over time, as we get a little wiser, a little more self-aware, a little kinder and less self-obsessed. This means that as the years pass, our general Psych Spectrum equilibrium rises, like a stock chart that goes up and down week to week but over the years goes up overall. But we also go through rough times in our lives where we seem to revert to old ways we thought we were done with. When a downward macro trend gets out of hand, our lives can fall apart for a while. It’s the human roller coaster that we’re all on, whether we like it or not.</p> \n<p>Macro trends happen because Psych Spectrum movement in one part of our lives can spread to others and generate a feedback spiral, helping upward and downward trends to beget more of the same. Maybe you start to lose some confidence at work, which then bleeds into your dating life. You end up in a relationship that doesn’t make you feel so great about yourself—one you probably wouldn’t have gotten into when you felt better about everything a year ago. You find yourself eating badly and exercising less. The quality of your work goes down, which makes you lose more confidence. Your lower confidence worsens your relationship, and maybe your family notices that you haven’t been calling as much as you used to. You start having a hard time being happy for friends when good things happen in their lives, which puts a distance between you and them. What started as a single negative development becomes a vicious cycle that infects all parts of your life. Years later, when things have turned around for you, you look back on those years and with hindsight, you can see them for what they were—a trough in the roller coaster of your life.</p> \n<p>If the entire U.S. giant were wearing a Psych Spectrum Fitbit, I think we might see the same kind of graph.</p> \n<p>In the U.S., election season is like a raging “Primitive Minds Gone Wild” keg party. In the months leading up to the election, the nation’s air becomes more and more saturated with toxic, contagious Primitive Mind smoke. If the two U.S. political parties are like a married couple desperately in need of couples therapy, election season is when they’re at their worst and most contemptuous. Not many of us can hold our tugs-of-war in place in that kind of environment, and on aggregate, election season causes the country to drift downward on the Psych Spectrum. The country’s giant collective Primitive Mind gets stronger and louder, pulling the national tug-of-war downward a bit on the mountain. The frozen, non-thinking spots in the collective national brain—the country’s political Echo Chambers—swell up and expand.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2.1-Brains.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8764\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2.1-Brains.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2.1-Brains.png 2387w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2.1-Brains-600x270.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2.1-Brains-768x346.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2.1-Brains-750x338.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> \n<p>As we talked about in Chapter 9, politics is always a bit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/12/political-disney-world.html#bottom-heavy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>bottom-heavy</em></a>&nbsp;on the Psych Spectrum—but during election season, politics is at its bottom-heaviest.</p> \n<p>Then election season ends, a bunch of post-mortem op-eds are written, and eventually, everyone gets bored of politics and moves on, if only for a little while. Many Americans rise up a bit on the Political Ladder, leaving the low-rung giants behind and repopulating the high-rung giants. As people relax a little about politics, some communities become slightly less groupthinky, shrinking the national Echo Chambers down in size.</p> \n<p>Putting it all together, the election cycle oscillation might look something like this.

Like my example with an individual, to really get a sense of how a country is doing, we’d need to zoom out and try to see the longer-term macro trends.</p> \n<p>Over a period of many decades, the hope is that countries have an upward trajectory. If almost everyone in your country would agree that they’d rather live there today than 100 years ago, it may be a sign that the big, national giant has managed to move higher up the mountain throughout the century, not lower. But even the most stable, healthy countries can go through painful periods of reversion as well.</p> \n<p>The history of the U.S. has certainly been a roller coaster, with plenty of upward macro trends and some eras of negative progress too. I’m not enough of a U.S. historian to take a respectable crack at what the full graph of that roller coaster might look like (though I encourage commenters to give it a try), but when I look at recent times, here’s what I see:</p> \n<p>Over the past 30 years, the U.S. has been on a downward macro trend—a negative feedback spiral that has been accelerating in recent years. And the harder I think about what that macro trend means, about what’s causing it, and about what its consequences could be, the more worried I get.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">__________</p> \n<p>I suspect that this trend is bigger than the U.S., because it seems to be mirrored in many parts of Europe and other parts of the world. But having focused the majority of my thinking and research on the U.S., I’ll limit my analysis to what’s been going on here (though I’d love to hear from non-U.S. readers about what macro trends they see happening in their country).</p> \n<p>On its face, the downward trend I’m referring to looks like an increase in political polarization, both among voters and among politicians. Let’s take a look at both areas:</p> \n<p style=\"font-size:32px\"><strong>The Voter Polarization Story</strong></p> \n<p>Voter polarization is an old pastime in the U.S.—but over the past half century, things have devolved into a particularly nasty situation.</p> \n<p>You could probably trace the roots of the trend all the way back to 1945, when Hitler died. As we’ve discussed, nothing unites a group of humans like a common enemy—and the first half of the twentieth century was dominated by giant world wars that helped Americans to feel united. The U.S. never stopped being immersed in foreign conflicts, but Hitler’s demise marked the last time Americans were totally, uncontroversially united against a common enemy.

A wave of pro-Communism sentiment from parts of the Left started to annoy the shit out of the Right, who felt that the Soviet Union and the spread of Communism should be viewed as pure evil, no differently than Hitler. Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican candidate for president, summed up this sentiment in his nomination acceptance speech, when he said:</p> \n<p><em>I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue. </em></p> \n<p>This was a rallying call against Communism, but it was also a rallying call to the American Right to dig their heels in with their stances, whether the Democrats were on board or not.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Left was undergoing a shift in the other direction. In his 1997 book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/35vEKI2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Achieving Our Country</em></a><em>, </em>philosopher Richard Rorty<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-1-8757\" id=\"note-1-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> describes the mid-1960s as a period during which the Left began to transition from what he calls The Reformist Left—who were patriotic and devoted to making pragmatic progressive improvements to the traditional U.S. system—to what he calls The Cultural Left. The Cultural Left, led by students who were born after World War II ended, was less patriotic than the Left of previous decades, viewing the U.S. as somewhat of a failed experiment. This shift put them in direct conflict with the super patriotic Goldwater Right. The Cultural Left was also more politically militant and less interested in pragmatic reform than the old, Reformist Left had been, falling nicely into Goldwater’s militant “extremism over moderation on matters of virtue” camp—only on the opposite side of every issue.</p> \n<p>The renewed partisan divide was more clear-cut than it had been in decades past—and the major events of the late 1960s were viewed by both factions as binary political battlegrounds.</p> \n<p>According to Rorty, the Cultural Left, who were often critical of Capitalism and sometimes sympathetic towards the Soviet Union, despised the Vietnam War, while most of the Right fervently supported it. Anti-war Republicans and pro-war Democrats increasingly became persona non grata in their own party and either faded away or defected to the other side.</p> \n<p>The Cultural Left saw the fight for civil rights as not only necessary but as a symbol of the country’s moral bankruptcy. This really boiled the South’s potato—and Republicans jumped on the opportunity. Democrats had dominated the South in presidential elections for a century, and by solidifying in resistance to the Democrats’ 1965 Voting Rights Act (in what Nixon’s strategists called “the Southern Strategy”), the Republicans snatched the South away, and they’ve (mostly) held it <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2010/11/11/the-long-goodbye\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ever since</a>. What had previously been a hazier divide on race issues like segregation, with some conservative Southern Democrats and some more progressive Northern Republicans previously in support of or opposed to segregation, respectively, now sorted itself out more cleanly.</p> \n<p>The cultural gap between the parties also widened. The Cultural Left, with their drugs and their hair and their music and their rampant sex, became increasingly irritating to the more traditional Republicans. The Left had a similarly one-dimensional view of the Right, seeing them as a group of sweater-wearing, warmongering, financially predatory old white racists.</p> \n<p>It all came to a head in the 1968 election, with Richard Nixon riding into the White House on a wave of populist appeal to everyone fed up with the Cultural Left—who, in turn, saw the election result as further reason to lose hope in the country.</p> \n<p>The tumult of the 1960s sowed many of the roots for the modern Left/Right divides on foreign, fiscal, and social issues. According to a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Generations-Politics-Parents-Princeton-Library/dp/0691615225\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comprehensive study</a>, people are at their most politically and ideologically impressionable between their mid-teens and mid-20s, and all of those Baby Boomers born in the 1940s and 50s—none of whom were sentient the last time the U.S. felt like a single, united front against a common enemy, and most of whom were deeply influenced by the events of the late 60s—are, by the 80s and 90s, running the country. The Greatest Generation (who fought in World War II) are by this point mostly retired, and it’s the Baby Boomers who are the politicians, the university administrators, the CEOs, the home buyers, and the media moguls.</p> \n<p>During the following decades, we see voter polarization steadily increasing. <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2017/10/05/the-partisan-divide-on-political-values-grows-even-wider/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pew data</a>, collected over the past 25 years, shows us that the gap between the viewpoints of Democrats and Republicans has grown on issues across the board. <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-1-8757\" id=\"note2-1-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/128a.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8765\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/128a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"934\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/128a.png 1842w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/128a-600x467.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/128a-768x598.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/128a-750x584.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> <p>Averaging out the growth of the gap in those 10 graphs yields a smooth trend—<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-2-8757\" id=\"note2-2-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/143.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8766\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/143.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"598\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/143.png 1222w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/143-502x600.png 502w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/143-768x919.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/143-627x750.png 627w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> <p>—even as gaps in viewpoints between the country’s races, religions, and other types of groups have remained unchanged:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-3-8757\" id=\"note2-3-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/142.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8767\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/142.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"639\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/142.png 1202w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/142-470x600.png 470w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/142-768x981.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/142-587x750.png 587w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> <p>Pew helps us visualize this another way—by plotting Americans on a spectrum from consistently liberal on one end to consistently conservative on the other.

If there were no relationship, the “correlation coefficient” would be zero. If there were a perfect relationship, it would be 1.

The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism…It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions…it is a spirit not to be encouraged.</em></p> <p>Everyone burst out laughing and the government has been polarized ever since.</p> <p>The John Adams–Thomas Jefferson election of 1800 was one of the <a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/19668/election-1800-birth-negative-campaigning-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dirtiest in history</a>. Jefferson then spent his presidency at fierce odds with Hamilton and the Federalists. Half a century later, the country descended into Civil War. A few decades after that, the 1890s were a hyper-polarized time<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-2-8757\" id=\"note-2-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> that in many ways resembled today’s divides.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-3-8757\" id=\"note-3-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> In the 1930s, the parties clashed again over the New Deal.</p> <p>Looking at the history seems to support the idea that a country like the U.S. goes through macro oscillations in polarization. What seems like a trajectory into hell when you only look at WWII to today looks more like just another part of a roller coaster from a more zoomed-out angle.(Though for reasons we’ll discuss later, the modern trend may be uniquely dangerous.)</p> <p>Probably the most commonly-cited metric to measure polarization levels in the U.S. House and Senate is something called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DW-NOMINATE</a>,<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-4-8757\" id=\"note-4-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> which places politicians on a liberal-to-conservative scale based on data like their <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/roll_call_vote.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">roll-call vote</a> behavior.

That would certainly seem like a possible culprit in House polarization, though it wouldn’t explain the trends in the Senate (which aren’t subject to district lines).</p> <p>Then there’s Newt Gingrich. When Gingrich won his first election in 1978, the Democrats were starting their 25th straight year as the majority in Congress.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-11-8757\" id=\"note2-11-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">11</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/538.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8778 size-full\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/538.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1662\" height=\"1516\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/538.png 1662w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/538-600x547.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/538-768x701.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/538-750x684.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1662px) 100vw, 1662px\" /></a></p> <p>During this long tenure, the Democrats <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KHZTfMLGSYg?t=1118\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">didn’t always treat the Republicans so well</a>, and Gingrich and other Republicans were frustrated that between the Democrats having more money and more access privileges due to their majority position, and continual assistance from what they saw as left-leaning mainstream media, the Democrat stranglehold on Congress had no seeming end in sight. So Gingrich innovated. He wanted to reframe Congressional elections to be less about the actual people running for Congress and more about a binary tribal war between the Left and the Right. Over the following 16 years, as Gingrich gained more seniority, he emphasized a culture among Republican politicians of distrust and disgust for Democratic leadership and made it taboo to say anything to legitimize them.</p> <p>In 1994, when the Republicans finally won back Congress, Gingrich, now the Speaker of the House, doubled down on the effort to tribalize. He crunched the traditional five-day legislative schedule into three days. According to Haidt and Abrams, “he changed the legislative calendar so that all business was done Tuesday through Thursday, and he encouraged his incoming freshmen not to move to the District. He did not want them to develop personal friendships with Democrats. He did not want their spouses to serve on the same charitable boards.”<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-12-8757\" id=\"note2-12-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">12</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-5-8757\" id=\"note-5-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a> He also helped to do away with the seniority system for committee chairmen, which law professor Cynthia Farina says “many now blame for enhancing extremist voices, punishing defections from the party line, and burying measures with bipartisan support.”<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-13-8757\" id=\"note2-13-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">13</a> <p>Whatever the cause, the shift from a standard partisan tone to a fully tribal Us-vs.-Them tone is now ubiquitous in Washington.

If a reasonably stable human society starts falling into some kind of downward spiral, it’s probably because something about one or both of the independent variables has changed—usually, something about the environment.</p> <p>I’ve read a whole bunch of sociological theories about why we in the U.S. have been spiraling down a polarization vortex, and there are lots of interesting ideas, with little consensus. Drawing upon what I see as the most compelling theories, here’s my hypothesis:</p> <p>Due to changes in the environment over recent decades, we’ve become connected in all the wrong ways—and it’s led to a resurgence of the Power Games in the U.S.</p> <p>There are two elements of the hypothesis:</p> <p style=\"font-size:32px\"><strong>1) Geographic Bubbles</strong></p> <p>Over the past generation, Americans have become <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mean-years-of-schooling-1?tab=chart&amp;country=USA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more educated</a>, which has made them more mobile. <em>The Economist</em> <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2008/06/19/the-big-sort\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cites a study</a> that found that “45% of young Americans with a college degree moved states within five years of graduating, whereas only 19% of those with only a high-school education did.”</p> <p>And here’s the thing about mobility. If lots of people have the means to choose where they settle down, and those people tend to have even a <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2016/06/22/4-partisan-stereotypes-views-of-republicans-and-democrats-as-neighbors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>slight</em> preference</a> to live near other people like them, everyone ends up totally segregated. This phenomenon is explained in a 1971 paper called <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Dynamic models of segregation</em></a>, but it’s best explored using a <a href=\"https://ncase.me/polygons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brilliant interactive simulation</a> by Nicky Case and Vi Hart.</p> <p>The simulation has two kinds of characters, a blue square and a yellow triangle.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8781\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"148\" height=\"83\" /></a></p> <p>These could represent people of different religions, different races, different socioeconomic backgrounds, or anything else. For our purposes, they’ll represent U.S. Democrats and Republicans.</p> <p>In the simulation, there’s one key metric, called “individual bias percentage”— a number that represents the minimum percentage of “sameness” (for us, ideological sameness) each shape finds acceptable among their direct neighbors. So for example, say the shapes like living in a politically diverse neighborhood, but they want at least 33% of their direct neighbors to be politically similar to them. That means they’ll only be unhappy enough to move if less than 33% of their neighbors are similar to them politically, and beyond that, they prefer diversity. To illustrate this, imagine these three tiny neighborhoods:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8782\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1736\" height=\"780\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1.png 1736w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-600x270.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-768x345.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-750x337.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1736px) 100vw, 1736px\" /></a></p> <p>Given our 33% condition above, everyone in the middle neighborhood is happy, because they live in a politically diverse neighborhood while also each having at least 1/3 of their direct neighbors share their views. On the right, no one is happy because there’s no political diversity, but no one is unhappy enough to move. On the left, there’s an unhappy triangle, because their direct neighbors are 5/6 squares and only 1/6 triangles (the other triangle in the left neighborhood is fine because it has only two direct neighbors, and one of them (50%) is also a triangle). Make sense?</p> <p>Next, Case and Hart bring out a big, diverse town with an interactive slider next to it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8783\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-2.png 2120w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-2-600x360.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-2-768x461.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-2-750x450.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> <p>The slider lets you adjust the “individual bias percentage” of the shapes in the town.

We end up with a completely segregated town.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8788\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"725\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-1.png 2110w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-1-600x362.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-1-768x464.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-1-750x453.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> <p>This exposes a stark fact: if easily mobile people like diversity but prefer not to be the <em>minority</em> where they live, it leads to complete segregated homogeneity. Or as Case and Hart put it, “small individual bias can lead to large collective bias.” The only way areas stay diverse—racially, ethnically, politically—is if people like diversity <em>more </em>than they dislike being in the minority.</p> <p>Back to our story. The simulation suggests that if Baby Boomers were, on average, a few “individual political bias percentage” points higher than their parents, <em>and </em>they were a bit more capable of moving and choosing their location, then when the Boomers reached home-buying age, the country would quickly sort itself into politically segregated neighborhoods in politically segregated counties.</p> <p>Which is exactly what happened.</p> <p>In his book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/37EC2Bv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Big Sort</em></a>, Bill Bishop examines how Americans have shifted geographically in relation to political leaning—and he found that Americans are far less likely to live in politically diverse areas than they used to be. Politically, Americans have formed geographical Echo Chambers. Living in a geographical Echo Chamber means people will find themselves surrounded by agreement at dinner parties, at local churches and parks and businesses, and at school, which is where children make their lifelong friends.</p> <p>The “Big Sort” shows up in poll numbers. In an election, pollsters define a “landslide county” as one in which the winning candidate beat the losing candidate by 20 percentage points or more—in other words, a very red or very blue county. In the 1976 presidential election, 27% of Americans lived in landslide counties, with the remaining 73% living in more politically balanced counties where the election margin was closer.</p> <p>By 1992, the percentage of Americans living in a landslide county had moved from 27% to 39%. That number has continued to rise every election since, with the 2016 results showing that <em>61% </em>of Americans now live in landslide counties.</p> <p>FiveThirtyEight <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/purple-america-has-all-but-disappeared/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">explains further</a>, writing about the 2016 presidential election:</p> <p><em>Of the nation’s 3,113 counties (or county equivalents), just 303 were decided by single-digit margins—less than 10 percent. In contrast, 1,096 counties fit that description in 1992, even though that election featured a wider national spread. During the same period, the number of </em><strong><em>extreme landslide counties</em></strong><em>—those decided by margins exceeding 50 percentage points—exploded from 93 to 1,196, or over a third of the nation’s counties. … The electorate’s move toward single-party geographic enclaves has been particularly pronounced at the extremes. Between 1992 and 2016, the share of voters living in extreme landslide counties quintupled from 4 percent to 21 percent.</em></p> <p>They sum this all up in one graph:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/122.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8789\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/122.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/122.png 1150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/122-600x501.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/122-768x641.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/122-750x626.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" /></a></p> <p>Landslide counties are bad for progress.

The length of the yellow line connecting the two circles represents the brand’s level of <em>dishonesty</em>.

News brands are rarely like <em>The Onion</em>—they typically claim to be squarely on the North Star. So if and when they ultimately present with bias and inaccuracy, it misleads their audience, filling them with real conviction without filling them with real knowledge.</p> <p>People will always disagree on which media brands are which level of biased/accurate, but at least the matrix can help us understand each other’s viewpoints, and the gaps between them, a bit more concretely.</p> <p>I can offer some of my own speculation. Looking broadly at the matrix, I’d guess that if you could take every presenter of news in the U.S. with a decent-sized audience and plot their actual location on the Media Matrix, you’d end up with many of them falling somewhere within an arch-shaped region—because bias and inaccuracy are probably often correlated.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11-media-matrix-arch.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8801 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11-media-matrix-arch-556x600.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11-media-matrix-arch-556x600.png 556w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11-media-matrix-arch-768x828.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11-media-matrix-arch-695x750.png 695w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11-media-matrix-arch.png 841w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" /></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">I’d bet most of them claim to be entirely objective and accurate, leaving the North Star covered in yellow circles.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">I’d also bet that of the brands inside this arch, the average audience member lines up pretty well with our </span><a style=\"font-size: inherit;\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thinking Ladder</a><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11a-media-matrix-arch-ladder-V2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8866 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11a-media-matrix-arch-ladder-V2-556x600.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11a-media-matrix-arch-ladder-V2-556x600.png 556w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11a-media-matrix-arch-ladder-V2-768x828.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11a-media-matrix-arch-ladder-V2-695x750.png 695w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.11a-media-matrix-arch-ladder-V2.png 841w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" /></a></p> <p>In any case, with this lens in mind, let’s look at two major recent media transformations:</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>Media Transformation #1: Broadcasting to Narrowcasting</strong></p> <p>In the 1980s, most Americans got their news from the Rather/Jennings/Brokaw trio on CBS, ABC, and NBC, and before them, from nationwide titans like Walter Cronkite. In those days, networks competed with each other for who could capture the largest share of American viewers. They were cautious to avoid seeming too politically biased and they knew that reporting a story incorrectly could lead to damaged credibility and a loss of viewers. So they had to be at least in the vicinity of the North Star.</p> <p>Some might argue that the people who ran these networks (along with those who ran the major newspapers at the time) were reasonably objective and accurate because those were the sacred values of those organizations. Those more cynical might argue that the mission was just to maximize profit, and that they presented news with reasonable objectivity and accuracy simply because they would have been penalized with a loss of viewers for not doing so. It’s hard to know for sure, because the media market was configured at the time such that the market incentives drove selfish media brands toward the North Star.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.16-media-matrix.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8856\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.16-media-matrix.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"595\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.16-media-matrix.png 826w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.16-media-matrix-545x600.png 545w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.16-media-matrix-768x845.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.16-media-matrix-682x750.png 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\" /></a></p> <p>In recent decades, new technology has caused dramatic changes to the traditional media environment.</p> <p>First, there was <strong>the birth of cable television</strong> around 1980, and with it, the advent of cable news. CNN (which literally stands for Cable News Network) launched in 1980. Cable channels, burdened with fewer regulations and hazier expectations than mainstream networks, could be more experimental with the way they covered the news.</p> <p>Then there was <strong>the end of the</strong> <strong>Fairness Doctrine.</strong> In 1949, the FCC (the U.S. Federal Communications Commission) enacted the <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40009.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fairness Doctrine</a>, which required anyone who held a broadcast license to present controversial issues of public importance in what they called an honest, equitable, and balanced manner. In 1987, in the face of arguments that the Fairness Doctrine was in direct conflict with the First Amendment’s freedom of the press clause, it was revoked.</p> <p>Not coincidentally, the demise of the Fairness Doctrine was soon followed by a sharp rise in blatantly politically biased media. Conservative talk radio exploded onto the scene in the late 1980s, most notably with <em>The Rush Limbaugh Show</em>, which debuted in 1988 and made Limbaugh the country’s most syndicated radio host by 1991. In 1996, <em>Fox News </em>and <em>MSNBC</em> were born.</p> <p>When I was in college, I went to see Ted Koppel (the anchor of ABC’s late-night news show <em>Nightline</em>) speak. I remember the host commenting that Koppel was famously secretive about his own political leanings. This was standard for a prominent anchor in the past, but by the end of the 1990s, a huge portion of Americans were getting their news from people whose political leaning was supremely out on the table.</p> <p>Then the internet sprung into our lives, and with it, sites like <em>The Drudge Report </em>(1995), <em>Slate </em>(1996)<em>, The Huffington Post </em>(2005), and <em>Breitbart</em> (2007), along with a trillion political blogs. The internet takes narrowcasting up into a new gear—full-fledged tribal media.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <em>Fox News </em>and conservative radio would continue to grow in size and influence, which was countered with a new genre of news TV on the Left—political talk shows. <em>The Daily Show </em>became a multi-decade sensation by serving as—depending on who you ask—either the voice of reason and sanity in the face of growing right-wing madness, or a show where elitist progressives would cackle as Jon Stewart relentlessly mocked their political outgroup. After Jon Stewart left, <em>The Daily Show</em> spawned, giving birth to a slew of similar “look at how awful the Right is” talk shows on even bigger stages.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-6-8757\" id=\"note-6-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a> <p>Now, of course, this discussion will ruffle all kinds of feathers. People loyal to the Left will note that Fox News and conservative talk radio—which serve as the primary news outlets for a vast portion of the nation’s conservatives—are significantly more biased than their left-leaning counterparts. People loyal to the Right will argue back that what progressives think of as objective, mainstream news brands—both currently and in previous decades—are all actually quite left-leaning and the reason a brand like Fox News has to exist in the first place.</p> <p>There are <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://adfontesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Media-Bias-Chart_Version-3.1_Watermark-min.jpg\">all</a></span> <a href=\"https://www.adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">kinds</span></a> <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-media-bias-chart-that-led-to-trumps-threat-to-regulate-google-2018-08-28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">of</span></a> <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/lmeh42e24ptz.png\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">charts</span></a> online taking a crack at displaying major news brands along a political bias axis.

The closest I could find to something that seemed intent on using an objective methodology to lay things out is this chart, from a site called <a href=\"https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AllSides</a> (vertical position is meaningless):</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8804 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart-545x600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"613\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart-545x600.jpg 545w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart-768x845.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart-682x750.jpg 682w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart.jpg 1531w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px\" /></a></p> <p>The difficult thing about topics where bias is both rampant and hard to quantify is that it’s hard to feel confident in anything you read. When I ran this chart by a mix of friends, a highly conservative friend (we’ll call him Bill LeMean) responded with <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f644.png\" alt=\"🙄\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />. When I asked him for clarification, Bill went on a tirade about how absurd it is to put brands like the AP and Reuters in the center and not further left, finishing with some angry thing about “The Precious,” which is his term for how he thinks I think of Obama. So who knows. Bill LeMean certainly has his own biases—but I also haven’t read enough AP or Reuters to judge whether he’s making a good point here or not.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-7-8757\" id=\"note-7-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> <p>Part of the reason it’s so hard to figure out media bias levels is that it’s one of the areas where we’re all craziest. There’s a phenomenon called the “hostile media effect,” which says that people on both sides <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281191995_A_Three-Decade_Retrospective_on_the_Hostile_Media_Effect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tend to see</a> the media as biased against their camp, even when they’re looking at the <a href=\"https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jpiliavi/965/hwang.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exact same coverage</a>.</p> <p>But there are some interesting stats out there that can offer clues. Like this chart, from <a href=\"https://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pew</a>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8805\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"631\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart-2.png 640w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-chart-2-600x539.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" /></a></p> <p>Or <a href=\"https://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/pj_14-10-21_mediapolarization-01/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this one</a>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-trust.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8806\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-trust.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"966\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-trust.png 420w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-trust-310x600.png 310w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/media-trust-388x750.png 388w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> <p>These don’t tell us about the bias levels of media brands, but they do tell us how the brands are viewed by the public. Looking at these charts, I can speculate how a vicious cycle could take place. Once the conservative media brands launch, many conservatives frustrated with the mainstream media would defect to them. Without those conservatives, the mainstream media has an audience that’s now overall more left-leaning than it used to be. To cater to their audience, they’ll probably start leaning a bit more left themselves—which causes more moderate conservatives to defect to the right-leaning brands. Meanwhile, with an audience made up almost entirely of conservatives, right-leaning media can move further right with little pushback, knowing that even their more moderate viewers will stick with them over the left-leaning options.</p> <p>We can also look at the people who work at the media brands. One trend that gives credence to the notion that mainstream media is moving further left is the increasing nonexistence of openly Republican journalists.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-15-8757\" id=\"note2-15-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">15</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/124.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8807\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/124.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/124.png 1698w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/124-600x433.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/124-768x555.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/124-750x542.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p> <p>Fortunately, we don’t need to have all the answers here. What’s important for our purposes is the bigger trend in play: broadcasting has given way to narrowcasting. And the narrowcasting market works differently than the broadcasting market. With more politically homogenous audiences, the market demand for truth goes down a little bit in favor of an increased demand for viewpoint confirmation. Likewise, unfair bias against politicians most of the audience dislikes is no longer penalized by the market—and is perhaps even rewarded with a more loyal audience. In a world of narrowcasting, the market incentives magnet is no longer located at the North Star.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.17-media-matrix-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8808 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.17-media-matrix-1-545x600.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"545\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.17-media-matrix-1-545x600.png 545w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.17-media-matrix-1-768x845.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.17-media-matrix-1-682x750.png 682w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.17-media-matrix-1.png 826w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px\" /></a></p> <h3><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">Political Junk Food</span></h3> <p><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">Remember this scene from Chapter 7?</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5.1-skittles-V2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8867 size-full\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5.1-skittles-V2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1641\" height=\"1564\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5.1-skittles-V2.png 1641w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5.1-skittles-V2-600x572.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5.1-skittles-V2-768x732.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5.1-skittles-V2-750x715.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1641px) 100vw, 1641px\" /></a></p> <p>Every business knows that the easiest way to make money is to sell directly to the simple, predictable Primitive Mind.</p> <p>To sell food to the Higher Mind, you have to worry about quality and nutrition, which is expensive and hard.

Its purpose is to combine three of the Primitive Mind’s favorite things: viewpoint/identity confirmation, outgroup bashing, and gossip. Primitive Mind crack.</p> <h3>A Politics Reality Show</h3> <p>Broadcast TV news tried, at least a little, to be a show about reality. Narrowcast news tries to be a reality show. Big difference.</p> <p>Reality is interesting sometimes. Reality shows are interesting all the time. Reality shows aren’t about reality, they’re about entertainment—so reality show producers manufacture a carefully edited, fictional version of reality that’s wildly entertaining, and super addictive. And what’s the reality TV producer’s best trick? Drama and negativity. Would anyone watch <em>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </em>if the characters got along most of the time? Of course not. That’s why every five minutes of the show includes a conflict of some kind.</p> <p>As soon as you realize that news media is also entertainment media, the constant coverage of conflict and drama makes perfect sense.</p> <p>In the U.S., most of us are addicted to a trashy reality show called <em>The Real Politicians of Washington.</em><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-8-8757\" id=\"note-8-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> \n                 <div id=\"“eggTen”\">\n                  <div id=\"image-map-pro-6346\"></div>\n                 </div> \n                 <div style=\"height:38px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div> <p>There are whole teams of heroes and villains, lots of ongoing storylines, and endless conflict. It’s a perfect vehicle for a dramatic, super-addictive soap opera.</p> <p>It’s not that these heavily featured politicians or the super played-up storylines are unimportant. It’s that we receive a totally <em>skewed</em> depiction of the full set of relevant political issues. The issues that make headlines day in and day out are usually overrepresented, while lots of other important political stories—like the bills being passed each week by the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/committees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">52 House and Senate committees</a>—are severely underreported.</p> <p>I recently had a chance to talk with a Congressman named <a href=\"https://kilmer.house.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Derek Kilmer</a>. Kilmer is the head of a House coalition called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New Democrats</a>. Here’s how they describe themselves:</p> <p><em>The New Democrat Coalition is made up of 103 forward-thinking Democrats who are committed to pro-economic growth, pro-innovation, and fiscally responsible policies. New Democrats are a solutions oriented coalition seeking to bridge the gap between left and right by challenging outmoded partisan approaches to governing. New Democrats believe the challenges ahead are too great for Members of Congress to refuse to cooperate purely out of partisanship. </em></p> <p>Snoooooooooze. The editors of <em>Real Politicians </em>waste no airtime on this kind of shit because it’s nuanced and productive and boring as fuck. Kilmer is full of measured, well-thought-out ideas for how to make the country better and I’m falling asleep just writing this sentence.</p> <p>Actual politics, like actual reality, is boring to most people. So tribal media brands do what reality producers do—they manufacture a carefully edited, fictional version of politics that’s wildly entertaining.</p> <p>That’s why most Americans who will tell you they’re super passionate about politics can barely name ten current members of Congress.

Of course it’s also true that Republican politicians, especially the current president, have often been dismissive of climate change. And “taking environmental action” is not necessarily the same as “taking action to curb emissions.” But the actual reality according to the survey makes me feel very differently about what kinds of strategies climate change activists should be using in order to build the necessarily coalition to change our trajectory. Presenting an inaccurate version of reality breeds displaced anger and division and hurts our ability to move toward important goals—all in the name of editing the politics reality show to be more entertaining with crisper, juicier storylines.</p> <p>The most dramatic events on <em>Real Politicians </em>are elections. Elections are the show’s climaxes. And the show’s editors make sure to over-dramatize the shit out of them.</p> <p>This is the past century of U.S. presidential elections.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-Zig-Zag-presidents-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8870 size-full\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-Zig-Zag-presidents-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2084\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-Zig-Zag-presidents-v2.png 2084w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-Zig-Zag-presidents-v2-600x202.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-Zig-Zag-presidents-v2-768x258.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-Zig-Zag-presidents-v2-750x252.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2084px) 100vw, 2084px\" /></a></p> <p>It’s a clear zig-zag pattern. Which makes sense. Citizens are typically not that happy with their lives, and it’s a natural impulse to blame the government for our problems. It’s also our impulse to naively believe that our favorite new politician will be able to fix all those problems, if only they could win the presidency. So after a single party has held down the presidency for a while, the country, still unhappy, decides that it’s time to vote for the other party.</p> <p>And yet—I remember when Bush won reelection in 2004, everyone in the media was talking about how Democrats just weren’t able to win in politics anymore for a number of what-seemed-like-rock-solid sociological theories. Then the Democrats swept the midterms in 2006 and the presidency in 2008.</p> <p>I remember in 2012, when Obama won reelection, hearing people say that the country had fundamentally shifted, and there were way more Hispanic immigrants than there used to be, and the Tea Party had rendered the Republican party irrelevant, and all of this other proof that times had changed and the Democrats wouldn’t ever lose a presidential election again.</p> <p>Then Republicans swept all three branches of government in 2016, at which point I read all these articles about how the Left is more <em>culturally</em> powerful but the Right is simply more <em>politically </em>powerful. I also heard a bunch of stuff about how gerrymandering ensured that the Democrats would never win back the House again. Then the Democrats won the House in 2018.</p> <p>Media channels are for-profit businesses in a marketplace, behaving rationally. When people care about entertainment and confirmation more than truth, you end up with skewed coverage, over-dramatized storylines, and <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/01/20/covington-catholic-nathan-phillips-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/on-ukraine-its-hard-to-tell-fox-news-and-4chan-apart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juliagalef/status/894092020494381056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/04/conservative-daily-post/evidence-ridiculously-thin-sensational-claim-huge-/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-york-times-corrects-story-on-nikki-haleys-curtains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.infowars.com/spirit-cooking-clinton-campaign-chairman-invited-to-bizarre-satanic-performance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/disputed-buzzfeed-story-trump-cohen-back-limelight-after-mueller-report-n996131\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2019/dec/18/tucker-carlson/carlson-falsely-claims-immigrants-are-dirtying-pot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/06/22/girl-time-magazine-cover-never-separated-mom-father-says/725499002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/statement-on-coverage-of-seth-rich-murder-investigation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/5/17821946/white-power-hand-signal-brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-hearing-zina-bash-4chan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lots</a> of fake news.</p> <p>In some ways, this is the return of an old story. The broadcast news era was something of an anomaly, generated by the advent of television. Before that, super partisan newspapers were common. James Baughman <a href=\"https://ethics.journalism.wisc.edu/2011/04/20/the-fall-and-rise-of-partisan-journalism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes</a> about political media in the 19<sup>th</sup> century:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-17-8757\" id=\"note2-17-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">17</a> <p><em>“Editors,” wrote one historian, “unabashedly shaped the news and their editorial comment to partisan purposes. They sought to convert the doubters, recover the wavering, and hold the committed. ‘The power of the press,’ one journalist candidly explained, ‘consists not in its logic or eloquence, but in its ability to manufacture facts, or to give coloring to facts that have occurred.’”</em></p> <p>But in other important ways, this is a totally unprecedented media landscape.</p> <p>Most notably, we have the internet. And one special kind of internet magic would be the source of a second key transformation to the media environment.</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>Media Transformation #2: Algorithms</strong></p> <p>Normally, I appreciate the Google search algorithm. It filters results that are most relevant to where I live and what I’m typically interested in, and it can guess remarkably well what I want to search for after I type just a few letters, saving me the trouble of typing the whole search.</p> <p>I appreciate the YouTube algorithm, which knows my favorite channels and makes sure I never miss their latest videos.</p> <p>I appreciate the Facebook algorithm, which spares me the knowledge of what Johnny from high school 20 years ago made for dinner last night while making sure to let me know when Johnny gets engaged, so I can go look through his most recent 87 photos to see the deal with his fiancé.</p> <p>Internet algorithms are usually good things, and very helpful.</p> <p>But new technology often comes along with unintended, unanticipated consequences.</p> <p>When I’m watching a YouTube video and I glance at the thumbnails on the sidebar, I’m more likely to click on a video featuring someone explaining history or science than I am to click on a video featuring someone reviewing movies. YouTube has picked up on that, which is why I never see movie review videos on my YouTube sidebar, but I’m constantly being introduced to great new history or science explainer videos.</p> <p>But then one night last year someone sent me a funny video a driver took with their phone. The driver taking the video had pissed off another driver, who opened his window and cursed out the driver. The angry driver got so worked up that he swung his arm at the video-taking driver angrily, and in the process, punched his own side mirror off. A delight of all delights.</p> <p>Then the video ended, and YouTube offered me my choice of nine more videos in the road rage genre. I clicked on one of them and watched it. Then YouTube offered me nine more. I had a lot of work to do, so I held down the Command key and clicked on all nine, opening them in nine new tabs, and watched them all. Two<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-9-8757\" id=\"note-9-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a> hours later, utterly disgusted with myself, I pulled the dramatic “punishing Chrome by holding down Command-Q and closing all eight Chrome windows and all 127 of their open tabs” move. A nightmare waste of time. But at least it was over.</p> <p>Except it wasn’t over. Somewhere out there, the YouTube algorithm was lining its Tim Urban fishhook with the best of the best road rage videos, which have reliably appeared in my YouTube sidebar ever since that regrettable night, damning me to an entire life wasted watching delightful road rage videos.</p> <p>Internet algorithms are profit-maximizing mechanisms that want to spoon feed me whatever I’m most likely to click on. This is a win-win, symbiotic relationship—until it’s not. When an algorithm is catering to your Higher Mind, it’s your friend. When it’s luring in your Primitive Mind against your Higher Mind’s will, the relationship is parasitic.</p> <p>So how does this apply to politics? What happens when your Higher Mind knows it’s important to challenge your beliefs and likes to click links representing a variety of viewpoints—but your Primitive Mind wants to click only on links that will further confirm and strengthen your existing viewpoints? Both minds will get some clicks in there—and overall, that might yield 75% clicks on confirmation links and only 25% clicks on dissent links.</p> <p>It won’t take long for the algorithms to start treating political confirmation links like my YouTube treated road rage videos. Soon, your Google searches and YouTube searches will turn up <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">only confirmation links</a>.</p> <p>The geographic and information bubbles don’t leave much room for air. As <a href=\"http://www.thebigsort.com/home.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Big Sort</em></a> author Bill Bishop puts it: “We now live in a giant feedback loop, hearing our own thoughts about what’s right and wrong bounced back to us by the television shows we watch, the newspapers and books we read, the blogs we visit online, the sermons we hear and the neighbourhoods we live in.”</p> <p>On social media, the effects of the two bubbles are multiplied. Most of our newsfeeds are insular networks made up of people who get their info from the same filter bubble we do. In 2017, PNAS <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/06/20/1618923114\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">analyzed</a> over half a million tweets about three politically polarizing topics: gun control, same-sex marriage, and climate change. Using an algorithm that estimated the political leaning of each account, they examined the accounts that retweeted each tweet. The findings? Political tweets are almost entirely retweeted by those who agree with the tweet, to followers who also almost entirely agree with the tweet. They visualized these findings, which shows the tweets almost exclusively bouncing around a single Echo Chamber, with little chance to change anyone’s mind. A frenzy of confirmation:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-18-8757\" id=\"note2-18-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">18</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/retweets.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8819\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/retweets.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"607\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/retweets.jpg 1280w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/retweets-600x285.jpg 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/retweets-768x364.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/retweets-750x356.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></a></p> <p>Even when there are exceptions—well-worded dissenting tweets that end up on people’s feeds—they have a hard time spreading, because social media is saturated with peer pressure to conform ideologically and shame those who dare challenge the narrative.</p> <p>On top of all that, social media provides another unfortunate filter: it dumbs down complex information. In an <a href=\"https://ncase.me/crowds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interactive about crowds</a>, Nicky Case explains: “Ideas don’t pass perfectly from one person to another the way a virus does. Like a game of Telephone, the message gets mutated with each re-telling…so, over time, ideas ‘evolve’ to be more catchy, copy-able, contagious.” Since complexity and catchiness are often inversely correlated, the super connectedness offered by the internet may actually <em>hinder </em>the spread of complex ideas.</p> <p>Putting this all together, the internet quickly becomes a downward magnet on your psyche. You may be a high-rung thinker interested in hearing a wide array of ideas and becoming more knowledgeable, but the internet is likely to push you in the opposite direction, even if it’s hard to see that it’s happening.</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>Separate Realities</strong></p> <p>When most of us hear about growing political polarization, we assume it means citizens are divided in their values.

I came into it crystal clear on what people on the Left generally think, how they think, and why. So the first order of business was a deep dive into what people on the Right—especially Trump voters—were saying, and why. I dug into conservative news sites, conservative blogs, conservative YouTube channels, conservative Reddit forums.</p> \n                       <p>And a funny thing happened. The internet noticed, and it went for the full indoctrination.</p> \n                       <p>Suddenly, it didn’t matter what I was watching on YouTube—it could be <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Fend1-nnNKk?t=7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a group of slippery Japanese people trying to climb stairs</a>—and I’d glance at my sidebar and see this:</p> \n                       <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?attachment_id=8823\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8823\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9-trump-sidebar.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"699\" height=\"1879\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9-trump-sidebar.png 1773w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9-trump-sidebar-223x600.png 223w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9-trump-sidebar-768x2064.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9-trump-sidebar-279x750.png 279w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px\" /></a></p> \n                       <p>It wasn’t just YouTube. The algorithms were serving me the pro-Trump Bento Box. Reddit and Quora started sending me emails with links to pro-Trump threads. Twitter started recommending conservative accounts for me to follow. And it went beyond pro-Trump material. As far as the internet was concerned, these were now the Clintons:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-21-8757\" id=\"note2-21-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">21</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hillary-witch.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8824\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/hillary-witch.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"552\" height=\"414\" /></a></p> <p>It didn’t change my views on Trump very much—but it <em>did </em>change my thoughts about his voters. Before, I had been fed a steady diet of “Trump is a huge bigot, Trump voters know he’s a huge bigot, and they voted for him because they’re huge bigots too.” But now the internet thought I was a Trump voter, and suddenly almost nothing I was seeing about Trump made him seem like a bigot. In the new depictions, he still seemed like a bit of a blowhard, but one that was unafraid to stand up to a corrupt, elite establishment and that was determined to help a losing America start winning again. The anti-Trump crowd I knew were making the mistake of looking at the version of Trump they were seeing and assuming his voters were voting for that guy. But his voters didn’t know that Trump. They knew the version of Trump <em>they </em>were seeing, and <em>that’s </em>the guy they were voting for.</p> <p>Of course, some of the most damning things that came out about Trump during the campaign were seen by everybody. Everyone in every information bubble heard Trump grab people by the pussy, criticize McCain for being captured in Vietnam, mock a disabled reporter, and stereotype illegal Mexican immigrants as rapists. But in their information bubble, they were seeing moments like these once or twice, not 20,000 times—and when compared to their bubble’s depiction of Wicked Hillary of the West, the evil treasonous criminal who threatened Bill’s sex victims and called the working class “deplorable,” I see how Trump might appear the lesser villain.</p> <p>I came out of the whole thing feeling like I understood the Trump phenomenon a little better, and the Left’s chorus of “Trump voters are all white supremacists!” began to seem over-confident, under-informed, and not very productive.</p> <p>If you’re thinking about politics without regularly asking yourself, “What does this look/feel like to the people I don’t know?”, you’re going to get a lot of things wrong. Which ultimately makes you less politically effective.</p> </p>\n                      </div> <p>Losing our grip on reality is an unnerving idea in general. But there’s one particular kind of delusion that keeps me up at night.</p> <p>Recently, I noticed <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/25/us/gofundme-scam-refunds-trnd/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this headline</a> on CNN.com:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/127.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8825\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/127.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"502\" height=\"102\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/127.png 2052w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/127-600x122.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/127-768x156.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/127-750x153.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" /></a></p> <p>I wanted to not click on that, but the computer and I both knew that I had no choice. So here’s what happened: a homeless man came across a woman after she had run out of gas on the side of the interstate, with no money. The homeless man told her to wait safely in her car while he walked over to a nearby gas station and, spending his last $20, bought gas and brought it back to her. The woman then went home and started a GoFundMe campaign to “pay it forward” and raise money for the homeless man.</p> <p>When we read a feel-good story like this, it poofs away the fog in our heads for a moment because it reminds us how many good people there are out there and how much generosity and kind-heartedness there is in the world. It makes our Primitive Minds feel safe, which calms them down, and it empowers our Higher Mind. <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/107/12/5334\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">High-mindedness is contagious</a>,<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-10-8757\" id=\"note-10-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> and the high-mindedness of the homeless man in the story traveled through the internet and infected 14,000 people, who donated a combined $400,000 to the homeless man. It was a beautiful moment.</p> <p>Until the woman, the woman’s boyfriend, and the homeless man got caught. The homeless man (Bobbitt) really was homeless, but the whole story had been made up by the three of them as a get-rich-quick scheme. The article explains: “Bobbitt received $75,000, and within months McClure and D’Amico had ‘squandered’ their share to buy a car, high-end handbags and trips…they also used it at casinos.”</p> <p>Quite the crew.</p> <p>At the very end of the article, there was a quote from GoFundMe’s spokesman:</p> <p><em>It’s important to understand that misuse is very rare on our platform. Campaigns with misuse make up less than one tenth of one percent of all campaigns.</em></p> <p>In other words, this is reality:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.1-gofundme-new-V2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8860\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.1-gofundme-new-V2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"413\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.1-gofundme-new-V2.png 1013w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.1-gofundme-new-V2-600x446.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.1-gofundme-new-V2-768x571.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.1-gofundme-new-V2-750x558.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" /></a></p> <p>And if we knew more about the thousands of genuinely heartwarming GoFundMe stories that happen every year, it would strengthen our trust and love networks and boost kind-heartedness and generosity. Those kinds of stories are like positive viruses that, when spread, strengthen society.</p> <p>But in the reality show editing room at CNN.com, they see this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.2-gofundme-new-V2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8861\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.2-gofundme-new-V2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"562\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.2-gofundme-new-V2.png 958w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.2-gofundme-new-V2-600x472.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.2-gofundme-new-V2-768x604.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.2-gofundme-new-V2-750x590.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></a></p> <p>Of all the people that saw the article’s headline, only a tiny fraction will end up reading the quote from GoFundMe at the bottom of the article. Everyone else just sees the headline, and lots of other similar headlines over the years, and they develop the intuition that things like GoFundMe are pretty “scammy”:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.3-gofundme-new-V2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8859\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.3-gofundme-new-V2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"502\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.3-gofundme-new-V2.png 696w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.3-gofundme-new-V2-555x600.png 555w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10.3-gofundme-new-V2-693x750.png 693w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" /></a></p> <p>Trust is a society’s most precious resource, and a strong trust network does amazing things, like donating $400,000 to a homeless man. But trust takes decades to build up and is easily shattered. In the case of a scam like this, 14,000 people reached out lovingly to another member of society, and their hands were zapped by an electroshocker. Their trust was shaken and replaced by cynicism.</p> <p>On its own, this scam wouldn’t do much harm to society. Unless, of course, the news plasters the scam all over their front pages. When that happens, 14,000 people have their outreached hands painfully shocked—and 10,000,000 more people watch it happen.</p> <p>A scam is like a virus that converts trust into cynicism, but it’s the news, in the name of keeping things entertaining and addictive, that distributes the virus across the whole country.</p> <p>We can call this phenomenon—where the news cherry-picks stories that weaken society and spreads them—“destructive cherry-picking.”</p> <p>Destructive cherry-picking breeds fear, anger, and cynicism. It’s why we always think crime is getting worse even though it’s almost always getting better.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote2-22-8757\" id=\"note2-22-8757\" rel=\"footnote2\">22</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/crime.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8829\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/crime.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1170\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/crime.jpg 1170w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/crime-585x600.jpg 585w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/crime-768x788.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/crime-731x750.jpg 731w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\" /></a></p> <p>But to me, the most damaging form of destructive cherry-picking is the kind that spreads <em>hate</em>.</p> <p>Nicky Case made a killer simulation about this phenomenon too. It’s fun and quick—<a href=\"https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">give it a try</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>Portraying a society where everyone is a GoFundMe scammer damages trust. Portraying a society where crime is rampant spreads fear.</p> <p>But portraying a society where everyone hates each other is the most dangerous virus of all, because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <p>Geographic bubbles mean many people barely know anyone on the other political side personally, so the only information they have on what those people are like comes from information bubbles. And those bubbles have increasingly become hate-mongering machines. The right-wing information bubble floods viewers with anecdotes that make it seem like everyone on the Left positively despises them and everything they stand for. What a Republican from a small town hears from the Left is: “you’re stupid, you’re ignorant, you’re a bigot, you’re privileged, your values are wrong, your religion is bad, you’re toxic, you’re backward, you’re selfish, you’re a Nazi.” Through the left-wing information bubble, all a Mexican-American living in Los Angeles hears from the Right is: “you’re a criminal, you’re a rapist, you’re not a real American, you’re stealing our jobs, you’re inferior, you don’t belong here, and we’re coming for you.” Outrage about these messages then spreads like wildfire on social media, because as CGP Grey explains in a fun/upsetting video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nothing spreads faster than anger</a>—especially anger in the specific format, “Just <em>look </em>at how <em>awful</em> the people we hate are.”<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8757#footnote-11-8757\" id=\"note-11-8757\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> <p>Vocal Primitive Minds activate other Primitive Minds. Filtering a steady stream of “they <em>hate </em>you” to people jolts awake the recipients’ Primitive Minds, filling them with reciprocal hatred, clouding their humanity, and flipping on that ancient tribal switch that makes people want to band together into giants for safety. The resulting anger is, in turn, filtered back over to the other side.</p> <p>This most troubling thing about this kind of vicious cycle is that it fosters what may be the most dangerous word in the English language.</p> <p style=\"font-size:32px\"><strong>Disgust</strong></p> <p>Like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear, disgust is a <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201601/what-are-basic-emotions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">basic emotion</a>, hardwired into all humans. Travel to any country in the world and basic emotions will be expressed similarly. That’s why smiles, for example, never require translation.</p> <p>Basic emotions are the way they are because they were helpful for survival in the ancient human world. A Google Images search for “disgust” shows a bunch of people, all making the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=disgust&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNQv-u7-iqmXdhkg1aadAcX7i6jJOg:1577494344003&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFl4mwkNfmAhXuYN8KHaOQD-kQ_AUoAXoECBMQAw&amp;biw=1837&amp;bih=1111\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same hideous face</a>—squinting their eyes, curling up their noses, and exhaling (and if it gets really bad, exhaling turns to gagging and eventually vomiting). <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07784-047\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scientists believe</a> this is evolution’s way of getting us to close up our incoming passages and expel outward whatever we can, in order to protect ourselves when we’re in the presence of toxins or disease. We react this way when confronted with rotten food, blood, shit, maggots, and anything else our primitive software believes is potentially dangerous and disease-carrying. We’re so prone to feel disgust that you probably feel a bit of disgust right now just having read the last sentence.</p> <p>The strange thing is that disgust can carry over to how we view <em>people</em>.

What’s happening is that your Primitive Mind is bad at distinguishing movies from reality and the movie actually makes it feel like it’s in danger.</p> <p>The behavioral immune system is the same idea. Once your Primitive Mind is triggered by the feeling of disgust, even just via images, it becomes <em>very </em>suspicious that life-threatening disease is afoot and wants to react accordingly. It gets all hyped up, your mind fills with smoke, and you start obeying your ancient software, even when it makes absolutely no sense. So you do the equivalent of double locking all your doors after watching a horror movie—you become super icked out by people and behavior that deviate from “your people” or their norms.</p> <p>The reason I called disgust one of the scariest words in the English language is that it’s a trigger for dehumanization, and dehumanization is the gateway drug to the worst things humans do. It’s not a coincidence that two of the most horrifying events in recent human history—the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide—were made possible by disgust. Nazi propaganda constantly compared Jews to disgust-inducing animals like <a href=\"https://ianpace.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/das-kleine-blatt-1939.jpg?w=590\">rats</a>, <a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/der-stuermer.org/pictures/dersturmer1.jpg\">swine</a>, and <a href=\"https://alphahistory.com/nazigermany/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/spider.jpg\">insects</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNbUeLnxQEI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rwandan radio broadcasts</a> that incited the 1994 genocide referred to Tutsis as “cockroaches” repeatedly. These are just two examples of a well-worn tradition. During World War I, the Germans depicted the British as <a href=\"https://i.redd.it/1dx43bsnh5n31.jpg\">spiders</a>, while the U.S. did the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kaiser-spider.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same thing</a> with the Kaiser.

As such, disgust guards the human–animal boundary in social cognition, playing the dual role of distancing ourselves from “lower” creatures and reaffirming our own humanity. When applied to intergroup contexts, disgust inserts a psychological boundary between us and them that humanizes us at the expense of the other. … there is evidence that feelings of disgust may weaken or block perceptions of target humanity. In two social-neuroscience investigations, Harris and Fiske (2006, 2007) found that members of certain disgust-eliciting outgroups fail to be processed as fully human, social entities.</em></p> <p>Disgust fills our mind with a special kind of primitive fog—one that turns ordinary humans into psychopaths who can commit unthinkable harm without remorse. Scary shit.</p> <p>The geographic and information bubbles are a lethal combo, ripe for disgust.</p> <p>Writer Gene Knudsen Hoffman says, “An enemy is one whose story we have not heard.” It’s hard to feel dehumanizing disgust for people you know personally. Less hard when you rarely see your enemies in person. And even less hard when destructive cherry-picking teaches you only the worst of the worst about them.</p> <p>There’s a term we need to start using: <strong>political bigotry.</strong></p> <p>Political bigotry is as real as any other bigotry. In a <a href=\"http://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2014/iyengar-ajps-group-polarization.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2014 paper</a> on political polarization in the U.S., Shanto Iyengar and Sean J. Westwood write:</p> <p><em>Hostile feelings for the opposing party are ingrained or automatic in voters’ minds, and that affective polarization based on party is just as strong as polarization based on race. We further show that party cues exert powerful effects on non-political judgments and behaviors. Partisans discriminate against opposing partisans, and do so to a degree that exceeds discrimination based on race.</em></p> <p>Their findings are corroborated by <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christine_Reyna/publication/256050159_The_Ideological-Conflict_Hypothesis/links/59ee1f51a6fdcc32187dac6d/The-Ideological-Conflict-Hypothesis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another 2014 paper</a>, which produced this graph, suggesting that political intolerance beats other kinds of intolerance on both the left and right.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/intolerance-V2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8862\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/intolerance-V2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"716\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/intolerance-V2.png 1364w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/intolerance-V2-600x453.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/intolerance-V2-768x580.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/intolerance-V2-750x566.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px\" /></a></p> <p>As political Echo Chambers have gotten larger and more extreme, political opponents have gone from seeming like wrong, stupid people to seeming like evil, disgusting monsters. Feeling disgust towards a large group of people is textbook bigotry. If you heard about a country populated by two major races or ethnicities or religions, and they talked about each other the way today’s Americans talk about the opposing political tribe, you’d be very, very concerned about that country.</p> <p>But for most of us, our instinct tells us that political bigotry is not as terrible as other kinds of bigotry. Maybe because it seems like it’s disgust about ideas more than disgust about people. Or maybe because, at least in the U.S., racial and other kinds of bigotry have historically been more prominent and the cause of more strife. But the <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christine_Reyna/publication/256050159_The_Ideological-Conflict_Hypothesis/links/59ee1f51a6fdcc32187dac6d/The-Ideological-Conflict-Hypothesis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">paper</a> goes on to talk about evidence that partisanship in the U.S. has increasingly become a “<em>primal” </em>kind of bond, much like ethnicity or race, making political bigotry a lot more like other types of bigotry.</p> <p>Bigotry is at its most harmful in moments when much of society fails to recognize it as bigotry. The best tools to combat bigotry are social norms that penalize its expression, but those norms only kick in when the bigoted attitudes and behavior become widely viewed as reprehensible. In the U.S. today, political bigotry is a rare form of bigotry that is rarely ever penalized by taboo—and it’s often rewarded. Iyengar and Westwood’s research corroborates this notion:</p> <p><em>The most plausible explanation for the stronger affective response generated by partisan cues is the non-applicability of egalitarian norms. These norms, which are supported by large majorities, discourage the manifestation of behavior that may be construed as discriminatory. In contemporary America, the strength of these norms has made virtually any discussion of racial differences a taboo subject to the point that citizens suppress their true feelings. No such constraints apply to evaluations of partisan groups. While Americans are inclined to “hedge” expressions of overt animosity toward racial minorities, immigrants, gays, or other marginalized groups, they enthusiastically voice hostility for the out-party and its supporters.</em></p> <p>When society is behaving badly, politicians will too. Iyengar and Westwood also studied how rising levels of disgust amongst voters is then mimicked by politicians:</p> <p><em>Hostility for the out party among rank and file partisans sends a clear signal to elected officials; representatives who appear willing to work across party lines run the risk of being perceived as “appeasers.” For the vast majority who represent uncompetitive districts, there are strong incentives to “bash” the opposition.</em></p> <p>If they’re right, we should be seeing lots of political disgust expressed by politicians right now. Let’s see if their research holds up.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11.1-disgusting-trump-3-column@0.5x.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8832 size-full\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11.1-disgusting-trump-3-column@0.5x.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1798\" height=\"2588\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11.1-disgusting-trump-3-column@0.5x.png 1798w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11.1-disgusting-trump-3-column@0.5x-417x600.png 417w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11.1-disgusting-trump-3-column@0.5x-768x1105.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11.1-disgusting-trump-3-column@0.5x-521x750.png 521w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1798px) 100vw, 1798px\" /></a></p> <p>Well then.

The U.S. giant has fallen ill, and this visual is one of the symptoms.</p> <p>We started this post looking at two well-documented trends in the U.S.: increasing polarization amongst citizens and within government. Then we looked at two major environmental changes that seem to be playing a large role in stoking and perpetuating those trends: geographic bubbles, generated by increased mobility, and information bubbles, generated by the shift from broadcast to narrowcast news and internet algorithms. These bubbles have Americans connected in all the wrong ways—no longer personally connected with people who disagree with them politically, and more connected than ever before in an online ecosystem that over-simplifies the world, encourages intellectual conformity, and spreads mistrust and hatred of the outgroup.</p> <p>Here are four reasons this scares me:</p> <p><strong>1) We’re losing our ability to gain knowledge. </strong>If our perceptions of reality are increasingly informed by media with other-than-truth motivations, we’ll increasingly lose our handle on the truth. This is like the big U.S. giant becoming schizophrenic.</p> <p><strong>2) We’re losing our ability to think together. </strong>Human giants can only think when people talk and when they’re free to say what they really think. As Echo Chambers grow larger and more intimidating, people inside them are afraid to defy the sacred narrative. And the more all-encompassing political identities become, the more topics turn from kickable machines to <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/10/idea-labs-echo-chambers.html#echo-chambers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">precious infants</a>. Meanwhile, intergroup communication suffers even more, as opposing groups become totally unable to collaborate on ideas. As the downward trend deepens, the voices of <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/12/political-disney-world.html#high-rung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">high-minded Progressivism and Conservativism</a>—the team that navigates the U.S. up the mountain—are growing more timid and harder to hear. The U.S. giant is losing its ability to learn.</p> <p><strong>3) We’re losing our ability to cooperate. </strong>A polarized country that isn’t capable of building broad coalitions can’t take forward steps—it can only self-inflict.</p> <p><strong>4) We’re doing that thing that people do before really, really awful things happen. </strong>Disgust should scare you as much as it scares me. If our species were a person, it would have a mix of beautiful and unadmirable qualities—but its darkest quality would be the ability to dehumanize.</p> <p>When I back up and look at all of these things at the same time—when I mentally zoom out as far as I can and try to see the downward macro trend all at once—it looks like one thing to me:</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/fire-light.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Power Games</a>.</p> <p>Humans in a constitutional democracy aren’t quite at home. Part of us—our Higher Minds—are right in their natural habitat, like bullied nerds who finally graduated high school and moved to a place where they can be themselves. But our Primitive Minds are wild animals caged up in a zoo. The cage is made up of the constitution and laws, but even more so, it’s made of widely accepted, socially enforced liberal norms.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/enlightenment-kids.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Value Games</a> is a remarkable human structure and when it’s working well, it can not only cage the worst instincts of the Primitive Mind but harness them into tremendous productivity. But the Value Games aren’t really our natural way, and they’re fragile. The Power Games are always pulling on us like gravity, and whenever there’s a crack in the Value Games structure, we’re at risk of falling. The Primitive Mind may be in a cage, but it never stops pushing against the bars, searching for one it can bend, trying to break out.</p> <p>The geographic and information bubbles are relatively new. The internet especially is evolving and changing literally by the month. The U.S. was built to be incredibly robust, but such insanely rapid environmental change is pushing it to its limits.</p> <p>When I look at the downward trend, I see a resurgence of the Power Games. We’re starting to do a lot of those things humans do when they’re at their worst. We’re tossing our principles aside and glomming onto big, mindless giants who aren’t sentient enough to know that that kind of structure doesn’t make sense anymore. As the country slides its way down the mountain, we’re behaving more and more like the output of a non-living, force-of-nature software program that only wants genes to be immortal.</p> <p>This is what I mean when I say the U.S. giant has fallen ill. In the chaos of rapid environmental changes, the giant’s immune system—the thing that keeps the Power Games in check—has become weakened, and the Power Games is spreading through its body like an epidemic.</p> <p>I don’t really know what’s chicken or egg here. Maybe the two bubbles caused the political polarization. Maybe the geographic bubble is enhanced by the polarization. Maybe it’s all Newt’s fault. Or maybe Newt’s tactics only worked because the giant was already sick. Maybe Trump is an inevitable symptom of the sickness, or maybe he’s an unusually harmful exacerbator of it. Ditto for social justice bullies. Maybe all of this is business as usual and I’m over-catastrophizing what’s just another trough in an overall upward-moving roller coaster. Or maybe it would be business as usual if not for the internet, which makes this a dangerous anomaly. No one seems to know for sure. But we <em>can</em> figure out how to get ourselves onto a better trajectory.</p> <p>After the last chapter, I was accused by some readers of practicing “bothsidesism,” a suggestion that I was depicting both U.S. parties as equal and equally at fault for the state of the nation, as a kind of cop-out.</p> <p>I get it. False equivalencies are infuriating. Imagine you’re eight and you’re in an argument with your sibling. It escalates and he shoves you. You shove him back. Then he slaps you incredibly hard across the face. Then your parent says, “Both of you, stop it!” You protest that what he just did was <em>much </em>worse than anything you did, to which your parent says, “I don’t care about the details—you’re both grounded.” It would be maddeningly unfair.</p> <p>People do this kind of thing all the time with societal conflicts, whether between political parties or racial groups or any other kind of faction. The people who do it often have good intentions—they want to seem fair and they think spreading out the blame equally is the best way to diffuse things. Other times, it happens when defenders of the group who did the “face slap” want to brush over the real story. Whatever the reason, drawing a false equivalency about unequal wrongdoing is as unfair as blaming only one side when there’s equal wrongdoing.</p> <p>The problem with posting what’s clearly a book one chapter at a time is that you can’t get the entirety of your point across until the last chapter is posted. Now that another chapter has come out, I hope it’s a little clearer that “I don’t care about the details—you’re both grounded” isn’t quite my angle here. I see it more like two siblings who have caught rabies. In this particular household, the siblings always have rabies to some extent (the low-rung element of both parties), but recently, their rabies have been flaring up. More rabies makes them want to bite each other more, and the way this strain of rabies works, every time a sibling gets bitten, it causes their own rabies to ramp up a bit, making them more likely to bite the other—and it becomes a vicious cycle. Diagnosing which sibling has rabies worse right now or whose rabies flared up first, while also a worthwhile endeavor, isn’t the right focus of this series. Writing a series focused on scolding a single faction of society and riling up anger toward that side is not only unlikely to help the U.S. giant get better, it’s the exact type of thing that&nbsp;<em>exacerbates&nbsp;</em>the illness—it would just be adding another&nbsp;<em>bite</em> to the rabies war.</p> <p>What seems more pressing to me is the bigger fact that our family has an increasingly dire rabies problem—one that, in the current world of technological explosion, may have existentially scary consequences if it doesn’t get fixed quickly.</p> <p>My obsession over the past three years has been trying to figure out how our national immune system works, where it draws its strength from, and how we can get it working again. I spent so long on this because I believe a resurgence of the Power Games is <em>the </em>limiting factor of every other societal struggle I might write a post about. Every other concern I have—AI safety, climate change, war, poverty, disease, injustice, unstable institutions—hinges on that larger concern. If the U.S., and other countries in a similar predicament, can figure out how to get their immune systems back to full strength in this rapidly changing world, allowing us to think together and work together, we’ll make forward progress in <em>all</em> of those areas. If our nations continue to get sicker and fall further downward into the Power Games, each and every one of those concerns will suffer. Everybody will lose.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> <p>As bleak as this may seem, one thing makes me hopeful.</p> <p><em>Pew’s </em>findings that polarization has sharply increased were well-publicized after the release of its report.

complex views on contested issues than our polarizing public debates would suggest.” <a href=\"https://hiddentribes.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to the report</a>, the Exhausted Majority holds a wide variety of attitudes and viewpoints, but its members share four main attributes:</p> \n                              <ul> \n                               <li><em>They are&nbsp;</em><strong><em>fed up</em></strong><em>&nbsp;with the polarization plaguing American government and society</em></li> \n                               <li><em>They are often&nbsp;</em><strong><em>forgotten</em></strong><em>&nbsp;in the public discourse, overlooked because their voices are seldom heard</em></li> \n                               <li><em>They

like…high-rung political thinking?</p> <p>If the report is to be believed, the common perception that citizens are becoming more polarized, more ideological, and more tribal about politics is an illusion.</p> <p>But where does this illusion come from? Typically, majority groups in a society are, if anything, too powerful, leaving minority groups marginalized. So why would politics work the opposite way?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pew offers</a> one possibility: “The rise of ideological uniformity has been much more pronounced among those who are the most politically active.” Those with the most extreme, black-and-white views are also those most vocal about politics, most active in dictating the national dialogue, and most likely to vote:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/conclusion-5.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8842\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/conclusion-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"727\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/conclusion-5.png 1336w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/conclusion-5-600x355.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/conclusion-5-768x454.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/conclusion-5-750x443.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px\" /></a></p> <p>That’s definitely part of the explanation, but it’s also nothing new. Hardcore partisans have always been highly politically active. Something else is going on here.</p> <p>When the Value Games are working properly, people holding the most extreme views are relegated to the fringes—retaining enough of a voice to effect change when they’re right about something but unable to do too much damage when, more often, they’re wrong. But in the Power Games, it’s often the case that small groups of more extreme people end up with outsized power over others.</p> <p>Maybe instead of focusing on how politically active the most extreme people are, we should be asking ourselves why those who hold “more complex views” have become so <em>inactive</em>.</p> <p>In the series intro, I wrote:</p> <p><em>When I told people I was planning to write a post about society, and the way people are acting, and the way the media is acting, and the way the government is acting, and the way everyone else is acting, people kept saying the same thing to me.</em></p> <p><em>Don’t do it. Don’t touch it. Write about something else. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Anything</span> else. It’s just not worth it. …</em></p> <p><em>It hit me that what I really needed to write about was <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">that</span>—about why it’s perilous to write about society.</em></p> <p><em>I ended up going with some combination of both of these things: society’s current situation and why it’s an especially bad idea for me to write about it—and how those two things are related.</em></p> <p>This chapter focused on the first item: society’s current situation. But the second item—about how incredibly ill-advised it currently is to write about that situation—is the item we need to look hardest at.</p> <p>That’s where we’ll go in the penultimate chapter of The Story of Us.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> <p>If you like Wait But Why, sign up for the&nbsp;<strong><a class=\"ClickPico PicoRule\">email list</a></strong>&nbsp;and we’ll send you new posts right when they come out.

At the end of the chapter, I reminded us that the entire discussion was only looking at a 2D cross section of what’s actually a 3D space of human thinking and behavior.</p> \n<p>The good news is the third dimension is something we already became familiar with early on in the series: Emergence Tower.

You don’t really need a third dimension to think about the behavior of ants or polar bears, because they exist almost entirely at a single point along Emergence Tower. Ants never function as self-important individuals—they’re always cells in a colony who live entirely for the well-being of the colony. Polar bears are almost<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8229#footnote-1-8229\" id=\"note-1-8229\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> always solitary selfish individuals, rarely sacrificing themselves for the well-being of neighboring polar bears.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1.3.2-emergence-animal-comparison.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8241\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1.3.2-emergence-animal-comparison.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1.3.2-emergence-animal-comparison.png 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1.3.2-emergence-animal-comparison-600x253.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1.3.2-emergence-animal-comparison-768x324.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1.3.2-emergence-animal-comparison-750x316.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /></a></p> \n<p>But humans are more complicated. Like ants, humans often function as cells in a larger tribe giant—but unlike ants, humans are <em>also </em>complex enough to function as true individual entities the way polar bears do.

Each nation is a smaller cloud with its own sub-culture. Americans who believe they have nothing at all in common with certain other Americans are taking for granted the rich set of specific norms, customs, and values they actually share.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8229#footnote-2-8229\" id=\"note-2-8229\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> <p>Inside of the broadest cultures are thousands of smaller communities—each with their own cultural vibe that exerts influence on its members. Someone working in a tech startup in the Bay Area is simultaneously living inside of the broad human community, the global Western community, the American community, the U.S. West Coast community, the San Francisco community, the tech industry community, the startup community, the community of their workplace, the community of their college alumni, the community of their extended family, the community of their group of friends, a few other bizarre SF-y situations, and a dozen other communities their particular life happens to be part of (including, if they’re a regular visitor here, the Wait But Why community). Most immediate to each of us are the micro-cultures of our immediate family, closest friends, and romantic relationships. Going against the current of all the larger communities combined tends to be easier than violating the unwritten rules of the most intimate mini cultures in someone’s life.</p> <p>A culture’s rules, norms, and value systems pertain to a wide spectrum of human experience. A group of friends, for example, has a way they do birthdays, a way they do emojis, a way they do talking behind each other’s backs, a way they do bragging and self-deprecation, a way they do conflict, and so on. They even have a way they do cultural adherence for each area—one group of friends might find it delightful when a certain friend regularly appalls them with their uncharacteristic-for-the-culture bluntness while in another, the same violation might be grounds for dismissal from the community. Some cultures apply pressure to live a certain kind of lifestyle or abide by a particular structure—a culture that shames being single at 30 incentivizes people to be on the lookout for a life partner in their mid-20s, while another one might not apply that pressure at all, driving different behavior.</p> <p>Living simultaneously in multiple cultures is part of what makes being a human tricky. Do we keep our individual inner values to ourselves and just do our best to match our external behavior to whatever culture we’re currently in a room with? Or do we stay loyal to one particular culture and live by those rules everywhere, even at our social or professional peril? Or do we just go for full authenticity and let our inner values drive our behavior, unaltered, for better or worse? Do we navigate our lives so to seek out external cultures that match our own values and minimize friction? Or do we surround ourselves with a range of conflicting cultures to put some pressure on our inner minds to learn and grow? Whether you consciously realize it or not, you’re making these decisions all the time.</p> <p>And these decisions matter—because the cultures we spend time in have a major influence over us.</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>Cultural Incentives</strong></p> <p>Remember Moochie from <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/stories.html#johnsons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 1</a>?</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.2-Moochie.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-7544\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.2-Moochie.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.2-Moochie.png 415w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.2-Moochie-300x204.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.2-Moochie-345x234.png 345w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/21.2-Moochie-103x70.png 103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" /></a></p> <p>The Johnsons drove Moochie’s behavior in a certain direction by adding Snausage rewards and electrocution penalties into his environment.

On the group level, the two minds jostle for control over the group’s <em>culture.</em> When people are around other people, their Primitive and Higher Minds band together with others of their kind in a group-wide power struggle. And like a human’s personality, a group’s culture has a general Psych Spectrum equilibrium it tends to default to.</p> <p>The psych equilibrium of a culture exerts a vertical <em>pull </em>on the individuals within it—filling each culture with a kind of electrical current.</p> <p>In higher-minded culture, the pervading values are Higher-Mind driven, making it a <em>positively charged </em>culture that exerts an upward pull on the psyches of their members. The behavior rewarded or zapped by the culture align more with the Higher Mind’s values, and interactions carry a generally high-minded tone, which empowers the Higher Minds of the people within the culture.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/17-HM-grid-alicia.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8254\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/17-HM-grid-alicia.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"574\" height=\"487\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/17-HM-grid-alicia.png 1258w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/17-HM-grid-alicia-600x509.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/17-HM-grid-alicia-768x652.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/17-HM-grid-alicia-750x637.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" /></a></p> <p>In a negatively charged culture, the Primitive Mind is on its home turf.

But in groups, where this kind of “coalition” can form, one mind gaining control over the culture is like an extreme home-field advantage in sports. Control over the electrical charge of the air and power over the painful zaps and pleasurable rays that police cultural dissidents is such a leg up that, for the “away team,” it can be very hard to overcome.</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>Culture, in 3D</strong></p> <p>So far, we’ve been focusing on the relationship between culture and individuals.

There are all kinds of intellectual cultures out there, but we can slot them into two broad categories:</p> <p>Idea Labs and Echo Chambers.</p> <p>We all know what an Echo Chamber is. An Idea Lab will be our term for the opposite. Let’s discuss:<a id=\"idea-labs\"></a></p> <p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Idea Labs</strong></p> <p>When the Higher Mind is in control of a single human’s intellect, the human becomes a high-rung thinker. When a <em>group</em> of Higher Minds band together to take over a group of people’s intellectual culture, they form what we can call an Idea Lab. An Idea Lab is an intellectual culture where high-rung thinking thrives and where it can be done well communally. Idea Lab culture abides by the Higher Mind’s intellectual goals, values, preferences, and tastes, and it sees thinking, ideas, discussion, debate, questions, answers, information, and knowledge through the Higher Mind’s lens. Any size community can be an Idea Lab if the intellectual culture in that community is Idea-Lab-like.</p> <p>We’re going to take a look at both cultures from two emergence perspectives:</p> <p><strong>1) The individual level</strong>—how the culture affects the individuals within it</p> <p><strong>2) The group level—</strong>how the culture affects the group itself, as a larger-emergence giant</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>How Idea Labs affect individuals</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11.5-loaf-IL-INTRO-1-sm.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8372 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11.5-loaf-IL-INTRO-1-sm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11.5-loaf-IL-INTRO-1-sm.png 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11.5-loaf-IL-INTRO-1-sm-600x570.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11.5-loaf-IL-INTRO-1-sm-768x730.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11.5-loaf-IL-INTRO-1-sm-750x713.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a></p> <p>To a person, a community is kind of like a mini nation, and as a mini nation, an Idea Lab is a lot like a liberal democracy. Both are rooted in values: a typical liberal democracy is premised on Enlightenment values like freedom and equal opportunity; an Idea Lab centers around the Enlightenment values of truth and free expression. A liberal democracy is governed by rules about the <em>way </em>things are done, not the end result—and this binding process is outlined in a constitution. An Idea Lab has a binding process too: the scientific method.</p> <p>Unlike communities of actual career scientists, most real-world communities don’t exist solely to find truth, so it’s not exactly the literal scientific method happening as much as it’s an intellectual culture that’s scientific-method-<em>esque</em>, generally abiding by the same principles.</p> <p>This makes an Idea Lab’s cultural point system pretty straightforward—the cool kids do stuff that serves truth, and those who do otherwise are lame. A few examples:</p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Idea Labs like independent thought.</span></strong> In an Idea Lab, people are more interested in what you have to say if they think your thoughts come from a self-determined place, and they’ll begin to tune you out if they suspect you tend to just repeat what you heard from another source. This is partially because independent thinkers usually respect other independent thinkers and find low-rung dogmatics to be transparent and boring. But it’s also for practical reasons. An independent thinker, regardless of their viewpoints, is an active brain in the room, contributing something original to the system. A dogmatic who simply regurgitates the same viewpoints, without independent critical thought, contributes little.</p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Idea Labs like intellectual diversity.</span></strong> An Idea Lab is a place of intellectual <em>pluralism</em>. It’s a miniature marketplace of ideas where multiple, varied viewpoints coexist. High-rung thinkers know that intellectual diversity is the key quality that fills a community with the rich collection of idea puzzle pieces needed to find truth. On topics where everyone seems to agree, people in an Idea Lab will have an instinct to prod that consensus with contrarian ideas and to play devil’s advocate. Thoughtful contrarianism is valued because there’s an implicit understanding that the evolution of knowledge works like the evolution of life. Only through mutations does evolution happen. In the natural world, a mutant is a biological weirdo. In an Idea Lab, bold, quirky, contrarian thinkers—intellectual weirdos—are seen as critical innovators in the lab who provide mutant ideas to the community.</p> <p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Idea Labs respect thinkers who stay close to the humility sweet spot tightrope.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-2x2-tightrope.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8259\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-2x2-tightrope.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"436\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-2x2-tightrope.png 862w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-2x2-tightrope-590x600.png 590w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-2x2-tightrope-768x781.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13-2x2-tightrope-737x750.png 737w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" /></a></p> <p>In an Idea Lab, conviction is used sparingly and with caution—because conviction levels in an Idea Lab are used as “degree of certainty” stamps. The more conviction in your voice when you make a claim, the more you’re saying: “You can <em>trust </em>me that this is truth. I’ve already done the hard work to vet this information, and it’s safe to incorporate it into your beliefs without much testing.” For trusted thinkers in an Idea Lab, conviction offers fellow members a beautiful knowledge-acquisition shortcut and saves them the effort and opportunity cost of re-vetting what has already been tested.</p> <p>I’ve always been a fan of this cartoon that explains what volts, amps, and ohms are.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8229#footnote2-1-8229\" id=\"note2-1-8229\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.1-ohms-comic.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8260\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.1-ohms-comic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.1-ohms-comic.png 495w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.1-ohms-comic-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" /></a></p> <p>In communities, info flows in a similar way.

And ohms are skepticism.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.2-ohms-comic-new-labels.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8262\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.2-ohms-comic-new-labels.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"453\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.2-ohms-comic-new-labels.png 900w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.2-ohms-comic-new-labels-150x150.png 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.2-ohms-comic-new-labels-594x600.png 594w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.2-ohms-comic-new-labels-768x776.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/14.2-ohms-comic-new-labels-743x750.png 743w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" /></a></p> <p>In an Idea Lab, this system is geared around letting truth in and keeping bullshit out. In a good trust network, the Skepticism character (i.e. the Belief Bouncer) is able to trust the Conviction character, which can spare everyone a bunch of work. When a proven high-rung thinker expresses info with a lot of conviction <em>umph</em>, the listener will lower the skepticism ohms without thinking too hard about it.</p> <p>On the other hand, unearned, false conviction is a major no-no in an Idea Lab. Conviction from a trusted source opens a clear path directly into someone’s most sacred intellectual space: their beliefs. And when conviction is used carelessly, it infects those beliefs with misconceptions, slant, and inaccuracies—the Idea Lab’s toxins—like feeding someone food that will make them sick. Super uncool kid thing to do—and the Idea Lab will punish you by lowering your Rung Rating and damaging your reputation, boy-who-cried-wolf style. Getting caught abusing the use of conviction means you lose the ability to believably communicate your degree of certainty when you say something—because people will know you have a spotty history. Now, when you up the volts and express conviction, listeners will take it with a grain of salt, keep the skepticism filter tight, and feel the need to further verify it.</p> <p>For all the same reasons, humility wins you major respect in an Idea Lab—where “I don’t know” is a very cool thing to say. People in an Idea Lab are high-rung thinkers, so they know that knowledge is hard. They know the world is a foggy, incredibly complex place, and they’re well aware that no single human knows that much about it. So humility is seen as evidence of honesty and self-awareness—evidence that you “get it.” A reputation for humility makes you intellectually powerful in an Idea Lab—because when a typically humble person does express conviction, it carries a ton of meaning and everyone’s ears perk up.</p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Idea Labs love arguments.</span></strong> Truth is a sacred value in an Idea Lab, and ideas themselves are seen as nothing more than puzzle pieces to be used in its service. Idea Labs treat all beliefs as works-in-progress, and they see an argument as not only fun, competitive, and intellectually stimulating, but also as a useful exercise for everyone involved, because they know you can only get to knowledge by rigorously testing hypotheses. That’s why Idea Labs are cultures of disconfirmation, debate, and argument. These values mean an Idea Lab doubles as a miniature <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/american-brain.html#mpi-gauntlet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketplace-of-ideas gauntlet</a>, a place where no idea is safe. In an Idea Lab, ideas are meant to be criticized, not respected; kicked, not coddled. But the aggression never falls on the <em>thinker</em>—arguments are often heated, but they don’t get personal. As a necessary condition of truth finding, <em>people </em>in an Idea Lab are safe to express any viewpoint they want.</p> <p>Spending time as a citizen of an Idea Lab mini nation—whether it happens at dinners with your spouse, in classroom discussions, in book club get-togethers, in text conversations, on long scrolls down Reddit threads, or anywhere else—makes you smarter. It shows you where the holes in your knowledge are; it grants you access to a network of intellectual trust that floods you with new, accurate information; it introduces you to a variety of perspectives; it teaches you how to effectively judge others’ ideas and claims. It’s a constant intellectual workout that keeps you sharp.</p> <p>But even more importantly, an Idea Lab helps you fight the good fight in your own head. I don’t care how good a thinker you are, your intellect will always be in an uphill Psych Spectrum battle against gravity. Even if you get good at thinking with your Higher Mind, your Primitive Mind never gives up and is always looking for a loophole—some personal insecurity, some emotional attachment, some lingering psychological baggage from your past—to latch onto as an opportunity to re-hijack the wheel.</p> <p>No one thinks like pure top-rung Scientists all the time. More often, after a brief stint on the top rung during an especially lucid and humble period, we start to <em>like </em>the new epiphanies we gleaned up there a little too much and we quickly drop down to the Sports Fan rung. And that’s okay. It might even be optimal to be a <em>little </em>over-confident in our intellectual lives. Taking a rooting interest in our ideas—a new philosophy, a new lifestyle choice, a new business strategy—allows us to really give them a try, somewhat liberated from the constant “but are we really sure about this?” nag from the Higher Mind.</p> <p>The Sports Fan rung alone isn’t a problem—especially since, like cheering fans in a stadium who know deep down that their fandom is a little silly, somewhere behind the fog of a Sports Fan’s confidence is the self-awareness of a still-pretty-present Higher Mind. The problem is that inviting some fog into the equation is a bit like closing your eyes <em>for just another minute or two </em>after you’ve shut your alarm off for good—it’s riskier than it feels. Getting a little attached to or emotional about an idea is a small step away from drifting unconsciously into <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html#unfalsifiableland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unfalsifiable Land</a> and into the oblivion of the intellectual slums down below. We’re programmed by evolution to be terrible thinkers, so we should never get cocky.</p> <p>Alcoholics Anonymous is a Higher Mind support network, where a bunch of people suffering from a disease—one in which the animal they live in has become fixated on using alcohol to ruin their lives—can get together and help each other fight the good fight. An Idea Lab is the same thing for our intellect—Dogmatics Anonymous.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15-ropes-v3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8354 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15-ropes-v3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"752\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15-ropes-v3.png 1622w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15-ropes-v3-600x564.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15-ropes-v3-768x722.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/15-ropes-v3-750x705.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> <p>People in Dogmatics Anonymous keep each other from falling too low down the Thinking Ladder.</p> <p>The social pressure helps: if it’s considered cool to think with your Higher Mind, you’re more likely to do so.</p> <p>And the intellectual pressure helps: If the people around you are good enough at thinking to notice when you’re being biased, hypocritical, conveniently gullible, or selectively unempathetic—and if they’re culturally encouraged to call you on it—you’re less likely to keep doing those things or fall into a well of false conviction. In an Idea Lab, the room is usually too well-lit for the Primitive Mind to get away with anything too sneaky.</p> <p>When you spend enough time in an Idea Lab, humility and self-awareness are <em>inflicted </em>upon you, whether you like it or not.

If the mind of a single high-rung thinker is a truth-seeking tool, the mind of an Idea Lab giant is truth-seeking <em>factory.</em></p> <p>Instead of a single Attention Bouncer, bound by the limits of his time and the scope of his curiosity, the Idea Lab organism has a <em>team</em> of Attention Bouncers importing information.</p> <p>Instead of a single Belief Bouncer trying his hardest to judge the accuracy of info, the Idea Lab giant has a squadron of Belief Bouncers at the door of the community’s generally accepted beliefs. In order to make it past the gate, a hypothesis or piece of information has to make it past <em>each </em>of the bouncers. Even if a convincing falsehood succeeds in duping most of the community, all it takes is one person’s Belief Bouncer discovering it to be flawed and they’ll quickly expose it as fraud to everyone else. The beliefs of high-rung thinkers are readily falsifiable—so this is a fast process that leaves the bad information with little hope.</p> <p>Instead of a single Puzzler working on building hypotheses out of scattered information, the constant hum of discussion in an Idea Lab makes puzzling collaborative. With everyone mostly saying what they’re really thinking, the line between puzzling together a hypothesis and testing that hypothesis in a gauntlet of criticism blurs. When dialectic and debate are core parts of an intellectual culture, new ideas can be tested as they’re being formed, in real-time, making the step-by-step knowledge-building process of the individual high-rung thinker into a single, dynamic process.</p> <p>As a giant organism, an Idea Lab is an example of emergence at its finest: a system that is far more than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>The Idea Lab giant is an organism that takes in raw information and converts it into knowledge and wisdom. Its immune system specializes in sorting truth from fiction and rooting out falsehoods and bias—the toxins that threaten the knowledge manufacturing process.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/19.2-IL-level-2-giant-FLOW-v4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8355 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/19.2-IL-level-2-giant-FLOW-v4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/19.2-IL-level-2-giant-FLOW-v4.png 1461w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/19.2-IL-level-2-giant-FLOW-v4-600x490.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/19.2-IL-level-2-giant-FLOW-v4-768x627.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/19.2-IL-level-2-giant-FLOW-v4-750x612.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p> <p>One of the coolest properties of an Idea Lab is its ability to play nicely with other Idea Labs and seamlessly meld together with them into larger Idea Labs. Take the simplest example: two couples.</p> <p>To continue exploiting the Johnsons from Part 1, let’s imagine that in their marriage, they have formed a strong, high-rung intellectual culture together. When they’re together, they form a tiny Idea Lab—a two-mind system that’s always working on a lifelong, collaborative mission to become a little less wrong and a little less foolish. They disagree about ideas all the time, but their intellectual arguments rarely double as <em>fights</em>. They get heated alongside smiles and jokes and light-hearted jabs at each other. Like any humans, they’re both prone to sink downwards on the ladder, but they keep each other honest, and they both have a history of changing their mind when the other makes a point so good they can’t deny the truth of it—an intellectual “offer they can’t refuse.”</p> <p>Now, let’s also imagine that they have their next-door neighbors, the Smiths, over for dinner one night.</p> \n   <div id=\"#eggEight\">\n    <div id=\"image-map-pro-1545\"></div>\n   </div> <p>The Smiths are also an Idea Lab couple. So very quickly, the dinner becomes a rich discourse, full of original ideas and critical thinking, as the four of them seamlessly merge their two-person Idea Labs into a four-person Idea Lab. The dinner table becomes a four-person marketplace of ideas, with double the knowledge, double the intellectual diversity, and double the keen-eyed Bouncers and Puzzlers at their service. The hangout goes on for hours after the food is done, and everyone leaves feeling a little bit smarter than they were before. The two couples, sharing high-rung intellectual values, both end up feeling positive about the experience, as the large amount of critical thinking that happened made the dinner super interesting and fun.</p> <p>The thing going on here is that Idea Labs are <strong>micro-divided,</strong> and <strong>macro-united. </strong>On a micro scale, Idea Labs and the people within them disagree often—that’s the intellectual diversity component.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.1-micro.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8271\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.1-micro.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"663\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.1-micro.png 1986w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.1-micro-600x460.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.1-micro-768x589.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.1-micro-750x575.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px\" /></a></p> <p>On a macro scale, all Idea Labs are broadly united by a common set of intellectual values—a shared understanding that they’re all ultimately on the same truth-seeking team.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.2-micro-macro-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8331 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.2-micro-macro-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"658\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.2-micro-macro-v2.png 2193w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.2-micro-macro-v2-600x454.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.2-micro-macro-v2-768x582.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/23.2-micro-macro-v2-750x568.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /></a></p> <p>This allows Idea Labs of all sizes to combine together just as easily as the Johnsons and Smiths did. Two can become four around a dinner table. A six-college-friends Idea Lab can become part of a larger one 50 students strong when those friends walk into one of <a href=\"https://bridgeusa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bridge USA</a>’s many university clubs dedicated to ideological diversity. High-rung science departments can “team up” with other departments by criticizing each other’s findings.</p> <p>Even farther up Emergence Tower, every Idea Lab in the U.S. is a tiny piece of the grand American Idea Lab—the U.S. marketplace of ideas—each of them a little pocket of neural tissue in the giant U.S. brain.

An Idea Lab is a good mini nation to be citizen of. Spending time in an Idea Lab makes you smarter, wiser, humbler, more realistic, and helps pull your internal battle <em>upwards.</em></p> <p><strong>Idea Labs are great at the community level.</strong> The same people encouraged to retain their full individuality at the low-emergence level also get to enjoy the benefits of being a cell in a larger, superintelligent system, with all of the social and community perks that come along with it.</p> <p><strong>Idea Labs are great at the national and pan-national level.</strong> We have Idea Labs to thank for the collective knowledge tower we’ve built as a species, for the evolution of our species’ psychological maturation, and for the development of our growing philosophical clarity.</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, Idea Labs bring to fruition a fundamental right:</p> <p style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>The Free Speech Puzzle</strong></p> <p>Given how naturally Idea Lab culture fits into the broader spirit of the U.S. constitution, you might assume that at least Idea Labs would be the norm in a place like the U.S.—but they’re not. The U.S. was a country built to give the underdog Higher Mind a chance, but it wasn’t built to <em>enforce</em> the Higher Mind’s ideals on any citizen. Doing so would violate the core premise of the country: freedom from authoritarian rule. The Constitution puts its citizens in an environment where neither the government, nor other citizens, are allowed to impinge on any citizen’s right to live in a high-minded environment. But like the case with power, wealth, and the pursuit of happiness—the Constitution offers only the <em>opportunity </em>to enjoy the ideals of the Enlightenment, not a guarantee of that kind of life. In the U.S., you’re so free that you’re <em>free to be unfree</em>, if you so choose.</p> <p>We can apply this to the world of discourse. The reality is that while all Americans are living under the protection of the First Amendment, many aren’t living with freedom of speech. Constitutional lawyer Greg Lukianoff highlights this distinction:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8229#footnote2-3-8229\" id=\"note2-3-8229\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a> <p><em>Though often used interchangeably, the concept of freedom of speech and the First Amendment are not the same thing. While the First Amendment protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press as they relate to duties of the state and state power, freedom of speech is a far broader idea that includes additional cultural values. These values incorporate healthy intellectual habits, such as giving the other side a fair hearing, reserving judgment, tolerating opinions that offend or anger us, believing that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, and recognizing that even people whose points of view we find repugnant might be (at least partially) right. At the heart of these values is epistemic humility – a fancy way of saying that we must always keep in mind that we could be wrong or, at least, that we can always learn something from listening to the other side.</em></p> <p>Free speech, like any Value Games privilege, requires both the government <em>and</em> the culture to be on board. The U.S. Constitution makes free speech possible—but only within the right <em>culture</em> does the freedom come to fruition.</p> <p>Let’s apply this idea to t-shirts. The Constitution gives all citizens the right to walk around wearing t-shirts in public. As far as we’re concerned, there might as well be a T-Shirt Amendment that protects this right for all citizens (the right to bare arms?). But if I live in a community in which one of the unwritten cultural beliefs is that wearing t-shirts is evil—and anyone who does so will likely be permanently shunned—I’m not gonna walk around in a t-shirt. Sure, the T-Shirt Amendment means that I can’t be imprisoned by the government for wearing a t-shirt—but my entire <em>social</em> life would be destroyed by doing so, which is just a different kind of incredibly harsh penalty. Being deeply invested in a community allows the culture of that community to essentially override my constitutional rights. The actual enjoyment of a constitutional right relies on finding a community who <em>agrees with the Constitution</em> about it.</p> <p>Likewise, in cultures that impose their own harsh penalties for saying the wrong thing, freedom of speech all but vanishes, along with the presence of the marketplace of ideas. This is why Idea Labs are so important. Idea Labs are fully bought in to the value of free speech—they see it as a constitutional gift and make it a way of life. Idea Lab culture is the critical second piece that completes the free speech puzzle.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/27-free-speech-puzzle.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8276\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/27-free-speech-puzzle.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"336\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/27-free-speech-puzzle.png 900w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/27-free-speech-puzzle-581x600.png 581w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/27-free-speech-puzzle-768x793.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/27-free-speech-puzzle-727x750.png 727w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" /></a></p> <p>If the Idea Lab were the only intellectual culture out there, things in the human world might be simple. But Idea Labs aren’t the only human intellectual culture, because the Higher Mind isn’t the only human mind. Liberal concepts like free speech are thoroughly artificial constructions, and no matter where they exist, they’ll always be the underdog, constantly fighting against the gravity of human nature.</p> <p>Some people do manage to spend most of our time in the little pockets of Higher-Mind-run cultures that have managed to subsist inside of the broader primitive ocean. But many of us aren’t so lucky. The typical human today, around the world, and inside the U.S., is spending their life inside communities that are culturally charged the old-fashioned way.<a id=\"echo-chambers\"></a></p> <p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Echo Chambers</strong></p> <p>Imagine you’ve just had your first baby.

We all know a few.</p> <p>And I’ve noticed a funny pattern—when I talk to the parents of an Upsetting-Looking Baby, they somehow don’t seem to realize what happened.</p> <p>The reason is the Primitive Mind is pulling one of its tricks. When you have a baby, your Primitive Mind knows that, cute or upsetting, baby survival is the key to its genetic mission, and it’s critical that you as the parent are fully obsessed with it.</p> <p>So let’s just say it turns out that your baby looks like this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/7.2-upsetting-baby-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8357\"

sacred object. And everyone who visits the house knows that—so they go with the flow and confirm the parents’ delusion, fully and unquestionably.</p> <p>When a culture holds an object to be sacred, the culture becomes embedded with an implicit set of iron-clad social rules about how that object must be treated. Praising the object becomes a very cool thing to do, while saying anything bad about the object is considered an act of unredeemable blasphemy. When something becomes uncriticizable to a culture, the culture becomes the opposite of an Idea Lab about that thing. It becomes an Echo Chamber.</p> <p>It doesn’t mean the culture is necessarily an Echo Chamber <em>in general</em>—it may be a classic Idea Lab most of the time and simply flip to the other side when the conversation turns to one particular topic.&nbsp;If you’re a sports fan (actual, not metaphorical), you’re well-accustomed to this kind of situation.</p> <p><a

populated entirely by lifelong Packers fans is an immediate Echo Chamber when it comes to Packers fandom. They may happily argue about everything else, including Packer-related topics (e.g. “Are they good enough to make the playoffs this year or not?”), but on the specific topic of “who are you rooting for in this game?”, any answer other than “the Packers” is blasphemy. Packers fandom is the sacred baby in the house, and everyone damn well better call it cute.</p> <p>So why do some objects or ideas become sacred to certain humans and certain cultures?</p> <p>As we’ve discussed in previous chapters, it often has a lot to do with identity. Every human is an impossibly complex, fluid, ever-evolving unique personality—and to the Higher Mind, that’s more than enough of an identity. But the Primitive Mind doesn’t understand human complexity or uniqueness, so it sees your innermost self as a blank page. A non-identity. For the Primitive Mind to feel secure about your identity, it needs you to attach external things to it—symbols, resources, profession, family name, status, religion, ethnicity, political affiliation, nationality, hometown, college alma mater, social group, music tastes—anything really, as long as it’s crisp and clear and tangible enough for its simple programming to grasp.</p> <p>The Primitive Mind is always hungry to meld you into larger giants, so its favorite kinds of external things to stitch to your identity are those that also stitch <em>you </em>into a group. When an object can help it define both who you are and which tribe you’re in, it latches onto it.</p> <p>Sports fandom is a classic Primitive Mind identity attachment because it checks a lot of these boxes. It’s crisp and clear. It’s linked together with other identity attachments like hometown and, in the case of something like the World Cup, nationality and even ethnic group. It binds you together with everyone else who likes the same team. There are even uniforms you can wear, painting the good-guy Us colors directly on your body, as you root for them against the bad-guy Them team with their bad-guy Them fans from their bad-guy Them hometown wearing their bad-guy Them colors.</p> <p>If we didn’t understand the Primitive Mind, we might think it’s a bit odd that a group of out-of-shape people sitting in a living room in sweatpants will scream “We won!” when a bunch of professional athletes they don’t know won a game they had no part in. But to the Primitive Mind, the athletes and the game are just vehicles to do the important thing—bind you together with other people. The Primitive Mind is so well-programmed to bind together with others that using only something as superficial as sports fandom, you can seamlessly become one with a total stranger you know nothing about—like <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/29-hug.png\">the time</a> at a Red Sox playoff game when I cuddled with a big, scary, mean man I never spoke to before or since.</p> <p>Which brings me back to our Packer fan family. When the son changed his rooting interest, all he said was, “actually I’m rooting for the Vikings.” But the Primitive Minds of his family members heard a <em>cascade</em> of betrayal, up and down Emergence Tower.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/30-packers-tower-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8724\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/30-packers-tower-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1471\" height=\"1422\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/30-packers-tower-1.png 1471w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/30-packers-tower-1-600x580.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/30-packers-tower-1-768x742.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/30-packers-tower-1-750x725.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1471px) 100vw, 1471px\" /></a></p> <p>He violated a sacred object—but really, he violated the core sense of unity and safety the Primitive Minds of his family members feel. That’s why a football team became a sacred object in the first place.</p> <p>But the reason sports fandom isn’t a bad thing is that it (usually) doesn’t harm anybody—it’s a form of fake, role-play tribalism. Jonathan Haidt gets at this when he provides the analogy: “Sports is to war as pornography is to sex.”<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8229#footnote2-4-8229\" id=\"note2-4-8229\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a> Sports fandom lets humans exercise primitive tribal drives—which you can plainly see every time triumphant fans instinctively throw <a href=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/2724/4406125299_f794cf603a_z.jpg\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">their</span></a> <a href=\"https://images.axios.com/DE0OYnJGMZEV-5wgEDVOqAUz_cU=/0x580:5568x3712/1920x1080/2019/07/08/1562546788548.jpg\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">arms</span></a> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/02/454071140_1.jpg\">up</a></span> like a conquering tribe of apes, or heartbroken fans cover their <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/usc-fans.jpg\">heads</a></span> <a href=\"https://i.imgflip.com/tkgiy.jpg\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and</span></a> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article6775531.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Shocked-Chelsea-fans-in-despair.jpg\">faces</a></span> like apes being attacked.

For example:</p> <p><strong>Where Idea Labs are cultures of critical thinking and debate, Echo Chambers are cultures of agreement and confirmation.</strong></p> <p>There are a few reasons for this:</p> <p>First, it comes from a core distinction between how the two cultures view ideas. Idea Labs see people and their ideas as separate entities—people are meant to be respected, ideas are not. In Echo Chambers, a person’s ideas are part of their identity, so respecting a person and respecting their ideas are one and the same. While people in an Idea lab argue with each other for fun, disagreeing with someone in a culture of agreement is seen as <em>rudeness</em>, and a heated argument about ideas in an Echo Chamber is indistinguishable from a fight. To put a visual to it, Idea Lab culture views agreement and decency as separate, unrelated axes, while Echo Chamber culture views agreement and decency as a single axis:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8710 size-full\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1650\" height=\"1159\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2.png 1650w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2-600x421.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2-768x539.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2-750x527.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px\" /></a></p> <p>Second, Echo Chambers are devoted to <em>specific </em>ideas. While the constitution of the Idea Lab mini nation is devoted to a <em>kind</em> of thinking, an Echo Chamber is an idea temple whose constitution is a set of sacred beliefs themselves.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/32-A-_-B.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8304\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/32-A-_-B.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"756\" height=\"219\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/32-A-_-B.png 1506w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/32-A-_-B-600x174.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/32-A-_-B-768x222.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/32-A-_-B-750x217.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px\" /></a></p> <p>The Idea Lab’s quest for knowledge and truth becomes the Echo Chamber’s quest for <em>confirmation</em> of the community’s sacred story.</p> <p>Changing the goal from truth-seeking to belief-confirmation flips a bunch of other values to their opposites.</p> <p>The intellectual diversity of the Idea Lab’s pluralism is a major threat to an Echo Chamber, which replaces it by the intellectual uniformity of purism. For the same reasons, Echo Chambers don’t like intellectual mutants—inconvenient independent thought is frowned upon in an Echo Chamber, where abiding by collective groupthink tends to go over much better.</p> <p>In assigning Rung Ratings, Echo Chambers are concerned only with <em>what </em>you think, not how you got there, basing judgments not on accuracy but on <em>loyalty </em>to the sacred ideas.</p> <p>The cultural incentives follow suit. The orange, downward-charged air of an Echo Chamber, like the blue-green, upward-charged air of an Idea Lab, administers rewards of acceptance, approval, and respect, and electroshocks of criticism, ridicule, shame, and ostracism—but the criteria for the incentives is almost the exact opposite.</p> <p>In an Echo Chamber culture, which sees knowledge as easy and obvious, conviction is seen as a sign of knowledge, intelligence, and righteousness (assuming, of course, you have the right viewpoints), and it’s socially rewarded with respect and deference. Humility, on the other hand, is looked down upon in an Echo Chamber, where saying “I don’t know” just makes you sound stupid and ignorant. Changing your mind too much in an Echo Chamber gets you zapped with negative labels, like <em>wishy-washy </em>and <em>flip-flopping</em> and <em>waffling</em>.</p> <p>An Echo Chamber’s sacred ideas are the community’s newborn baby. And the best way to both express your allegiance to the community and prove your own intellectual and moral worth is to call the baby cute, as fervently as you can.

While conviction in an Idea Lab expresses your degree of certainty about what you’re saying, conviction in an Echo Chamber expresses the degree of your Us-ness. The baby isn’t kind of cute. It’s not maybe cute. It’s deeply fucking cute. Period.</p> <p>When a group of people is together expressing their Us-ness at the same time, it not only makes each individual feel safe and loved and accepted and included, it provides a binding energy that unites the group. Participating in one of these sessions—as we all have—showers you with cultural reward, and it feels great in the same way eating Skittles feels great. It’s a classic form of primitive bliss.</p> <p>Positive incentives go a long way to unifying the Echo Chamber’s viewpoints—but in a community fused together by shared belief, they’re not enough. So they’re coupled with their partner in crime: <strong>taboo</strong>.</p> <p>Taboos exist in an Idea Lab, but you have to say something pretty extreme to violate one—and almost always, the offense is an attack on a person, not their idea: a mean-spirited racial slur, a degrading jab, a nasty low-blow. The only way for an otherwise-respected thinker to get culturally zapped by the sole expression of an idea itself is to express a viewpoint so inane that it totally lowers people’s opinion of their intellectual ability.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/33-inane-opinion.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8306 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/33-inane-opinion.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"528\" height=\"111\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/33-inane-opinion.png 1443w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/33-inane-opinion-600x126.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/33-inane-opinion-768x162.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/33-inane-opinion-750x158.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" /></a></p> <p>The over-application of taboo is the bane of free speech, so pro-free-speech cultures use it sparingly.

In your criticisms of the <em>opposing</em> viewpoints and those who hold them, you’re free in an Echo Chamber to be as personal and as vicious as you please—cutting slurs, degrading jabs, and nasty low-blows included. Not only is this kind of expression not considered taboo, it’s a sign of moral and intellectual awesomeness. But disagree with the sacred beliefs and you’ve committed blasphemy in place of worship—and you’ll be promptly electrocuted.</p> <p>The Idea Lab’s criticism gauntlet, a safe place for people and a dangerous one for ideas, provides a type of resistance that elevates truth and wisdom and pushes the whole entity, along with each of its members, toward intellectual and moral growth. An Echo Chamber’s taboo minefield makes it a safe and protected space for all ideas that confirm the sacred beliefs and a very dangerous space for ideas—and people—that don’t. This type of resistance has the opposite effect, discouraging new ideas and intellectual innovation and repressing the growth of the community and its members.</p> <p>Of course, both of these make sense, given the cultural objectives. High-rung thinkers want their perception of reality to change and get closer to reality, so they invite the productive kind of resistance. Low-rung thinkers want their perception of reality to remain untouched. They view safety not as safety <em>to</em> <em>speak </em>certain ideas but as safety <em>from hearing </em>certain ideas—making an Idea Lab a place of danger for them. So they invite the repressive kind of resistance.</p> <p>Liberal democracies were built to be bubbles of free speech in a world of censorship—bubbles where Higher Minds could band together and form high-minded giants, safe from the bullying of the Primitive Mind.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.2-orange-green.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8308\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.2-orange-green.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"483\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.2-orange-green.png 1796w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.2-orange-green-600x499.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.2-orange-green-768x638.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.2-orange-green-750x623.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" /></a></p> <p>Idea Labs are communities born of this spirit, taking full advantage of the privilege afforded to them by the liberal constitutions. But the Primitive Minds in our heads don’t understand any of this. They run on automated software, unable to see the present day or understand its liberal values. No matter what country they’re in, they want to do what they were programmed to do: play the ancient Power Games by banding together into the old-fashioned kind of giant.</p> <p>And the thing about Primitive Minds is, as simple and unthinking as they may be, they can also be highly innovative. It’s like what Jeff Goldblum said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.1-life-finds-a-way.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8309\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.1-life-finds-a-way.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"260\" /></a></p> <p>You can put as many constraints on Primitive Minds as you want to, but some of them will usually find a way to get together and play the Power Games. In a country like the U.S., the Echo Chamber is one way they do it. The Echo Chamber is a mini dictatorship—a cultural dictatorship—of Power Games inside of a liberal democracy. A non-free-speech zone inside of a free speech nation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.3-orange-green-orange-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8311\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.3-orange-green-orange-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.3-orange-green-orange-1.png 1796w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.3-orange-green-orange-1-600x499.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.3-orange-green-orange-1-768x638.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/26.3-orange-green-orange-1-750x623.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p> <p>This kind of mini dictatorship has the opposite effect on its citizens that an Idea Lab has. If an Idea Lab is Dogmatics Anonymous, an Echo Chamber is a dogma keg party.</p> <p>Some reasons why the dogma keg party sucks:</p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">An Echo Chamber makes you more primitive.</span></strong> Spending time in an environment full of primitive smoke gives the Primitive Mind home-field advantage in the battle inside your head. In an Echo Chamber, people are constantly releasing the human version of wolfpack pheromones—the words they use, the virtue signaling, the in-group / out-group social structure, the binary worldview. This isn’t simply the Primitive Mind’s way of thinking, it’s like gas in the air that ignites our primitive fires. Tribal language is the Primitive Mind’s way of signaling to each other: “Let’s fucking do this. Let’s band together and go to war.” Your Higher Mind is already in a serious uphill battle for sanity—but trying to tame your Primitive Mind in that kind of environment is like trying to get a shark to refrain from eating while surrounding it with the scent of blood.</p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">An Echo Chamber makes you arrogant.</span></strong> On top of the general downward pull on your psyche, an Echo Chamber pulls directly downwards on your intellect. When everyone around you believes humility is for the weak-minded and conviction is a sign of intelligence and righteousness, it’s going to have an effect on you. Even in an Idea Lab culture where humility is the ultimate intellectual virtue, we have a very hard time actually being humble. So when you take away that cultural pressure and apply the reverse pressure, <em>shaming</em>&nbsp;humility—good fucking luck.</p> <p>At the same time, the strength of your beliefs goes up. In an Idea Lab you’re always being reminded that opposing ideas have validity, that all ideas are flawed, that you and everyone else is prone to bias, and that the world is ridiculously complex. This is like an air jet that blows the fog of delusion out of the environment. In an Echo Chamber, all of those reminders have been filtered out by the system, allowing the fog to grow thick. Members of an Echo Chamber tend to share both an oversimplified conception of the world and an inflated view of their own intellect. When everyone around you shares your delusions, the communal fog strengthens delusion, which allows conviction to rise to laughable levels.</p> <p>Instead of pulling you toward the Knowledge-Conviction diagonal, the Echo Chamber pulls you upwards into the arrogant zone.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35-2x2-EC-magnet.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8312\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35-2x2-EC-magnet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"476\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35-2x2-EC-magnet.png 862w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35-2x2-EC-magnet-600x571.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35-2x2-EC-magnet-768x731.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35-2x2-EC-magnet-750x714.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> <p>This is why people who spend too much time in an Echo Chamber end up as an intellectual contradiction—holding views that are strongly felt but weakly supported.</p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">An Echo Chamber makes you intellectually helpless.</span></strong> Those who want to become better thinkers will have a hard time in an Echo Chamber, where the constant barrage of confirmation of a single viewpoint, along with the prohibition of dissent and open debate on the sacred topics, removes all the most critical tools of knowledge-acquisition from the environment. It’s an environment where A) people think knowledge is easy, B) accuracy isn’t taken into account for ideas that confirm the dogma, C) honest new hypotheses are rarely being formed, and D) the testing of existing assumptions or new incoming confirmation, through dissent and criticism, is culturally discouraged. A + B + C + D = an environment of imposed ignorance. How could anyone learn real stuff in that environment? They couldn’t.</p> <p>And when you’ve been ignorant for too long, you don’t just lack knowledge, your learning skills dull. Learning is a skill like anything else—it takes practice—and your ability to think critically atrophies. People who surround themselves by Idea Lab cultures get constant practice at defending their ideas and challenging others. In the Echo Chamber’s safe-from-dissent-space, you remain an amateur, which makes the prospect of trying to migrate from your environment to a more argumentative one incredibly daunting.</p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">An Echo Chamber makes you more of a dick.</span></strong> When the Primitive Mind gets control of your heart, it’ll happily toggle your ability to feel empathy up and down to suit its purposes—and resisting this is all the more difficult in an environment totally isolated from the maligned group, where myths and stereotypes about them permeate every conversation, and where it’s believed that hating the right people is precisely what makes someone a good person. When you come to believe that people outside the Echo Chamber are not worth talking to, it’s easy to forget that they’re full, real people just like you.</p> <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">An Echo Chamber bullies you into submission.</span></strong> Those who manage to remain self-aware enough to try to improve will be met with the social aspect of the Echo Chamber’s cultural rubric. If you try to step outside the standard groupthink viewpoints, the Echo Chamber will dock your social status, and your likability, and your credibility. Your friends will talk behind your back. Your family will discuss how you’ve changed. Your co-workers will exclude you from happy hour drinks. Your fellow dogmatics have built their identities, their sense of stability, and their self-esteem around the Echo Chamber’s set of delusions—and trying to improve will be subconsciously perceived by others as a personal threat. But since self-awareness is scarce in Echo Chambers, they’ll consciously just think you’re an asshole.</p> <p>All of this adds up to an Echo Chamber culture being a big, fat magnet at the bottom of the How You Think ladder.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/36-laddder-w-magnet-EC-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8314\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/36-laddder-w-magnet-EC-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"671\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/36-laddder-w-magnet-EC-1.png 2068w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/36-laddder-w-magnet-EC-1-600x473.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/36-laddder-w-magnet-EC-1-768x605.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/36-laddder-w-magnet-EC-1-750x591.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px\" /></a></p> <p>While the pull of an Idea Lab makes you smarter, wiser, and more humble, the Echo Chamber magnet makes you ignorant, arrogant, delusional, unempathetic, and inept.

Revisiting the above Echo Chamber qualities from the giant organism perspective helps us see them in a new light.</p> <p>To survive, a giant needs to be glued together well, and the Echo Chamber is glued together by a shared set of beliefs. While an Idea Lab draws its strength from its intellectual diversity, the Echo Chamber thrives on intellectual uniformity:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/37-brains-EC-3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8325\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/37-brains-EC-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/37-brains-EC-3.png 848w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/37-brains-EC-3-452x600.png 452w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/37-brains-EC-3-768x1019.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/37-brains-EC-3-565x750.png 565w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px\" /></a></p> <p>The multi-colored brain network in an Idea Lab is a marketplace of ideas that functions as a super-brain—a giant, superintelligent thinking machine. But the Echo Chamber’s network isn’t a giant brain at all. It’s a solid-colored <em>agreement network—</em>a bloc of hijacked brains, tightly glued together by shared beliefs in order to generate brute strength in numbers.</p> <p>For a giant glued together by shared beliefs, confirmation of those beliefs are like the giant’s food—the giant relies on a steady incoming stream of confirmation for sustenance and strength. So Echo Chambers are factories that specialize in confirmation manufacture.</p> <p>The Echo Chamber’s collective Attention Bouncers scour the world for bright red information cherries that support the giant’s core beliefs—anything that helps promote the “We are so right / knowledgeable / smart / virtuous and They are so wrong / ignorant / stupid / evil” manifesto. The standards for confirmation cherries aren’t high—it can be random anecdotes or statistics, strongly worded opinions, out-of-context quotes, whatever. It’s not important whether the confirmation is true or something that would pass for confirmation outside the Echo Chamber—most people in an Echo Chamber already believe, and all they need from confirmation is a nice continual flow to keep morale high and the belief glue at full strength.</p> <p>Social pressure in an Echo Chamber plays its role, lining up with the main mission. Expressing confirmation is socially rewarded in an Echo Chamber, so the giant’s circulatory system—the communication network—ends up flooded with the very ripest confirmation cherries. When new, juicy nuggets of dogma-supporting info are discovered, they spread through the system like wildfire. The confirmation factory is also great at twisting the less bright cherries to make them better—through a game of telephone, one person’s somewhat-relevant anecdote can quickly morph into a confirmed, undeniable fact about the world that members treat as further scientific proof that the sacred baby is obese and adorable. This is its own kind of market that pushes the best supporting arguments—real or manufactured—straight into the beliefs of the Echo Chamber’s members, since the Belief Bouncers of low-rung thinkers usually give an immediate free pass to friendly, confirming information.</p> <p>If the Idea Lab giant is the ultimate Scientist, the Echo Chamber is the ultimate Zealot. And like any zealot, an Echo Chamber relies not just on belief but on full <em>conviction. </em>An Echo Chamber’s conviction isn’t just a trademark quality of the Echo Chamber giant—it’s the giant’s lifeblood.</p> <p>But strength that relies on conviction is brittle, and vulnerable. In many cases, the conviction of many Echo Chamber members is entirely sourced in their trust in other members’ conviction, many of whose conviction is derived from the conviction of others still. It’s like a conviction Ponzi Scheme. In reality, the Echo Chamber’s dogma baby isn’t usually very cute at all, and the fervent belief that it is relies on the complete absence of questioning or real discussion about it. For a giant that relies on conviction to survive, doubt is deadly.</p> <p>In an Idea Lab, people know that the information stream entering the system will be full of toxins—deceptions, slant, falsehoods, bullshit surveys and studies, cherry-picked research, misleading statistics, etc.—and there needs to be a strong immune system to keep their body of knowledge healthy. Their immune system is the idea gauntlet with its culture of dissent and disconfirmation. Information and suppositions that manage to make it through the gauntlet are very likely to be non-toxic—and the continual re-examination of the Idea Lab’s accepted assumptions help to root out toxins that somehow slipped by.</p> <p>An Echo Chamber works the opposite way. The Idea Lab’s toxin—bias and misconception—is the Echo Chamber’s immune system. The Idea Lab’s immune system—doubt and dissent—is precisely the Echo Chamber’s toxin. Each immune system is made of that which the other immune system is built to guard against.</p> <p>For an Echo Chamber giant, doubt that threatens to infiltrate the system from the outside, where it can catch on and spread, is like a deadly virus. So the Echo Chamber’s immune system is a multi-layered filter system that leaves little to chance. To successfully generate doubt in an Echo Chamber’s neurons, dissent has to first make it past the cherry-picking filter. Then it has to survive the filter that specializes in misinterpreting, distorting, and re-framing inconvenient info (or, if all that fails, discrediting the source). Dissent that makes it this far has to figure out a way to spread through a social network that punishes members for sharing it. Finally, when the occasional devastating stat or damning news story or well-reasoned dissenting op-ed does manage to reach the minds of Echo Chamber members, there’s a last line of defense—denial. Most Echo Chamber members are low-rung thinkers, which means they’re unfalsifiable—they enforce Echo Chamber rules inside their own heads, and their cognitive biases provide the final blockade.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/38-EC-level-2-giant-FLOW-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8358 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/38-EC-level-2-giant-FLOW-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/38-EC-level-2-giant-FLOW-v2.png 1304w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/38-EC-level-2-giant-FLOW-v2-150x150.png 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/38-EC-level-2-giant-FLOW-v2-595x600.png 595w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/38-EC-level-2-giant-FLOW-v2-768x775.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/38-EC-level-2-giant-FLOW-v2-743x750.png 743w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" /></a></p> <p>But even with an airtight immune system in place to thwart invasion by doubt viruses, the Echo Chamber is vulnerable to an internal threat. H. L. Menken said, “The most dangerous man to any government is a man who is able to think things out for himself, and without regard for the prevailing superstitions and taboos.” Same story for Echo Chambers. In addition to the large number of Attorneys and Zealots who believe every part of the dogma, there are some people in every Echo Chamber who don’t actually believe the dogma—just like there are some people who visit new parents who are well aware that the baby isn’t actually cute. These are the most dangerous people to an Echo Chamber, because as trusted members of the Us group, dissent from their mouths can circumvent the immune system and trigger dangerous cognitive dissonance in fellow members. If dissent from the outside threatens to become a doubt virus in the body of the Echo Chamber giant, dissent from the <em>inside</em> threatens to become a doubt <em>cancer</em>. This is why Echo Chambers go beyond making it uncool to express unpopular ideas and make it <em>taboo</em>. Cancer must be nipped at the bud.</p> <p>This is the kind of intense information control you see when reality is not your friend—when ideological purity is a survival requirement.</p> <p>When we look at how giants interact with other giants, we see a final distinction between Idea Labs and Echo Chambers.&nbsp;As we discussed earlier, Idea Labs merge seamlessly together with other Idea Labs, because while micro-divided in their viewpoints, they’re macro-united by common values like civility and truth. Echo Chambers, as expected, are the reverse—micro-united in their viewpoints, macro-divided with other communities who don’t share those viewpoints.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/39-micro-macro-EC.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8334\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/39-micro-macro-EC.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"661\" height=\"638\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/39-micro-macro-EC.png 1721w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/39-micro-macro-EC-600x579.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/39-micro-macro-EC-768x741.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/39-micro-macro-EC-750x724.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px\" /></a></p> <p>Since Echo Chambers are built on agreement, they can only merge with other communities who are like-minded.</p> <p>Take the Millers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40-millers.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8336\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40-millers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40-millers.png 824w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40-millers-600x556.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40-millers-768x711.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40-millers-750x694.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a></p> <p>The Millers are an Echo Chamber-y couple. When they were on the dating scene, both of them judged potential suitors based on like-mindedness, and their closeness as a couple is based on how much they agree on. Today, there’s a long list of viewpoints that, if expressed by one member, would cause a huge fight. In their social life, they judge things the same way—they seek out like-minded friends and see those who disagree with them as assholes and idiots.</p> <p>Of course, all people bond with others over shared viewpoints—but for the Millers, it’s the <em>only</em> way bonding happens. When they have new potential friends over for dinner, the more agreement that happens at the table—especially around the ideas the Millers hold most sacred, like politics and child-rearing—the more they’ll like the new friends and pursue them as long-term companions. Get-togethers at their house end up feeling very different from the Johnson-Smith dinner we observed earlier.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40.4-tables.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8360\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40.4-tables.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40.4-tables.png 1525w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40.4-tables-600x321.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40.4-tables-768x410.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40.4-tables-750x401.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40.4-tables-374x200.png 374w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>For Echo Chamber couples, it’s pretty easy to keep things glued tightly together. But as Echo Chambers grow in size, it becomes a greater challenge to hold them together by shared ideas—so usually, the binding beliefs are honed down and simplified to the common denominator ideas that the whole community can get behind. So while Idea Labs get even smarter and more nuanced as they grow, growing Echo Chambers become even dumber and more sure of themselves.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40.5-mirror.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8335\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40.5-mirror.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"324\" height=\"394\" /></a></p> <p>Remember the “me against my brother; me and my brother against our cousins; me, my brother, and my cousins against the stranger” cartoon from <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/giants.html#bedouin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 1</a> of this series? Hatred or fear of a common enemy—an opposing group of people or ideas—is often the common denominator that unites large Echo Chambers. Without a prominent Them foil, an Echo Chamber’s Us is liable to split into rival Us/Them factions. So Echo Chambers don’t usually combine all the way up to the nationwide or species-wide level the way Idea Labs do—they grow until they hit a stable two-rival situation (think political parties or economic paradigms, to name two obvious examples). The hatred/fear mechanism to unite otherwise-divided Echo Chambers means that growing Echo Chamber coalitions don’t only get more ignorant—they get meaner and scarier.</p> <p>Earlier, I said that Idea Labs are awesome because they’re awesome at every level of emergence. Well Echo Chambers suck—because they suck at every level of emergence.</p> <p><strong>At the individual level</strong>, they repress free speech with a minefield of taboos, hinder learning and growth, and foster delusional arrogance. As mini nations, they’re more like old school dictatorships than constitutional democracies, and they pull their citizens downward on the Psych Spectrum.</p> <p><strong>At the community level</strong>, Echo Chambers are more than the sum of their parts only in raw power. Intellectually, the Echo Chamber giant is less capable of finding truth than a single independent thinker.</p> <p><strong>And at the national and pan-national level</strong>, we can thank Echo Chamber coalitions for fun parts of our history like war, oppression, bigotry, and genocide. The grand, species-wide Idea Lab is why we’ve made progress. Giant Echo Chambers are why that progress hasn’t happened a lot faster.</p> <p>All of us are living in at least a few Echo Chambers right now. To discover the Echo Chambers in your life, think about the different communities you’re a part of, and ask, “Is there a sacred baby in the room when I’m with those people? Are there ideas or viewpoints that are socially off-limits?”</p> <p>Here’s one other trick:</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>The Asshole Litmus Test</strong></p> <p>I’m a long-time fan of Randall Munroe and his always-delightful site <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">xkcd</a>. But I have a quibble with one particular xkcd comic:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/xkcd-free_speech_2x.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8337\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/xkcd-free_speech_2x.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"609\" height=\"622\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/xkcd-free_speech_2x.png 1132w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/xkcd-free_speech_2x-588x600.png 588w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/xkcd-free_speech_2x-768x784.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/xkcd-free_speech_2x-735x750.png 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 609px) 100vw, 609px\" /></a></p> <p>What Randall’s trying to do here is put an end to people claiming that their First Amendment rights are being violated when in fact, they’re not.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8229#footnote-4-8229\" id=\"note-4-8229\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> And the comic does a good job at that. My problem with the comic is that it doesn’t address the difference between the two kinds of intellectual cultures we’ve discussed—and as such, it serves as perfect justification for <em>both</em> the Idea Lab and the Echo Chamber.</p> <p>For me, the critical word in the comic is “asshole.” Both kinds of intellectual culture agree with the comic—what they disagree on is the definition of asshole.</p> <p>Communities that define asshole as “someone who in arguments attacks people, not ideas,” or “someone who expresses conviction on viewpoints where they don’t actually know very much,” or “someone who never admits when they’re wrong” are Idea Labs. They eject from the club those who turn arguments into fights and hinder the community’s ability to search for truth.</p> <p>On the other hand, communities that define asshole as “someone who disagrees with what the community believes,” or “someone who holds views that we find offensive,” or “someone who criticizes the community or defends our rival community” are Echo Chambers. By “showing the door” to anyone who doesn’t say their baby is cute, they purge their community of dissent and ensure that things remain intellectually pure.</p> <p>The xkcd comic is a comic about intolerance—but the key question it leaves open is: intolerance of <em>what?</em> When you consider your own judgments and those within your communities, think about the criteria for intolerance. Ask yourself: How exactly is “asshole” being defined?</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>Liberal Democracy: Cultural Coexistence</strong></p> <p>This is a post series about both psychology and sociology, because to understand what’s going on in the world around us, we need to think about both. If we view humanity in 3D, we see that psychology and sociology are really studies of the same human system, just from different vantage points along Emergence Tower.</p> <p>What Idea Labs and Echo Chambers show us is that the Higher Mind – Primitive Mind tension isn’t just happening in each of our heads—it’s raging up and down Emergence Tower, at the heart of both our psychology and sociology. It’s a <em>3D struggle.</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/41-loaf-battle-NEW-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8390 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/41-loaf-battle-NEW-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"579\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/41-loaf-battle-NEW-v2.png 1369w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/41-loaf-battle-NEW-v2-600x543.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/41-loaf-battle-NEW-v2-768x695.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/41-loaf-battle-NEW-v2-750x678.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px\" /></a></p> <p>This 3D struggle is the backstory behind human history and behind everything going on in our world today. It can also help us understand why the U.S. forefathers designed the system the way they did.</p> <p>The key innovation in a country like the U.S. isn’t to force higher-minded cultures and free speech upon anyone—it’s to allow people and communities to be whoever they want to be, in peace. <span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">The important thing is that membership in any community or culture, including a mini dictatorship, is purely </span><em style=\"font-size: inherit;\">voluntary</em><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">. If the only threat zealots have is to kick you out of their social circle—to “show you the door”—higher-minded people are free in a liberal democracy to say, “goodbye!” and head elsewhere. That’s liberal democracy’s secret sauce.</span></p> <p>In countries like the U.S., Idea Labs and Echo Chambers <em>coexist</em>. Echo Chambers may slow down the country’s progress—but they can’t forcefully hijack the whole system like they do in the Power Games. Whether the Echo Chambers like it or not (and they usually don’t), a liberal democracy’s Idea Labs, with enough tenacity, can continue to power their country’s slow, steady forward march of progress.</p> <p>At least that’s how it’s supposed to be. Remember the words of a wise man, Jeff Goldblum. <em>Life finds a way.</em> Liberal democracies do a great job of capping the power of the Primitive Mind and even harnessing that power as an engine of progress. But like an animal in a cage, the Primitive Mind yearns for its natural habitat—the Power Games. And even the best system isn’t infallible.</p> <p>I look around the U.S. and other parts of the world today and I worry that something is off—that in the chaos of rapid advances in technology and media, our worst tendencies may be quietly breaking free. In the next part of this series, we’ll hold our noses and dive into everybody’s favorite topic: politics. If we can look out at the world around us and see it in 3D, we might just be able to figure out what’s really going on.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/political-disney-world\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7661\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1.png 1100w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-300x164.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-768x419.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-600x327.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-239x130.png 239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" /></a></p> <p class=\"has-text-align-center wbwFont\">Chapter 9: <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/12/political-disney-world.html\">Political Disney World</a></p> \n     <div style=\"height:38px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To keep up with this series, sign up for the&nbsp;<strong><a class=\"ClickPico PicoRule\">Wait But Why email list</a></strong> and we’ll send you the new posts right when they come out.

Worth mentioning that my 94-year-old grandmother was born closer to the Andrew Jackson administration than to today.</p>\n<p>If you were born in the 1980s like me, a kid today who&#8217;s the age you were in 1990 is a full 30-year generation younger than you. They&#8217;ll remember Obama&#8217;s presidency the way you remember Reagan&#8217;s. 9/11 to them is the moon landing for you. The 90s seem as ancient to them as the 60s seem to you. To you, the 70s are just a little before your time—that&#8217;s how they think of the 2000s. They see the 70s how you see the 40s. And the hippy 60s seems as old to them as the Great Depression seems to you. </p>\n<p>But the weirdest thing about kids today: most of them will live to see the 2100s.</p>\n<p>Sorry if this stressed you out.

Now it’s time to play with them.</p> \n<p>We finished the chapter&nbsp;with a paragraph full of questions:</p> \n<p><em>How do millions of citizens, holding a wide range of views, often in furious conflict with each other, actually function as a single brain&nbsp;in practice? How does the brain form opinions? How does it learn new things? How does it make concrete decisions, and how does it change its mind?</em></p> \n<p>The big U.S. brain thinks using the same system it employs to distribute resources and elect leaders: the Value Games. The First Amendment, in addition to providing a key liberty, opens up a whole new competitive playing field:<a id=\"mpi\"></a></p> \n<h3><strong>The Marketplace of Ideas</strong></h3> \n<p>It’s well known that the economic marketplace is all about supply and demand—a supply of products and services satisfies the demand for all kinds of things, like homes, cars, food, and healthcare. The two components react to and influence one another. Demand drives supply as supply scrambles to match it, and suppliers try to manipulate demand to drive it towards whatever they’re supplying.</p> \n<p>We don’t always think of it like this, but the marketplace of ideas (MPI) works the same way. The demand for everything from knowledge to wisdom to leadership to entertainment to emotional catharsis is met by an endless supply of human expression. But there isn’t really an established way to analyze the MPI the way there is with economics, so we’ll come up with our own way of doing it, using the new language we’re developing.</p> \n<p>In its most basic form, the MPI is an <em>attention </em>market, where attention is the key currency instead of money.</p> \n<p>Economic demand is generated by consumer preferences; demand in the MPI is a function of <em>listener </em>preferences. The listener is the consumer of expressed ideas—and in the same way economic consumers have limited money to spend, idea consumers have limited <em>time</em> to spend listening.</p> \n<p>Economic supply is made up of products and services, and economic suppliers are sellers; supply in the MPI is ideas, supplied by speakers (“speakers,” in this case, means anyone exerting any form of expression—speech, writing, art, etc.).</p> \n<p>The MPI is Outer Self suppliers selling ideas, via expression, to listening Inner Self consumers. So the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/mute-button.html#speech-curve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Speech Curve</a> is the MPI’s supply curve. And because people tend to be interested in listening to like-minded people, the top of the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/mute-button.html#thought-pile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thought Pile</a> can serve as a decent proxy for an MPI demand curve.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/45.1-supply-demand-8bit.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7910\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/45.1-supply-demand-8bit.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"293\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/45.1-supply-demand-8bit.png 2100w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/45.1-supply-demand-8bit-600x283.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/45.1-supply-demand-8bit-768x363.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/45.1-supply-demand-8bit-750x354.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></a></p> \n<p>With the First Amendment barring restrictions on expression, attention seekers can take advantage of all parts of the Thought Pile. The most popular viewpoints on each topic reach the largest stages—national media, national politics, pop art—while the supply of less common viewpoints finds some space with the smaller megaphones, like local radio or, today, popular websites or YouTube channels.

In reality, there’s a lot of other stuff going on in the MPI—stuff like tribalism and virtue signaling and media manipulation and the cudgel of cultural taboo and other fun things in the pit of hell we’ll be descending into together later in the series. But we’re keeping things simple for now, and the basic concepts of the Thought Pile and Speech Curve—and the relevance windows and attention ceilings yielded by their shapes—is a good starting point.</p> <p>To most of us, the marketplace snapshot is an intuitive roadmap. Without realizing we’re following any specific roadmap, we’re all subconsciously aware of the marketplace’s supply and demand, its areas of relevance, and its uncrossable lines—and we use this intuition to navigate our way through society. Each subculture, each company culture, each marriage or group of friends is its own little MPI with all of these components in place, and most people abide closely by the various lines and curves—because a culture’s marketplace curves are a roadmap to popularity, and diverting off that map is often a roadmap to ostracism. Wannabe comedians and writers and podcasters and artists and entrepreneurs have the shape of their target audience’s marketplace curves on the forefront of their minds—because it’s a roadmap to acquire the precious attention and respect necessary for success. Politicians have entire teams working day and night to suss out the dimensions of the idea marketplaces of their party and of the country, because for them, it’s a career survival instruction manual.</p> <p>And if that’s what you want—popularity, attention, survival—then it makes sense to use the current marketplace curves as guidelines.</p> <p>But what if you want more?</p> <p>Abiding by the existing shape of the MPI is an exercise in mimicking the status quo. It’s taking what society’s brain is already thinking and jumping into the flow to try to get a piece of the action. It’s being a <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cook</a>.</p> <p>Trying your best to meet existing demand for ideas is trying your best to preach to the choir—to have your voice ascend in the marketplace on a vertical column of attention by preaching a little better than the other preachers—by offering a little crunchier version of the same expression carrot they’re already eating.</p> <p>There’s nothing wrong with doing any of that. But it’s not leadership.</p> <p>Leadership is, by definition, leading people <em>away </em>from where they already are. If you’re preaching to the choir, you’re not leading anybody anywhere.</p> <p>When you’re zoomed in on a snapshot, markets are distribution mechanisms that allot coveted, limited resources like wealth or attention. But then we remember the cool thing about markets: when a market is working well, the cumulative effect of all the activity is a giant forward arrow.</p> <p>When you back up and look at the bigger picture, the economic market is a <em>progress machine</em>. When you apply the axis of time to the economy, you see that each market snapshot is a thin slice of a forward progress arrow of technology, of innovation, of efficiency, of prosperity.</p> <p>Over time, the MPI generates its own giant progress arrow: the growth of both knowledge and wisdom. When a country can think for itself, it gets both smarter and more mature as it ages.</p> <p>Every individual competing in the economic marketplace is, to some extent, contributing to the big progress arrow. But the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chefs</a>—those pushing the mainstream out of their comfort zone—are the primary drivers of change. The entrepreneurs who, instead of building a better hotel, build Airbnb. The tech moguls who, instead of building a better flip phone, build the iPhone. The employees who challenge the company’s conventional wisdom instead of kowtowing before it.</p> <p>Likewise, if you want to do more than preach to the choir in the MPI—if you want to help drive knowledge or wisdom <em>forward</em>—you’ll need to make the jump from the benign attention market to the brutal <em>influence </em>market. You have to roll up your sleeves and go looking for the far less pleasant and far less willing kind of audience—the audience who <em>doesn’t </em>agree with you—and tell them things they don’t like hearing.</p> <p>You’ve got to do something a thousand times harder than confirming people’s beliefs and validating their identities—you have to <em>change people’s minds.</em></p> <h3><strong>Mind-Changing Movements</strong></h3> <p>At any given point in time, there will be a wide range of what the people in an MPI believe to be true or good. But the ideas that carry the most power will be those held by the most people—the mainstream ideas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/52-mainstream-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7993\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/52-mainstream-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/52-mainstream-v2.png 1506w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/52-mainstream-v2-600x283.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/52-mainstream-v2-768x363.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/52-mainstream-v2-750x354.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>Typically, the mainstream ideas are what will be taught in schools, what will appear most often in art, what will dictate broad cultural norms, and what will limit the stances held by national politicians.

People don’t like having their beliefs challenged or their favorite habits disparaged. Companies profiting off the status quo <em>really </em>don’t like dissenting viewpoints. So the new, anti-smoking ideas were attacked from all sides.</p> <p>Most claims to truth that aim to debunk the mainstream perception of reality turn out to be wrong—and the MPI gauntlet is great at exposing their wrongness. Sometimes a false idea can make a run at it for a while, but the further it gets in widespread adoption, the more viciously the MPI attacks it. When false claims to truth go up against a marketplace free to criticize them, the marketplace almost always wins. Eventually, the falsehoods are shown to be wrong so clearly by the marketplace that all but the most stubborn zealots stop believing them.</p> <p>But the gauntlet provides a second service. Scattered throughout the haystack of bogus claims are needles of actual truth. The gauntlet, acting selfishly, attacks <em>all </em>claims to truth—hay and needle. When it attacks hay, it exposes the claim as hay. But when it attacks a <em>needle</em>, the needle stands strong. The more the needle of truth withstands the gauntlet’s attacks, the more people begin to adopt the viewpoint as their own. After enough attacks from the gauntlet, a needle still standing is exposed to be <em>true</em>. By no intentional goodwill, the same gauntlet that exposes falsehoods <em>also </em>exposes truth. The two services make the nastiest side of the MPI—the relentless gauntlet—an efficient <em>truth-finder</em> that sifts through hay and identifies the needles.</p> <p>So the gauntlet went full force on “smoking causes cancer,” hammering it from every possible angle, trying to expose it as (or at least frame it as) a fear-mongering strand of BS hay.</p> <p>And for a while, the attacks were effective. Forty years after the early evidence surfaced linking smoking to cancer, a 1954 Gallup survey found that 60% of Americans answered “No” or “Unsure” to the question “Does smoking cause lung cancer?” And in 1953, 47% of Americans smoked cigarettes—including half of all doctors.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=7904#footnote2-3-7904\" id=\"note2-3-7904\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a> <p>But the gauntlet can only hold off a truth needle for so long, and the anti-smoking claims didn’t fade away—they only got louder.</p> <p>In 1964, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/199073624/Smoking-and-Health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public report</a> on smoking for the first time, outlining the negative effects. As more and more evidence began to pile up about the dangers of second-hand smoke, more people in the marketplace began to protest cigarette smoking being legal in indoor spaces. Parents whose minds had changed about cigarettes became more likely to prohibit their children from smoking. The culture started to turn against smoking, lowering the prevalence of the cigarette in TV shows. Politicians, noticing the shifting tide of public opinion, began to outlaw cigarette ads, require cigarette companies to display warnings on their labels, and ban smoking in enclosed spaces like restaurants and airplanes, making a smoking habit increasingly inconvenient.</p> <p>As the big U.S. brain’s answer to “Does smoking cause lung cancer?” changed from “No” to “Yes”<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=7904#footnote2-4-7904\" id=\"note2-4-7904\" rel=\"footnote2\">4</a>—</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/55-smoking-poll.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-7954\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/55-smoking-poll.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"331\" height=\"160\" /></a></p> <p>—the percentage of Americans who smoked dropped from 47% in 1953 to 14% in 2017.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=7904#footnote2-5-7904\" id=\"note2-5-7904\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a> <p>The cigarette story is a story of the MPI doing its job.

We’re built to believe convenient delusions, not to be accurate. Given this fact about us, the MPI isn’t just a way for a large group of people to work together to find truth, <em>it’s the only way </em>for them to do it. As author Jonathan Rauch <a href=\"https://www.thefire.org/so-to-speak-transcript-jonathan-rauch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">points out</a>, when someone like Einstein declares his theory of general relativity, there literally is no way to tell if he’s a genius or a madman until the “global network of checkers,” as Rauch puts it, attacks the theory from all angles, looking for holes, and continually fails.</p> <p>Little Lulu from <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/stories.html#lulu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Part 1</a> did the best she could, using her own life experience and her own sense of reason, to turn her mind into a truth filter at that berry bush.

Both knowledge and wisdom are ever-evolving works in progress, and in both cases, the nasty MPI gauntlet is the mechanism that drives that change.</p> <p>In the case of the U.S. brain’s views on interracial marriage, things have changed very quickly, at least by sociological standards. By 2013, only 55 years after 96% of Americans disapproved of interracial marriage, that percentage had dropped to 13%. A complete 180.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/57-opinion-poll-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7997 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/57-opinion-poll-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"451\" height=\"267\" /></a></p> <p>If fringe truth claims are a pile of nonsense hay with a few truth needles inside, fringe claims about <em>morality</em> are a pile of dogshit dotted with a few diamonds of wisdom. Most of what the fringe has to say will always be wrong, because the fringe is cluttered with the least knowledgeable and least wise among us. But scattered within that crowd are often the very <em>wisest </em>people too.</p> <p>In 1958, almost every reasonable person in the U.S. thought interracial marriage was an immoral thing. Today, we see this as a failure of wisdom. The 4% who disagreed with them were the wisest people of all when it came to this topic. Their ideas were the diamonds in the dogshit.</p> <p>The MPI is not kind to factual hay, and it’s even less kind to moral dogshit. While those who believe fringe, foolish moral claims are usually positive that those claims are diamonds, the MPI has a bright flashlight, and a sensitive nose, and dogshit doesn’t last long in the gauntlet. But when the rare diamond does enter the marketplace from the fringe, the more light that shines on it, the <em>brighter</em> it gets. In a half century, the small group of activists wise enough to see that interracial marriage bans were wrong, ridiculous, and unconstitutional, shouted their unpopular ideas into the MPI, igniting a mind-changing movement that spread until the change of mind had reached the center of the U.S. brain’s consciousness.</p> <p>We can look at this story on our idea spectrum.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-interracial-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7998\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-interracial-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-interracial-v2.png 2700w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-interracial-v2-600x339.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-interracial-v2-768x434.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-interracial-v2-750x424.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>Starting a mind-changing movement is like starting a fire with flint—it’s laborious and sometimes not even possible. But when it gets rolling, it can spread like a forest fire. The history of interracial marriage in the U.S. is another story about the power of a free marketplace of ideas. It’s the same power that changed the U.S. brain’s mind about duels, about slavery, about child labor, about women’s suffrage, about business monopolies, about segregation, and the same power that’s currently working out what it thinks about animal rights, and bioethics, and online privacy, and ten other things, many of which seem right now like fringe dogshit to 96% of us.</p> <p>The people who argued for cigarettes and against interracial marriage weren’t, on average, worse people or stupider people than today’s Americans—just like the medieval scientists who believed the solar system was geocentric weren’t less intelligent than today’s scientists. Like any individual, a society grows up over time by reflecting on its experience, reconsidering what it believes, and working to evolve for the better. And like an individual, this evolution takes place within society’s mind. A society’s mind is its marketplace of ideas, and the freer, more open, and more active that marketplace is, the sharper and clearer the giant mind is and the faster the pace of societal growth.</p> \n     <div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n      <h3><strong>The Extra Thoughts on Leadership Blue Box</strong></h3> \n      <p>All leadership is hard, but some is harder than others. In the above examples, I left out the Speech Curve and just focused on the Thought Pile for simplicity. But in reality, the Speech Curve and Thought Pile move together, each at times being the leader that pulls the other one behind it. In instances when the Thought Pile is the leader, it means that the big brain has quietly changed its mind about something, through lots of small conversations—but no one quite realizes yet just how sweeping a shift has taken place, so people are still timid to say out loud what everyone is thinking. It looks something like this:</p> \n      <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.1-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7965\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.1-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.1-v2.png 2368w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.1-v2-600x263.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.1-v2-768x336.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.1-v2-750x328.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> \n      <p>In a case like this, the Speech Curve is outdated for a period of time until people perceptive enough to see the Thought Pile’s real location and courageous enough to trust their instincts start speaking up—venturing into this zone on the right:</p> \n      <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.2-v3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8000\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.2-v3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.2-v3.png 2368w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.2-v3-600x263.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.2-v3-768x336.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.2-v3-750x328.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a>If these bold speakers are wrong about where the Thought Pile is, they often end up in trouble, penalized by the market. But when they’re right, they’re handsomely rewarded. They become iconic stand-up comedians, best-selling authors, and election-sweeping politicians. One example that pops to mind is Obama being like, “Yeah duh I smoked pot. Smoking pot is fun.” The widespread assumption at the time was that saying something like that would sink a politician (which is why a few election cycles earlier, Clinton pretended he never inhaled)—but Obama was savvy enough to see that the Thought Pile had shifted and the Speech Curve was lagging behind. And it turned out to be a boost for his popularity.</p> \n      <p>Saying what everyone is thinking but not saying is a form of leadership. It formalizes a Thought Pile shift that has already happened, clearing the way for everyone else to start saying those things too. A few bold speakers with big platforms are usually all it takes for the whole Speech Curve to shift and realign with the Thought Pile.</p> \n      <p>Then there are the times when the Speech Curve leads the Thought Pile. This is when someone has the nerve to go here:</p> \n      <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7968\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"751\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.3.png 2100w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.3-600x283.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.3-768x363.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56A.3-750x354.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px\" /></a></p> \n      <p>This is even riskier than saying something that you suspect is already within the Thought Pile. It will for sure be met with resistance, and there’s a strong chance the speaker will be zapped out of relevance by an angry Thought Pile. But if the speaker is good enough—and if they have truth or wisdom on their side—they may be able to change people’s minds and pull the Thought Pile over toward their viewpoint. Changing minds is the harder kind of leadership. It requires even more courage than the “say what everyone’s thinking” kind, and if it succeeds, it’s even more impactful. </p> \n      <p>Both kinds of leadership are incredibly important. They’re both the work of people who have the guts to reason from first principles and act on that reasoning. And most movements are probably the result of a bit of both forms of leadership. In this way, the Thought Pile and Speech Curve are a tag team, each taking the reins at times when the other is lagging behind, working together to drive the country’s evolution.</p> \n     </div> <p>The MPI is an attention market, a knowledge market, and a wisdom market—all rooted, like the economic and political markets, in the fundamental American freedom-fairness compromise: <em>everyone has an equal opportunity to compete, but no one has a right to succeed.</em> Anyone is free to run for office, start a business, express their opinions, or become an activist—but to actually acquire power, wealth, attention, and influence, you have to earn it from your fellow citizens on the playing field.</p> <p>But Value Games markets are fragile, and they rely on clear rules. The status quo has a fierce survival instinct, which is why leaders in any market will be met with resistance—and what matters most is the <em>type</em> of resistance. In the Power Games, with the looming threat of imprisonment or execution for saying something unpopular with the wrong people, the opponents of cigarettes and the proponents of interracial marriage may have never spoken up in the first place. But the Constitution alters the rules of the game, taking the exact same selfish resistance and transforming it from a gauntlet of harmful cudgels into a gauntlet of harmless <em>criticism,</em> limiting it to attacking the dissent itself, not the dissenter. This kind of resistance, rather than repressing fringe viewpoints, <em>tests </em>them—forming a filter that pushes falsehoods and foolishness down and lifts truth and virtue <em>up</em>. In the same way that a free economic market harnesses human selfishness and points it toward progress and innovation, a free marketplace of ideas transforms selfishness into a compass that points the country in the direction of knowledge and wisdom.</p> <p>Which brings me back to Obama and Clinton and 2008.</p> <p>Jonathan Rauch, the author I mentioned earlier, is also a gay activist. He describes what it was like to be gay in the U.S. in 1960:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=7904#footnote2-7-7904\" id=\"note2-7-7904\" rel=\"footnote2\">7</a> <p><em>Gay Americans were forbidden to work for the government; forbidden to obtain security clearances; forbidden to serve in the military. They were arrested for making love, even in their own homes; beaten and killed on the streets; entrapped and arrested by the police for sport; fired from their jobs. They were joked about, demeaned, and bullied as a matter of course; forced to live by a code of secrecy and lies, on pain of opprobrium and unemployment; witch-hunted by anti-Communists, Christians, and any politician or preacher who needed a scapegoat; condemned as evil by moralists and as sick by scientists; portrayed as sinister and simpering by Hollywood; perhaps worst of all, rejected and condemned, at the most vulnerable time of life, by their own parents. America was a society permeated by hate: usually, it’s true, hateful ideas and assumptions, not hateful people, but hate all the same. So ubiquitous was the hostility to homosexuality that few gay people ever even dared hold hands in public with the person they loved.</em></p> <p>In a Power Games country, a topic like gay rights, considered deeply offensive to most people in 1960, almost certainly would have been censored. By censoring anything it considers dogshit, the society also censors that critical wise 4% that drives most of the growth.</p> <p>But in a U.S. hell-bent on free speech, Rauch tells the story of how things changed:</p> <p><em>In ones and twos at first, then in streams and eventually cascades, gays talked. They argued. They explained. They showed. They confronted. … As gay people stepped forward, liberal science engaged. The old anti-gay dogmas came under critical scrutiny as never before. “Homosexuals molest and recruit children”; “homosexuals cannot be happy”; “homosexuals are really heterosexuals”; “homosexuality is unknown in nature”: The canards collapsed with astonishing speed. </em></p> <p><em>What took place was not just empirical learning but also moral learning. How can it be wicked to love? How can it be noble to lie? How can it be compassionate to reject your own children? How can it be kind to harass and taunt? How can it be fair to harp on one Biblical injunction when so many others are ignored? How can it be just to penalize what does no demonstrable harm? Gay people were asking straight people to test their values against logic, against compassion, against life. Gradually, then rapidly, the criticism had its effect. You cannot be gay in America today and doubt that moral learning is real and that the open society fosters it.</em></p> <p>It took a while to get there, but by 2008, the U.S. brain had given both the truth and wisdom regarding homosexuality a lot of reflection, and it had changed its mind considerably on the topic.</p> <p>But as we were reminded above, it hadn’t quite changed its mind on gay <em>marriage</em> yet.</p> <p>Sensing that the pro-gay-marriage stance was still below political sea level, Obama and Clinton decided to pander to the status quo beliefs and play it safe.</p> <p>But a mind-changing movement had caught fire and the national Thought Pile was on the move.

Or as Overton’s think tank puts it, “the ongoing contest among media and other political actors about what counts as legitimate disagreement.” In this second set of battles, proponents of a policy outside the Overton window fight to simply get their policy into the window—that’s the hard part. Then they can worry about winning the inevitable battle over that policy that will ensue <em>within </em>the window. Meanwhile, opponents of that policy will fight fiercely to keep the policy outside the window, where it’s deemed unacceptable to even be debated. That’s the best way to prevent it from happening.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=7904#footnote-3-7904\" id=\"note-3-7904\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> <p>If you live in a democracy, and you’re not zoomed out far enough, you might look at the politicians running your government and mistake them for your leaders. In the short term, sure, they jostle with each other over the country’s policies and steer the country on the international stage. But with a step back, the real long-term leader of a democracy is the giant communal brain of the citizen body. Politicians are all about principles…as long as those principles fit on the top of the country’s Thought Pile, safely inside the Overton window. But when that Thought Pile moves, like it did on the topic of gay marriage between 2008 and 2012, politicians drop everything and start <em>swimming</em>.</p> <p>This is no criticism of politicians—being a small-picture leader and a big-picture follower is the politician’s survival requirement. It’s simply a reminder that change in a country like the U.S. starts at the bottom and works its way up to the top. It starts with brave citizens willing to say unpopular things in public. With the right idea and a lot of courage, a single person can spark a mind-changing movement that gains so much momentum, it moves our beliefs and our cultural norms, which in turn moves the Overton window, which moves policy, which moves law.</p> <p>Whenever a citizen of a democracy speaks up in a classroom or town hall, writes an op-ed, makes a movie, tweets a tweet, or yells something out on the street, they’re sending an idea out into the great network—firing a little neural impulse into the workings of the larger system. Every citizen, whether they realize it or not, is a neuron in the mind of a giant organism, and what they do and say in their lifetime contributes to who that organism is, even if only a little bit.</p> <p>But all of this only works because of free speech. All of those Thought Piles only ooze along the idea spectrum with a mind of their own because they’re protected from above by the broad arc of a free and protected Speech Curve.</p> <p>It’s easy to see why free speech is often referred to as not just a right but as <em>the </em>fundamental right on which all other rights are based.</p> <p>Free speech allows the precious resource of attention to be allotted the Value Games way instead of being doled out by the powerful and high-status at their whim.</p> <p>Free speech gives citizens a way to resolve conflicts with words instead of violence. When ideas can go to battle against each other, people don’t have to.</p> <p>Free speech gives power to the powerless. It’s never easy being in the minority in any country. The rich are protected and empowered by their money, the elite by their connections, the majority by their vote. A minority population is often helpless. But free speech gives the powerless a voice—an ability to launch a mind-changing movement that wins over the majority and makes the country better for themselves.</p> <p>The free speech of individual citizens is the free <em>thought</em> of the communal citizen body, and the singular right that lets hundreds of millions of minds link together into a giant network that can learn, grow, and think as one. Society is driven by the stories we believe, and free speech hands authorship of those stories over to the people themselves.</p> <p>And it’s for all these same reasons that Power Games dictators clutch so tightly onto their mute buttons. Even today, over two centuries after the birth of the U.S., <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/58-MAP.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">almost three billion human beings</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=7904#footnote2-9-7904\" id=\"note2-9-7904\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a> are still deprived of freedom of speech or other core Enlightenment freedoms.</p> <p>But dictators aren’t the only ones who use mute buttons. Given all of the obvious benefits of free speech, when a culture or a movement or an individual citizen seems threatened by free speech, the first question you should ask is: “Why? What are they so scared of?” Free speech is a tool that helps us see what’s true versus false and right versus wrong—so if you believe truth and virtue are on your side, a vibrant, open discourse is your best friend. And if someone is trying to repress free speech—that tells us something important.</p> <p>Mute buttons in any form should raise an alarm in all of our heads, though they sometimes seem to go unnoticed. When all you’ve ever known is freedom, it can be easy to forget just how precious it is.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> <p>In a world of Power Games, the American forefathers built a different kind of giant—one that didn’t need to be controlled with strings and cudgels because it could think for itself and make its own decisions.

But the new country quickly began to thrive. This wasn’t the first time a society replaced an iron cudgel with a constitution—but one had never been done so effectively, on so broad a scale, in modern times. Soon, countries run by constitutions, driven by minds of their own, began springing up all over the world.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=7904#footnote2-10-7904\" id=\"note2-10-7904\" rel=\"footnote2\">10</a><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/60-democracy-chart.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7976\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/60-democracy-chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"867\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/60-democracy-chart.png 3400w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/60-democracy-chart-600x433.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/60-democracy-chart-768x555.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/60-democracy-chart-750x542.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> <p>The founders knew that they didn’t have all the answers. They knew that over time the world would change, the citizens would change, and unpredictable things would happen. They were wise enough to know that no matter how smart they were, their country was a first draft—United States 1.0. The U.S. was a promising child who would need to grow up into a more perfect nation.</p> <p>So they built a nation that was founded on doubt, not certainty. With a mysterious, foggy future ahead, free speech would give the new nation a way to figure things out as it went: a flashlight to help see the truth, a compass that would help point it towards wisdom, and a mirror that would help an orphan child raise itself.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61-trudging.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7975\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61-trudging.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61-trudging.png 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61-trudging-600x380.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61-trudging-768x486.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/61-trudging-750x475.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>But when you’re dealing with humans, nothing is easy.</p> <p>Taking the human out of the Power Games is one thing—taking the Power Games out of the human is quite another. Enlightenment-born constitutions put the Primitive Mind in a cage, but just how strong are those bars?</p> <p>While the Value Games may be the official way of doing business in the U.S., at the core of every U.S. citizen and government official runs a piece of primitive software that speaks a more ancient language—and in U.S. society, the shadow of a cudgel sometimes seems to loom where it’s not supposed to.</p> <p>Is the U.S. the Enlightenment come to life? Or is it the Power Games, wearing an Enlightenment disguise?</p> <p>Probably a little of both.</p> <p>The U.S. is a story of a nation’s struggle for security, for power, for progress, for wealth. But mostly, it’s a story of a nation’s struggle against itself.</p> <p>Sounds a little like each of us, doesn’t it?</p> <p>That’s the thing about building a giant human being. You get the whole package—on a giant scale.</p> <p>In this post, we got to know how the U.S. works on the surface. But to accomplish our goal in this series—to understand modern societies well enough that we can figure out how to make things better—we’ll need to go deeper.

03:23:55","updatedTime":"2020-08-17 03:23:55","title":"You Won’t Believe My Morning","link":"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8917","description":"<p>You won’t believe my morning.</p>\n<p>I went out on my daily excursion to sit on the front step of my building for ten minutes holding my breath when people walked by. Normally, I spend the time diddling around my phone, but I forgot to bring my phone this morning, so I just looked around.</p>\n<p>As I was taking in the emptiness of the street, a little glint caught my eye in a patch of dirt on the sidewalk. I bent over to look closer, and there was the glint again. It wasn’t a normal glint like from a shiny rock or a piece of metal—it was a little pinprick of flashing light.</p>\n<p>Intrigued, I was now on all fours looking closer. And I saw the most surreal thing.</p>\n<p><em>Tiny houses.</em></p>\n<p>Like <em>tiny </em>houses. Each about a millimeter high, like ornately carved grains of sand.</p>\n<p>I was either dreaming or looking at the coolest, <em>cutest </em>little art project ever.</p>\n<p>As I examined the microscopic village, I noticed what looked like a scrawl of teeny letters on the dirt next to the houses. It said:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">PUT YOUR THUMB ON THE OVAL</p>\n<p>Now fully having the time of my life, I looked around for an oval. I searched for a few minutes with no luck until I saw, a bit outside the area where the houses were, a little strip of silver, maybe two millimeters long and a millimeter wide. Careful not to damage the houses, I put my thumb on it.</p>\n<p>I won’t be able to accurately describe what happened next, but I’ll try my best. Imagine if the ground underneath you suddenly felt like a furiously spinning liquid whirlpool, combined with the feeling of freefalling, combined with your entire visual field turning into a blurry gray, combined with the worst nausea of your life.</p>\n<p>And then, just as fast as it started, it all stopped. I cowered for a few seconds trying to catch my breath, and when I opened my eyes, I wasn’t in New York anymore.</p>\n<p>I was on a pastoral ranch, surrounded by big log cabins and a bunch of people staring down at me as I looked up at them, still on all fours. One of the people said to me, “Are you okay?”</p>\n<p>“I feel okay, but I’m having <em>severe </em>hallucinations.”</p>\n<p>They all started cheering and hugging and high-fiving each other.</p>\n<p>“Are you doctors?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“He thinks he has the virus,” one of them said, and they all roared with laughter.</p>\n<p>A woman shushed the crowd and said, “Okay, back to work everyone. I’ll give him the briefing.”</p>\n<p>The others left, and the woman smiled at me. “I’m Layla.”</p>\n<p>“Hi Layla. Do I have coronavirus?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“You don’t have coronavirus,” she said. “You’re just tiny. We shrunk you to 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of your normal size. You haven’t moved anywhere, you’ve just gotten much smaller.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck,” I explained.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I imagine it’s a lot to take in,” she said. “Let me try to clear things up. There are different tiers of human life, not just the one you’re used to. Our tier is exactly 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> the size of yours. In yours, people are about 180 centimeters tall. Here, we’re about 0.18 millimeters tall. We’d say 180 micrometers tall, but I know in your world, micrometers don’t mean very much.”</p>\n<p>I stared at her. “You’re telling me I’m 0.18 millimeters tall right now?”</p>\n<p>“Correct,” she said. “About half the size of a dust mite, or a little taller than the width of a human hair up in your world. A person in your world with really good eyesight could <em>barely </em>see you, if they looked closely. And see that house over there?&#8221; She pointed to a large, three-story house. “In the scale you’re used to, that would be about 10 meters high. Here, it’s about the size of a cubic millimeter—the size of a grain of sand on the sidewalk. Some of our houses were actually carved from grains of sand.”</p>\n<p>“Hold on.” I stopped her. “I’m <em>very </em>scared of bugs. I wrote a whole post about it once. Are there <em>giant </em>bugs here?”</p>\n<p>“Yes and no. There are no bugs in our village because we lined the perimeter with a poison that kills any insects that come too close. But you wouldn’t want to walk too far away from the houses—about three centimeters from here, you’ll cross that barrier and run into things you won’t like.”</p>\n<p>“How about flying bugs?” I asked diligently.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I haven’t mentioned time yet. Okay so time here moves 100 times faster than it does up on your tier. Time scales up inversely with the square root of the size difference. So 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of the size means 100X faster time. So when a flying insect starts to descend into the village, our defense crew has over a minute here to handle the situation. They fire a jet of air at the insect that deflects it away from us. Same deal for dogs. Every year or two, a dog will pee on us. The defense crew keeps track of every dog walking by. At 1/100<sup>th</sup> the speed of our world, we first see an approaching dog about ten minutes before it gets near us, and by the time a peeing dog is lifting its leg over us, we’ve had plenty of time to draw the tarps, which roll over the entire village and cover everything—the same tarps we use every time it rains or snows.”</p>\n<p>“Good to know. But why am I here?”</p>\n<p>“Right, I was about to get to that. After a heated debate in the village, we voted to bring someone from your world here, because we wanted to show you something. We’ve been trying to catch someone’s eye in your world for three of your weeks. That’s almost <em>six years </em>here. That’s why everyone was so excited to see you.”</p>\n<p>“How did you catch my attention?”</p>\n<p>“With <em>that</em>.” She pointed at a tube on the roof of one of the houses that looked like large telescope. “That’s a super-powered laser that we’ve been trying to shine in people’s eyes as they walked by on the sidewalk. But no one noticed. Until today. Way out on the horizon, we piled boulders into the shapes of letters that spelled out the instructions, and you were dicking around just hard enough that you actually bent down to read them. We’re thankful.”</p>\n<p>“What was that oval in the instructions?”</p>\n<p>“Look down.”</p>\n<p>I was standing on a metallic oval about the size of a swimming pool.</p>\n<p>“This is our trans-tier station. When you touched this with your thumb, it shrunk you down to our tier.</p>\n<p>“Wait.” I looked up at her. “Do I <em>live</em> here now?”</p>\n<p>She laughed. “Don’t worry. We’ll send you back to your world in a little bit. Now come with me.”</p>\n<p>I walked with Layla towards the other side of the village. I looked around. Everyone was staring at me. Some people waved.</p>\n<p>“What’s that?” I asked Layla, pointing up at what looked like a sheet of color stretching into the sky.</p>\n<p>“That’s your apartment building. All you can see from here is the first brick. That band of light way up in the sky is the mortar between the first and second brick in the wall.”</p>\n<p>We walked into a small building and entered a room with a long white table in the middle. Layla turned towards a wall on the side of the room, and suddenly the outline of a square formed in the wall. The square moved outwards into the room and rotated downwards until it was parallel to the floor. Layla pulled a tweezer-like tool from her pocket and carefully pinched what looked like nothing a few centimeters above the panel.</p>\n<p>She walked over to me. “Open your palm.”</p>\n<p>She put her tweezers into my hand and dropped something the size of a grain of sand. I raised up my palm to look at it. It was reddish and fuzzy.</p>\n<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“SARS-CoV-2. What you&#8217;ve been calling &#8216;coronavirus.&#8217;”</p>\n<p>I flung it across the room. “What the <em>fuck</em>.”</p>\n<p>Layla laughed, touched the square, and the little object flew back across the room into its spot above the square.</p>\n<p>“It can’t hurt you here. The viruses of your world are <em>way </em>too big to do any damage in our bodies.”</p>\n<p>I stared at her, trying to process the situation. “How do you know about coronavirus? And how did you…<em>get </em>one?”</p>\n<p>“Oh we know everything about your world. Your tier moves so slowly compared to ours that your technology is eons behind ours. Our tools have allowed us to watch your world since your prehistoric days. As for how we got a coronavirus particle, we didn’t get it—we <em>made </em>it.”</p>\n<p>“<em>You </em>made the coronavirus?”</p>\n<p>“Well, with a little help. Follow me.”</p>\n<p>Again I followed Layla, again dumbfounded, this time out of the building toward a fenced-in area outside. When we got close, a door in the fence opened and inside, we stood together on the edge of what looked like a barren circle of land.</p>\n<p>Layla opened her hand. The little virus was sitting neatly on her palm. “SARS-CoV-2 is a standard sized Coronavirus—about 120 nanometers in diameter. 120 nanometers is ridiculously small in your world, but in ours, you can roll it around in your fingers.</p>\n<p>“Cool…let me think about that for a minute.”</p>\n<p>“Wait, I can explain this better. In your world, this is a perfect size analogy:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">SARS-CoV-2 : grain of sand :: grain of sand : house</p>\n<p>In both cases, the relationship is 1-to-10,000, which is also the relationship of our world to yours. In your world, your apartment building is huge, a grain of sand is tiny, and this coronavirus is unfathomably microscopic. In ours, the virus is tiny, a grain of your sand is huge enough to live in, and your apartment building is unfathomably large.”</p>\n<p>“Makes sense.”</p>\n<p>“Now, what’s a virus made of? Atoms. And atoms are about 0.1 nanometers in diameter—about 1/1,000<sup>th</sup> of the diameter of a SARS-CoV-2 particle. That’s small even for <em>us.</em> An atom is almost as small for us as a virus is for you. Constructing a virus requires incredibly complex engineering and tools that can interact with the quantum field. We can’t do it ourselves.”</p>\n<p>“So how—”</p>\n<p>“Look down.”</p>\n<p>I looked at the ground.</p>\n<p>She pulled me toward the center of the circle of land and then pulled me to an abrupt stop.</p>\n<p>“Look closer.”</p>\n<p>I bent over as far as I could and strained my eyes. No. Fucking. Way.</p>\n<p><em>Another microscopic world</em>.</p>\n<p><em>“Is that</em>…”</p>\n<p>“Yup. That’s the tier below <em>us</em>. Give me your thumb.”</p>\n<p>She carefully placed the virus particle onto the ground. Then she guided my hand to the ground, touching both of our thumbs to a little metallic spot.</p>\n<p>Whirlpool. Falling. Gray. Nausea. Misery.</p>\n<p>I eventually got a hold of my trembling and drooling and opened my eyes. In every direction, as far as I could see, stretched a hazy blue-ish / purple-ish plane. It also began to dawn on me that I wasn’t standing or sitting on anything—I was <em>floating</em>.</p>\n<p>After about a minute of wondering what the <em>hell </em>was going on in my life, a patch of the sky darkened. The dark region became smaller and more defined until it condensed into Layla floating next to me.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t leave me again,” I said.</p>\n<p>“Sorry, my thumb hit the pad a split second later than yours did. Time moves 100 times faster here than up there, so you got to spend some reflective time here by yourself.”</p>\n<p>“Okay where are we?”</p>\n<p>“We’re outside your apartment building. Remember?”</p>\n<p>“Righttt. So what <em>size</em> are we?”</p>\n<p>“We went down the same jump you did when you transitioned from your world to ours—we shrunk to 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of our previous size. So you’re now 18 nanometers tall. If you stood on the edge of a cross-section of a human hair, it would take you about two hours to walk across it.”</p>\n<p>“Jesus.”</p>\n<p>“Time here is now going by at 100X the speed of time in my world, which means it’s moving 10,000 times faster than the speed of time in yours. You could spend a year here and less than an hour would pass in your world.”</p>\n<p>“Kind of like Inception?”</p>\n<p>“Not really. Anyway, nothing down here works the way it does in our worlds. Like see how the ground is all eternal and purply?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah.”</p>\n<p>“That’s not really ground, and it’s not really purple. When you’re this small, there aren’t any solid objects in the sense you understand. And your eyes are too small now to perceive the visible light spectrum.”</p>\n<p>“So what the hell?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t really get it either. But the people who live here have incredibly advanced ways of manipulating the quantum field so we can feel like we’re intact humans, floating in place, seeing purple. They set it up this way because it’s something we can make sense of.”</p>\n<p>“That’s nice of them. Where are they all anyway?”</p>\n<p>“The thing is, they don’t like our world, and they <em>really </em>don’t like your world. They interact with us occasionally, when it’s necessary, but they’ll never allow you or anyone from your world to see them or know anything about how they live. This is actually the first time anyone from your world has been allowed down here, other than Andy Kaufman, who’s lived here since 1984.”</p>\n<p>“Then why am I allowed to be here?”</p>\n<p>“So I can show you this.”</p>\n<p>Layla straightened her arm in front of her, with her palm facing outwards. Her palm lit up and when it did, a bizarre-looking giant object was revealed in front of us.</p>\n<p>“This,” Layla said, “is SARS-CoV-2. Down here, it’s the size of a house.”</p>\n<p>I looked up at the vast virus in front of me. It looked nothing like it had when it was a fuzzy grain of sand in my hand. It was transparent, like a massive, intricately structured, sphere-shaped jellyfish. There was a kind of furious movement within the transparency, but I couldn’t see anything specific moving. It was confusing.</p>\n<p>Layla motioned for me to come close to the virus. She took my hand and placed my palm onto the virus’s almost invisible surface. It felt kind of like palming a grape bunch except instead of grapes it was tapioca balls like the ones in those bubble teas—if the tapioca balls were vibrating so vigorously that it felt a little like being mildly electroshocked, like when you put your finger in an electrical outlet. It was an unpleasant sensation, though not quite painful, and <em>super </em>weird and cool-feeling.</p>\n<p>“Pull one off,” Layla said.</p>\n<p>It took me a few tries to latch onto one of the atoms, because they’re “slippery” (quotes because there is no word for what it felt like, but &#8220;slippery&#8221; gets the general idea across), and when I finally got one and pulled, there was a lot of resistance. When I pulled it, it dragged the adjacent atoms along with it, and the harder I pulled, the more ferociously and unpleasantly it vibrated. Finally it <em>snapped </em>free. I looked at my fist—<em>I had an atom.</em></p>\n<p>Layla smiled. “Cool right?”</p>\n<p>“<em>So </em>cool. Can I keep it?”</p>\n<p>“Sure good luck with that.”</p>\n<p>I was so awe-struck by so many things, I had forgotten how intensely confused I was.</p>\n<p>“Wait, so why did you <em>make</em> this?”</p>\n<p>She turned towards me. “As I said, because of the way time moves—”</p>\n<p>“Your world has been around a lot longer than ours.”</p>\n<p>“Yes. And <em>this</em> world we’re in now has been around a lot longer than <em>mine</em>. They know much more about everything than we do, and they can do things we can’t even begin to understand. The stuff they can do is so over our heads they can’t even <em>explain </em>it to us. And <em>we’re</em> that far ahead of <em>your</em> world.</p>\n<p>For a long time, as advanced as this world was, it relied on us to preserve our world for its own survival. It exists on a patch of dirt in our village. If our village were destroyed, they would be destroyed with it. But a while back, they worked out the technology for how to be <em>location independent</em>, which means they can move from wherever they are to any other place in the universe instantly.</p>\n<p>We don’t have that technology yet. We tried to learn from them, but we couldn’t grasp the fundamental ideas well enough to develop it ourselves. So we’re stuck in our location.”</p>\n<p>“In New York City?”</p>\n<p>“Yup. We migrated here in the 1800s when we determined it would be a good place to interface with your world, should the need ever arise. We’re also not the only people in our world. There are lots of villages like ours in different parts of the Earth. Once we connected with you, the others stopped broadcasting their location. There’s no reason for more than one of us to be revealed to your world.</p>\n<p>For most of time, Earth was a safe and stable home for our world. But over the last century, your world has been advancing exponentially in technology but remaining stagnant in wisdom. You’re rapidly gaining tremendous powers but still behaving like short-sighted primates. The voice of wisdom is there, but it’s being trampled over by political parties, religions, and nations too mired in blind conflict to lift their heads up and see the bigger picture.”</p>\n<p>“It’s funny you say that Layla. I’m actually writing a whole thing about—”</p>\n<p>“Oh I know. We did our research on everyone who lives in your vicinity so we’d know how to communicate with the person we brought to us if we caught someone’s attention. That’s why I’m speaking English and speaking in the odd way you do. Your little series is cute, even if it took us forever to read—but it will have limited effect. Your world is stubborn about growing up. And in the process of destroying yourselves, we believe you’ll destroy us as well.”</p>\n<p>“So you’re trying to kill us off with a pandemic.”</p>\n<p>“If we wanted to kill you off, you’d all be dead right now. It’s an option we hope we don’t have to use. We were once like you and we empathize with your struggle.</p>\n<p>We created this coronavirus to fall into a certain sweet spot—not damaging enough to destroy your world, but bad enough to cause a long and scary global crisis. Short of an alien attack, it is the one thing that could make all humans in your world feel like they’re on the same team against a common enemy. The first and most crucial step on the road to a long-lasting species is the epiphany that you truly are a single team, alone in a dark and dangerous universe. We’re hoping the virus can help push you in that direction.”</p>\n<p>“I feel like there was a better way to do this.”</p>\n<p>“We probably could have thought a little harder about it.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah cause it’s going pretty badly up there is the thing.”</p>\n<p>“Totes. Anyway, we couldn’t make the virus on our own. It’s hard enough to make something that small and complex that involves atomic and subatomic construction, but we wanted the virus to be <em>precisely</em> as harmful as it is. We needed help. The tier below us is less vulnerable to your world than we are, but for reasons I’m not entirely sure about, they also believe living in a multi-tiered ecosystem may be important in the future—so they share our interests. They agreed to build the virus for us.”</p>\n<p>“How did you manage to get the virus into our world?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s funny. You have to imagine it from our perspective. If you’re us, the world you’re planning to transform is a planet with nearly an <em>AU</em> diameter, full of <em>18-kilometer tall people</em>—people so tall, your world’s airplanes could accidentally fly into their belly buttons. Now imagine you’re standing on that planet, smaller than one of their dust mites, pinching between your fingers something the size of a grain of sand <em>on your scale</em>. You find your way onto one of these giants’ football-field-size teeth, and you <em>flick </em>the grain of sand into his kilometer-wide chasm of a mouth. And <em>that’s</em> supposed to change the trajectory of their future. It seems impossible.</p>\n<p>“And yet.”</p>\n<p>“And yet. With some very clever maneuvers, we flicked our little particle into the mouth of an unlucky giant, and it did the trick. By the way, we were dying when you blamed it on a <em>pangolin </em>of all things.”</p>\n<p>“He seemed guilty. I still don’t understand why you brought <em>me</em> down here.”</p>\n<p>“We weren’t originally planning to reveal any of this backstory to your world. But after watching things unfold for the first few weeks, we don’t see enough of the effect we were hoping for. Maybe if your world learns that there are other worlds out there—worlds that did manage to triumph in the wisdom game—it’ll empower the wise voices to stand up with a bit more courage in this struggle and in even greater challenges that lie ahead. It’s a long shot, but these are desperate times.”</p>\n<p>“I guess it’s worth a try. I’ll write a post explaining what I learned from you.”</p>\n<p>“And tweet out the post and send it out to your email list and stuff?”</p>\n<p>“Eh. Fine.”</p>\n<p>“Ready to go back up to your life? Only 23 seconds have passed there since you shrunk down.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah let’s do it.”</p>\n<p>Layla and I moved ourselves on top of the big metal oval.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to increase my size 10,000-fold and yours 100,000,000-fold, so you can go back home in one shot…which is a good thing because transporting up is even worse than transporting down.”</p>\n<p>“Great…”</p>\n<p>“Ready?”</p>\n<p>“I have one more question.”</p>\n<p>“Yes?”</p>\n<p>“How many tiers are there?” I asked.</p>\n<p>“No one knows for sure. The people on this atomic-level tier tell us they know of at least one tier below them, though they won’t tell us more than that. And no one seems to know about tiers above yours. Your world is thinking about that, with all your multiverse talk. We’re still working on that one too.”</p>\n<p>“If you ever figure it out, will you let me know?”</p>\n<p>“One thing at a time.”</p>\n<p>We touched our thumbs to the metal.</p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you like Wait But Why, sign up for the <a class=\"ClickPico\"><strong>email list</strong></a> and we’ll send you new posts right when they come out.</p>\n<p>To support Wait But Why, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy\"><strong>visit our Patreon page</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Posts:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As discussed, <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/why-bugs-ruin-everything.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>why bugs ruin everything</strong></span></a>.</p>\n<p>Another time <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html\"><strong>we transported ourselves</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/04/stick-figure-puzzle.html\"><strong>a puzzle</strong></a> for your quarantine.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/03/my-morning.html\">You Won&#8217;t Believe My Morning</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 21:50:20 +0000","feedId":382,"bgimg":"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FB.jpg","linkMd5":"1de598c0ef42e27a8eea7dff4448f099","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn35@2020_1/2020/08/16/19-23-57-784_e8dd3aa5016fe644.webp","metaImg":"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FB.jpg","destWidth":1500,"destHeight":785,"author":"Tim Urban"},{"createdTime":"2020-08-17 03:23:54","updatedTime":"2020-08-17 03:23:54","title":"The Thinking Ladder","link":"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8034","description":"<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><em>This is Chapter 7 in a blog series.

Our beliefs make up our perception of reality, they drive our behavior, and they shape our life stories. History happened the way it did because of what people believed in the past, and what we believe today will write the story of our future.</p> \n<p>So it seems like an important question to ask: Why do we actually come to believe the things we end up believing?</p> \n<p>To figure that out, we have to get good at seeing human thinking in 3D. By the time you finish Part 3, you’ll understand what I mean by that.</p> \n<p>For now, let’s get used to seeing in 2D. That’s our mission in this chapter.</p> \n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Seeing in 2D</strong></p> \n<p>The first dimension, as we’re defining dimensions, is the <em>What</em> of life. It’s what we see around us, what goes on in society, what people say and do, what they believe.</p> \n<p>Looking at everything in one dimension just shows us what’s on the surface of all these parts of reality. But when we lift the covers off the What of life and look at what lies beneath, we’re reminded that there’s a second dimension to everything as well.</p> \n<p>To see in 2D, we’re going to need x-ray goggles:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2-X-Ray-lens.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8035\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2-X-Ray-lens.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"569\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2-X-Ray-lens.png 796w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2-X-Ray-lens-580x600.png 580w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2-X-Ray-lens-768x795.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2-X-Ray-lens-725x750.png 725w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Without these goggles, we’d look at a human and just see this:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.1-non-x-ray-human.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8037\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/3.1-non-x-ray-human.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"290\" /></a></p> \n<p>That’s what a human looks like in one dimension.

With x-ray vision, we can see the inner psychology that lies behind the scenes of every human What.</p> \n<p>Quick review:</p> \n<p>As we discussed in <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/fire-light.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chapter 1</a>, the animal world is really a world of strands of genetic code, each in a never-ending quest for immortality. Animals are just the biological containers that genes use as temporary homes during this quest. And to control their containers, genes have their animals running on primitive automated software that I’m pretty sure looks a lot like this:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8039\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"240\" /></a></p> \n<p>The Primitive Mind in every animal—humans included—has been optimized to near perfection at getting animals to survive long enough to pass their precious genes along to new containers.</p> \n<p>Scientists aren’t positive about the timeline, but many believe that all humans in all parts of the world lived in hunter-gatherer tribes as recently as 11,000 BC. So 13,000 years ago—or, if we call a generation 25 years, about 500 generations ago.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4-500-generations-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8221\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4-500-generations-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1238\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4-500-generations-v2.png 2000w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4-500-generations-v2-600x371.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4-500-generations-v2-768x475.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/4-500-generations-v2-750x464.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></a></p> \n<p>500 generations isn’t enough time for evolution to take a shit. So the Primitive Mind—a hardwired part of us—is still stuck in the world of 11,000 BC. Which means we’re all like computers running on the highly unimpressive <em>Windows 11000 BC </em>operating system, and there’s no way to do a software update.</p> \n<p>But humans have something else going on as well—cognitive superpowers that combine together into an enhanced center of consciousness we’re calling the Higher Mind.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-HM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8041\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-HM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"221\" height=\"300\" /></a></p> \n<p>The Higher Mind and his magical thinking abilities helped the human species transform their typical animal hunter-gatherer world into undoubtedly the strangest of all animal habitats: an advanced civilization. The Higher Mind’s heightened awareness allows him to see the world with clear eyes, behave rationally in any environment, and adjust to changes in real time.</p> \n<p>So while our Primitive Minds are still somewhere in 11,000 BC, our Higher Minds are living right here with us in 2019. Which is why, even though both minds are just trying to do their jobs, they’re in a fight most of the time.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, the fights are about what’s best for us—a <strong>practical conflict.</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5.1-skittles.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8042\"

when the two minds agree on what’s important—i.e. they share a common value—but they disagree on the best way to get there. When you’re torn about whether to go for it with a Skittles binge or not, your two minds are actually in total agreement that physical health is of the utmost importance. But in 11,000 BC, where your Primitive Mind lives, there was no such thing as processed food, calories were hard to come by, and anything with a texture and taste as delectable as a Skittle was sure to be high in calories. In other words, everything the Primitive Mind knows tells it that binging on Skittles is the healthiest possible decision. Your Higher Mind, living in 2019, is extremely aware that eating 145 Skittles in a sitting is not the right health decision. And thus, your inner conflict.</p> \n<p>The same kind of practical conflict can also lead to a lot of fights about our fears.</p> \n<p><a

happens when two minds disagree on what’s important in the first place—a <strong>values conflict</strong>. A values conflict happens when the Higher Mind has a moral objection to something the Primitive Mind is programmed to want. Like, say, the way the Primitive Mind is programmed to try feverishly to deliver its precious genetic cargo to as large a variety of new containers as possible, at the expense of values like kindness, civility, professionalism, or marital fidelity. An inner values conflict is in progress anytime you’re coping with a moral qualm or integrity struggle.</p> \n<p>There’s also the reverse kind of values conflict—when the Higher Mind values something that the Primitive Mind is specifically programmed to <em>resist</em>—like, say, pitching in with housework or donating to charity.</p> \n<p>Humans are so complicated for a simple reason: we’re each <em>the product of a struggle</em> between two fundamentally different, often contradictory forces.</p> \n<p>This ongoing struggle of fire and light is like a constant tug-of-war in our heads—a tug-of-war over our thoughts, our emotions, our values, our morals, our judgments, and our overall consciousness.</p> \n<p>When we look through our x-ray glasses at someone whose Higher Mind is, at the moment, running the show, we see this:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.1-PM-HM-leash.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8061\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.1-PM-HM-leash-750x719.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"347\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.1-PM-HM-leash-750x719.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.1-PM-HM-leash-600x575.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.1-PM-HM-leash-768x736.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.1-PM-HM-leash.png 853w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px\" /></a></p> \n<p>With a prominent Higher Mind in total control, the Primitive Mind still makes a fuss, but the Higher Mind just yanks it back like a dog owner walking his dog.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.2-PM-HM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8062\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.2-PM-HM-750x453.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"549\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.2-PM-HM-750x453.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.2-PM-HM-600x363.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.2-PM-HM-768x464.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.2-PM-HM.png 1282w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" /></a></p> \n<p>But when the balance of power swings to the other side, the Primitive Mind is like an escaped zoo animal.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-D.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8063\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-D-750x475.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"507\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-D-750x475.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-D-600x380.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-D-768x486.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-D.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.3-PM-HM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8064\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.3-PM-HM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.3-PM-HM.png 1282w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.3-PM-HM-600x363.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.3-PM-HM-768x464.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/8.3-PM-HM-750x453.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The tug-of-war isn’t binary—it’s a spectrum.

The Higher Mind understands that primitive pleasures like sex, food, and all-in-good-fun tribalism like sports fandom are awesome, and often necessary, parts of a human life. And like a good pet owner, the Higher Mind is more than happy to let the Primitive Mind have its fun. Primitive bliss is great, as long as it’s being managed by the Higher Mind, who makes sure it’s done in moderation, done for the right reasons, and no one gets hurt.</p> \n<p>When we’re low on the Psych Spectrum, we’re short-sighted, we’re small-minded, we think and act with our pettiest emotions and our ego, we lack self-awareness, we’re short on compassion, high on hypocrisy—and because the Primitive Mind is an unconscious software program, we’re usually too foggy to see our own shittiness for what it is.</p> \n<p>Your Psych Spectrum position ebbs and flows throughout each day, each month, and each year of our lives, as we go through happy times and hard times, great days and terrible ones, good moods and crankiness. Even a single bad night’s sleep has the potential to lower you down the spectrum the next day. But if we could quantify all of your various states, it would yield a general average. We can call that average your “psych equilibrium.” Throughout our lives, as we grow and evolve psychologically, this equilibrium can change.<a id=\"grownups\"></a></p> \n<div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>Adults and Grown-Ups Blue Box</strong></p> \n <p>Let’s make an important language distinction: the difference between what it means to be an <em>adult </em>and what it means to be a <em>grown-up</em>. For our purposes, “adult” refers to our physical age, while “grown-up” refers to our <em>psychological </em>age. An adult is old. A grown-up is <em>wise</em>.</p> \n <p>Each of us accumulates wisdom with life experience, but only when our Higher Mind is the one doing the thinking can we tap into that wisdom. When our willpower and our consciousness succumb to ancient software, we revert to the worst version of ourselves.</p> \n <p>While the physical age pathway from child to adult is linear, steady, and the same for everyone, the pathway up this psychological spectrum is different for each of us. This is why we all know plenty of childish adults, as well as some surprisingly grown-up children.</p> \n <p>Unlike our physical age, wisdom isn’t evenly distributed inside of us—we all have parts of our lives where we’re good at being grown up, and others where we tend to struggle. Our wisdom gaps—the parts of our life where we tend to be less grown-up than we are adult—are the areas where we’re psychologically <em>stunted</em>.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9.1-adult-vs-grown-up-v2-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8392 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9.1-adult-vs-grown-up-v2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"461\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9.1-adult-vs-grown-up-v2-1.png 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9.1-adult-vs-grown-up-v2-1-600x574.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9.1-adult-vs-grown-up-v2-1-768x735.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9.1-adult-vs-grown-up-v2-1-750x718.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" /></a></p> \n <p>So the question isn’t <em>if </em>you’re psychologically stunted—the question is <em>where?</em></p> \n <p>Of course, like everything psychological, I’m sure nature plays a big role and we’re all born already prone to certain areas of psychological stunting, based on our genetic profile. But nurture is undoubtedly behind many of our Psych Spectrum struggles. I’m no psychologist, but thinking about my own mind and the minds of the people I know well, a few likely culprits come to mind:</p> \n <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">1) Areas of life where your parents are stunted. </span></strong>You know how sometimes you feel like your parents are super wise about life and you admire them for it, and other times you can’t believe how unwise they can be and you feel like you have to raise <em>them? </em>This is because wisdom is unevenly distributed in your parents too—they’re stunted just like everybody else, going through the same internal struggle. And the thing is, areas of stunting often run in the family—you’re likely stunted in many of the same areas where your parents drive you crazy. It’s just harder to see in yourself because it might manifest a little differently, and because it tends to be harder to see our own flaws than the flaws of others.</p> \n <p>Part of the reason stunting runs in the family is that children aren’t raised by their parents—they’re raised by their parents’ Higher Minds <em>and </em>by their parents’ Primitive Minds. In the areas of life where your parents tend to be wise, you were probably being raised mostly by a Higher Mind. So you learned to approach this part of life with <em>your</em> Higher Mind doing the thinking, and the habit usually sticks.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.1-stunted-comic.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8070\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.1-stunted-comic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"401\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.1-stunted-comic.png 647w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.1-stunted-comic-600x564.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" /></a> <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.2-stunted-comic-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8223\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.2-stunted-comic-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"530\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.2-stunted-comic-1.png 986w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.2-stunted-comic-1-150x150.png 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.2-stunted-comic-1-600x600.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.2-stunted-comic-1-768x768.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/10.2-stunted-comic-1-750x750.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" /></a></p> \n <p>On the other hand, the parts of life where your parent is a baby, you were raised by…a baby.

Thinking about an area of life through the lens of your Primitive Mind also becomes a habit—one that people can spend a lifetime trying to break, sometimes unsuccessfully. Wherever your parents were fearful, low integrity, petty, snobby, braggy, bratty, bigoted, jealous, cruel, entitled, uncompassionate, repressed, insecure, selfish, delusional, or any other form of foolish—those will be your psychological challenges in life. Those are the areas where you’ll be starting off from a psychologically primitive, unevolved place and where you’ll need to spend your energy and attention trying to grow.</p> \n <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">2) Areas of life where your Primitive Mind has gone through trauma. </span></strong>If at any point in your past, you were bullied, neglected, shamed, ridiculed, betrayed, out-grouped, abandoned, heartbroken, discriminated against, or profoundly let down, your Primitive Mind has gone through hell. Experiences like those are burned into the Primitive Mind’s memory, and if you never fully processed what happened, the trauma will remain an open wound in your psyche. Trauma to your Primitive Mind is a wound that only the Higher Mind can tend to, disinfect, bandage up, and begin to heal. And until that happens, the previous version of yourself—the age you were when the trauma occurred—will haunt you like a ghost. Like, say, if you were socially excluded in middle school and you never properly processed that nightmare. It’ll be 20 years later and at just the <em>hint </em>of being out-grouped in any situation, you’ll have a meltdown and find yourself acting like a child. The traumatized middle schooler will wake up and hijack your psyche, bringing your psychological age in that moment back down to middle school. The unprocessed pains of the past are vulnerable spots in your psyche where you may be prone to fall into the unconscious hands of the Primitive Mind.</p> \n <p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">3) Areas of life where your current environment is stoking the Primitive Mind.</span> </strong>Your current environment is made up of all the places you spend time, all the people you engage with, and the river of information that enters your brain from the external world. Your environment is constantly impressing itself upon you, and vice versa: when you speak or express yourself in any way, your environment reacts. This constant friction between you and your environment can have all kinds of effects on you—ranging from very positive to neutral to very negative. And certain parts of this relationship will inevitably stoke your Primitive Mind—a gossipy workplace, a tribalism-fueling news website, an unhealthy friendship, and plenty of other elements of our environment can regularly pull us downward on the Psych Spectrum.</p> \n <p>Upbringing, trauma, and environment don’t perfectly cover all the bases, but my own life experience tells me that they map pretty well onto someone’s psychological still-working-on-it list.</p> \n</div> \n<p>The challenge of human growth is outlined, for each of us, by our personal list of Psych Spectrum trouble areas. This list is why life will be hard. It’s why we’ll hurt others. It’s why we have regrets. It’s what stands in between us and the life we know we should be living. And it’s a list we’ll install right into our children (if we haven’t already), unless we put in the continual self-reflection and hard work to “raise ourselves” in the areas where our parents couldn’t.</p> \n<p>Most of the problems with humans can be boiled down to unchecked Primitive Minds getting their way against the Higher Mind’s better judgment. This is what’s behind chronic procrastination, chronic overeating, temper outbursts, infidelity, sexual assault, and all the other terrible things humans do to themselves and others. Back in the hunter-gatherer days, the Primitive Mind was mostly on point—but in the modern world, it’s our collective mental illness. And no one is immune.</p> \n<p>Back to our dimensions. So many of our problems today stem from the oversimplification of complicated phenomena in our discussions. Thinking about the real world in one dimension is usually a bad idea.</p> \n<p>For example, wealth in one dimension looks like this.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1-wealth.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8075\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1-wealth.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"120\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1-wealth.png 1521w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1-wealth-600x96.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1-wealth-768x123.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1-wealth-750x120.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /></a></p> \n<p>If you want to place blame for society’s ills, and you only have one dimension to work with, you’re left with the unnuanced option of blaming the rich, blaming the poor, blaming both, or blaming neither.</p> \n<p>But I came across this little visual recently:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1a-neuterthedebt-grid.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8076\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1a-neuterthedebt-grid.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1a-neuterthedebt-grid.jpg 599w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.1a-neuterthedebt-grid-239x130.jpg 239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" /></a></p> \n<p>This visual is imploring us to bring one-dimensional thinking into 2D. It’s taking the wealth spectrum and expanding it (with the axes switched) into something like this:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.2-wealth-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8399 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.2-wealth-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.2-wealth-v2.png 1850w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.2-wealth-v2-600x437.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.2-wealth-v2-768x560.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/11.2-wealth-v2-750x546.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Regardless of whether you agree with the specific viewpoint put forth in that other visual, adding a second dimension allows us to have a far more nuanced discussion about it.</p> \n<p>For the rest of this series, we’re going to apply one particular second dimension to everything we discuss: <strong>the Psych Spectrum. </strong></p> \n<p>The hard thing is, we’ve all been trained to think in only one dimension—in the <em>What </em>dimension. We look at people’s behavior, their words, their tendencies, their habits, their demeanor, their disposition—and we stop there. The Psych Spectrum adds the critical second dimension to the equation that asks <em>why </em>people act the way they do. When a cashier is rude to you, you can look at the situation in one dimension, judge them to be an asshole, and stop there. Or you can put your x-ray goggles on, see that their Primitive Mind is clearly pulling the strings in their head, and <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cashier-1024x512.jpg\">wonder why</a>. When you look at things in 2D, it doesn’t make sense to hate people who say or do shitty things, because it doesn’t make sense to hate the ancient pre-programmed survival software causing them to do so. In 2D, you see someone acting like an asshole as being “in the hands of the demon”—a demon that you know, looking at <em>yourself</em> in 2D, you fall into the hands of too, sometimes.</p> \n<p>Once you get this second dimension into your thinking, you’ll notice yourself applying it everywhere.

Most of us value both health and culinary pleasure—but whether or not we binge on Skittles is determined by which of those values carries the most weight in our heads in that moment.

It’s a direct correlation: the more access the Higher Mind has to truth, the brighter his light, and the wiser you are.</p> \n<p>Given that mission, and the understanding that the mission is incredibly hard and never complete—it’s only rational for the Higher Mind to be entirely humble about his perception of reality at any given moment and totally unattached to the ideas that make up that perception. He sees beliefs as nothing more than the most recent draft of an eternal work in progress, and as he lives more and learns more, nothing makes the Higher Mind happier than a chance to revise that inevitably flawed draft. Because when beliefs are being revised, it’s a signal of progress—of becoming less ignorant, less foolish, less delusional. A change of mind about something is a good sign that his light is getting brighter—and that’s all that matters to the Higher Mind.</p> \n<p>And how about the Primitive Mind?</p> \n<p>It’s intuitive why the Primitive Mind would object to marital fidelity—but what’s its problem with the Higher Mind’s approach to beliefs? Isn’t truth helpful to its genetic survival mission?</p> \n<p>Actually no, it’s not. Truth is mostly irrelevant to the Primitive Mind.</p> \n<p>The Primitive Mind’s beliefs are typically installed into its system early on in life, kind of like the way our immune system’s settings are initially configured by our environment. The “intellectual environment” that configures our Primitive Mind’s core beliefs is typically made up of the prevailing beliefs of our family and the broader community we grow up around. On the individual level, the Primitive Mind views those beliefs as a fundamental part of its person’s identity—and therefore about as sacred as the person’s arms or lungs or heart. On the group level, beliefs are the key node that wires its person into a larger giant, which—in the Primitive Mind’s ancient world—means being safe on the lifeboat. For reasons like these, the Primitive Mind puts beliefs into the same ultra-critical category as core biological needs.</p> \n<p>Given all of this, the last thing the Primitive Mind wants is for you to feel <em>humble </em>about your beliefs or interested in <em>revising</em> them. It wants you to treat your beliefs as sacred objects—as precious organs in your body or precious seats on a lifeboat. The Primitive Mind treats beliefs like it treats everything else—as nothing more than a means to the singular goal of genetic survival. To the Primitive Mind, the right beliefs are whatever will leave you with the strongest sense of identity and best fuse you with a large, powerful giant. An ever-evolving quest for truth is directly antithetical to these causes.</p> \n<p>So when it comes to beliefs, <strong>the Primitive Mind doesn’t want truth, it wants <em>confirmation</em>—of your existing beliefs.</strong></p> \n<p>So where does this inner conflict leave all of us? As fucking crazy people.</p> \n<p>To structure our little examination of our collective craziness, let’s divide the Psych Spectrum into four parts:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.1-ladder-segments.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8084\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.1-ladder-segments.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.1-ladder-segments.png 2023w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.1-ladder-segments-600x483.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.1-ladder-segments-768x618.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.1-ladder-segments-750x604.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>We can approximate each of these Psych Spectrum quartiles with a line—making our square into a Thinking Ladder with four rungs.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.2-ladder-rungs.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8085\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.2-ladder-rungs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.2-ladder-rungs.png 2023w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.2-ladder-rungs-600x483.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.2-ladder-rungs-768x618.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.2-ladder-rungs-750x604.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a>The Thinking Ladder is my favorite lens to use to think about thinking. For any given idea spectrum, you’ll find people on each of the four rungs. People on the same rung may disagree wildly with each other about <em>what</em> they think—i.e. they’ll be at different points <em>along </em>the rung—but what they’ll all have in common is a <em>way</em> of thinking, driven by a common intellectual motivation, at least when it comes to the topic at hand. Most of us are in the habit of dividing people up by what they think—by <em>where they stand </em>on a topic. Our goal here is to shine a spotlight on <em>how</em> people think and learn to categorize people that way instead.</p> \n<p>So let’s explore each of these rungs, starting by looking at how thinking works at the top of the Psych Spectrum—where the Higher Mind is in full control—and then working our way down the rungs, until we finish up at the intellectual slums at the bottom.<a id=\"scientist\"></a></p> \n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Rung 1: Thinking Like a Scientist</strong></p> \n<p>Meet the Scientist:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.3-ladder-SCI.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8086\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.3-ladder-SCI.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.3-ladder-SCI.png 2023w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.3-ladder-SCI-600x483.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.3-ladder-SCI-768x618.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.3-ladder-SCI-750x604.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>This is who you are in moments when your Higher Mind is in charge of your thinking.

It has to do with your thinking process.</p> \n<p>We often think of science as the study of the natural world, but in the words of Carl Sagan,&nbsp;“Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.”</p> \n<p>Science is a way of thinking. A means of thinking. A&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;<em>process, </em>designed to do one thing: find truth.</p> \n<p>When you’re high up on the Psych Spectrum, the Higher Mind’s core intellectual value—truth—will be in the top section of your Values Stack. And the Primitive Mind’s core intellectual value—confirmation of your existing beliefs—will be toward the very bottom.

When you’re thinking like a Scientist, there’s little doubt where the nail goes.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19.1-means-ends-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8089\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/19.1-means-ends-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"333\" /></a></p> \n<p>Things are simple up on the top rung: your intellectual mission is to take your existing beliefs, or lack thereof (Point A) and use your thinking process to move towards beliefs that are a little closer to the truth (Point B).

He knows that even a viewpoint you’re pretty sure you disagree with, from a person you’re pretty sure you don’t like, can teach you something. It may not end up changing your mind, but learning about the way that person thinks is information in itself.

And if the only means of assessment is to verify the truth of it yourself, you’re not saving much time.</p> <p>That’s why perhaps the most important skill of a savvy thinker is learning how to dole out <em>trust</em>.</p> <p>Trust, when assigned wisely, is an efficient knowledge-acquisition trick. If you’re able to trust someone who actually speaks the truth, and you accept what they say as truth, you’ve taken the knowledge they worked hard for—either through their own primary research or indirectly, using their own carefully designed trust criteria—and essentially photocopied it into your own brain.</p> <p>Without trust, knowledge is limited to a tiny dataset of personal experience. Raise infant Einstein in the forest with no information and then tell him to invent the best weapon he can, and he won’t get anywhere <em>near </em>the bow and arrow. But start Einstein off standing atop a knowledge skyscraper and he can outline how general relativity works. Communication, plus trust, is a magical intellectual corner-cutting tool—and it’s the reason humanity has been able to accumulate a skyscraper of collective knowledge over the past 10,000 years that has led a species of forest primates to understand the origins of the universe.</p> <p>But trust, when applied wrongly, does the exact opposite. When we trust information to be true that isn’t, we end up with the <em>illusion </em>of knowledge—which is far worse than having no knowledge at all.</p> <p>The fact is, almost all the learning you’ve done in your life has flowed into you through a trust channel presided over by your Belief Bouncer. But what matters far more than the quantity of your cumulative learning is the <em>quality—</em>the legitimacy—of what you’ve learned. And the quality of your knowledge is a function of how good your Belief Bouncer is at assigning trust.</p> <p>In a way, learning is kind of like running a business and knowledge is like the cash you collect. Accepting bad information as truth is like accepting a customer’s payment in Monopoly money without realizing it. You can build a great business and work hard for decades running it, but if 90% of your income has been counterfeit Monopoly money, you’re still a terrible businessperson.</p> <p>It’s easy to see that Monopoly money is fake, but Monopoly knowledge often looks exactly like real knowledge to the untrained eye, so our knowledge economy is currently infested with counterfeit information.</p> <p>To do his critically important job, your Belief Bouncer needs to master the art of <em>skepticism.</em></p> <p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The Skepticism Spectrum</strong></p> <p>The truth-seeker’s goal is to hone in on a <em>skepticism sweet spot</em>—something we can visualize on a Skepticism Spectrum.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25.1-Skepticism-Spectrum.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8104\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25.1-Skepticism-Spectrum.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"141\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25.1-Skepticism-Spectrum.png 1672w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25.1-Skepticism-Spectrum-600x113.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25.1-Skepticism-Spectrum-768x144.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25.1-Skepticism-Spectrum-750x141.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>The Skepticism Spectrum is a filter whose settings can be adjusted to make the filter stricter or looser. The sweet spot is the filter’s optimal setting—just tight enough to consistently identify and weed out bullshit; just open enough to let in the truth and take full advantage of the magical corner-cutting of adopting the real knowledge of others as your own.</p> <p>Move to the left of the sweet spot on the spectrum, where the filter is looser, and you begin to allow some bullshit to flow into your beliefs. Move even farther left and your beliefs become packed with a jumble of falsehoods, misconceptions, and contradictions. Moving to the <em>right</em> of the sweet spot tightens the filter too much, like a business owner so worried about accidentally accepting Monopoly money that they end up turning down real money too. Go way to the right and you’ll stop believing the moon landing happened.</p> <p>To be a healthy eater, you need to find the food intake sweet spot—too lenient a “Food Bouncer” and you eat a ton of junk food, too strict a bouncer and you starve. Being a healthy thinker works the same way. Both gullibility and paranoia, especially as you move farther away from the sweet spot, cripple your ability to be a healthy thinker. When you’re being gullible, contradictions become a nightmare for you. You read Opinion A on a topic and you’re sold, adopting it into your beliefs. Then you read Opinion B, which says Opinion A is wrong, and you’re sold on <em>that</em>. With wildly contradicting viewpoints jostling over your beliefs, you end up withdrawing from the topic, feeling like you’re just not capable of understanding it. On the other side, when you’re being paranoid, everything you hear comes along with a little asterisk that says, “don’t be a chump—they’re probably trying to manipulate you.” You refrain from adding almost anything to your knowledge bank. In both cases, learning stalls.</p> <p>Both gullibility and paranoia are a sign of a lack of confidence in your own judgment of who and what is trustworthy. The key skill that’s missing is the ability to accurately separate the real from the skewed from the misleading from the totally incorrect. If you can’t judge incoming information, you can’t take advantage of the critical tool of indirect knowledge.</p> <p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The Rung Rating: A Trust Shortcut</strong></p> <p>Effective thinkers, usually without consciously realizing it, develop an internal trust rating system for friends, journalists, politicians, media brands, institutions, and any other source of information. Like an intellectual credit score.</p> <p>We’ll call this credit score a Rung Rating—because what they’re really evaluating is which rung of our Thinking Ladder the source is “thinking from.”</p> <p>A good trust rating system adds even more efficiency to the knowledge acquisition process, saving the Belief Bouncer the heavy lifting of having to evaluate every piece of incoming info on its own merits. We have an internal trust rating system in our heads for the food we eat. If you trust a certain grocery store or food brand or restaurant, you can save the time of carefully scanning ingredients before every bite. The Rung Rating works the same way.</p> <p>On top of being an efficient time-saver for acquiring info from trusted sources, it’s a trick that allows you to gain real knowledge from <em>less</em>-than-healthy information as well. If I know that a particular source, on Topic X-Y, tends to be strongly pro-X and a bit biased against Y, but they also have shown to be reasonably concerned with truth, I can accept their views about X or Y as real information, as long as they’re taken with the proper grain of salt. Depending on the magnitude and direction of their bias, I can apply just the right size and flavor salt grain to their views. If they say something good about X, I can consider that point but know I need to verify it myself, since their historical bias in favor of X means this is just a default statement for them. Same for a negative statement about Y. On the other hand, if they say something <em>good</em> about Y, their historically anti-Y bias makes this <em>very</em> meaningful information that I can probably accept right off the bat.</p> <p>To get anywhere as a thinker, you need to start with the right puzzle pieces. The Attention Bouncer and Belief Bouncer, through a team effort, are in charge of getting you those pieces. If they’re doing their job, the super-VIP club of your beliefs ends up populated by a large array of useful information—and you’re ready to get puzzling.</p> <p style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Forming a Hypothesis, Component 3: Puzzling Together a Hypothesis</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20.5-Scientific-Method-sci-hyp-formation-3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8105\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20.5-Scientific-Method-sci-hyp-formation-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"348\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20.5-Scientific-Method-sci-hyp-formation-3.png 801w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20.5-Scientific-Method-sci-hyp-formation-3-477x600.png 477w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20.5-Scientific-Method-sci-hyp-formation-3-768x966.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20.5-Scientific-Method-sci-hyp-formation-3-596x750.png 596w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px\" /></a></p> <p>In the center of the beliefs region of your mind, your Puzzler starts putting pieces of information together.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/27.1-puzzler-building.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8106\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/27.1-puzzler-building.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/27.1-puzzler-building.png 914w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/27.1-puzzler-building-600x343.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/27.1-puzzler-building-768x439.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/27.1-puzzler-building-750x429.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></a></p> <p>Your Puzzler knows that the two bouncers guarding his laboratory have done a ton of listening to others, and his job is to now block out all of that noise and build his puzzle using nothing other than rationality and the info already in your head.</p> <p>When you reason from first principles, you’ll often come to conclusions that conflict with your pre-existing beliefs or with conventional wisdom.

They feel sure they’re right about an opinion they’ve never had to defend—an opinion that has never stepped into a ring.</p> <p>A belief or opinion you haven’t tested isn’t knowledge, it’s wannabe knowledge—i.e. a hypothesis.

No matter how fine-tuned your Rung Rating filter system is, it’s sure to mess up sometimes and let falsehood toxins find their way into your hypothesis. You’re also wary of your own biases and the inevitable stubbornness of your own worldview. This is why dissent is so critical for every Scientist. Dissent is the truth-seeker’s immune system. If your hypothesis is a machine, things like biased reasoning, oversimplification, and misleading statistics are its glitches and bugs, and a feisty dissenter to the hypothesis is like a technician searching for those flaws, which helps make it a better machine.

Your hypothesis is starting to get some serious <em>gauntlet cred</em>.</p> <p>The gauntlet isn’t kind to most ideas, because most ideas are flawed. And when your hypothesis is flawed, some time in the gauntlet watching it get its ass kicked will <em>lower </em>the conviction you feel and convince you that you need to go back to the drawing board.

When you’re thinking like a Scientist, it means the Higher Mind is strong in your head, and it lights you up with clarity and self-awareness. High self-awareness means that when you look in the mirror, you see yourself as you are—a flawed thinker with endless potential to learn.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/37.1-mirror-sci.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8133\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/37.1-mirror-sci.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"377\" /></a></p> <p>Clear self-awareness helps you keep an eye on the Primitive Mind and stay aware of your own cognitive pitfalls—because you know that your brain was designed for survival, not truth, and it’s wise to be wary of your own intuition. As you learn and ponder, self-awareness helps you resist your brain’s urge to save mental energy and oversimplify a complex topic. It helps you remember to think in spectrums despite an instinct to think in binary black-and-white. It helps you force yourself to parse slightly different versions of similar ideas instead of more conveniently grouping ideas together and labeling them as a single thing. It helps you keep putting in the effort to search for the nuance. Because a Scientist knows that the truth is always buried somewhere in the wrinkles of nuance, and that a satisfying, clean-cut, one-sided viewpoint is almost always wrong or incomplete. Looking in the mirror helps you keep an eye on your <em>own</em> Rung Rating as you do your thinking.</p> <p>So you manage to stay pretty close to the tightrope, working your way somewhere up here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/36.5-2x2-Sci.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8136 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/36.5-2x2-Sci.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"459\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/36.5-2x2-Sci.png 862w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/36.5-2x2-Sci-590x600.png 590w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/36.5-2x2-Sci-768x781.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/36.5-2x2-Sci-737x750.png 737w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px\" /></a></p> <p>Your little hypothesis has gone through hell and come out on the other side as <em>knowledge</em>.</p> <p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/38.2-hypothesis-_-knowledge.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8138\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/38.2-hypothesis-_-knowledge.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"431\" height=\"335\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/38.2-hypothesis-_-knowledge.png 606w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/38.2-hypothesis-_-knowledge-600x466.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px\" /></a></p> <p>There’s just one more thing to do.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/38.3-hypothesis-_-knowledge.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8139\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/38.3-hypothesis-_-knowledge.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"474\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/38.3-hypothesis-_-knowledge.png 684w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/38.3-hypothesis-_-knowledge-600x428.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" /></a></p> <p>Top-rung thinkers know themselves, their peers, and history well enough to know that all human intellect is fallible. In the actual science world, even the most tried and true hypothesis will be treated not as ultimate truth, but as a&nbsp;<em>theory</em>. Scientists max out at “theory” because they know that all beliefs are falsifiable and subject to be proven wrong by changing times or new evidence. Thinking works the same way—in order to continually claim a hypothesis to be “knowledge,” it must survive continued testing and scrutiny.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> <p>If all of this sounds a bit exhausting, that’s because it is.</p> <p>The Scientist’s learning process is exhausting because knowledge is hard. Because truth is hard. Which is why people who tend to think like Scientists are more than happy to say “I don’t know” most of the time. They’re lazy like anyone else—the thing that makes them Scientists isn’t that they’re necessarily obsessive learners, but that they’re realistic about what developing real, independent, informed viewpoints entails, and they’re honest with themselves and others about what they know and what they don’t.</p> <p>But for today at least, you’ve gone hard enough at this to establish a solid, independent viewpoint that you can feel confident about—and you’ve done it the Scientist way.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> <p>I recently attended a conference for scientists (actual, science scientists). I’m not a scientist, but I’m a curious person, and I often write about science, so I had a delightful time spending the whole conference cornering scientists and grilling them on questions I’ve had but haven’t been able to answer.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8034#footnote-4-8034\" id=\"note-4-8034\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8034#footnote-5-8034\" id=\"note-5-8034\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8034#footnote-6-8034\" id=\"note-6-8034\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8034#footnote-7-8034\" id=\"note-7-8034\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> I also often write about how scientists <em>think</em>, and at one point, standing in a circle with about four scientists, I talked about how much I admire the way scientists think—their humility, their pure motivations, their willingness to admit they’re wrong when new evidence changes their conclusions.&nbsp;</p> <p>They all burst out laughing. One of them said, “Have you <em>met </em>scientists?”&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the thing about humans. We’re so bad at thinking like Scientists that even <em>scientists </em>are bad at thinking like Scientists. Because no matter who you are, inside your mind is a powerful little primitive fuzzball.</p> <p>Above, when you were thinking like a Scientist, the conditions in your head were pristine. The Higher Mind was doing the thinking while the Primitive Mind lay mostly dormant. We’re all there sometimes, when we’re being our best selves—when we’re thinking like pros.</p> <p>But truth is a fragile motive. And at some point, without you realizing it, something changes. It’s a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Sometimes, a topic you’re thinking about jolts your Primitive Mind awake because it believes, for some reason, that holding a certain viewpoint on this topic is important for your survival—often because the topic has become tangled up with your identity. Sometimes, the Primitive Mind has activated for some unrelated reason, which infiltrates your mind with one or more of its standard emotions—fear, pride, anger, ego—and this then affects your thinking, bringing your intellect down closer to its level.</p> <p>Whatever the cause, on our journey down the ladder today, the Primitive Mind has entered the picture. The Higher Mind is still the more powerful character, but now he’s got competition.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-B.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8140\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-B.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"472\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-B.png 1317w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-B-600x433.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-B-768x554.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-PM-HM-leash-B-750x541.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" /></a></p> <p>The Primitive Mind’s involvement has compromised your ability to think from the very top rung—you’ve dropped down to Rung 2.

Psychologists call it “motivated reasoning.” I like to think of as Reasoning While Motivated—the thinking equivalent of drunk driving. Sent-ts’an explains:</p> <p><em>If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against. The struggle between “for” and “against” is the mind’s worst disease.</em> – Sent-ts’an, c. 700 AD</p> <p>When you’re thinking like a Sports Fan, Sent-ts’an and his apostrophe <em>and</em> his hyphen are all mad at you, because they know what they’re about to see—the Scientist’s rigorous due process of thinking, corrupted by the truth-seeker’s most treacherous obstacle:</p> <p>Confirmation bias.</p> <p>Confirmation bias, one of the most common impairments caused by Reasoning While Motivated, is why people see perfection in their brand new romantic relationships, and why people are so often nauseated by exes they once adored. It’s why socially paranoid people <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/long-email-delay.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freak out</a> when someone takes too long to respond to their email. It’s why overconfident artists can hear ten lukewarm reactions to their art and one effusive one and see the single exception as evidence of their greatness—and why other insecure artists do the exact opposite. It’s why conspiracy theorists see evidence of their conspiracies everywhere.</p> <p>Our x-ray goggles remind us what’s going on here: While the Higher Mind is all about the How You Think axis—about the integrity of the <em>process</em> of thinking—the Primitive Mind is the opposite: it cares only about <em>what</em> you think—about your x-axis position. Because the two minds’ intellectual goals—truth and confirmation—are in direct conflict, it’s a zero-sum situation. When the Primitive Mind enters the equation and captures a piece of your mindset, it inherently draws some of your integrity <em>away </em>from the Higher Mind’s principles. Confirmation rising up in your Values Stack also means truth moving down.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/40.1-Values-Stack-SF-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8144\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/40.1-Values-Stack-SF-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"250\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/40.1-Values-Stack-SF-v2.png 2400w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/40.1-Values-Stack-SF-v2-600x200.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/40.1-Values-Stack-SF-v2-768x256.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/40.1-Values-Stack-SF-v2-750x250.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a>Truth being lowered a bit in your Values Stack moves it out of sacred, nailed-in territory and into the important-but-not-totally-sacred area, where values are fastened in a less rock-solid way—let’s say, with a thumbtack.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/41.1-means-ends-SF.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8145\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/41.1-means-ends-SF.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/41.1-means-ends-SF.png 695w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/41.1-means-ends-SF-600x204.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" /></a></p> <p>At the same time, confirmation has moved <em>up</em> from the unimportant area of your Values Stack—where values swing freely, totally at the whim of the more important values above—to the <em>somewhat important</em> tier.

Back in my 20s, I suffered through a reasonable amount of <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/secretly-hate-bars.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hellish nightlife</a>—and a common experience was waiting in line outside some dark, loud, nightmarish weekend night bar while groups of women would walk up and gain immediate entry, without waiting in line. If I were with a group that was too guy heavy, we might get all the way to the front only to not be let in at all.</p> <p>When you’re thinking like a Sports Fan, your Attention Bouncer treats information that concurs with your existing opinion like a group of young, attractive women. And he treats info that weakens your existing views like a large, unappealing group of bros. Wary of letting your mind turn into a sausage fest, he plays favorites.</p> <p>When favoritism happens in the realm of ideas, we call it <strong>cherry-picking.</strong></p> <p>According to the internet, the origin of the term has to do with actual cherry-picking. Imagine you’re a very rich person who owns a huge estate, and one day you’re bored as shit so you call your servant into the room and tell him you’d like to get a sense of what the cherry harvest is like this year in your orchard. But you’re also hungry, so you order the servant not to <em>tell </em>you how the cherries are looking but to actually bring you a<em> representative sampling</em> of the cherries in your orchard.</p> <p>If you were thinking on the Scientist rung of the ladder, you’d leave the instructions at that. Your servant would count the cherries in the orchard and collect a sampling like this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.1-cherry-picking-sci.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8149\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.1-cherry-picking-sci.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"404\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.1-cherry-picking-sci.png 916w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.1-cherry-picking-sci-600x593.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.1-cherry-picking-sci-768x759.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.1-cherry-picking-sci-750x741.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></a></p> <p>But if you were thinking from the Sports Fan’s rung, you might add in one extra comment while issuing the command: “…and it will upset me greatly if my cherries aren’t having a good year. I look forward to learning how well they’re doing.”</p> <p>So now, the servant heads out to the orchard with the same plan—to pick a representative sampling. But with your last comment ringing in his ears, he finds himself not really <em>counting</em> the cherries but more <em>eyeballing</em> them. And when he picks his sampling, it comes out like this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.2-cherry-picking-SF.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8151\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.2-cherry-picking-SF.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.2-cherry-picking-SF.png 916w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.2-cherry-picking-SF-600x593.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.2-cherry-picking-SF-768x759.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/44.2-cherry-picking-SF-750x741.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p> <p>As a Rung 2 thinker, you still want to know what’s actually happening out in the world—you’re just nudging the results a little. And that’s what you did here in the info gathering phase, with your Attention Bouncer as the servant.

They’re taking psychology classes, they’re learning about experimental methods, so they’re given a study. It looks like it’s from the Journal of Science. They’re asked to critique the methods. And the study seems to show that caffeine consumption is associated with breast cancer. And their job now is to read the study and say what they think of the methods.</em></p> <p><em>Well, who do you think finds a lot of flaws in that study? Who do you think? Coffee drinkers! And do you think all coffee drinkers are trying to find flaws in the study? </em>Women<em> who drink coffee are desperately saying, “Must I believe it? Must I believe it? What could possibly be wrong,” and they find all kinds of things wrong with it. The others say, “Oh gosh, okay, I didn’t know that.”</em></p> <p>Reasoning While Motivated caused the exact people who were most upset about the study’s results to reason differently, and less accurately, than the rest of the participants—because it literally changes what goes on in our brain. An MIT study used actual fMRI data to see what was going on with motivated reasoning, and they found that “motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning when people do not have a strong emotional stake in the conclusions reached.”<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8034#footnote2-3-8034\" id=\"note2-3-8034\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a> Kinda like how drunk driving is qualitatively distinct from sober driving.</p> <p>We could also return to the story of smoking in the US that we discussed in Part 2 and see the same exact phenomenon.

When the match is over, you usually end up feeling like your hypothesis passed the test with flying colors—even in cases when an objective observer would see it the opposite way.</p> <p>At the end of all of this, it’s no surprise when you end up right at that shiny green Point B.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/55.1-end-at-point-B.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8168\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/55.1-end-at-point-B.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"401\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/55.1-end-at-point-B.png 992w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/55.1-end-at-point-B-600x575.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/55.1-end-at-point-B-768x735.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/55.1-end-at-point-B-750x718.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" /></a></p> <p>Your road to Point B was easier this time.

The Higher Mind still has the edge in the Sports Fan’s mind, which is why the Sports Fan, motivated as they are, still goes to such great pains to try to go through all the steps of the thinking process. The Sports Fan <em>gets</em> that the scientific method is incredibly important—they’re just not great at working through it effectively.</p> <p>But the Higher Mind will be a nagging voice of self-doubt in the Sports Fan’s head, and at least some of the time, the Sports Fan can reluctantly acknowledge that they’re wrong. Watching their favorite team play, a real-life sports fan’s eye may be biased, but when a slow-motion replay clearly shows that the opposing team was in bounds and got both feet down, they will grudgingly concede that it was the right call—in the end, if the dissent is strong enough, the Sports Fan’s views are falsifiable. Deep down, when push comes to shove, the integrity of the game matters most to the Sports Fan—because underneath all the haze of cognitive bias, Sports Fans are still real thinkers.</p> <p>This is why a lot of Sports Fans end up on a <a href=\"https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dunning-Kruger</a>-type path, where the Higher Mind eventually prevails and the Sports Fan starts thinking more like a Scientist.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-2x2-SF-D-K.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8172\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-2x2-SF-D-K.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"494\" height=\"503\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-2x2-SF-D-K.png 862w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-2x2-SF-D-K-590x600.png 590w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-2x2-SF-D-K-768x781.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/56.2-2x2-SF-D-K-737x750.png 737w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\" /></a></p> <p>When the scientists I talked to at that conference laughed and asked me, “Have you <em>met </em>scientists?” I think they were probably referring to the fact that scientists, like almost all good thinkers, often drift down a rung and think like Sports Fans. Sports Fans are imperfect Scientists—Scientists who have, at least in a particular moment or on a particular topic, fallen off the thinking wagon and let their Primitive Mind get the best of them.

Yes, you’ve begun Reasoning While Motivated, but you’ve only had a couple drinks at the motivation bar and your Higher Mind is still in near-total control.</p> <p>But as you drift down the Psych Spectrum, the influence of the Primitive Mind becomes more and more prominent. Your feet get stickier on the x-axis, as it becomes increasingly difficult for even the strongest dissenting evidence to move your beliefs. As the smoke clouding your reason gets thicker, your self-awareness dulls.

The opposing attorney presents an opposing arrow that leads to the opposite Point B. This completes the picture, allowing the jury to decide which of the two arrows is more legit-seeming and which Point B seems more like the truth.

Your Attention Bouncer no longer needs to put in much thought or effort to supply you with information—you’ve made his life easy.</p> <p>Attorney-style cherry-picking explains why there are so many situations where opposing sides of an argument can, simultaneously, be <em>absolutely positive </em>they’re right. When you’re low enough on the How You Think ladder, you stop being aware of the fact that cherry-picking is even a thing, so to you, it seems like <em>clearly, all the evidence shows that I’m right. </em>We see this everywhere.&nbsp;Like, for example, two ideologically opposed media platforms presenting the same exact news story but picking totally different cherries to present, so the parties presented as heroes and villains, victims and perpetrators, are literally reversed in their tellings.</p> <p>There are plenty of less-charged examples as well. Want to believe that coffee, wine, chocolate, saturated fat, or red meat are healthy? Just type into Google the name of that item, along with “surprisingly healthy.” Cherry-picking has you covered. Want to believe they’re all terrible for you? Ask Google if they’re “harmful” or “unhealthy” to eat. Either way, you’ll come out of your search even more sure of what you came in wanting to believe.&nbsp;</p> <p>Your Attention Bouncer is also less intent on collecting first principles puzzle pieces than he was on the higher rungs and more content to collect pre-packaged arguments in the form of op-eds and other external opinions. When you’re looking for confirmation first and foremost, nothing is more efficient than information in a “here is why you are right” format.</p> <p>Your Belief Bouncer’s new assignment is just as easy. When assessing which info is valid, instead of the super difficult job of checking IDs for truth, he now only has to check IDs for content.</p> <p>When a piece of imported info jibes with what you already believe, the bouncer opens the door wide.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/64.1-Skepticism-Spectrum-ATT.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8183\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/64.1-Skepticism-Spectrum-ATT.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"303\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/64.1-Skepticism-Spectrum-ATT.png 1735w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/64.1-Skepticism-Spectrum-ATT-600x242.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/64.1-Skepticism-Spectrum-ATT-768x310.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/64.1-Skepticism-Spectrum-ATT-750x303.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>Info that suggests you might be wrong is seen as malicious and manipulated and consistently shut out by a skepticism filter so tight nothing could ever get through it.

When you think you already know the truth, then by definition, someone who agrees with you is right and someone who doesn’t is wrong. Instead of asking, “How did they get to this idea?” your Belief Bouncer now simply asks: “Are they enlightened?”</p> <p>In such rapid “bias motion” yourself, anyone who disagrees with you, objective or biased, appears to you to be a terrible thinker. A surefire sign that you’re thinking like an Attorney is when you believe—really believe, in your heart—that the people who disagree with you are not just wrong, but wrong because of who they are—fundamentally bad thinkers—despite having a relatively small amount of experience getting to know them.</p> <p>When you’re thinking like an Attorney and Reasoning While Obligated, your two-bouncer immune system is totally disabled. Your beliefs end up filled with a combination of real information and Monopoly-money junk—and you no longer have the ability to tell one from the other.</p> <p>The good news is, it’s not important. Knowing what’s true and what’s not only matters when you’re actually trying to get to the truth—and your goal has now shifted to confirmation. So in the center of your mind, your Puzzler gets to work. The preferred conclusion at the periphery of the Sports Fan’s consciousness has now been moved front and center, and your Puzzler uses it as a guide, like the image on the box cover of a jigsaw puzzle.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/65.1-puzzler-building-ATT.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8185\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/65.1-puzzler-building-ATT.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/65.1-puzzler-building-ATT.png 914w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/65.1-puzzler-building-ATT-600x360.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/65.1-puzzler-building-ATT-768x460.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/65.1-puzzler-building-ATT-750x450.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></a></p> <p>Where Scientists have to painstakingly paint, Attorneys can mindlessly trace.</p> <p>Often, the main activity for your Puzzler is simple memorization. Rather than focus on raw first principles, the bouncers have imported mostly second-hand arguments by others, and memorizing them will feel to you like gaining knowledge. You simply adopt as your own viewpoints the most legit-sounding arguments made by others who agree with you, and you’re good to go.</p> <p>When you do decide to dig in a bit more and form some of your own conclusions, your Attorney process has you covered with all kinds of clever tricks involving trends and anecdotes, correlation and causation, sneakily worded statistics, and more (we’ll get into all of that in later chapters).</p> <p>If someone really wants to believe just about <em>anything—</em>that&nbsp;the Earth is flat, that 9/11 was orchestrated by Americans, that everyone hates them, that everyone loves them, that the CIA is after them—the human brain will have no problem using the large toolbox of Attorney tricks to make that belief seem perfectly clear and irrefutable.</p> <p>When you’re thinking like an Attorney, the Hypothesis Formation stage is really just a belief-strengthening process. You inevitably end up with the same viewpoints you started with, now beefed up with a refreshed set of facts and arguments that remind you just how right you are. You’ve constructed an arrow that does the trick.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/66.1-A-_-B-constructed-arrow-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8186\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/66.1-A-_-B-constructed-arrow-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"301\" height=\"297\" /></a></p> <p style=\"font-size:30px\"><strong>Testing your hypothesis, Attorney style</strong></p> <p>In the testing phase, though you’re far less eager to seek out dissent to challenge your beliefs, your manufactured arrow to Point B has you ready to argue with anyone who tries to crack your conviction. You’re ready for the testing phase, because you know you’re invincible.</p> <p>Your argument has nothing to worry about, because in order for dissent to generate doubt, you have to thoughtfully listen to and consider the dissent—and you won’t do either. For every argument that comes your way, you’ll listen only enough to pick out the best argument against it from your arsenal. Usually you’ll simply be reciting the words of one of the opinion pieces you imported. If someone does come at you with an argument you can’t seem to beat, you’ll again reach into your arsenal of dirty tricks.</p> <p>Your refusal to really listen to or consider anything a dissenter says, compounded with your bag of trump card tricks, and topped off with your unbreakable conviction that you’re right, will ensure that you’re an absolutely infuriating person to argue with. Your opponents will feel like they’re arguing against a brick wall, and by the end, it’ll be clear to them that nothing they could have said—nothing whatsoever—could have made you say “hmm that’s a good point—I need to think about that—maybe I’m wrong.” That’s what it feels like to argue with someone who lives in Unfalsifiable Land.</p> <p>The Scientist watches their ideas box as an objective spectator. The Sports Fan watches with a rooting interest. The Attorney watches boxing matches from the middle of the ring, as the corrupt ref who has fixed the match’s outcome from the moment it begun.</p> <p>Let’s bring back our scientific method of knowledge acquisition for a second.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20-Scientific-Method.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8092\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20-Scientific-Method.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"278\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20-Scientific-Method.png 2731w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20-Scientific-Method-600x209.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20-Scientific-Method-768x267.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20-Scientific-Method-750x261.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></strong></p> <p>High-rung thinkers go through this arduous process because they know that knowledge is hard.

You think your mind is full of original viewpoints based on real, hard knowledge. You come out of those fixed-match arguments believing that you crushed it. If the argument was frustrating, you probably attribute it, ironically, to your <em>opponent</em> being a brick wall to argue with, and the kind of person who just can’t admit when they’re wrong.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8034#footnote-8-8034\" id=\"note-8-8034\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> <p>This is the power of human delusion. A delusional feat of this magnitude—to leave you filled with a level of conviction you have absolutely no ground to feel—is usually a tag-team effort between two types of delusion:</p> <p><strong>1) A distorted view of yourself. </strong>When you look in the mirror, instead of seeing a dramatically flawed thinker, the Primitive Mind’s thick smoke shows you a model intellectual.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/37.3-mirror-ATT.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8189\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/37.3-mirror-ATT.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"253\" height=\"380\" /></a></strong></p> <p><strong>2) A distorted view of the world. </strong>When you’re clear-headed and thinking like a Scientist, you’re well aware that both the world and the people in it are impossibly complex and nuanced and messy. This fact keeps you humble about what you know, no matter how much you’ve learned. But when you’re thinking like an Attorney, the same consciousness-clouding fog that lowers your self-awareness also distorts your vision of the world around you. While the Scientist’s <em>clear </em>vision shows them a complex, foggy world, the Attorney’s <em>foggy</em> vision shows them a world that’s straightforward, full of crisp lines and black-and-white distinctions. As your intellect works its way down the ladder, fuzzy spectrums sharpen into clean, binary distinctions, and unique individual people sort themselves into easily stereotyped groups. Issues now have a right side and a wrong side, with little middle ground. People are right or wrong, well-intentioned or malicious, and that’s that. Oversimplification is the amateur thinker’s trademark.</p> <p>Arrogance is ignorance plus conviction. This is an especially deadly combo because it prevents you from improving. It not only leaves you without real knowledge, it deprives you of the humility needed to gain real knowledge or grow into a better thinker. When you think you’re already doing great, you feel like there’s no room left for improvement. We all collect life experience, but we don’t all take advantage of it. While humility is a permeable filter that absorbs life experience and converts it into knowledge and wisdom, arrogance is a rubber shield that life experience simply bounces off of.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> <p>If there’s anything you can say about Rung 3, Attorney-style thinkers, they at least understand the <em>concept</em> of an arrow. They’re unfalsifiable, but they’re not <em>that</em> big an internal shift—an intellectual “growth spurt”—away from becoming a legitimate thinker. From somewhere in the periphery of their mind, the voice of the Higher Mind still carries some weight. And if they can just learn to listen to it and value it, maybe they can change.</p> <p>But again, we’re working on a spectrum here, so the Higher Mind’s prominence in an Attorney’s head varies. The How You Think ladder works kind of like the U.S. congress. It’s a binary situation where whichever “party” has the majority is in the driver’s seat. At any point along the spectrum, either the Higher Mind or the Primitive Mind holds primary control, all determined by whether you’re below or above the ladder’s midpoint. But like congress, the margin of victory matters. When you’re thinking like an Attorney, the Primitive Mind is the majority party—but the Higher Mind is a sizable minority who still asserts influence. But as your intellect drops further down the Psych Spectrum, deeper into Unfalsifiable Land, the Higher Mind’s voice grows fainter. The Primitive Mind starts to develop a <em>super-</em>majority, eventually leaving the minority Higher Mind party with little to no influence.</p> <p>As you descend, you become an increasingly corrupt Attorney, increasingly likely to accept red-painted plastic cherries—fake news, shoddy statistics, scattered anecdotal personal experiences—as hard evidence and universal truth. You start taking things out of context or even flat-out lying when you argue with people. And less exposure to those who disagree with you means it becomes easier to fictionalize your opponents as people not even worth talking to, making you even more certain that everything you believe is correct. At the same time, your self-image and the conviction you hold about your beliefs grow even stronger than they were. You no longer concern yourself with the reasoning behind your viewpoints—you just know that those viewpoints are right.</p> <p>Eventually, your Values Stack looks like this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/69.1-Values-Stack-ZEA-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8191\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/69.1-Values-Stack-ZEA-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"592\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/69.1-Values-Stack-ZEA-v2.png 1000w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/69.1-Values-Stack-ZEA-v2-600x345.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/69.1-Values-Stack-ZEA-v2-768x442.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/69.1-Values-Stack-ZEA-v2-750x431.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" /></a></p> <p>With confirmation having reached the sacred section of the stack, your nail is back in the picture—while truth now swings freely.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/70.1-means-ends-ZEA.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8192\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/70.1-means-ends-ZEA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"333\" /></a></p> <p>Your thinking is now entirely running on the ancient software of your Primitive Mind, with the rational, reasonable, humble, and self-aware Higher Mind completely out of the picture.</p> <p>You’ve reached the bottom rung.</p> <p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Rung 4: Thinking Like a Zealot</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.6-ladder-ZEA.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8193\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.6-ladder-ZEA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2023\" height=\"1629\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.6-ladder-ZEA.png 2023w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.6-ladder-ZEA-600x483.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.6-ladder-ZEA-768x618.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.6-ladder-ZEA-750x604.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2023px) 100vw, 2023px\" /></a></p> <p>We all think like Zealots at times. We’re all naive in our own unique set of ways, and zealot-like thinking is sometimes a case of naivety. Sometimes we’re taught zealot-like thinking by our parents or friends. Sometimes we’re scared and zealotry is a cave we’ve found to hide in.</p> <p>I think it’s often because we’ve made the amateur error of thinking that people are ideas and ideas are people. If ideas and people are the same, it ties our self-worth to the worth of our beliefs. It ties our personal safety to the protection of those beliefs, and it makes a challenge to those beliefs feel like physical danger. It makes validation of our beliefs feel like acceptance and approval and love. This is one of the many pits we fall into when our Primitive Minds are doing our thinking.</p> <p>When you forget that people and ideas are separate, your entire thinking process is laden with a crippling burden: to protect your beliefs like you protect your body. You’ve traded in the Scientist’s horizontal flexibility for a total willingness to vertically compromise on your thinking process, and you’ve swapped the Scientist’s vertical rigidity that keeps their process on the top rung for a horizontal rigidity that nails your feet right into the Idea Spectrum, right at the point where your viewpoints live.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71.1-ice-skating-nails.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8194\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71.1-ice-skating-nails.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71.1-ice-skating-nails.png 2023w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71.1-ice-skating-nails-600x483.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71.1-ice-skating-nails-768x618.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71.1-ice-skating-nails-750x604.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> <p>No longer is there a humble Point A. When you’re thinking like a Zealot, humility feels weak and shameful. You’ll never say “I don’t know,” because that sounds the same to you as saying “I don’t know who I am.” You <em>do </em>know. Your beliefs are a rock-solid reflection of the objective truth, period. Knowledge is the opposite of hard—it’s like knowing the sky is blue. Anyone with a mind and a heart knows what’s true and what’s not.</p> <p>So you don’t need any “process of thinking” arrow. Arrows are for idiots. This is what thinking like a Zealot feels like.</p> <p>In reality, you’ve taken a set of ideas to be sacred, and you’ve given up an independent truth-seeking path in order to faithfully serve those sacred ideas. Without any Higher Mind influence forcing you to engage with some kind of knowledge process, the once-rigorous scientific method has evolved to this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/72.1-worshipping-B.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8195\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/72.1-worshipping-B.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/72.1-worshipping-B.png 935w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/72.1-worshipping-B-600x528.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/72.1-worshipping-B-768x676.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/72.1-worshipping-B-750x660.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p> <p>Thinking, for you, is about worship, not learning.</p> <p>So aside from a deep pleasure you derive from information that praises and confirms What You Think, gathering information has little use—you already know all your cherries are perfect, so your Attention Bouncer servant can stay home.</p> <p>Your Belief Bouncer doesn’t have much to do either. Ideas that validate your ideas are good, true ideas, spoken by good, reasonable people. And those are the only ideas you want to hear.</p> <p>The three characters in your reasoning process who used to help you find truth now simply send in a never-ending stream of love, acceptance, approval, and safety in the form of anecdotes, statistics, and opinions that make you feel great.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/73.1-Attention-Bouncer-ZEA.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8196\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/73.1-Attention-Bouncer-ZEA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/73.1-Attention-Bouncer-ZEA.png 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/73.1-Attention-Bouncer-ZEA-600x342.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/73.1-Attention-Bouncer-ZEA-768x438.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/73.1-Attention-Bouncer-ZEA-750x428.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p> <p>In the testing ideas phase—well, there is no testing ideas phase. First of all, why would you test what you’re already sure about? It’s like testing whether the ocean is wet. But more importantly, when you think ideas and people are the same, someone challenging your ideas feels like an insult. It feels violating. It feels personally invalidating. It’s a threat. If Scientists see dissent as a puzzle piece and Sports Fans see dissent as a tennis ball, Zealots see dissent as a bucket of shit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/73.2-dissent-shit-bucket.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8197\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/73.2-dissent-shit-bucket.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"297\" height=\"324\" /></a></p> <p>And who wants to challenge your ideas anyway? Dissenters. Dissenters are people who hold different ideas, which means they’re different kinds of people—worse kinds of people. Their entire existence, if accepted, invalidates your own existence. So they cannot be tolerated. You avoid dissenters and their disgusting ideas as much as you can—other than the time you spend mocking them and their ideas, which is just another form of self-confirmation.</p> <p>At the top of our ladder, your identity was that of a humble learner, which made you intellectually robust. So intellectual boxing matches were your friend—they made you smarter and brought you a little closer to the truth. Now that you’re thinking like a Zealot, those ideas in the ring are your naked, vulnerable body—so you don’t want to watch your ideas box, or root for them, or even fix the matches. You ban boxing altogether.</p> <p>When you’re thinking like a Zealot, there is no reasoning process, because there is no reasoning. You’re just here, always:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/74.1-2x2-ZEA.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8198\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/74.1-2x2-ZEA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/74.1-2x2-ZEA.png 862w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/74.1-2x2-ZEA-590x600.png 590w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/74.1-2x2-ZEA-768x781.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/74.1-2x2-ZEA-737x750.png 737w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\" /></a></p> <p>You’re the picture of arrogance, of unearned conviction, of total ignorance, of utter un-self-awareness. And hiding just beneath that façade is a terrifying frailty, protected only by a rigid, brittle set of simplified beliefs. It’s not a great situation.</p> <p>So there’s our ladder. Time for a big recap chart:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/75-Recap-Chart.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8199\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/75-Recap-Chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1250\" height=\"3621\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/75-Recap-Chart.png 2360w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/75-Recap-Chart-207x600.png 207w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/75-Recap-Chart-259x750.png 259w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px\" /></a></p> <p>Each of us is a work in progress, and as we grow in age, we also can grow up psychologically. The more we evolve psychologically, the more time we spend thinking from the high rungs and the less time we spend down below. But no matter how good we get at thinking, I’m pretty sure we never totally rid ourselves of low-rung thinking.</p> <p>This post focused entirely on individual thinking, but the intellectual life of an individual doesn’t happen in isolation. The 2D picture we’ve painted so far in this post is still an incomplete picture. It’s a 2D cross section of what’s actually a 3D system—a single slice of bread in the <em>loaf</em> of human behavior. To bring our lens into full focus, we’ll need to zoom out and look deeper into the loaf, exploring how thinking happens in communities. In the next chapter, we’ll step into the wonderful, horrible world of intellectual <em>cultures.</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/idea-labs-echo-chambers\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7661\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"101\" height=\"55\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1.png 1100w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-300x164.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-768x419.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-600x327.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-374x200.png 374w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-239x130.png 239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px\" /></a></p> <p class=\"has-text-align-center wbwFont\">Chapter 8: <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/10/idea-labs-echo-chambers.html\">Idea Labs and Echo Chambers</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> <p>To keep up with this series, sign up for the <strong><a class=\"ClickPico PicoRule\">Wait But Why email list</a></strong> and we’ll send you the new posts right when they come out.</p> <p>Huge thanks to our Patreon supporters for making this series free for everyone.

Then they’d implant <em>that </em>embryo in one of the two women and when she has that kid, it’s actually the <em>grandchild</em>&nbsp;of both couples. So the four of them have effectively produced a four-way child that’s equally related to each of them. Then, as my fantasy goes, 30 years later, when the two couples are in their 60s and their grandchild is in her 30s, they could return to the two original frozen embryos and birth <em>them</em>. So now you have two 60-something couples, their 30-year-old grandchild, and in her two arms, she’s holding two babies—<em>her parents</em>. And the children of the two couples. I picture a few years later her feeding the now-toddlers, being like, “Hey <em>mom</em>—do <em>not </em>hit dad. You have to <em>wait </em>for your food, you can’t just take his.” It goes on. 30 years later, the two parents are now 30, and <em>they </em>get married and have a child. And when Thanksgiving rolls around, you’ve got the original two couples—now in their 90s—their 30-year-old children, who are married, and their grandchildren, who are 60 years old and 3 months old, respectively.

Quick note before we jump in:</p> \n<p>This is a post about something I’ve been wanting to write about forever: careers. Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are—which is weird because I’m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this. When it comes to careers, society is like your great uncle who traps you at holidays and goes on a 15-minute mostly incoherent unsolicited advice monologue, and you tune out almost the whole time because it’s super clear he has very little idea what he’s talking about and that everything he says is like 45 years outdated. Society is like that great uncle, and conventional wisdom is like his rant. Except in this case, instead of tuning it out, we pay rapt attention to every word, and then we make major career decisions based on what he says. Kind of a weird thing for us to do.</p> \n<p>This post isn’t me giving you career advice really—it’s a framework that I think can help you make career decisions that actually reflect who you are, what you want, and what our rapidly changing career landscape looks like today. You’re not a pro at this, but you’re certainly more qualified to figure out what’s best for you than our collective un-self-aware great uncle. For those of you yet to start your career who aren’t sure what you want to do with their lives, or those of you currently in the middle of your career who aren’t sure you’re on the right path, I hope this post can help you press the reset button on your thought process and get some clarity.</p> \n<p>Finally, it feels very good to put this post up. It’s been way, way too long. The last year has been pretty frustrating for me and anyone who likes Wait But Why—a lot of build-up of ideas with none of the satisfying release of those ideas on the blog (most of my last year has been spent working on another, way longer post). I’m hoping this WBW Dark Ages era is nearing its end, because I miss hanging out here. Thanks, as always, to the small group of ridiculously generous, ridiculously patient patrons who have stuck with us through such a slow period.</p> \n<p>– Tim</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><em><strong>PDF:</strong> If you want to print this post or read it offline, the PDF is probably the way to go.

We just woke up out of nowhere and found ourselves on some path set for us by our parents, by society, and by circumstances. We’re told the rules of the river and the way we should swim and what our goals should be. Our job isn’t to think about our path—it’s to succeed on the path we’ve been placed on, based on the way success has been defined for us.</p> \n<p>For many of us—and I suspect for a large portion of Wait But Why readers—our childhood river then feeds into a pond, called college.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-1-6721\" id=\"note-1-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> We may have some say in which particular pond we landed in, but in the end, most college ponds aren’t really that different from one another.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-6781 aligncenter\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"673\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1.png 1518w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1-300x217.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1-768x557.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1-600x435.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\" /></a></p> \n<p>In the pond, we have a bit more breathing room and some leeway to branch out into more specific interests.

One is that at that moment, you’re kind of skill-less and knowledge-less and a lot of other things-less:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6733\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg 1500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2-281x300.jpg 281w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2-768x819.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2-563x600.jpg 563w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p> \n<p>But before you can even address your general uselessness, there’s an even bigger issue—your pre-set path ended. Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO. But no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path—except you. And you’ve spent your whole life becoming a pro student, leaving you with zero experience as the CEO of anything. Up to now, you’ve only been in charge of the micro decisions—”How do I succeed at my job as a student?”—and now you’re suddenly holding the keys to the macro cockpit as well, tasked with answering stressful macro questions like “Who am I?” and “What are the important things in life?” and “What are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?” When we leave school for the last time, the macro guidance we’ve become so accustomed to is suddenly whisked away from us, leaving us standing there holding our respective dicks, with no idea how to do this.</p> \n<p>Then time happens. And we end up on a path. And that path becomes our life’s story.</p> \n<p>At the end of our life, when we look back at how things went, we can see our life’s path in its entirety, from an aerial view.</p> \n<p>When scientists study people on their deathbed and how they feel about their lives, they usually find that many of them feel some serious regrets. I think a lot of those regrets stem from the fact that most of us aren’t really taught about path-making in our childhoods, and most of us also don’t get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn’t really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in.</p> \n<p>So this is a post about path-making. Let’s take a 30-minute pre-deathbed pause to look down at the path we’re on, and ahead at where that path seems to be going, and make sure it makes sense.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>The Cook and the Chef—Revisited</strong></span></p> \n<p>In the past, <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I’ve written about</a> the critical distinction between “reasoning from first principles” and “reasoning by analogy”—or what I called being a “chef” vs. being a “cook.” Since writing the post, I notice this distinction everywhere, and I’ve thought about it roughly 2 million times in my own life.</p> \n<p>The idea is that reasoning from first principles is reasoning like a scientist. You take core facts and observations and use them to puzzle together a conclusion, kind of like a chef playing around with raw ingredients to try to make them into something good. By doing this puzzling, a chef eventually writes a new recipe. The other kind of reasoning—reasoning by analogy—happens when you look at the way things are already done and you essentially copy it, with maybe a little personal tweak here and there—kind of like a cook following an already written recipe.</p> \n<p>A pure verbatim recipe-copying cook and a pure independently inventive chef are the two extreme ends of what is, of course, a spectrum. But for any particular part of your life that involves reasoning and decision making, wherever you happen to be on the spectrum, your reasoning process can usually be boiled down to fundamentally chef-like or fundamentally cook-like. Creating vs. copying. Originality vs. conformity.</p> \n<p>Being a chef takes a tremendous amount of time and energy—which makes sense, because you’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, you’re trying to invent it for the first time. Puzzling your way to a conclusion feels like navigating a mysterious forest while blindfolded and always involves a whole lot of failure, in the form of trial and error. Being a cook is far easier and more straightforward and less icky. In most situations, being a chef is a terrible waste of time, and comes with a high opportunity cost, since time on Earth is immensely scarce. Right now, I’m wearing J. Crew jeans and a plain t-shirt and a hoodie and Allbirds shoes, because I’m trying to conform. Throughout my life, I’ve looked around at people who seem kind of like me and I’ve bought a bunch of clothes that look like what they wear. And this makes sense—because clothes aren’t important to me, and they’re not how I choose to express my individuality. So in my case, fashion is a perfect part of life to use a reasoning shortcut and be a cook.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-2-6721\" id=\"note-2-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></p> \n<p>But then there are those parts of life that are really really deeply important—like where you choose to live, or the kinds of friends you choose to make, or whether you want to get married and to whom, or whether you want to have kids and how you want to raise them, or how you set your lifestyle priorities.</p> \n<p>Career-path-carving is definitely one of those really really deeply important things. Let’s spell out the obvious reasons why:</p> \n<p><strong>Time. </strong>For most of us, a career (including ancillary career time, like time spent commuting and thinking about your work) will eat up somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 hours. At the moment, a long human life runs at about 750,000 hours. When you subtract childhood (~175,000 hours) and the portion of your adult life you’ll spend sleeping, eating, exercising, and otherwise taking care of the human pet you live in, along with errands and general life upkeep (~325,000 hours), you’re left with 250,000 “meaningful adult hours.”<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-3-6721\" id=\"note-3-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time—not something to be a cook about.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6735\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"713\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png 900w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart-253x300.png 253w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart-768x912.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart-505x600.png 505w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>Quality of Life. </strong>Your career has a major effect on all the non-career hours as well. For those of us not already wealthy through past earnings, marriage, or inheritance, a career doubles as our means of support. The particulars of your career also often play a big role in determining where you live, how flexible your life is, the kinds of things you’re able to do in your free time, and sometimes even in who you end up marrying.</p> \n<p><strong>Impact. </strong>On top of your career being the way you spend much of your time and the means of support for the rest of your time, your career triples as your primary mode of impact-making. Every human life touches thousands of other lives in thousands of different ways, and all of those lives you alter then go on to touch thousands of lives of their own. We can’t test this, but I’m pretty sure that you can select any 80-year-old alive today, go back in time 80 years, find them as an infant, throw the infant in the trash, and then come back to the present day and find a countless number of things changed. All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future—but the <em>kind</em> of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy. Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it.</p> \n<p><strong>Identity. </strong>In our childhoods, people ask us about our career plans by asking us what we want to <em>be</em> when we grow up. When we grow up, we tell people about our careers by telling them what we <em>are. </em>We don’t say, “I practice law”—we say, “I am a lawyer.” This is probably an unhealthy way to think about careers, but the way many societies are right now, a person’s career quadruples as the person’s primary identity. Which is kind of a big thing.</p> \n<p>So yeah—your career path isn’t like my shitty sweatshirt. It’s really really deeply important, putting it squarely in “Definitely absolutely make sure to be a chef about it” territory.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Your Career Map</strong></span></p> \n<p>Which brings us to you.

Was it really me?” The answer can get confusing.</p> \n<p>I’m pretty sure all of these people would benefit from a moment of career path reflection.</p> \n<div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n <p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>The Okay But Why Do You Think You Can Help Me With My Career Reflection You Draw Stick Figures for a Living Blue Box</strong></span></p> \n <p>Extremely fair question. One thing I always ask myself as I pick topics to write about is, “Am I qualified to write about this?” Here are the reasons I decided to take on this topic:</p> \n <p>1) I have spent most of the last 20 years in a perpetual state of analyzing my own career path.</p> \n <p>2) My path has taken a lot of turns—from wanting to be a movie star when I was 7 to wanting to be the president when I was 17 to wanting to write film scores when I was 22 to wanting to be an entrepreneur when I was 24 to wanting to write musicals when I was 29 to most recently wanting to be a writer-ish guy.</p> \n <p>3) After being pretty all over the place about my career path for most of my life, I actually love my job now. That’s always subject to change, but being able to look at the decision-making processes that led me to confusing or frustrating places, side by side with the decisions that led me to a more fulfilling place, has offered me some wisdom on where people tend to go wrong.</p> \n <p>4) On top of having my own story to look at, I’ve had a front-row seat for the stories of my dozen or so closest friends. My friends seem to share my career path obsessiveness, so between observing their paths and talking with them about those paths again and again along the way, I’ve broadened my views on the topic, which helps me to distinguish between the lessons that are my-life specific and those that are more universal.</p> \n <p>5) Finally, this isn’t a post about which careers are better or worse than others or which career values are more or less meaningful—there are lots of social scientists and self-help authors out there with good data on that, and I’m not one of them. It’s instead a framework that I think can help a career-path reflector better see their own situation, and what really matters to them, clearly and honestly. This framework has worked really well for me, so I think it can probably be helpful for other people too.</p> \n</div> \n<p>Now that you’ve taken a fresh look at your Career Plans map, along with whatever arrow may or may not be on it, put it down and out of sight. We’ll come back to it at the end of the post. It’s time now for a deep dive—let’s think about this from scratch. From first principles.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p>In the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cook-chef post</a>, I designed a simple framework for how a chef makes major career choices. At its core is a simple Venn diagram.</p> \n<p>The first part of the diagram is the Want Box, which contains all the careers you find desirable.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6740\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box.png 1544w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box-283x300.png 283w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box-768x813.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box-567x600.png 567w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The second part of the diagram is the Reality Box. The Reality Box is for the set of all careers that are realistic to potentially achieve—based on a comparison, in each case, between your level of potential in an area and the general difficulty of achieving success in that area.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6741\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box.png 1970w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box-300x244.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box-768x623.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box-600x487.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The overlapping area contains your optimal career path choices—the set of arrows you should consider drawing on your Career Map. We can call it the Option Pool.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6742\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn.png 1586w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-300x191.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-768x490.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-600x383.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a></p> \n<p>This is straightforward enough. But actually filling in these boxes accurately is way harder than it looks. For the diagram to work, it has to be as close to the truth as possible, and to get there, we have to lift up the hood of our subconscious and head down. Let’s start with the Want Box.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Deep Analysis, Part 1: Your Want Box</strong></span></p> \n<p>The hard thing about the Want Box is that you want a bunch of different things—or, rather, there are a bunch of different sides of you, and each of them wants—and fears—its own stuff. And since some motivations have conflicting interests with others, you cannot, by definition, have everything you want. Going for one thing you want means, by definition, not going for others, and sometimes, it’ll specifically mean going directly <em>against</em> others. The Want Box is a game of compromise.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>The Yearning Octopus</strong></span></p> \n<p>To do a proper Want Box audit, you need to think about what you yearn for in a career and then unpack the shit out of it. Luckily, we have someone here who can help us. The Yearning Octopus.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6744\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1.png 1400w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1-300x257.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1-768x658.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1-600x514.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p>We each have our own personal Yearning Octopus<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-5-6721\" id=\"note-5-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a> in our heads.

It’s a reflection of our specific personality and our values, and it bears the burden of probably the most complex and challenging human need: fulfillment. It’s also in the shit dealing with not only our current selves, but a bunch of our past selves too. The dreams of 7-year-old you and the idealized identity of 12-year-old you and the secret hopes of 17-year-old you and the evolving passions of your current self are all somewhere on the personal tentacle, each throwing their own little fit about getting what they want, and each fully ready to make you feel horrible about yourself with their disappointment and disgust if you fail them. On top of that, your fear of death sometimes emerges on the personal tentacle, all needy about you leaving your mark and achieving greatness and all that. The personal tentacle is why you don’t find very many billionaires content to spend the rest of their life sipping cocktails on the beach—it’s a highly needy tentacle.</p> \n<p>And yet, the personal tentacle is also one that often ends up somewhat neglected. Because in many cases, it’s the ickiest set of yearnings to really <em>go</em> for; because the fears of this tentacle aren’t scary in an immediate way—they creep in out of the background over time; and because the personal tentacle is always at risk of getting bowled over early in your career by the powerful animal emotions of the other tentacles. This neglect can leave a person with major regrets later on once the dust settles. An unfulfilled Personal Yearnings tentacle is often the explanation, for example, behind a very successful, very unhappy person—who may believe they got successful in the wrong field.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6749\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png 1218w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle-300x275.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle-768x704.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle-600x550.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The Social Yearnings tentacle is probably our most primitive, animal side, with its core drive stemming back to our tribal evolutionary past. On the tentacle are a number of odd creatures.</p> \n<p>As we’ve discussed <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">before</a> on this blog, we all have a Social Survival Mammoth living in our heads who’s earth-shatteringly obsessed with what other people think of us. This means he craves acceptance and inclusion and being well-liked, while likewise being petrified of embarrassment, negative judgment, and disapproval. He really really really wants to be in the in-group and he really really really doesn’t want to be in the outgroup. He’s <a href=\"https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mammoth1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quite cute</a> though.</p> \n<p>Then there’s your ego, who’s a similar character but even more needy. Your ego doesn’t just want to be accepted; it wants to be admired, desired, and fawned upon—ideally, on a mass scale. More upsetting to it than being disliked is being ignored. It wants to be relevant and important and widely known.</p> \n<p>There are other characters milling about as well. Somewhere else on the social tentacle is a little judge with a little gavel who gets very butthurt if it thinks people aren’t judging you fairly—if you’re not appropriately appreciated. It’s very important to the judge that people are aware of exactly how smart and talented you think you are. The judge is also big on holding grudges—which is the reason a lot of people are driven more than anything by a desire to <em>show</em> that person or those people who never believed in them.</p> \n<p>Finally, some of us may find a loving little dog on our social tentacle who wants more than anything in the world to please its owner, and who just cannot bear the thought of disappointing them. The one problem with this adorable creature is that its owner isn’t you. It’s a person with so much psychological power over you that, if you’re not careful, you may dedicate your whole career to trying to please them and make them proud. (It’s probably a parent.)</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6750\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"522\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png 1079w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle-287x300.png 287w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle-768x802.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle-574x600.png 574w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The Lifestyle Yearnings tentacle mostly just wants Tuesday to be a good day. But like, a really pleasant, enjoyable day—with plenty of free time and self-care and relaxation and luxuries.</p> \n<p>It’s also concerned with your life in the big picture being as great as possible—as far as your lifestyle tentacle is concerned, you should be able to do what you want to do in life, when and how you want to do it, with the people you like most. Life should be full of fun times and rich experiences, but it should also roll by smoothly, without too much hard work and as few bumps in the road as possible.</p> \n<p>The issue is, even if you place a high priority on your lifestyle yearnings, it’s pretty difficult to keep the whole tentacle happy at the same time. The part of the tentacle that just wants to sit around and relax will hold you back from sweating to build the kind of career that offers long-term flexibility and the kind of wealth that can make life luxurious and cushy and full of toys. The part of the tentacle that only feels comfortable when the future feels predictable will reject the exact kinds of paths that may generate the long-term freedom another part of the tentacle longs for. The side of you that wants a stress-free life doesn’t get along very well with the side of you that thirsts to be hang gliding off a cliff in Namibia like Richard Branson.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6846\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"847\" height=\"726\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png 1400w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1-300x257.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1-768x658.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1-600x514.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The Moral Yearnings tentacle thinks the rest of the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus are a real pack of dicks—each one more self-involved and self-indulgent than the next. The parts of you on the moral tentacle look around and see a big world that needs so much fixing; they see billions of people no less worthy than you of a good life who just happened to be born into inferior circumstances; they see an uncertain future ahead that hangs in the balance between utopia and dystopia for life on Earth—a future we can actually push in the right direction if we could only get our other tentacles out of our way. While the other tentacles fantasize about what you would do with your life if you had a billion dollars in the bank, the moral tentacle fantasizes about the kind of impact you could make if you had a billion dollars to <em>deploy</em>.</p> \n<p>Needless to say, the other tentacles of your Yearning Octopus find the moral tentacle to be insufferable. They also can’t begin to understand philanthropy for philanthropy’s sake—they think, “Other people aren’t me, so why would I spend my time and energy working to help them?”—but they <em>can </em>understand philanthropy for their own motive’s sake. While the moral and lifestyle tentacles tend to be in direct conflict, others may sometimes find common ground—the social tentacle can get very into philanthropy if it’ll happen to win you respect and admiration from a highly regarded social group, and some people’s personal tentacle may find the meaning or self-worth it so craves in a philanthropic endeavor.</p> \n<p>That’s why, when you do something philanthropic—or anything altruistic, really—there are a few separate things going on in your head. The part of you <em>determined </em>to get proper public credit for the deed lives on your social tentacle; the part of you that thinks “God I’m a good person” lives on your personal tentacle; and the part of you that really loves seeing the person or group you helped be better off lives on your moral tentacle. Likewise, <em>not </em>doing anything for others can hurt you on multiple tentacles—the moral tentacle because it feels guilty and sad, the social tentacle because this may cause others to judge you as a selfish or greedy person, and the personal tentacle because it may lower your self-esteem.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6752\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle.png 1214w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle-300x262.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle-768x672.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle-600x525.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Your Practical Yearnings tentacle thinks all of this is fine and great—but it would also like to point out that it’s March 31st and your rent is due tomorrow, and the funny thing about that is that it logged into your bank account and saw that the number of dollars in it is actually less than the number of dollars that your landlord will need from you sometime in the next 34 hours. And yeah it knows that you deposited that check on Thursday and that it’s supposed to clear tomorrow morning, but your practical tentacle also could have sworn that just last month, all the tentacles promised that they’d make some sacrifices in order to build up at least a little bank account cushion so that simply paying the rent wouldn’t have to be really fucking stressful every month. Your practical tentacle also can’t help but notice that your social tentacle offered to buy a round of drinks for all nine people you went to the bar with last Saturday so those people would think of you as a classy, generous person, and that your lifestyle tentacle chose to rent what sure seems like a pretty nice-ass apartment for someone now living check to check, and that the updates have gotten real quiet from your friend about that bagel delivery service he started six months ago that your moral tentacle happily invested $2,500 in to help it get off the ground, and oh also that meanwhile your personal tentacle has everyone sweating their dick off working at two comedy-writing internships simultaneously that somehow manage to bring in less money combined than you made dressing up as an Egyptian enchantress to wait tables at Jekyll &amp; Hyde sophomore year of college.</p> \n<p>At its basic level, your practical tentacle wants to make sure you can eat food and wear clothes and buy the medicine you need and not live outside. It doesn’t really care how these things happen—it just wants them to happen. But then everyone else on the octopus makes your practical tentacle’s life super hard by being fucky about things. Every time your income goes up, your lifestyle tentacle decides to raise the bar on what it wants and expects, leaving your practical tentacle continually in the shit trying to cover it all so you don’t have to run up your credit card debt. Your personal tentacle has all of these weird needs that take up a lot of time and more often than not aren’t exactly big money-makers. And while your practical tentacle would be totally down to just ask your rich uncle for money to help out, your social tentacle outlawed asking others for money because “it’s not a good look,” with your personal tentacle chiming in that “yeah, we’re better than that.”</p> \n<p>So that’s the situation. You’ve got this Yearning Octopus in your head with five tentacles (or however many yours has), each with their own agenda, that often conflict with each other. Then there are the distinct individual yearnings on each tentacle, often in conflict amongst themselves. And if that weren’t enough, you sometimes have furious internal conflict inside a <em>single</em> yearning. Like when your desire to pursue your passion can’t figure out what it’s most passionate about.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6753\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument.png 999w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument-300x289.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument-768x741.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument-600x579.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Or when you want so badly to be respected, but then you remember that a career that wins the undying respect of one segment of society will always receive shrugs from other segments and even contemptuous eye rolls from other segments still.</p> \n<p>Or when you decide to satisfy your urge to help others, before realizing that the part of you that wants to dedicate your life to helping to mitigate humanity’s greatest existential risks has palpable disdain for the part of you that would rather make a tangible positive impact on your local community—while the part of you that can’t stand the thought of the millions of today’s humans without access to clean water finds both of those other yearnings to be pretty cold and heartless.</p> \n<p>So yeah, your Yearning Octopus is complicated. And no human in history has ever satisfied their entire octopus—that’s why you’ll never find it fully smiling. Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Dissecting the Octopus</strong></span></p> \n<p>With that in mind, let’s return to your Want Box. When we think about our career goals and fears and hopes and dreams, our consciousness is just accessing the net output of the Yearning Octopus—which is usually made up of its loudest voices. Only by digging into our mind’s subconscious can we see what’s really going on.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-6-6721\" id=\"note-6-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></p> \n<p>The cool thing is that we all have the ability to do that. The stuff in your subconscious is like stuff in the basement of a house. It’s not off-limits to us—it’s just in the basement. We can go look at it anytime—we just have to A) remember that the house has a basement, and B) actually spend the time and energy to go down there, even though going down there might suck.</p> \n<p>So let’s head to the basement of your mind to look for the octopus. Unless you’re one of those people who’s really practiced at analyzing your subconscious, it might be dark in the basement, making it hard to see your octopus. The way to start turning the lights on is by identifying what your conscious mind currently knows about your yearnings and fears, and then unpacking it.</p> \n<p>Like if there’s a certain career path that sounds fantastic to you, unpack that. Which tentacles in particular are yearning for that career—and which specific parts of those tentacles?</p> \n<p>If you’re not currently working towards that career you supposedly yearn for, try to figure out why not. If you think it’s because you’re afraid of failing, unpack <em>that</em>. Fear of failure can emerge from any of the tentacles, so that’s not a specific enough analysis. You want to find the specific source of the fear. Is it a social tentacle fear of embarrassment, or of being judged by others as not that smart, or of appearing to be not that successful to your romantic interests? Is it a personal tentacle fear of damaging your own self-image—of confirming a suspicion about yourself that haunts you? Is it a lifestyle tentacle fear of having to downgrade your living situation, or of bringing stress and instability into a currently predictable life? Or maybe that fear of a living situation downgrade isn’t actually emerging from your lifestyle tentacle, but more so from your social tentacle—in other words, is it possible you’re indifferent about the apartment change itself but super concerned about the <em>message</em> a lifestyle downgrade sends to your friends and family? Or are there financial commitments you simply cannot back out of at the moment, and your practical tentacle is in a genuine panic about how you’ll make ends meet should this career switch take longer than expected to work out, or not work out at all? Or are a few of these combining together to generate your fear of making the leap?</p> \n<p>Perhaps you don’t really think it’s fear of failure that’s stopping you, but something else. Maybe it’s a dread of the change in identity—both internally and externally—that inevitably accompanies a career move like this. Maybe it’s the heavy weight of inertia—an intense resistance to change—that seems to exist in and of itself and overpowers all of your other yearnings. In either case, you’d want to unpack the feeling and ask yourself exactly which tentacles are so opposed to an identity shift, or so driven by inertia.</p> \n<p>Maybe you pine to be rich. You fantasize about a life where you make $1.2 million a year, and you feel a tremendous drive to make it happen. All five tentacles can feel a desire for wealth under certain circumstances, each for their own reasons. Unpack it.</p> \n<p>As you unpack an inner drive to make money, maybe you discover that at its core, the drive is more for a sense of security than for vast wealth. That can be unpacked too. A yearning for security at its simplest is just your practical tentacle doing what your practical tentacle does. But maybe it’s not actually basic security you want as much as a guarantee of a certain level of fanciness demanded by your lifestyle or social tentacle. Or perhaps what you really want is a level of security so over-the-top secure it can no longer be called a security yearning—instead, it may be an impulse by the emotional well-being section of your lifestyle tentacle to alleviate a compulsive financial stress you were raised to forever feel, almost regardless of your actual financial situation.</p> \n<p>The answers to all of these questions lie somewhere on the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus. And by asking questions like these and digging deep enough to identify the true roots of your various yearnings, you start to turn on the basement light and acquaint yourself with your octopus in all its complexity.</p> \n<p>You’ll also come to understand which of your inner yearnings seem to speak the loudest in your mind and carry the most pull in your decision-making processes. Pretty quickly, a yearning hierarchy will begin to reveal itself. You’ll identify yearnings that speak loudly and get their way; yearnings that cry at the top of their lungs but get continually elbowed out of the way by higher-prioritized parts of the octopus; yearnings that seem resigned to their low-status positions in the hierarchy.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Searching for Imposters</strong></span></p> \n<p>We’re making good progress—but we’re just getting started. Once you have a reasonably clear picture of your Yearning Octopus, you can start doing the real work—work that takes place another level down in your subconscious, in the basement of the basement. Here, you can set up a little interrogation room and one by one, bring each yearning down into it for a cross-examination.</p> \n<p>You’ll start by asking each yearning: how did you end up here, and why are you the way you are? Desires, beliefs, values, and fears don’t materialize out of nowhere. They’re either developed over time by our internal consciousness as observations and life experience pour in, or they’re implanted in us from the outside, by someone else. In other words, they’re the product of either you the chef or you the cook.</p> \n<p>So the goal here in your creepy interrogation room is to tug on the faces of each of your yearnings to find out if it’s authentically you, or if it’s someone else <em>disguised </em>as you.</p> \n<p>You can pull on a yearning’s face by playing the Why Game. You’ll ask your initial Why—<em>Why is this something I want?—</em>and get to some kind of Because. Then you’ll keep going. Why did that particular Because lead you to want what you now want? And when did that particular Because gain so much gravity with you? You’ll get to a deeper Because behind the Because. And if you continue with this, you’ll usually discover one of three things:</p> \n<p>1) You’ll trace the Why back to its origin and reveal a long chain of authentic evolution that developed through deep independent thought. You’ll pull on their face and confirm that the skin is real.</p> \n<p>2) You’ll trace the Why back to an original Because that someone else installed in you—<em>I guess the only reason I actually have this value is because my mom kind of forced it on me—</em>and you realize that you never really thought to consider whether you actually independently agree with it. You never stopped to ask yourself whether your own accumulated wisdom actually justifies the level of conviction you feel about that core belief. In a case like this, the yearning is revealed to be an imposter pretending to be an authentic yearning of yours. You pull on its face and it’s a mask that comes off, exposing the yearning’s original installer underneath.</p> \n<p>3) You’ll trace the Why back and back and get kind of lost in a haze of “I guess I just know this because it’s true!” This could be an authentic you thing, or just another version of #2, in an instance where you can’t recall the moment this feeling was installed in you. Somewhere deep in you, you’ll have a hunch about which it is.</p> \n<p>In a #1 scenario, you can be proud that you developed that part of you like a chef. It’s an authentic and hard-earned feeling or value.</p> \n<p>In a #2 or maybe #3 scenario, you’ve discovered that you’ve been duped. You’ve let someone else sneak onto your Yearning Octopus while you weren’t looking. When it comes to that particular belief of yours, you’re a cook following someone else’s recipe—an obedient robot reciting desires and fears out of someone else’s brain.</p> \n<p>There’s a chance you’re an unusually wise person whose examination reveals an octopus developed mostly by you and kept readily up to date. More likely, you’re like me and most of my friends—your interrogation room reveals some definite imposters, or at least a lot of ambiguity. Like, underneath one mask, you’ll find your mom.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6754\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-1.png 549w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-1-296x300.png 296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6755\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-2.png 316w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-2-215x300.png 215w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6756\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"338\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-3.png 393w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-3-254x300.png 254w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6757\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"341\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4.png 496w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4-228x300.png 228w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4-455x600.png 455w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6819\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1.png 725w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1-278x300.png 278w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1-557x600.png 557w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\" /></a></p> \n<p>You’ll pull off others to reveal the values and judgments of broader conventional wisdom, or the viewpoints of your more immediate community, or what’s considered cool by the dominant culture of your generation or the immediate culture within your closest group of friends.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6759\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"343\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6.png 568w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6-229x300.png 229w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6-457x600.png 457w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Sometimes you’ll get to the end of a Why-Because pathway only to find the philosophy in a famous novel, or something a celebrity hero of yours once said in an interview, or a strong opinion one of your professors always repeated.</p> \n<p>You might even find that some of your yearnings and fears were written by you…when you were seven years old.

But it’s time well spent—because you’re not your 7-year-old self, just like you’re not your parents or your friends or your generation or your society or your heroes or your past decisions or your recent circumstances. You’re Current-Age You—the only person, and the only version of yourself, who is actually qualified to want and not want the things you want and don’t want.</p> \n<p>To be clear, this isn’t to say that it’s wrong to live by the words of a wise parent or a famous philosopher or friends you respect or the convictions of a younger you. Humble people are by <em>definition </em>influence-able—influences are an important and inevitable part of who each of us is. The key distinction is this:</p> \n<p>Do you treat the words of your external influences as information, held and considered by an authentic inner you, that you’ve carefully decided to embrace? Or are your influences themselves actually in your brain, <em>masquerading as </em>inner you?</p> \n<p>Do you want the same thing someone else you know wants because you heard them talk about it, you thought about it alongside your own life experience, and you eventually decided that, for now, you agree? Or because you heard someone talk about what they want or fear, and you thought, “I don’t know shit and that person does, so if they say X is true, I’m sure they’re right”—and then you etched those ideas into your mind, never again feeling the need to question them?</p> \n<p>The former is what chefs do. The latter is what you do when you’re being an obedient robot. And a robot is what you become when at some point you get the idea in your head that someone else is more qualified to be you than you are.</p> \n<p>The good news is that all humans make this mistake—and you can fix it. Just like your subconscious is right there for viewing if you want to view it—it’s also there for changing and updating and rewriting. It’s your head—you’re allowed to do with it what you want.</p> \n<p>So it’s time for some evictions. Masked imposters have to go. Even mom and dad.</p> \n<p>At the end of this, your octopus may look a little barren, leaving you feeling a little like you don’t know who you even are anymore. We usually think of this as a bad feeling, or even an existential crisis, but it actually means you’re doing better than most people.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6802\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2.png 1135w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2-300x291.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2-768x744.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2-600x581.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The drop from naive over-confidence to wise, realistic humility never feels good, but pausing the roller coaster while it’s still on that first cliff and avoiding the pain—which turns out to be a lot of people’s move—isn’t a great strategy. Wisdom isn’t correlated with knowledge, it’s correlated with being in touch with reality—it’s not how far to the right you are on the graph, it’s how close you are to the orange line. Wisdom hurts at first, but it’s the only place where actual growth happens. The irony is that the cliff-pausers of the world like to make the wiser, braver valley-dwellers or continual-climbers feel bad about themselves—because they fundamentally don’t get how knowing yourself works. They haven’t reached that stage yet.</p> \n<p>Getting to know your real self is super hard and never complete. But if you’ve tumbled off the cliff, you’ve gone through a key rite of passage and progress is now possible. As you climb up the orange line, you’ll slowly but surely begin to repopulate your Yearning Octopus with your real self.</p> \n<p>At the moment, it probably won’t be obvious what those missing yearnings of yours are exactly—because they’re on an even deeper floor of your subconscious. They’re in the basement of the basement of the basement—in a place called Denial Prison.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Denial Prison</strong></span></p> \n<p>Our brain’s Denial Prison is a place most of us don’t even know is there—it’s where we put the parts of us we repress and deny.</p> \n<p>The authentic yearnings of ours that we’re in touch with—i.e. those that proved to be authentic during interrogation—were easy parts of our true selves to find in our subconscious, lying in plain sight, right below the surface of our consciousness. Even our conscious mind knows these yearnings well, because they frequently make their way upstairs into our thoughts. These are the parts of us we have a healthy relationship with.</p> \n<p>But then there are the parts of you that weren’t living on your octopus where they’re supposed to be—instead, you found an imposter in their place. These lost parts of you are often incredibly hard to access, because they’ve been living deep in your subconscious, on a floor so low it’s almost not there at all. Almost.</p> \n<p>Some parts of us are banished down on basement #3 because they’re extraordinarily painful for us to acknowledge or think about. Sometimes new parts of us are born only to be immediately locked up in prison as part of a denial of our own evolution—i.e. out of stubbornness. But there are other times when a part of us is in Denial Prison because someone <em>else</em> locked it up down there. In the case of your yearnings, some of them will have been put there by whatever masked intruder had been taking its place. If dad has successfully convinced you that you care deeply about having a prestigious career, he probably has also convinced you that the part of you that, deep down, really wants to be a carpenter isn’t really you and isn’t what you really want. At some point during your childhood, he threw your passion for carpentry into a dark, dank Denial Prison cell.</p> \n<p>So let’s gather your courage and head down to the basement of the basement of the basement of your mind and see what we find.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6821 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"566\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1.png 990w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1-300x265.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1-768x679.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1-600x530.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a></p> \n<p>You may pass some unpleasant characters.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6764\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2.png 551w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2-236x300.png 236w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2-472x600.png 472w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Leave them for another time—right now, search for locked-away career-related yearnings. Maybe you’ll find a repressed passion to teach. Or a desire to be famous that your particular tribe has shamed you out of. Or a deep love of long blocks of free, open leisure time that your hornier, greedier teenage self kicked downstairs in favor of a raging ambition.</p> \n<p>There will be certain parts of your authentic self you won’t be able to uncover in Denial Prison—it’s pretty dark down there. But be patient—now that you’ve done your audit and cleared space for them on your octopus, they may begin to emerge.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Priority Rankings</strong></span></p> \n<p>The other part of our Yearning Octopus audit will address the hierarchy of your yearnings. Almost as important as the yearnings themselves is the priority they’re given. The hierarchy is easy to see because it’s revealed in your actions. You may like to think a desire to do something bold is high up on your hierarchy, but if you’re not currently working on something bold, it reveals that however important boldness is to you, something else—some source of fear or inertia in you—is currently being prioritized above it.</p> \n<p>It’s important to remember that a ranking of yearnings is also a ranking of fears. The octopus contains anything that could make you want or not want to pursue a certain career, and the reverse side of each yearning is its accompanying fear of the opposite. The reverse side of your yearning to be admired is a fear of embarrassment. If you flip over your desire for self-actualization, you’ll see a fear of underachieving. The other half of your craving of self-esteem is a fear of feeling shame. If your actions don’t seem to match what you believe is the internal hierarchy of your yearnings, usually it’s because you’re forgetting to think about the role your fears are playing. What looks like a determined drive for success, for example, might actually be someone running <em>away </em>from a negative self-image or trying to escape feelings like envy or under-appreciation. If your actions seem beholden to yearnings that you don’t believe you actually care that much about, you’re probably not looking closely enough at your fears.</p> \n<p>With both yearnings and fears in mind, think about what your internal hierarchy might look like, and return that same important question: “Who made this order? Was it really me?”</p> \n<p>For example, we’re often told to “follow our passion”—this is society saying “put your passion yearnings at the top of your hierarchy.” That’s a very specific instruction. Maybe that’s the right thing for you, but it also very well might not be. It’s something you need to independently evaluate.</p> \n<p>To get this right, let’s try to do a fresh ranking, from first principles, based on who we really are, how we’ve evolved over time, and what really matters to us most, right now.</p> \n<p>This isn’t about which yearnings or fears have the loudest voices or which fears are most palpable—if it were, you’d be letting your impulses take the wheel of your life. The person doing the ranking is <em>you</em>—the little center of consciousness reading this post who can observe your octopus and look at it objectively. This involves another kind of compromise. On one side, you’ll try to tap into all the wisdom you’ve accumulated throughout your life and make active decisions about values—about what you really believe is <em>important</em>. On the other side, it’s about self-acceptance and self-compassion. Sometimes you’ll have strong undeniable yearnings that you’re not super proud of—whether you like it or not, those are part of you, and when you neglect them, they may cause a continual stink and make you miserable. Creating your yearning hierarchy is a give and take between what’s important and what’s you. It’s probably a good goal to give higher priority to your more noble qualities, but it’s okay to throw a bone to some of your not-so-noble sides as well—depending on where you decide to draw the line. There’s a wisdom to knowing when to accept your not-so-noble side and when to reject it entirely.</p> \n<p>To get all of this in order, we want a good system. You can play around with what works for you—I like the idea of a shelf:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6817\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"580\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png 943w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2-300x218.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2-768x557.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2-600x435.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>This divides things into five categories. The absolutely highest priority inner drives get to go in the extra special non-negotiable bowl. The NN bowl is for yearnings <i>so </i>important to you that you want to essentially guarantee that they’ll happen—at the expense of all other yearnings, if necessary. This is why so many of history’s legends were famously single-minded—they had a very intense NN bowl yearning and it led them to world fame, often at the expense of relationships, balance, and health. The bowl is small because it should be used very sparingly—if at all. Like maybe only one thing gets it. Or <i>maybe </i>two or three. Too many things in the NN bowl cancels out its power, making that the same as having nothing in the bowl at all.<span class=\"m_1544476509806979791gmail-Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> \n<p>Your group of top shelf yearnings is mostly what will drive your career choices—but top shelf placement should also be doled out sparingly (that’s why it’s not a very large shelf). Shelf placement is as much about de-prioritizing as it is about prioritizing. You’re not just choosing which parts of you are the most important to make you happy, you’re choosing which parts of you to intentionally leave wanting or even directly opposed. No matter what your hierarchy looks like, some yearnings will be left feeling very unhappy and some fears will feel like they’re being continually assaulted. This is inevitable.</p> \n<p>That’s why most yearnings should be on the middle shelf, the bottom shelf, or the trash can. The middle shelf is good for those not-so-noble qualities in you that you decide to accept. They deserve some of your attention. And they’ll often demand it—core parts of you won’t go quietly into non-prioritization, and they sometimes can really ruin your life if they’re neglected.</p> \n<p>Most of the rest will end up on the bottom shelf. Putting a part of you on the bottom shelf is telling it, “I know you want these things, but for now, I’ve decided other things are more important. I promise to revisit you a little later, after I’ve gotten some more information, and if I change my mind, you’ll get a shelf upgrade then.” The best way to think of the bottom shelf is this: the more yearnings you can convince to accept a bottom shelf rating, the better the chances your top shelf and NN bowl yearnings have of getting what they want. Likewise, the fewer yearnings you put on the <em>top</em> shelf, the more likely those on the top shelf will be to thrive. Your time and energy are severely limited, so this is a zero-sum compromise. The amateur mistake is to be too liberal with the NN bowl and top shelf and too sparing with the large bottom shelf.</p> \n<p>Then there’s the trash can, for the drives and fears you flat-out reject—those parts of you that fundamentally violate the person your wisest self wants to be. A good amount of inner conflict emerges from people’s trash cans, and trash can control is a major component of integrity and inner strength. But like the rest of your hierarchy decisions, your criteria for what qualifies as trash should be derived from your own deep thought, not from what others tell you is and is not trash.</p> \n<p>As you go through this difficult prioritizing process—inevitably, at times, against the screaming protests of unhappily deprioritized yearnings—remember that you’re the only wise one in the room. Yearnings and fears are impatient and bad at seeing the big picture. Even a seemingly high-minded yearning, like those on the moral tentacle, can’t understand the complete picture in the way you can. Many of the people who have done wonders to make the world better got there on a path that started with selfish motives like wealth or personal fulfillment—motives their moral tentacle probably hated at first. The octopus won’t be the wise adult in the room—that’s your job.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6789\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"477\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png 1487w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1-300x238.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1-768x610.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1-600x477.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Finally, as we’ll discuss more later, this is not a permanent decision. It’s the opposite—it’s a rough draft written in light pencil. It’s a hypothesis that you’ll be able to test and then revise based on how actually living this hierarchy feels in practice.</p> \n<p>Your Want Box is ready to go. Now let’s turn to your Reality Box.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Deep Analysis, Part 2: Your Reality Box</strong></span></p> \n<p>The Want Box deals with what you find desirable. The Reality Box deals with what’s <em>possible</em>.</p> \n<p>But when we examined the Want Box, it became clear that it’s not necessarily based on what you actually want—it’s based on what you <em>think </em>you want—what you’re in the <em>habit </em>of wanting.</p> \n<p>The Reality Box is the same deal. It doesn’t show you reality, it shows your best crack at what reality might be—your <em>perception </em>of reality.</p> \n<p>The goal of self-reflection is to bring both of these boxes as close to accuracy as possible. We want our perceived yearnings to be a true reflection of our authentic inner selves, and we want our beliefs about what’s possible to come close to mirroring what’s actually possible. For our Want Box audit, we looked under the hood of the Want Box and found its settings—your yearnings and fears. When we open the hood of your Reality Box, we see a group of <em>beliefs</em>.</p> \n<p>When it comes to your career possibilities, you’re dealing with two sets of beliefs: beliefs about the world and beliefs about your own potential. For a career option to qualify for your Reality Box, your potential in that career area has to measure up to the objective difficulty of achieving success in that area.</p> \n<p>Us being us, we’re probably pretty bad at assessing either side of this comparison accurately.</p> \n<p>I don’t know how you think about career path difficulty, but in my experience, people often see it like this:</p> \n<p>There are traditional careers—stuff like medicine or law or teaching or a corporate ladder, etc.—and these careers have predictable, set paths. If you’re decently smart and work hard, you’ll end up in a successful, stable situation.</p> \n<p>Then there are less traditional careers—the arts, entrepreneurship, non-profit work, politics, etc.—and these are wildcards. Success and stability are no guarantee, and to reach great heights, it’s either a lottery ticket game of luck, a genetic lottery game of innate talent, or some combination of the two.</p> \n<p>These are perfectly reasonable assumptions—if you live in 1952. Your beliefs about the world of careers and about what it takes to succeed need just as thorough an unmasking as your yearnings did—and I suspect that behind most of them, you’ll find big, fat conventional wisdom. You might first pull off the mask of one of your beliefs and find your parents or your friends or your college career coach—but if you keep going and pull on <em>their </em>face, you’ll usually see that it’s also a mask, and conventional wisdom is there hiding behind it. A general conception, a common opinion, an oft-cited statistic<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-7-6721\" id=\"note-7-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a>—none of which have actually been verified by you, but all of which are treated as gospel by society.</p> \n<p>Today’s world goes through dramatic changes each decade, which usually leaves conventional wisdom wildly outdated. But we’re wired for a more ancient world where almost nothing ever changed, so we all reason like cooks and treat conventional wisdom as equivalent to truth.</p> \n<p>These problems then extend to how we view our own potential. When you overrate the impact of innate talent on how people fare in their careers—and you also conflate talent and skill level—it won’t leave you feeling great about your chances at many paths. Because we better understand the trajectory of traditional careers, we’re less prone to do this with them. A first-year medical student sees an experienced surgeon at work and thinks, “I can get there one day—just need to do about 20 years of hard work.” But when a young artist or entrepreneur or software engineer looks at the equivalent of the experienced surgeon in their field, they’re more likely to think, “Wow look how talented they are—I’m nowhere near that good,” and get all hopeless. There’s also the other common notion, that people who thrive in non-traditional careers had some “big break” at some point, like hitting a lucky scratch card jackpot—and I don’t know many people who want to risk their careers on scratch cards.</p> \n<p>These are only a few examples of the slew of delusions and misconceptions we tend to have about how great careers happen. So let’s brainstorm how it might actually work:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>The Career Landscape</strong></span></p> \n<p>I have no idea, mostly. And I think most people have no idea. Things are just changing too quickly.</p> \n<p>But that’s kind of the key point. If you can figure out how to get a reasonably accurate picture of the real career landscape out there, you have a massive edge over everyone else, most of whom will be using conventional wisdom as their instruction booklet.</p> \n<p>First, there’s the broad landscape—the set of all the jobs someone could possibly have in today’s society. My current job description is: “Writer of 8,000-to-40,000-word articles about a bunch of different topics, with cursing and stick figures, on a remarkably sporadic schedule.” Think conventional wisdom has any job openings for me with that description? The landscape today is made up of thousands of options—some 40 years old, some made possible only three months ago because of the advent of some new technology—and the way things work today, if there’s an option you want that’s not already out there, you can probably create it for yourself. Pretty stressful, but also incredibly exciting.</p> \n<p>Then, there’s each specific career path. A career path is like a game board. The conventional wisdom bookshelf contains instruction booklets for only a small fraction of today’s available game boards—and those that it does have usually tell you how that game was played in the past, even though the current game board has evolved significantly into something with new kinds of opportunities and different rules and loopholes. When you consider a career path today, to make an accurate assessment of what the path looks like and what kinds of strength-weakness profiles it favors, you have to understand what that career’s current game board looks like. Otherwise, it’s like trying to evaluate your chances of being a professional basketball player based on your height and strength without realizing that, say, basketball has evolved and is now played on oversize courts that contain 10 different 7-foot hoops, and the current game favors speed over height and strength.</p> \n<p>This is promising news. There are likely dozens of awesome career paths that beautifully match your natural strengths, <em>and </em>it’s likely that most other people trying to succeed on those paths are playing with an outdated rulebook and strategy guide. If you simply understand what the game board really looks like and play by modern rules, you have a huge advantage.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Your Potential</strong></span></p> \n<p>And this brings us to you and your particular strengths. Not only do we assess our strengths based on the wrong game boards (like in our basketball example)—even when we have the <em>right </em>game board in mind, we’re often bad at identifying the real strengths that that game calls for.</p> \n<p>When assessing your chances on a certain career path, the key question is:</p> \n<p><em>With enough time, could you get good enough at this game to potentially reach whatever your definition of success is in that career?</em></p> \n<p>I like to view this journey to “good enough at the game to succeed” as a distance. The distance starts with where you are now—point A—and ends with you reaching your definition of success, which we can draw with a star.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6766\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1.png 958w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1-300x65.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1-768x168.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1-600x131.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The length of the distance depends on where point A is (how far along you are at the current moment) and where the star is (how lofty your definition of success is).</p> \n<p>So if you’re a college graduate who majored in computer science and your career goal is to be a middle-of-the-ladder engineer at Google, your distance might look like this:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6767\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1.png 958w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1-300x65.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1-768x168.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1-600x131.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p>But if you’ve never done any kind of computer science before, and your career goal is to be the top engineer at Google, you’ve got a much longer road ahead:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6768\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1.png 958w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1-300x65.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1-768x168.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1-600x131.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p>If your goal is to create the new Google, the road gets much, much longer.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6791\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"196\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2.png 958w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2-300x65.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2-768x168.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2-600x131.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p>At this point, conventional wisdom might emerge as a voice in your head and point out that simply getting good enough at a certain skill doesn’t actually guarantee success—you might reach the star on a career path and still find that you haven’t “made it” yet.</p> \n<p>That’s mostly wrong, because it’s misunderstanding the star. The star isn’t about a particular skill level—e.g. coding ability or acting skills or business savvy—it’s about the entire <em>game</em>. In traditional careers, the games tend to be more straightforward—if you want to be a top surgeon, and you get incredibly good at surgery, you’ve probably hit your star and you’ll have your career. But the game boards in less traditional careers often involve many more factors. Reaching the “I want to be a famous actor” star doesn’t simply mean getting as good at acting as Morgan Freeman, it means getting as good at the entire actor <em>game </em>as most movie stars get by the time they break through. Acting ability is only one piece of that puzzle—you also need a knack for getting yourself in front of people with power, a shrewdness for personal branding, an insane amount of optimism, a ridiculous amount of hustle and persistence, etc. If you get good enough at that <em>whole </em>game—every component of it—your chances of becoming an A-list movie star are actually pretty high. <em>That’s </em>what hitting the star means.</p> \n<p>But conventional wisdom doesn’t get how non-traditional careers work—it only thinks in terms of a narrow aspect of success: talent and hard work. When career paths have game boards with much more going on, conventional wisdom just throws its hands up and calls it “luck.” To conventional wisdom, becoming a movie star requires some talent, but mostly, hitting a rare scratch ticket jackpot.</p> \n<p>So how do you figure out your chances of getting to any particular star? It’s all about a simple formula:</p> \n<p>Distance = Speed x Time.</p> \n<p>In our case, the more apt wording might be:</p> \n<p>Progress = Pace x Persistence.</p> \n<p>Your outlook on any career quest depends on A) the pace at which you’ll be able to improve at playing that career’s “game” and B) the amount of time you’re willing to persist in chasing that star. Let’s talk about both of these:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Pace</strong></span></p> \n<p>What makes someone slower or faster at improving at a career game? I’d say it comes down to three factors:</p> \n<p><strong>Your level of chefness. </strong>As we discussed earlier, chefs look at the world with fresh eyes and build conclusions based on what they observe and what they’ve experienced. Cooks arrive at conclusions by following someone else’s recipe—in the case of careers, the recipe is usually conventional wisdom. Careers are complex games that almost everyone starts off bad at—then the chefs improve rapidly through a continual loop…</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6796\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png 1639w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1-300x268.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1-768x687.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1-600x537.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /></a></p> \n<p>…while cooks improve at a snail’s pace, because their strategy is just following a recipe which itself barely changes. What’s more, in a world where career games are constantly evolving and morphing, the chef’s tactics can evolve in real time and keep up. Meanwhile, the cook’s recipe just grows more and more outdated—a problem they remain oblivious to. This is why I’m pretty convinced that at least for less traditional careers, your level of chefness is the single most important factor in determining your pace of improvement.</p> \n<p><strong>Your work ethic. </strong>This one is obvious. Someone who works on their career 60 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, is going to move down the path almost four times faster than someone who works 20 hours a week, 40 weeks a year. Someone who chooses a balanced lifestyle will move slower than a single-minded workaholic. Someone with a propensity towards laziness or procrastination is going to lose a lot of ground to someone who’s good at putting in consistent work days. Someone who frequently breaks from work to daydream or pick up their phone is going to get less done in each work hour than someone who practices deep focus.</p> \n<p><strong>Your natural abilities. </strong>Talent does matter. Smarter, more talented people will improve at a game at a faster rate than less naturally gifted people. But intelligence and talent are only two types of natural ability that come into play here. Cleverness and savvy matter too, and those qualities don’t always correlate with raw intelligence. Depending on the type of career, social skills can be critically important as well. In many careers, likable (or subtly manipulative) people have a big advantage over less likable people—and those who enjoy socializing will put in more people hours over time, and build deeper relationships, than antisocial types.</p> \n<p>Other things, like existing connections, existing resources, and existing skills matter, of course, but they’re not components of pace—they’re part of the location of point A.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Persistence</strong></span></p> \n<p>When I say persistence, I’m referring to long-term persistence (as opposed to day-to-day work ethic). Persistence is simpler than pace. The more years you’re willing to commit to chasing a star, the farther along the road towards the star you’ll get. A car going 30 mph that quits driving after 15 minutes gets a lot less far than a car that drives 10 mph for two hours.</p> \n<p>And this is why persistence is so important. Someone who has decided they’re only willing to give a dream career a shot for three years before they’ll go for their fallback plan has essentially disqualified themselves from a chance at their dreams. It doesn’t matter how awesome you are—if you’ll give up after two or three years of not breaking through, you’re unlikely to succeed. A few years is just not enough time to traverse the typically long distances it takes to get to the raddest success stars, no matter how impressive your pace.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Your Real Strengths and W</strong><strong>eaknesses</strong></span></p> \n<p>With our pace-times-persistence equation in mind, let’s revisit the concept of strengths and weaknesses. It’s not that “strengths and weaknesses” is a bad concept—it’s that we think about it all wrong. When we list our strengths, we tend to list our areas of existing skill more than anything else. Instead, strengths should be all about pace and persistence qualities. Originality or lack thereof should be a critical component of the discussion, making qualities like agility and humility (trademark chef traits) notable strengths, and qualities like stubbornness<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-8-6721\" id=\"note-8-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> or intellectual laziness (classic cook traits) important weaknesses. The subtleties of work ethic, like a knack for deep focus or a propensity to procrastinate, should also be a major part of the discussion, as should natural abilities beyond talent, like savvy and likability. Qualities related to persistence, like resilience and determination and patience, should be thought of as promising strengths, while a social tentacle clamoring to appear successful as quickly as possible should be viewed as a bright red flag.</p> \n<p>Most importantly, these items shouldn’t be discussed as a snapshot of where they are now, but rather in terms of your <em>potential for improvement</em> in each of them. If you handed 25-year-old Michael Jordan a basketball for the first time, he’d suck. But calling basketball a “weakness” of his would be getting it very wrong. Instead, you’d want to watch him practice over the next six weeks and evaluate the slope of his improvement. This lesson applies to specific skills—but most general pace and persistence qualities can <em>also</em> be worked on and improved if you focus on them.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Filling in the Reality Box</strong></span></p> \n<p>Your true Reality Box would literally include all career paths for which you think a highly improved version of yourself could, with an entire lifetime of effort, reach the minimum star you’d be comfortable defining as success. This would be an impossibly big list, only ruling out paths that are clearly far too long for you to traverse at your maximum possible pace on the path (like me chasing a career as an Olympic figure skater). But it’s still useful to pause for a minute and reflect on the vast extent of your full Reality Box—just acknowledging how many options are truly open to you can put you in the right mindset.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-9-6721\" id=\"note-9-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></p> \n<p>So to be a bit more efficient, let’s worry about the parts of the Reality Box that might actually end up in your Option Pool (the middle of the Venn diagram where the Want and Reality Boxes overlap). To complete our Reality Box audit with that caveat, we need to evaluate:</p> \n<p><strong>1) The general landscape. </strong>Take our best crack at evaluating the world’s current career landscape—the full range of options available (or create-able).</p> \n<p><strong>2) Specific game boards.</strong> For any careers that sound remotely interesting, ponder what the deal might be with that career’s current game board—the parties involved, the way success seems to be happening for others recently, the most up-to-date rules of the game, the latest new loopholes that are being exploited, etc.</p> \n<p><strong>3) Starting point.</strong> For those paths, evaluate your starting point, based on your current skills, resources, and connections relevant to that field.</p> \n<p><strong>4) Success point.</strong> Think about end points and where on each line your star should be placed. Ask yourself what’s the minimum level of success you’d need to achieve in order to feel happy about having chosen that career path.</p> \n<p><strong>5) Your pace.</strong> Make an initial estimate for what your pace of improvement might be on these various game boards, based on your current pace-related strengths and how much you think you can improve at each of them (in other words, how much your speed might be able to <em>accelerate</em>).</p> \n<p><strong>6) Your level of persistence.</strong> Evaluate the amount of time you think you’ll be willing to put into each of these respective paths.</p> \n<p>Now it’s just math. You take your game board and make it a line, you plot starting points and success stars that together generate the various distances in front of you, and for each, you multiply your pace by your level of persistence. If it seems like the product of your pace and persistence for a given career path might be able to measure up to the path’s total length, that career lands in your Reality Box. Of course, it’s impossible to get exact values for any of the above factors, but it’s good to at least know the equation you’re working with.</p> \n<p>A from-first-principles Reality Box audit may bring some overly optimistic people down to Earth, but I suspect that for most, an audit will leave them feeling like they have a lot more options than they realized, empowering them to set their sights on a bolder direction.</p> \n<p>A good Reality Box reflection warrants yet another Want Box reflection. Reframing a bunch of career paths in your mind will affect your level of yearning for some of them. One career may seem less appealing after reminding yourself that it will entail thousands of hours of networking or multiple decades of pre-success struggle. Another may seem less daunting after changing your mind about how much luck is actually involved. There will be other career paths you hadn’t considered wanting because you hadn’t considered them as real options, but some deep reflection has opened your mind to them.</p> \n<p>This brings us to the end of our long, two-part deep dive. After a fairly exhausting box-auditing process, we can return to our Venn<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-10-6721\" id=\"note-10-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a> diagram.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6771\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1.png 1586w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1-300x191.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1-768x490.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1-600x383.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Assuming some things have changed, you have a new Option Pool to look at—a new list of options on the table that seem both desirable to your high-priority rankings and possible to achieve.

With these options in front of us, we’re ready to lift our heads up out of analysis and look forward into the future.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Connecting the Dots into the Future</strong></span></p> \n<p>It’s time to bring back your Career Plans map that I made you put down at the beginning of the post—the one with the arrow or the question mark.

If so, congrats—you’re ahead of most of us.</p> \n<p>If not, well that’s shitty news, but it’s also good news.

Major step in the right direction. Cross out the arrow and join the question mark crowd.</p> \n<p>Now the question mark crowd has a tough choice. You gotta pick one of the arrows in the Option Pool.</p> \n<p>It’s a tough choice—but it should be <em>way less tough </em>than it is. Here’s why:</p> \n<p>Careers used to be kind of like a 40-year tunnel. You picked your tunnel, and once you were in, that was that. You worked in that profession for 40 years or so before the tunnel spit you out on the other side into your retirement.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6787\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png 1100w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2-300x232.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2-768x593.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2-600x464.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The truth is, careers have probably never really functioned like 40-year-tunnels, they just seemed that way. At best, traditional careers of the past played out <em>kind </em>of like tunnels.</p> \n<p>Today’s careers—especially the less traditional ones—are really really not like tunnels. But crusty old conventional wisdom has a lot of us still viewing things that way, which makes the already hard job of making big career path choices much harder.</p> \n<p>When you think of your career as a tunnel, it causes an identity crisis in anyone who doesn’t feel sure of who exactly they are and who they’ll want to be decades from now—which is most sane people. It enhances the delusion that what we do for work is a synonym for who we are, making a question mark on your map seem like an existential disaster.</p> \n<p>When you think of your career as a tunnel, the stakes to make the right choice seem so high that it explodes the feeling of tyranny of choice. For perfectionist types especially, this can be utterly paralyzing.</p> \n<p>When you think of your career as a tunnel, you lose the courage to make a career switch, even when your soul is begging for it. It makes switching careers feel incredibly risky and embarrassing, and it suggests that someone who does so is a failure. It also makes all kinds of multi-faceted, vibrant, mid-career people feel like they’re too old to make a bold switch or start a whole new path afresh.</p> \n<p>But conventional wisdom still tells many of us that careers are tunnels. As the icing on its shit cake—on top of helping us yearn for things we don’t actually want, deny yearnings that we feel deep down, fear things that aren’t dangerous, and believe things about the world and our potential that aren’t accurate—conventional wisdom tells us that careers are a tunnel to help us daunt the shit out of ourselves unnecessarily.</p> \n<p>Today’s career landscape isn’t a lineup of tunnels, it’s a massive, impossibly complex, rapidly changing science laboratory. Today’s people aren’t synonymous with what they do—they’re impossibly complex, rapidly changing scientists. And today’s career isn’t a tunnel, or a box, or an identity label—it’s a long series of science experiments.</p> \n<p>Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compared</a> life to connecting the dots, pointing out that while it’s easy to look at your past and see how the dots connected to lead you to where you are, it’s basically impossible in life to connect the dots forwards.</p> \n<p>If you look at the biographies of your heroes, you’ll see that their paths look a lot more like a long series of connected dots than a straight and predictable tunnel. If you look at yourself and your friends, you’ll probably see the same trend—according to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170420130623/https://www.bls.gov/news.release/tenure.nr0.htm\">data</a>, the median time a young person stays in a given job is only 3 years (older people spend a longer time on each dot, but not that much longer—10.4 years on average).</p> \n<p>So seeing your career as a series of dots isn’t a mental trick to help you make decisions—it’s an accurate depiction of what’s actually happening. And seeing your career as a tunnel isn’t just unproductive—it’s delusional.</p> \n<p>Likewise, you’re limited to focusing mainly on the next dot on your path—because it’s the only dot you <em>can </em>figure out. You don’t have to worry about dot #4 because you can’t anyway—you’re literally not qualified to do so.</p> \n<p>By the time dot #4 rolls around, you will have learned stuff about yourself you don’t know now. You’ll also have changed from who you are now, and your Yearning Octopus will reflect those changes. You’ll know a lot more than you currently do about the career landscape and the specific game boards you’re interested in, and you’ll have become a much better game player. And of course, that landscape—and those game boards—will have themselves evolved.</p> \n<p>The fantastic website <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">80,000 Hours</a> (which exists to help young, talented people work through their career choices) has compiled a lot of data to back this up: data on the fact that <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/02/we-change-more-than-we-expect-so-keep-your-options-open/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you’ll change</a>, that <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/02/which-careers-will-be-automated/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the world will change</a>, and that <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you’ll only learn with time what you’re actually good at</a>. Popular psychologist Dan Gilbert also eloquently <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">describes</a> just how bad we are at predicting what will make us happy in the future.</p> \n<p>Pretending you can figure out what dot #2 or #4 or #8 should be now is laughable. Future dots are the worry of a future, wiser you living in a future world. So let’s focus on dot #1.</p> \n<p>If we’re thinking of ourselves as scientists and of society as a science lab, we should think of your current freshly revised Want-Reality Venn Diagram as nothing more than an early, rough hypothesis. Dot #1 is your chance to test it out.</p> \n<p>Hypothesis testing is intuitive in the dating world. If a friend were toiling over what kind of person she wants to marry but never went out with anyone, you’d tell her, “You can’t figure this out on your couch—you’ve gotta start going on dates, and that’ll teach you what you want in a partner.” If that friend then went on a solid first date and returned home to toil for hours about whether or not this new person was The One, you’d again have to correct her. You’d say, “There’s no way you can know that from just one date! You have to get some experience dating this person to learn what you need to learn to make that decision.”</p> \n<p>We can all agree that this hypothetical friend is pretty nuts and is lacking a fundamental understanding of how you find a happy relationship. So let’s not be like her when it comes to picking our career. Dot #1 is a chill situation—it’s just a first date.</p> \n<p>This is awesome news—because it makes it a lot less scary to draw an arrow on your map if it’s only an arrow to dot #1 of your future. The real cause of tyranny of choice is accurately seeing the sheer number of options you have in today’s world while delusionally seeing those careers as the 40-year tunnels of yesterday’s world. That’s a lethal combo. Reframing your next major career decision as a far lower-stakes choice makes the number of options exciting, not stressful.</p> \n<p>And that’s all great in theory. But now comes the hard part.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Making Your Move</strong></span></p> \n<p>You’ve reflected and reflected and reflected and weighed and measured and predicted and considered. You’ve chosen a dot and drawn an arrow. And now you have to actually make the move.</p> \n<p>We’re super bad at this. We’re frightened people. We don’t like icky things and making a bold, real-life step is icky. If there’s any ounce of procrastination susceptibility in us, here’s where it’ll show itself.</p> \n<p>The Yearning Octopus can help. As we discussed earlier, your behavior at any given point simply displays the configuration of your octopus. If you’ve decided on a life step and you can’t quite take it, it’s because the parts of you that don’t want to make a move are ranked higher in your subconscious than the parts of you that do. Your conscious mind may have tried to assign lower shelf ratings to the parts of your octopus that lean towards inertia, but your yearnings have rebelled. You’re a CEO not in control of their staff.</p> \n<p>To fix this problem, think like a kindergarten teacher. In your class, a faction of the 5-year-olds is rebelling against your wishes. What do you do?</p> \n<p>Go talk to the 5-year-olds that are causing the trouble. They’re unpleasant, defiant simpletons, but they can still be reasoned with. Talk to them about why you’ve ranked them lower than others in the octopus hierarchy. Describe to them the insights you gained from your Reality Box reflection. Remind them about how connecting the dots works and about the chillness of dot #1. You’re the teacher—figure it out.</p> \n<p>The older I get, the clearer it becomes that our internal battle as the kindergarten teachers of our mind is like 97% of life’s struggle. The world is easy—<em>you’re </em>difficult. If you find yourself continually not executing your plans in life and your promises to yourself, you’ve uncovered your new #1 priority—becoming a better kindergarten teacher. Until you do, your life will be run by a bunch of primitive, short-sighted 5-year-olds, and your whole shit will suck. Trust me, I know.</p> \n<p>If your inner analysis does call for a career leap to a new dot, I hope that at some point, you’re able to make the jump.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>After the Move</strong></span></p> \n<p>Jumping to a new dot is a liberating feeling, usually side by side with some substantial internal havoc.</p> \n<p>First of all, for a while at least, you’ll probably suck at what you’re doing on your new dot. While your wise self will know that’s exactly how it should be, your less wise selves will go into full existential meltdown mode. All of the fears you so thoughtfully deprioritized in your octopus ranking will think someone is murdering them and they’ll start trying to call 911. The yearnings you did prioritize won’t be feeling much gratification yet, and they’ll wonder if they were wrong all along about what they thought they wanted. The yearnings you didn’t prioritize will get out the guitar and start singing love songs for the greener-seeming grass you deprived them of. It won’t be much fun.</p> \n<p>Even if things do go well, you’ll be quickly reminded of the fact that the Yearning Octopus is a generally unhappy creature. Core pieces of the octopus will feel neglected or even assaulted, and every day that goes by, you’ll be bearing the opportunity cost of the paths you were considering but chose not to walk down—the versions of you in parallel universes where you made other choices. You’ll think about their hypothetical advancement in the world and worry about what you may have passed up.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6788\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"631\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png 1200w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2-300x237.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2-768x605.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2-600x473.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>As you get wiser, you’ll learn to view a largely unhappy octopus with acceptance. You’ll let it whine and get good at tuning it out, knowing that it’s whining in the exact way you planned for it to be.</p> \n<p>The whining octopus is a reminder of why pure, elated happiness is never a reasonable goal. The times you feel pure happiness are temporary, drug-induced delusions—like the honeymoon phase of a new relationship or new job or the high following a long-awaited success. Those moments are the perfect golf shots of a mediocre golfer’s outing—they’re awesome, and you should enjoy the shit out of them—but they’re not the new normal, and they never will be.</p> \n<p>A better goal is contentment: the satisfying feeling that you’re currently taking the best crack you can at a good life path; that what you’re working on might prove to be a piece of an eventual puzzle you can feel really proud of. Chasing happiness is an amateur move. Feeling contentment in those times when your choices and your circumstances have combined to pull it off, and knowing you have all that you could ever ask for, is for the wise.</p> \n<p>People talk about being present in the moment, but there’s also the broader concept of macro-presence: feeling broadly present in your own life. If you’re on a career dot that, when you’re being really honest with yourself, feels right, you get to stop thinking and stop planning for a while and just dig in. You’ll come back to the big picture later—for now, you can put the macro picture aside, put your head down, and dedicate all of your energy to the present. For a while, you can just <em>live</em>.</p> \n<p>These moments don’t always last that long, so sink your teeth in. Put everything you’ve got into the dot you’ve chosen. As far as you know, you might be Michael Jordan holding his first basketball, so start playing.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>The Next Dot?</strong></span></p> \n<p>At some point, your good feelings about the macro picture may sour. And when they do, you’ll have to get back into analysis mode and figure out what, in particular, is causing the restlessness.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, the macro mission won’t be the problem. It’ll be that the chef in you has decided that the mission itself calls for a strategic dot jump. In these cases, jumping dots isn’t a release of persistence but the <em>stuff </em>of persistence. This is the <em>mission-enhancing</em> type of dot jump.</p> \n<p>Other times, you’ll feel a darker kind of restlessness—the suspicion that you may need to change up the macro mission. When this happens, you’ll have to figure out if that feeling is emerging from the wise parts of you or simply from your restless, deprioritized yearnings. A <em>mission-changing </em>dot jump may be in order, but depending on which parts of you are asking for it, it may also be the wrong move.</p> \n<p>In these moments, it’s important to consider where you tend to be on this spectrum:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6775\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png 900w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum-300x99.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum-768x253.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum-600x198.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The people on the left side of this spectrum are jump-shy. The cement-footed. Their pitfall is staying way too long in the wrong things. The people on the right are jump-happy—the wing-footed—and they have the opposite pitfall: they’re quick quitters.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=6721#footnote-11-6721\" id=\"note-11-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> (You should be especially wary of cement feet—psychologists believe that people at the end of their lives are most likely to regret living by inertia: a commonly voiced regret is <a href=\"https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/12/top-career-regrets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“I wish I had quit earlier,”</a> and the most common advice of the elderly is, “<a href=\"https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2013/04/most-important-life-lesson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Don’t stay in a job you dislike.</a>“)</p> \n<p>This is why these internal frameworks are important. They give you the ability to analyze the source of your impulses. In our example, the question is whether your impulse to jump missions is the result of genuine evolution or quick-quitter bias. So think about your diagram. Is your restlessness just the expected incessant whining of an octopus still correctly configured? The weariness from a long trudge on what’s still the right path for you? Or have you learned new information about yourself or the world during the trudge that has corrected some off-base initial assumptions? Or maybe something is fundamentally evolving—some blue or yellow <em>loop </em>activity:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6804\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"790\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small.png 2500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small-300x263.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small-768x674.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small-600x527.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p>If you feel that things have genuinely changed, you may decide to zoom out even further and think about the big red loop, which deals with fundamentally changing your mission:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-6805\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"790\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png 2500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small-300x263.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small-768x674.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small-600x527.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> \n<p>If a career is like connecting the dots, we should probably rank “getting wise about dot-jumping” pretty high on our to-do list. The best place to start is by looking at your own past. Studying your own past decisions, with the flashlight of hindsight and accumulated wisdom, is like an athlete studying game tape.</p> \n<p>Looking at my own past, I can see a lot of dot jumps (or, while I was still in school, career plan adjustments), and some of them look pretty unwise in retrospect. But the clearer a picture I can see of my past bad decisions and the thought patterns and behavioral habits that built them, the less likely I’ll be to repeat them in the future.</p> \n<p>Remembering that you’re kind of dumb is also a critical humbling exercise. The insecurity of humility doesn’t feel very good, and the burden of having to continually invent your own life map is never easy—but insecurity and difficulty are the feelings of driving your own ship. It’s when we feel too good that we run the risk of becoming overconfident, intellectually complacent, and set in our ways. It’s exactly when we think we have life all figured out that we end up losing our way.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p>Over the course of your life, your good and bad decisions will collaborate to forge your unique life path. Often on this blog, I’ve written about how irrational our fears can be and how badly they can hold us back. But we should probably embrace the fear of end-of-life regret.</p> \n<p>I’ve thankfully never been on anything that felt like a deathbed, but it seems like there’s something about the end of life that lets people see things with clear eyes. It seems like facing death makes all of those voices in your head who aren’t actually you melt away, leaving your little authentic self standing there all alone, in reflection. I think end-of-life regrets may simply be your authentic self thinking about the parts of your life you never got to live—the parts of you that someone else kicked down into your subconscious.</p> \n<p>My own psyche seems to back this up—looking back on my path so far, the mistakes that bother me most are the ones that happened because someone else took the wheel of my head and overruled the quiet, insecure voice of my authentic self—the mistakes that I knew at the time, deep down, were wrong. My goal for the future isn’t to avoid mistakes, it’s for the mistakes I do make to be my own.</p> \n<p>That’s why I went through such an excruciatingly rigorous analysis in this post. I think this is one of those few topics in life that’s worth it. Other voices will never stop fiercely trying to live your life for you—you owe it to that little insecure character in the very center of your consciousness to get this right.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you’re into Wait But Why, sign up for the <strong><a class=\"ClickPico PicoRule\">Wait But Why email list</a></strong> and we’ll send you the new posts right when they come out.

To live in Newton, there were only two requirements: you had to be a Red Sox fan and you had to be a Democrat. I was both, so things were chill.</p> \n<p>When I was six, my second-grade classroom voted on the 1988 presidential election by&nbsp;circling either “Michael Dukakis” or “George Bush” on a little sheet of paper, folding it, and placing it into a shoebox on the teacher’s desk. It was the first time I had been sentient for a big political event.&nbsp;Later that day, the teacher revealed the results:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Dukakis 20, Bush 1</strong></p> \n<p>Duh. Dukakis was the nice good guy candidate and Bush was the bad guy candidate. I still don’t know who the one sick fuck was who voted for the bad guy, but other than that, the results made sense. Pretty boring.</p> \n<p>Then the actual election happened and—somehow—<em>Bush won</em>.</p> \n<p>I was floored. What kind of medieval shit did my country just pull? How could so many people have gotten it so obviously wrong?</p> \n<p>I assumed when I was older and understood the world better, it would make more sense.</p> \n<p>But I got older, and the storyline stayed the same. There was the Obviously Good Party, who cared about poor people and black people and flowers and smiles—and the Obviously Bad Party, who were all these two men, teaching their sons about offshore bank accounts.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-watch-ad.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8427 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-watch-ad-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-watch-ad-600x400.jpg 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-watch-ad-768x512.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-watch-ad-750x500.jpg 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-watch-ad-103x70.jpg 103w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1-watch-ad.jpg 1425w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p>And every election, the vote would split very near 50/50. I figured there really just were a lot of bad people in my country. Shame.</p> \n<p>Then I went to college. It was 2000. Bush-Gore year. While everyone I grew up with was obviously rooting as hard as possible for Gore to win, it began to dawn on me that I&nbsp;had made a very strange group of new friends in college. Some of them were rooting for Gore, but they hated certain things about his beliefs. Others disliked&nbsp;<em>both&nbsp;</em>candidates. And some of them were fervently rooting for&nbsp;<em>Bush,&nbsp;</em>even though they had previously seemed like reasonable people.</p> \n<p>I knew exactly where I stood, of course, and made my opinion clear. When I explained that I was unquestionably voting for Gore, instead of giving me a high five, my friends asked me why. I had all kinds of explanations, but when they’d push me to&nbsp;talk in specifics, I’d run into a problem.</p> \n<p>I didn’t really know the specifics.</p> \n<p>I knew Gore was&nbsp;the better choice, just like I knew the Democratic Party was the better party—but when pressed about my underlying reasons for liking any specific policy of Gore’s,&nbsp;I’d end up in an uncomfortable place.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Gore will be much better for the poor.</em></strong></p> \n<p><em>Why?</em></p> \n<p><strong><em>Because he&nbsp;won’t cut taxes for the rich as much and&nbsp;there will be more money for social programs.</em></strong></p> \n<p><em>Which social programs are you talking about? What about them do you think has worked well? Why are you so sure increased government spending on those programs is the best way to help the poor? And why are you so confident that tax cuts for the rich don’t end up positively affecting poor people?</em></p> \n<p><strong><em>Um well Gore will be better for the environment.&nbsp;</em></strong></p> \n<p><em>How so?</em></p> \n<p><strong><em>He talks about it more and seems to care about it more.</em></strong></p> \n<p><em>Right but what kinds of policies do you hope he’ll put in place that Bush won’t? And do you think government regulations or incentives will accomplish more than a market solution like a carbon tax?</em></p> \n<p>Well fucking shit. When continually pressed, my underlying reasoning for my positions would always seem to boil down to some combination of, “Because that’s what seems intuitive to me based on what everyone I know has always said” and “Because&nbsp;the Democrats are the good guys”.</p> \n<p>Being challenged by people who didn’t agree with me made me realize I didn’t actually <em>know</em> anything—I just strongly <em>believed</em>&nbsp;a bunch of things.</p> \n<p>I didn’t know anything because I hadn’t ever needed to know anything to feel like I had all the answers, and I hadn’t ever been interested enough in the workings of government to put in the serious effort to truly understand it. All I knew was how to articulate the beliefs I assumed were right, in a pretty surface way.</p> \n<p>I had always thought of myself as a well-educated thinker, an independent thinker, and a thinker whose opinions were based on evidence and facts—but freshman year, I was smacked over the head with the truth about myself. When it came to politics, at least, I wasn’t really a thinker at all.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> \n<p>If I had to describe politics in modern societies, I’d say it’s—how should I put this—it’s a fucking nightmare. It’s just awful, for basically everyone. It makes us angry. It makes us anxious. It makes us hateful. It makes us our worst selves.</p> \n<p>But why?</p> \n<p>Politics is just the domain of how people live and work and make decisions together, which on its face seems like a fascinating puzzle—a joint project each society works on together, for all of their benefit. Sure, it’s contentious and involves competition and disagreement, but there are a lot of worlds like that that aren’t a fucking nightmare and don’t consistently bring out our worst selves: science, sports, tech, entrepreneurship, and the arts, to name a few. What is it about politics that makes it so much more miserable than all of those other vibrant centers of human development?</p> \n<p>Let’s pull out our tools and discuss.</p> \n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Politics, in 2D</strong></p> \n<p>I don’t know about other countries, but the entire U.S. talks about politics as if it’s one-dimensional:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-political-spectrum.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8426\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-political-spectrum.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"103\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-political-spectrum.png 1360w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-political-spectrum-600x83.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-political-spectrum-768x106.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2-political-spectrum-750x103.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> \n<p>In this chapter, let’s try looking at politics in 2D instead. We spent <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chapter 7</a> talking about the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/15.6-ladder-ZEA.png\">Thinking Ladder</a>. What would a Political Ladder look like?</p> \n<div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n <h3>The Probably Time For a Refresher Blue Box</h3> \n <p>We started this series by defining what I see as two fundamental elements of the human psyche.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.1-PM-HM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8659\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.1-PM-HM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"899\" height=\"736\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.1-PM-HM.png 899w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.1-PM-HM-600x491.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.1-PM-HM-768x629.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.1-PM-HM-750x614.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px\" /></a></p> \n <p>I call them “minds,” but really, they just represent two states a person (or group of people) can be in. When the Primitive Mind is in control in our minds, we’re often not being our best selves, not making very good choices, and not especially self-aware about what we’re doing or why. When the Higher Mind is in control, we’re being more of a grown-up. It’s not binary though—it’s more of a tug-of-war between the two states. The tug-of-war ebbs and flows in each of us and often, we’re somewhere in the middle.</p> \n <p>The Psych Spectrum is our way of visualizing the state of this tug-of-war. When the Higher Mind has a strong presence in our heads, we’re higher up on the spectrum. When the Higher Mind’s voice gets lost in the fog of a riled up Primitive Mind, we sink lower down on the spectrum.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.2-Psych-Spectrum.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8660 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.2-Psych-Spectrum-264x600.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"292\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.2-Psych-Spectrum-264x600.png 264w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.2-Psych-Spectrum-768x1745.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.2-Psych-Spectrum-330x750.png 330w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.2-Psych-Spectrum.png 972w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px\" /></a></p> \n <p>I find that when I’m thinking about any What of life—what we do, what we say, what we think—things make a lot more sense once I bring the Psych Spectrum into my thought process. The ladder is our way of doing this visually. If we simplify any What of life so we can represent its possibilities on a one-dimensional, horizontal spectrum, we can then slap the Psych Spectrum onto it as a vertical y-axis. The resulting <em>square</em> forces us to add another dimension to our thinking and reconsider the What of life alongside the question, “but how is the Psych Spectrum affecting what’s happening here?”</p> \n <p>I call the square a ladder because thinking of it in terms of rungs focuses the discussion in on the Psych Spectrum, which is the skill I want us to gain in this series.</p> \n <p>To define the rungs of any ladder, we need to start by asking ourselves how the Higher and Primitive Minds “do” that part of life. This defines the y-axis’s two extremes. Each person, in thinking about their own psyche, might define it a little differently. When it comes to our intellectual lives, I see the Higher Mind as motivated to seek truth (because that’s the rational thing to want) and the Primitive Mind as motivated to confirm what it already believes (because that was the best way for a human to survive 50,000 years ago). My specific definition of each rung of the resulting Thinking Ladder is derived from those two definitions (I call the Thinking Ladder’s y-axis the “How You Think” axis for clarity—but it’s really just “the Psych Spectrum, as it applies to thinking”):</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.3-thinking-ladder.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8661\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.3-thinking-ladder.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"737\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.3-thinking-ladder.png 1860w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.3-thinking-ladder-600x520.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.3-thinking-ladder-768x666.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2.3-thinking-ladder-750x650.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /></a></p> \n</div> \n<p>So what would a Political Ladder look like?</p> \n<p>It’s a little more complicated than the Thinking Ladder. A huge element of politics is “political thinking,” and for that element, we could just use the Thinking Ladder. But politics also involves <em>action. </em>To bring this element in, we should also ask ourselves: What would the Higher Mind and Primitive Mind’s political <em>goals</em> be?</p> \n<p>Everyone can take their own crack at this, but here’s mine: The political goal of the grown up, rational, universal-thinking Higher Mind is to build <em>a more perfect nation</em>. And the political goal of the ancient, survival-obsessed, Power-Games-playing Primitive Mind is <em>political triumph </em>against the bad guys, whomever they may be. A discussion of politics should incorporate both political thinking and political activism:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.2-y-axes-v4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8674\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.2-y-axes-v4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"603\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.2-y-axes-v4.png 1400w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.2-y-axes-v4-600x556.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.2-y-axes-v4-768x712.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.2-y-axes-v4-750x695.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Using two political ladders in this post would be terribly cumbersome, and also pretty redundant. I’m sure there are instances when someone is simultaneously at different y-axis positions when it comes to their political thinking and activism… but you know people—most of them will be in a similar place on both. So to simplify, we’ll combine these into a single Political Ladder.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.3-political-ladder-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8662\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.3-political-ladder-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"831\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.3-political-ladder-1.png 2018w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.3-political-ladder-1-600x498.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.3-political-ladder-1-768x638.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/3.3-political-ladder-1-750x623.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p> \n<p>With our view of politics now in 2D,<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-1-8422\" id=\"note-1-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> we can return to our question: Why is politics such a nightmare?</p> \n<p>The answer: The Political Ladder is <em>bottom-heavy.<a id=\"bottom-heavy\"></a></em></p> \n<p style=\"font-size:32px\"><strong>Bottom-Heavy Topics</strong></p> \n<p>Religion, like most things human, exists all up and down the Psych Spectrum. At the top, you’ll find people who think about religion as a set of cultural traditions, as a basis for community, as a moral framework, even as an enticing set of possibilities for the unknown. Every single major religious text has high-minded ideas in it, and every single major religion includes millions of high-minded members—those whose religious adherence isn’t mutually exclusive with, but right in line with, top-rung intellectual and moral thought. Religion, when done the Higher Mind’s way, is a lovely thing.</p> \n<p>And in each case, as you work your way down the Psych Spectrum, high-minded conceptions of religious culture, community, and philosophy morph into complete and utter zealotry, tribalism, delusion, and depravity, as they’re transferred from the Higher Mind’s domain into the clutches of the Primitive Mind.</p> \n<p>What makes religion a major cause of some of the largest, most intense Echo Chambers isn’t that religious thinking spans the Psych Spectrum—most topics do—it’s that the distribution is bottom-heavy. For every deeply religious person thinking about religion from the high rungs, there are even more people down below. Some reasons why:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Religion involves beliefs about death, sex, morality, and almost every other topic the Primitive Mind cares about. Beliefs about eternal life, in particular, match up perfectly with the core end goal of animal genes.</li> \n <li>Religion is faith-based, and at least with its conceptions of what happens after death, inherently untestable—i.e. unfalsifiable.</li> \n <li>Religion is a topic that identities like to attach themselves to. People don’t <em>follow</em> Christianity or <em>believe in</em> Christianity or <em>live by the philosophies of</em> Christianity—people <em>are </em>Christians.</li> \n <li>Religion lends itself perfectly to a tribal, Us/Them worldview. Not only are you an X, but <em>other people are a Y</em>, and if Y religion is true, it would mean your religion is not true.</li> \n <li>Most religions are based on books written long ago, by people whose Higher Minds had much less access to knowledge and advanced moral wisdom than we do today.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>So it makes sense that religion would rile up our Primitive Minds and damn religion to eternal Psych Spectrum bottom-heaviness.</p> \n<p>And if I had grown up in a religious Echo Chamber—and if I were surrounded by religious dogmatists in my life today—and if my country were currently being torn apart by religion—then I might have decided to write a big post series about religion. Instead, I wrote one about politics.</p> \n<p>Like religion, politics is a pro at igniting our primitive fires.</p> \n<p>The Primitive Mind mistakes politics, like it does religion, for a life-and-death situation. This makes sense, because in the ancient world where the Primitive Mind still thinks it lives, politics <em>was</em> a life-or-death game. For almost everyone who lived before the Enlightenment, and still for many people in today’s world, being on the losing end of the game of politics put you in grave danger at the hands of your enemies. And being on the winning side meant having the power to vanquish those enemies. If politics went wrong, nothing else mattered—you were fucked.</p> \n<p>It’s not that today’s politics no longer deals with critical life factors like freedom, safety, fairness, and resources—it’s that today, in a country like the U.S., the <em>stakes</em> in each of those games are far lower than they were in ancient times. Modern politics is about whether taxes should be higher or lower—not about which people should have food during a period of low resources and which should starve to death. It’s about where the line should be drawn when certain rights butt up against other rights—not about which people will be slaves and which will be masters. Politics today is an argument about whether the criminal justice system is applied consistently—not about which citizens the written law itself will and won’t apply to. It’s about the way police do their job and police accountability—not about which citizens should be protected by the government during a genocide and which should be the subject of government genocide. It’s not that modern liberal politics doesn’t have life-or-death consequences for some people—it’s that today, those cases are the exception, not the rule.</p> \n<p>But our Primitive Minds are hardwired to see politics the old-fashioned way, regardless of how the world has changed. That many people will read the above paragraph and think, “politics is <em>still </em>all of those things, just in better disguise,” is reflective of how bad we are at thinking reasonably about politics.</p> \n<p>And politics doesn’t just rile up one part of your ancient mind—like religion, politics is a one-stop-shop for nearly every concept that lights the Primitive Mind’s fires:</p> \n<p>The Primitive Mind is obsessed with the concept of power hierarchies—and politics is literally the allotment to some humans of power they’re allowed to use against the rest of the population.</p> \n<p>The Primitive Mind is obsessed with binary moral divisions—and politics, like religion, is a prime arena for the fiercest disputes over what’s righteous and depraved, fair and unfair, pure and toxic, good and evil.</p> \n<p>The Primitive Mind is deeply concerned with defending your identity—and political alignment, like religious affiliation, consistently forms a piece of people’s core identity.</p> \n<p>Politics sometimes even overlaps with the world of religion itself, in the continual dispute over how political laws interact with religious laws.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4-church-and-state.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8431 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4-church-and-state-600x531.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4-church-and-state-600x531.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/4-church-and-state.png 626w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a></p> \n<p>And of course, there’s the way politics lends itself beautifully to tribalism, the Primitive Mind’s favorite game. The Primitive Mind sees the whole world through a Power Games lens, and it’s always looking for ways to divide its surroundings into Us people and Them people—it just needs a vehicle. And politics provides a perfect one.</p> \n<p>This all adds up to politics being a bottom-heavy thing for us.

Having political beliefs challenged, on the other hand, generated less activity in those areas and more activity in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Default Mode Network</a>—a group of brain regions associated with creating a sense of self and with disengagement from the external world. The scans also showed that having a political belief challenged caused more activity in the insula and the amygdala—emotional, fight-or-flight parts of the brain—than having a nonpolitical belief challenged.</p> <p>So when the participants had one of their political views challenged, they were more likely to withdraw from the external world and go into the internally focused parts of their brains that deal with their identity, as well as the parts of their brains that deal with danger, fear, and other primal emotions. And while doing their thinking this way, their minds were far less likely to change.</p> <p>This is just one of dozens of studies I came across in my research that examine the relationship between political beliefs and the likelihood of changing one’s mind—and the findings seem to be pretty consistent.</p> <p>The study above examined people who identified with the American Left, but of course, the phenomenon spans the political spectrum. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378014000909\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Another study</a> found that in their questioning, “people whose political identity was made salient were less likely to believe in an anthropogenic cause of climate change and less likely to support government climate change policies than those whose identity was not made salient; particularly when those people were aligned with the right-wing of politics.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14599246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Another</a> found that “even under conditions of effortful processing, attitudes toward a social policy depended almost exclusively upon the stated position of one’s political party.” This study also examined participants’ awareness of their own political dogmatism and found, predictably, that “participants denied having been influenced by their political group.” But of course, “they believed that other individuals, especially their ideological adversaries, would be so influenced.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00588.x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One study</a> suggests that showing people belief-disconfirming scientific evidence not only leads them to reject the evidence but to lose faith in <em>science in general</em>—finding that “relative to those reading belief-confirming evidence, participants reading belief-disconfirming evidence indicated more belief that the topic could not be studied scientifically and more belief that a series of other unrelated topics could not be studied scientifically.”</p> <p>Then there are the studies about <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-010-9112-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the backfire effect</a> that find that not only do “corrections frequently fail to reduce misperceptions among the targeted ideological group … corrections actually increase misperceptions among the group in question.”</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-010-9112-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> suggests an explanation: “When confronted with counterevidence, people experience negative emotions borne of conflict between the perceived importance of their existing beliefs and the uncertainty created by the new information. In an effort to reduce these negative emotions, people may begin to think in ways that minimize the impact of the challenging evidence: discounting its source, forming counterarguments, socially validating their original attitude, or selectively avoiding the new information.”</p> <p>In case you’re assuming that well-educated people might fare better here—mountains of evidence (not to mention real-world observation) suggest that they don’t. <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/08/15/1704882114.short\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One study</a> looked specifically at what happens when education and science knowledge butt heads with political dogmatism. It found that “more knowledgeable individuals are more likely to express beliefs consistent with their religious or political identities for issues that have become polarized along those lines (e.g. stem cell research, human evolution), but not for issues that are controversial on other grounds (e.g. genetically modified foods).” So for controversial science-related issues that were not politically polarized, more education meant less dogmatism—which seems intuitive. But when the science-related controversies were politically (or religiously) polarized, that correlation went away, and their beliefs simply lined up with their tribal alliance. In our terms: well-educated people are likely to be high-rung thinkers…until the topic is politically or religiously polarized, at which point they drop down the ladder and become obedient partisans like anybody else.</p> <p>Taking a moment to look at some research is a nice reminder that high-rung thinking is actually neurologically different than low-rung thinking. Low-rung thinking isn’t really thinking at all—it’s self-preservation. Our relationship with intellectual culture follows suit. When our psyche is up on the high rungs, we know that thinking is just thinking. This makes us interested in truth and open to changing our minds—so we like Idea Labs. When we’re lower on the ladder and confusing thinking with self-preservation, confirmation of our beliefs feels like safety—so we seek out an Echo Chamber as a protective bunker.</p> </p></p>\n</div> \n<p>The good news is that politics isn’t <em>confined </em>to the low rungs. There’s plenty of political activity up on the high rungs—it’s just that politics has an ugly high/low <em>ratio</em>. I think, with some work, we can improve that ratio. But first, we have to see the political landscape for what it is. You can’t improve upon a bottom-heavy distribution if you can’t <em>see</em> the bottom-heavy distribution, and you can’t see it if you don’t know there’s a vertical dimension to be at the bottom of in the first place.</p> \n<p>It reminds me of the whole “Inuit people have 428,085 words to describe different kinds of snow!” thing. Whether that’s true or just a fun myth (it’s a myth), it gets at an important concept: the level of nuance in our thinking is limited by the level of nuance in our language. Before I encountered the delightful term “<a href=\"https://grantland.com/features/humblebrag-hall-fame/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">humblebrag</a>,” I found it vaguely irritating when someone would humblebrag, but it was more of a subconscious irritation and one I’d have had a hard time articulating to someone if I tried. But then this term entered my thinking and my vocabulary, and suddenly, humblebragging became a distinct <em>thing</em> in my head. I clearly noticed it now, and I knew exactly why it irritated me. I also noticed myself doing it, which helped me do it less. Labeling a nuanced concept sharpens our ability to think about that concept and communicate our thoughts to others. With the right labels, nuance becomes a breeze.</p> \n<p>That’s what we’re trying to do here. Like, consider these four political thinkers:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.1-2x2-on-ladder.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8435\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.1-2x2-on-ladder.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.1-2x2-on-ladder.png 2018w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.1-2x2-on-ladder-600x498.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.1-2x2-on-ladder-768x638.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.1-2x2-on-ladder-750x623.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The two thinkers on the left side, at least on the topic at hand, share a common viewpoint.

We’re experts at identifying what people think and grouping people that way, because we’ve been trained to look at these four thinkers and see two left-wingers and two right-wingers.</p> \n<p>But we’re awful at talking about the vertical distinction. When I listen to arguments or read op-eds, I constantly hear people <em>trying </em>to make vertical distinctions in their arguments about politicians or ideas, but because A) many people forget that there is a vertical axis, and B) those who do think vertically lack a common language with which to talk about it, those attempts are usually misunderstood or missed altogether.</p> \n<p>When people notice a vertical discrepancy between thinkers, it’s like me before I learned the word “humblebrag”—they often can’t quite tell <em>what </em>it is that they’re noticing, so they’ll misattribute the qualities that distinguish the thinkers to something they do have a vocabulary for. I hear people refer to high-rung political thinkers as being more <em>centrist</em>, or more <em>moderate</em>, than low-rung thinkers. But those are What You Think words. They refer to the middle part of the <em>x-</em>axis—as if holding viewpoints in those areas is the mark of a good thinker, and vice versa. Often, high-rung thinkers <em>will</em> end up at more centrist or moderate positions than low-rung thinkers,&nbsp;but there are plenty of cases where the opposite is true. Vertical terms like <em>high-rung </em>and <em>low-rung</em> make our discussions a bit less constrained and a bit nimbler.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.4-2x2-on-ladder-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8621\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.4-2x2-on-ladder-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2018\" height=\"1676\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.4-2x2-on-ladder-1.png 2018w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.4-2x2-on-ladder-1-600x498.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.4-2x2-on-ladder-1-768x638.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/5.4-2x2-on-ladder-1-750x623.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2018px) 100vw, 2018px\" /></a></p> \n<p>So let’s try taking a breath from left-wing and right-wing politics and focusing, for the rest of this chapter, on the worlds of high-rung and low-rung politics.</p> \n<p style=\"font-size:32px\"><strong>The Political Arch</strong></p> \n<p>Every country has their own special political squabble around the What of politics—the parties, the stances, the ideologies.

You’ll even find some hopelessly partisan, highly tribal, fully unfalsifiable political <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html#attorney\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Attorneys</a>.</p> \n<p>The thing that makes high-rung politics high-rung is that it takes place within high-rung political <em>culture. </em></p> \n<p>High-rung political culture is the political version of the high-rung Idea Lab cultures we discussed <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/10/idea-labs-echo-chambers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">last chapter</a>. It subscribes to all the same high-rung intellectual values and supplements them with the high-rung political notion that the good of the country trumps the good of any political tribe. It’s a culture that makes it safe for Scientists to be Scientists, and it lets Sports Fans do their thing while keeping their worst tendencies on a leash. Attorneys who abide by the culture’s norms and don’t inhibit good conversations can stay. When Attorneys are policed by a strong high-rung culture, their one-sided arguments can provide potential truth material or serve as useful criticism of prevailing ideas. The right political culture can turn a wide collection of thinkers into a productive thinking system.</p> \n<p>In high-rung political culture, people are micro-divided in their viewpoints and macro-united, in a broader sense, in their values.</p> \n<p>They’re macro-united because they’re almost all liberals. Not “liberal” the way it’s often used in the U.S., as a synonym with “Left”—liberal the way the Enlightenment thinkers used it. Liberal meaning “committed to liberal values”—values like truth, human rights, freedom of expression, and equality of opportunity.</p> \n<p>They’re macro-united because they share a common notion of reality. Their opinions will differ wildly, but they’ll usually agree on facts or the lack thereof.</p> \n<p>They’re macro-united by a shared humility—an understanding of just how hard politics is and a self-awareness that knows it’s impossible to fully understand the values or the worldview of people who grew up in or live in circumstances different from your own.</p> \n<p>They’re macro-united because they get how democracy works. They know that a successful democracy is one where everyone gets what they want only <em>sometimes</em>—where regular and widespread frustration and disappointment means the system is working.</p> \n<p>Finally, high-rung political thinkers and activists are macro-united around the broad shared goal of a more perfect nation, along with a mutual understanding that they can move towards that goal only by being micro-divided within a vibrant marketplace of ideas. High-rung political discussions are boxing rings, where ideas get their asses kicked, but people don’t. When it’s safe for people to say what they’re thinking, <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/american-brain.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Speech Curves line up with Thought Piles</a>, turning high-rung thinking communities into giant superbrains.</p> \n<p>And what exactly are people micro-divided about in the high-rung political world? Their debates center around three core questions:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/7.1-3-Questions.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8442\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/7.1-3-Questions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1165\" height=\"825\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/7.1-3-Questions.png 1165w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/7.1-3-Questions-600x425.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/7.1-3-Questions-768x544.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/7.1-3-Questions-750x531.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1165px) 100vw, 1165px\" /></a></p> \n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Question 1: What Is?</strong></p> \n<p>You can’t figure out how to make a more perfect nation if you don’t have a good sense of what the nation currently is. What does the population look like, and how has it evolved over time? What are the current policies, and how do they work? Which experimental programs are being attempted, and what does the data say about their efficacy? How are resources currently distributed? How is the status quo being experienced by citizens of all kinds and in all circumstances? The study of What Is is the domain of science. Embedded in What Is, and critical to its understanding, is the study of What Has Been—i.e. how did What Is become What Is? This is the domain of history.</p> \n<p>Both science and history are the search for truth—the quest to see reality as best you can. High up on the ladder, there’s disagreement around Question 1, but not too much <em>conflict</em>. Conflict happens when disagreement is accompanied by conviction, and two high-rung thinkers won’t usually both feel strongly about conflicting conceptions of reality. Conviction on the high rungs is a function of clarity, and if there’s clarity around a certain set of facts, high-rung thinkers will usually agree with each other. When things are hazier, two differing high-rung thinkers will both speak with doubt, and they’ll consider the points where their conceptions differ to be areas for joint exploration as part of a collaborative knowledge quest.</p> \n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Question 2: What Should Be?</strong></p> \n<p>Unlike What Is, What Should Be is a matter of philosophy and often the subject of fierce conflict on the high rungs. High up on the arch, almost everyone’s goal is a more perfect nation, but thinkers hold different notions of what kinds of policies and systems are the fairest, the most morally right, and the most philosophically consistent. They’ll dig deep on lots of hard questions with no objectively correct answer:</p> \n<p>What should the role of government be? Which freedoms should be restricted in the name of citizen protection and which shouldn’t? When does a fetus become a human being? What are the criteria for “equal opportunity” to be considered equal? How big and how powerful should government be, and where should the boundaries be drawn between state and federal government power? What should the country’s role be in the world, and under what circumstances should it involve itself in foreign affairs? When is it appropriate for the military to use force against other countries or police to use force against citizens? Which resources are rights, and which are privileges? The list is long, and the debates are heated.</p> \n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Question 3: How to Get There?</strong></p> \n<p><a id=\"pdw\"></a>What Is and What Should Be, when compared, yield the gaps between reality and the ideal. These gaps define the political objectives of the high-rung thinker. But even when high-rung thinkers do agree about What Should Be, they often completely disagree about the best way to bridge the gap from What Is to their vision of something better. No one is an expert at how to run a country, and there’s rarely a consensus about the most effective way to fix an identified flaw in the system. Two people who agree that the middle class should be larger than it is can completely disagree about which tax structure or government structures will best achieve the goal. Two people who feel the same exact way about the history of race in the U.S. can hold opposite viewpoints about the efficacy of affirmative action. Two people who both hate the current healthcare system can come up with entirely different government healthcare programs as their proposed solution.</p> \n<p>Parsing political arguments using these three questions can help us isolate what the arguments are really about. Sometimes thinkers who agree philosophically will disagree strategically. Some who seem to agree strategically may actually be aiming for different outcomes. Some will disagree on all fronts.</p> \n<p>Other times, disagreements may be more fundamental. Here, it may be appropriate to *cautiously* apply what have become two of the most unpleasant words in American English: Progressivism and Conservatism.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.1-PC-bags.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8443 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.1-PC-bags-600x206.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"206\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.1-PC-bags-600x206.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.1-PC-bags-768x264.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.1-PC-bags-750x258.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.1-PC-bags.png 1138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p>If we’re going to discuss these words—and the core concept behind each—the first thing we’ll need to do is put aside the baggage.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.2-PC-no-bags.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8444 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.2-PC-no-bags-600x206.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"206\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.2-PC-no-bags-600x206.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.2-PC-no-bags-768x264.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.2-PC-no-bags-750x258.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/8.2-PC-no-bags.png 1138w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Well done. Now, anytime in this post we’re going to use politically charged words, we should make sure to agree on the definitions we’re using.</p> \n<p>If you want to confuse yourself, google around for a while reading about “Progressivism” and “Conservatism.” Each of the words has been the banner for a huge range of political, economic, social, and philosophical ideas—some of them overlapping, some that are unrelated to each other, and some that are totally contradictory with others.</p> \n<p>In the U.S., giant political Echo Chambers have appropriated these words as banners for themselves and for their enemies. And we’ll come back to what the words mean in that low-rung context, but let’s remind ourselves that the words <em>themselves</em> actually have pretty intuitive literal definitions, and I think those meanings provide an important and useful distinction in political thinking. At their most literal—and, because we’re dealing with Higher Minds at the moment, their most charitable:</p> \n<p><strong>Progressivism = </strong>concerned with helping society make forward <em>progress</em>—positive changes to the status quo. That progress can come from identifying what you deem to be a flaw in your nation’s systems or its culture and working to root it out, or by trying to make your nation’s strong points even stronger.</p> \n<p><strong>Conservatism =</strong> concerned with <em>conserving</em> what is already good about society—either by fighting against the erosion of what you deem to be your nation’s strong qualities, or by pushing back against well-intentioned attempts at positive progress that you believe, in reality, will prove to be changes for the worse, not for the better.</p> \n<p>Put more simply, if a nation is a boat, high-rung Progressivism tries to make improvements to flaws in the boat and build newer, better features, while high-rung Conservatism tries to protect the existing boat against damage and deterioration.</p> \n<p>Given that any nation, like any boat, has some things working well and others working poorly—along with the capacity to be both improved and damaged over time—Progressivism and Conservatism, the way we’re currently defining them, are simply the two sides of the “Let’s make this the best boat we can” coin. Two halves of a single noble quest for a more perfect nation.</p> \n<p>As high-rung thinkers trudge their way up the mountain into a foggy future, some of the most fundamental disagreements will be those between a progressive and conservative mindset—the “to change or not to change?” disagreements, and their underlying “how well is this part of the system accomplishing what it’s supposed to?” and “what does a more perfect nation even look like?” disputes.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-2-8422\" id=\"note-2-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/9-PC-Snake.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8445 size-full\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/9-PC-Snake.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1461\" height=\"841\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/9-PC-Snake.png 1461w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/9-PC-Snake-600x345.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/9-PC-Snake-768x442.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/9-PC-Snake-750x432.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1461px) 100vw, 1461px\" /></a></p> <p>It’s easy to see looking at this diagram why Progressivism is important. No country is perfect, and you can’t become a more perfect nation without making changes. Progressivism drives that change.</p> <p>But Conservatism is just as important. Firstly, there are some aspects of a country that are working beautifully—and in these cases, the conservative impulse to resist the inevitable calls for change will be wise. Further, a country like the U.S. is permanently tasked with figuring things out as they go, and when it comes to running and adjusting a massive country in a rapidly changing world, everyone is an amateur. Mistakes will be made, and some changes will prove with time to have been ineffective or detrimental. In these moments, the voice urging the country to press the undo key and go back to the way things used to be will be the wisest voice.</p> <p>Secondly, Progressivism is the collection of lots of different ideas—most of them untested—and inevitably, most of them will be bad ideas. Nations evolve the same way species do—through beneficial mutations. Coming up with mutations and pushing them into the national genome is the job of Progressivism. But for every beneficial mutation to a species, there are many more mutations which prove to be detrimental to survival. The conservative resistance to <em>all</em> progressive ideas provides a critical filter—a gauntlet that relentlessly tries to expose flaws in each progressive effort at mutation. Forcing progressive ideas to pass through intense conservative resistance in order to implement their desired change helps separate the wise ideas from the foolish or naive and protects the country from the latter kind.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that I’m using these <em>ism </em>terms and not “progressives” and “conservatives” because the latter implies that people are either one or the other, and high-rung culture doesn’t equate people with their ideas. High-rung thinkers may tend to think in a more progressive or conservative way—but they <em>are </em>no line of thought.</p> <p>Even using the words as adjectives for people—declaring yourself to <em>be </em>progressive or conservative, in general (as opposed to “holding a conservative viewpoint” or “tending to be progressive in a certain area of your thinking”) is an implicit presumption of uniform thinking across the board and through time. A single brash label for a person, or for their thinking, boxes in a person’s intellect and boxes in their evolution—and high-rung thinkers don’t like to be put in boxes, by themselves or by anyone else. This non-boxable phenomenon is apparent when I think about the high-rung political thinkers I know or know of, as it can often be frustratingly hard to figure out what their “deal” is politically.</p> <p>But while the individuals in high-rung politics may bounce back and forth between the two camps, what <em>is</em> consistent is a substantial group of people falling into each bucket on any given issue. If we bring things into 3D and venture upwards on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1.1AM-extended-emergence-tower-v2.png\">Emergence Tower</a>, we can visualize the two groups as a progressive giant and a conservative giant.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/10-high-rung-giants.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8446\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/10-high-rung-giants.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/10-high-rung-giants.png 1942w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/10-high-rung-giants-600x477.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/10-high-rung-giants-768x610.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/10-high-rung-giants-750x596.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></a></p> <p>If high-rung politics is a grand political courtroom, these giants are the two lawyers.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-3-8422\" id=\"note-3-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> When the “defendant” is the nation’s status quo or its traditional values, the progressive giant is the prosecutor and the conservative giant is the defense. In these cases, Progressivism will be the voice of negativity and criticism, while Conservatism will paint the rosier picture of the country as it stands, and its history.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-courtroom-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8709 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-courtroom-v2-750x651.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"651\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-courtroom-v2-750x651.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-courtroom-v2-600x521.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-courtroom-v2-768x666.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/11-courtroom-v2.png 1435w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>But when it comes to how to change the country—when the defendant is the country’s evolution—the roles switch. Progressivism, now in the role of the defense, will tend to be a vocal proponent of change, while Conservatism, as prosecutor, will be critical of and resistant to change.</p> <p>In both cases, each giant acts as a counterforce against the other and helps keep it in check. When the conservative giant gets riled up, it can drift too far into “Our country is perfect just as it is” or “Our country used to be perfect” territory. When the progressive giant gets out of hand, it can fall too far down the “Our country is and always has been awful” hole. The presence of its rival giant restrains each giant from becoming a ridiculous caricature of itself.</p> <p>The clash of these two forces lies at the heart of the parts of society that evolve. I have a friend who’s a new mother and decided not to breastfeed her baby and use formula instead. She explained her reasoning to me and it made sense. I mentioned this to another friend, also a new mother, who thinks the first friend is crazy. Her reasoning made sense too.</p> <p>Another friend of mine makes a compelling case about how women who can afford to should consider using a surrogate for pregnancy instead of getting pregnant themselves. I found this interesting and have brought it up with a few other friends, to hugely negative reactions.</p> <p>I’m not sure who’s more right in either case, or if there even is a clear right and wrong side—but I know that some people having a progressive, “we should challenge the status quo” instinct in each area is important for our ability to evolve and improve, and some people having a knee-jerk conservative instinct to criticize and push back against progressive ideas is important for our ability to proceed prudently and effectively in our evolution. Together, they are the two lawyers that allow societal evolution to undergo “due process” in the marketplace of ideas.</p> <p>This same tension exists at the core of debates about nutrition, wellness, parenting, education, professional sports rules, holidays, company culture, employment practices, and 100 other things. In each area, evolution is driven by progressive ideas and policed by conservative sensibilities. In any of these situations, people with a progressive mindset feel like they’re dragging more conservative people upward to a better place, while people on the conservative side feel that the progressive effort is dragging things downward to a worse place.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-4-8422\" id=\"note-4-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a> <p>Most of us will find ourselves on the progressive side in some of these “courtrooms” and on the conservative side of others. Even people who find themselves falling on the same side of most the debates I mentioned would hesitate to box themselves in by attaching their identities to that quality and letting that label automatically determine all of their viewpoints. High-rung political culture simply extends this way of thinking to politics as well.</p> <p>Some political debates aren’t about “to change or not to change.” Instead, they’re about a spectrum of possibility and the debates are about where exactly on the spectrum our policies should lie.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.1-spectrum-tug-of-war.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8448 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.1-spectrum-tug-of-war-750x278.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"278\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.1-spectrum-tug-of-war-750x278.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.1-spectrum-tug-of-war-600x222.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.1-spectrum-tug-of-war-768x285.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.1-spectrum-tug-of-war.png 1360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>In spectrum battles, which side ends up backed by the Left vs. the Right doesn’t always map on very well to “progressive” or “conservative,” but it doesn’t matter. The important thing is that each side of the spectrum has a group advocating for it. This allows the marketplace of ideas as a whole to home in on a point that represents a reasonable compromise. As the debates rage on and public opinion evolves, that point can evolve along with it. It’s democracy at its finest: everyone disagrees with each other in an unpleasant marketplace of ideas, and it results in a policy that represents a broad compromise that most people are somewhat unhappy with. There a lot of these types of issues in American politics:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.2-spectrum-tug-of-war.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8449\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.2-spectrum-tug-of-war.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1350\" height=\"911\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.2-spectrum-tug-of-war.png 2763w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.2-spectrum-tug-of-war-600x405.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.2-spectrum-tug-of-war-768x518.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.2-spectrum-tug-of-war-750x506.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.2-spectrum-tug-of-war-345x234.png 345w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/12.2-spectrum-tug-of-war-103x70.png 103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px\" /></a></p> <p>Sometimes political issues revolve around priorities and where we should direct our attention.

They’re both just doing their part of the job.</p> <p>It’s like a company having two founders, one who focuses more on operations and the other who thinks more about growth. Progressivism and Conservatism each worry about one half of every issue, and together, they make sure we’re paying enough attention to everything that matters.</p> <p>Every person involved in high-rung politics has a Primitive Mind in their head that wants to identify with political parties and treat politics like a tribal war. But up on the high rungs, the Higher Minds have the edge—one that they protect with a pervasive high-rung culture. The culture keeps everyone—even the more partisan people—aware that ultimately, they’re all on the same team. As fierce as the debates between the high-rung giants can be, they know deep down that what they’re really doing is working together to navigate their way up the mountain, towards a more perfect nation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/13A-map.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8452\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/13A-map.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"551\" height=\"402\" /></a></p> <p>But politics is bottom-heavy. And even the high-rung-thinking grown-ups among us are prone to morph into childish low-rungers when it comes to politics.</p> <p>When our Primitive Minds get ahold of our political thinking, our political worldview, values, and general mentality jump in a time machine back to hunter-gatherer times. Politics ceases to be about figuring out the truth and building a more perfect nation and becomes geared toward ideological confirmation and triumphing over the bad guys.

But especially <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, <em>Aladdin</em>, and <em>The Lion King</em>. I’ve never been sure if those are objectively the best four Disney movies or if everyone just thinks whichever Disney movies happened to come out when they were between the ages of 7 and 12 are the best Disney movies. Either way, clearly those are the four best Disney movies.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-5-8422\" id=\"note-5-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-6-8422\" id=\"note-6-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a> <p>The thing about those movies, though, is that they’re definitely fake movies, and definitely not real life.

I see it as a metaphor for all kinds of things in the world. Here’s what I mean:</p> <p>Analog is what actually goes on in the natural world. It’s a perfect representation of reality: information in its natural, messy state. Sound is a nice example.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-7-8422\" id=\"note-7-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a> Sound is analog information that can be represented by a wave:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.1-analog-digital.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8454 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.1-analog-digital-750x500.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.1-analog-digital-750x500.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.1-analog-digital-600x400.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.1-analog-digital-768x512.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.1-analog-digital-103x70.png 103w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.1-analog-digital.png 1182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>Digitization is a way to approximate analog information using a set of exact values.

When you listen to an mp3, you’re not listening to the true analog information made by the band’s instruments, you’re listening to a digitized version of the sounds—a big string of 1s and 0s that approximates the analog sound wave of the song.</p> <p>Above, the sound wave has been digitized to eight incremental values, by rounding all parts of the wave to the nearest value. Eight values can be expressed by three “bits” (a three-number string of 1s and 0s). You can compress an mp3 into a smaller file by making your approximations of the analog wave cruder—by making the digital “steps” <em>bigger</em>, using only four values. Now you only need two bits.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.3-analog-digital.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8456 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.3-analog-digital-750x451.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.3-analog-digital-750x451.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.3-analog-digital-600x360.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.3-analog-digital-768x461.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.3-analog-digital.png 1182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>The more you compress a sound file, the smaller the mp3 file gets, because bigger steps require fewer 1s and 0s to express the sound.

The size and sound quality of a digitized file all depend on how far down the <em>digitization spectrum</em> you go in your conversion.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.4-digitization-spectrum-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8707 size-full\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.4-digitization-spectrum-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1293\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.4-digitization-spectrum-v2.png 1293w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.4-digitization-spectrum-v2-600x150.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.4-digitization-spectrum-v2-768x192.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.4-digitization-spectrum-v2-750x188.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1293px) 100vw, 1293px\" /></a></p> <p>At the far end of the digitization spectrum, you’d have only straight 1s and 0s—a tiny file that would sound almost nothing like the original song.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.5-analog-digital.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8458 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.5-analog-digital-750x454.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.5-analog-digital-750x454.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.5-analog-digital-600x363.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.5-analog-digital-768x465.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14.5-analog-digital.png 1182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>The same concept applies to visual information.

You want to weigh the costs of high file size alongside the costs of quality reduction and choose the optimal compromise for whatever you’re trying to do.</p> <p>I’ve been thinking about this a lot because the general concept behind the digitization spectrum and the compromise it represents is relevant in all kinds of places. If someone asks you a time-related question, without realizing you’re doing it, you’ll answer the question at what you believe to be the optimal point along the spectrum. If you didn’t do this, you’d be a weird person.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/16.1-time-digitization-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8698\"

/></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In our thoughts and our conversations about life, society, politics, or anything else, we’re always negotiating this same balance. Digitization/approximation, when used appropriately, is an incredibly handy efficiency tool that leverages the human mind’s talent for pattern recognition. But digitization is inherently lossy—it intentionally does away with nuance—and the appropriate amount of digitization is up to whatever point where the lost nuance isn’t important, meaningful information—or at least where the lost nuance is <em>less </em>important than the gained efficiency.</p> <p>Back to Disney movies.</p> <p>The real world is analog—gray, amorphous, and endlessly nuanced. What Disney movies do is they digitize the shit out of the real world. They go the full distance, converting all that gray into clean black-and-white 1s and 0s.</p> <p>Real people are complex and flawed, full of faults but almost always worthy of compassion. Disney characters, on the other hand, are either entirely good or entirely bad.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-8-8422\" id=\"note-8-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.1-digital-characters.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8467\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.1-digital-characters.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.1-digital-characters.png 2337w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.1-digital-characters-600x217.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.1-digital-characters-768x277.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.1-digital-characters-750x271.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> <p>It goes beyond characters. In the real world, each turn of <em>events</em> is mired in potential positives and potential negatives, which is a mess to sort out. Disney movies get rid of that messiness. Something that happens is either clearly good, or it’s clearly bad. Disney even digitizes the weather.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.3-digital-weather.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8468\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.3-digital-weather.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.3-digital-weather.png 2095w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.3-digital-weather-600x296.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.3-digital-weather-768x379.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/17.3-digital-weather-750x371.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p> <p>Disney digitization spares no one.

Their core audience is little kids, who aren’t ready yet to sort through gray. Before a person learns to think in nuance, they first need to learn the basic concepts of good vs. bad, right vs. wrong, safe vs. dangerous, happy vs. sad. It’s the same way you wouldn’t teach a beginner poker player about the difference between how to slow play a big hand when you’re in early vs. late position—you’d start by making sure they understood what a pair is, what folding means, and how the betting works. Going straight to the higher-level strategy would only confuse them.</p> <p>If good Disney characters are shown to have deep character flaws, kids may misinterpret the message and think they’re supposed to mimic those qualities.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-9-8422\" id=\"note-9-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-10-8422\" id=\"note-10-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-11-8422\" id=\"note-11-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-12-8422\" id=\"note-12-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-13-8422\" id=\"note-13-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a> And if bad guys are humanized, kids will get upset when things turn out badly for them in the end.</p> <p>Digitizing an analog world into perfect cartoon simplicity makes sense. In fictional Disney movies. Made for kids.</p> <p>But over-digitizing the <em>real</em> world is pretty bad idea—and unfortunately, that’s exactly what the Primitive Mind likes to do. So low-rung politics ends up feeling, to its participants, just like a Disney movie.</p> <p>Up on the high rungs, people know the world is a mess of analog complexity. They look out at that world, with clear eyes, and see fog. They also know that people are little microcosms of the messy world—each person an evolving gray smattering of virtues and flaws.</p> <p>Political Disney World is much more fun. Everything is nice and crisp and perfectly digital. Good guys and bad guys, with good ideas and bad ideas, respectively. Good politicians and bad politicians with good policies and bad policies. Right and wrong. Smart and ignorant. Virtuous and evil. Safe and dangerous.</p> <p>1s and 0s.</p> <p>In the foggy minds of Political Disney World, it’s all quite clear.</p> <p>At the heart of every faction in Political Disney World (PDW) is a guiding narrative. PDW narratives are all-encompassing versions of reality—they come with their own worldview, their own telling of history, their own description of the present, and their own explanation for the causes behind all of it. A unique, customized Disney movie for the tribe, by the tribe.</p> <p>Every country has a Political Disney World, each with their own factions and their own narratives. I live inside “Political Disney World, U.S.,” where there are two major factions: the low-rung Democrats and the low-rung Republicans. Their narratives digitize both people and ideas.</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>How PDW Narratives Digitize People</strong></p> <p>Central to each narrative are the main characters.

The world of low-rung religion (Religious Disney World) does this all the time, with their gods and devils, their believers and infidels, their heaven and hell. Political Disney World does the same thing, just using different terms. A digital people mentality is why people in PDW rarely marry someone with opposing political views (something people in the high-rung political world do all the time). It’s why people in PDW tend to feel an endless well of compassion and understanding for bullies, blunderers, and criminals within the protagonist group, while dropping all semblance of empathy for bad actors on the evil side.</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>How PDW Narratives Digitize Ideas</strong></p> <p>Political Disney World is also big on digitizing ideas, using one of PDW’s defining features: the checklist. A narrative’s checklist allows its thinkers to trade in the gray mess of nuanced “What Is,” “What Should Be,” and “How to Get from A to B” debates for a perfectly digitized list of binary issues with a Good, Correct Stance and an Evil, Wrong Stance. In the U.S. narratives, the current checklist includes items like these:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/19-checklist.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8476 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/19-checklist-417x750.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"417\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/19-checklist-417x750.png 417w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/19-checklist-333x600.png 333w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/19-checklist.png 601w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" /></a></p> <p>In each case, what is treated as a complex debate up on the high rungs digitizes out to perfect cartoon simplicity down below.</p> <p>Some telltale signs that people are deriving their viewpoints from a checklist:</p> \n       <ul> \n        <li>They abide faithfully by the entire list of protagonist viewpoints, with no exceptions. They can scan down their side of the above checklist and, without hesitation, check off every box.</li> \n        <li>For each issue, they tend to see the Them stance as having 0% merit.</li> \n        <li>They have strong feelings about the <em>specific </em>issues highlighted by the checklist but have little to say about all the other issues that matter to their country. Issues played up in the media are like plotlines in the Disney movie narrative, which you’ll hear constant emotional discussion about, while other issues are like plotlines that didn’t make it into the movie’s final cut—and in PDW, you won’t hear people talking about them at all.</li> \n       </ul> <p>Anytime a bunch of adults are pretty sure that they live in a Disney movie, there can only be one explanation:</p> <p>They’ve been sucked into the Power Games.</p> <p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>New World, Old Games</strong></p> <p>The Power Games, as you’ll recall, is what humans evolved to do a long, long time ago.

Whether one is a bit worse than the other in any given year or decade is less important to our discussion than the fact that both are bad.</p> <p>Both parties are a bit challenged on the adult vs. grown-up thing, buying fully into the middle-school-esque “in-group/out-group” social structure—a classic sign of the Power Games. And both are totally down with gross negative generalizations of the out-group (John Cleese <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLNhPMQnWu4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">explains further</a>).</p> <p>On both sides of PDW, people would struggle to name three policies they like of a president on the Them side of things and three legitimate areas where an Us president has gone wrong—even though every president does a lot of good and bad things. People on both sides tend to believe that if only everyone in the country shared their viewpoints and values, all national problems would be solved. All signs of simplistic, tribal thinking. All signs of the Power Games.</p> <p>Probably the clearest sign of the Power Games is rampant hypocrisy. High-rung thinking is all about values and principles, and there’s an effort to remain consistent about them in the face of the inevitable tug of tribal attachment. But the Power Games has only one principle: power. As George Orwell succinctly said it in <em>1984</em>: “The object of power is power.”</p> <p>Channeling more Orwell, writer Andrew Sullivan <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/09/can-democracy-survive-tribalism.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sums it up nicely</a>:</p> <p><em>George Orwell famously defined this mind-set as identifying yourself with a movement, “placing it beyond good and evil and recognising no other duty than that of advancing its interests.” It’s typified, he noted, by self-contradiction and indifference to reality. And so many severe critics of George W. Bush’s surveillance policies became oddly muted when Obama adopted most of them; Democrats looked the other way as Obama ramped up deportations to levels higher than Trump’s rate so far. Republicans, in turn, were obsessed with the national debt when Obama was in office, despite the deepest recession in decades. But the minute Trump came to power, they couldn’t be more enthusiastic about a tax package that could add trillions of dollars to it. No tribe was more federalist when it came to marijuana laws than liberals; and no tribe was less federalist when it came to abortion. Reverse that for conservatives. For the right-tribe, everything is genetic except homosexuality; for the left-tribe, nothing is genetic except homosexuality. During the Bush years, liberals inveighed ceaselessly against executive overreach; under Obama, they cheered when he used his executive authority to alter immigration laws and impose new environmental regulations by fiat.</em></p> <p>In the Power Games, principles will lose to power every time. While people in high-rung politics are criticized for flip-flopping on their <em>principles</em> (as in the above paragraph), PDW flip-floppers are criticized for the opposite reason: you get in trouble on the low rungs for flip-flopping on <em>policy positions</em> in an effort to stay <em>consistent</em> with principles. Integrity matters up high, loyalty matters down below.</p> <p>Liberalism itself is a set of principles, and in Political Disney World, people won’t hesitate to go illiberal if it helps with tribal victory. Beyond common PDW illiberal practices like selective empathy or being selectively supportive of core liberal rights like free speech, there’s the illiberal way people in PDW view democracy. When people in low-rung politics lose an election, they scream that they’re disenfranchised, they insist that the system must be broken,<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-15-8422\" id=\"note-15-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a> and they have an impulse to overthrow the opposition leader. When their candidate wins, they say things like, “faith in democracy restored!”—i.e. democracy is only working when my candidate wins. This isn’t the mindset of someone who believes in democracy—it’s the mindset of someone who believes in dictatorship but who is stuck in a democracy.</p> <p>This is why it’s bad that the U.S. has come to redefine the word “liberal” as a synonym for “progressive.” While “progressive” is an x-axis word, “liberal” is a <em>y-axis</em> concept.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/22-liberal-illiberal.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8482\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/22-liberal-illiberal.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"950\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/22-liberal-illiberal.png 1951w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/22-liberal-illiberal-600x475.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/22-liberal-illiberal-768x608.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/22-liberal-illiberal-750x594.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> <p>When we do a “zoom-up” on Emergence Tower, we’re reminded that what feels to PDW members like being a protagonist in a Disney movie is actually just being a uniform cell in a big, dumb, Power Games giant.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/23-low-rung-giants.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8483\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/23-low-rung-giants.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"950\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/23-low-rung-giants.png 1951w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/23-low-rung-giants-600x475.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/23-low-rung-giants-768x608.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/23-low-rung-giants-750x594.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> \n       <div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n        <h3><strong>Variations in the Us/Them Divide Blue Box</strong></h3> \n        <p>People with a Power Games mentality will almost always divide into the Us vs. Them format—the thing that varies is how big the giants in question are.

The sacred narrative baby must always be said to be cute. This is what it means for a tribe to be micro-united.</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>Keeping things macro-divided</strong></p> <p>As the Bedouin proverb reminds us, in the Power Games, the best glue of all is a good common enemy. And the bigger a giant you want to build, the bigger the common enemy you’ll need to keep things glued together—because if the Them giant isn’t big enough, the Us giant will inevitably fracture into a new Us/Them structure. To serve this cause, low-rung political giants will typically frame politics as a zero-sum game—one in which the goals of the good guys can only come as a result of the bad guys losing (and vice versa). And they’ll focus a ton of energy on the part of the narrative that talks about how stupid, ignorant, evil, bigoted, opportunistic, sneaky, toxic, backward, selfish, and most importantly dangerous the bad guys are, making lots of memes like this:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote2-5-8422\" id=\"note2-5-8422\" rel=\"footnote2\">5</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/26.1-republican-brain.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8490\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/26.1-republican-brain.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"570\" height=\"502\" /></a></p> <p>And this:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote2-6-8422\" id=\"note2-6-8422\" rel=\"footnote2\">6</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/26.2-democrat-brain.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8491\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/26.2-democrat-brain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/26.2-democrat-brain.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/26.2-democrat-brain-103x70.png 103w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> <p>Citizens of Political Disney World will be even better trained to rattle off the narrative’s story about how bad the bad guys are than they are to rattle off why the good guys are good.</p> <p>The bad-guys-are-bad part of the narrative is especially important because on top of its common-enemy glue benefits, it is the critical foil the story’s protagonists need in order to feel like protagonists. Without Jafar, Aladdin is no longer a hero—he’s just some guy. That’s why Mr. Mean Man has to always be super mean and Miss Shitty Pants has to always stay shitty-pantsed.</p> <p style=\"font-size:32px\"><strong>Protecting the glue</strong></p> <p>Power Games giants glued together by belief in a certain story need a very specialized environment to survive. Unlike the inherent robustness of values-based high-rung giants, Power Games giants are brittle and vulnerable. When you rely on people fervently believing an all-encompassing, mostly fictional reality when real reality is all around them, you need to maintain a lot of control to keep things in order.</p> <p>The sacred narrative would be torn to shreds in the marketplace of ideas outside the kingdom’s walls, where high-rung thinkers roam and no idea is safe from criticism. Loyalists would be not only told but shown clear evidence that Disney World isn’t a real place, like when a shitty five-year-old bursts the kindergarten class’s bubble by spilling the truth about Santa Claus. Unacceptable.</p> <p>Traditionally, brittle Power Games giants have avoided having their bubble burst with strict laws that control the flow of information—like King Mustache’s laws in <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/mute-button.html#censorship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hypothetica</a>. But in a country with laws like the First Amendment, Echo Chambers are forced to police speech with culture. The right culture can serve as a filter system, which both enriches the giant with glue-strengthening narrative confirmation and protects the giant from every Power Games giant’s kryptonite—doubt.</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>The PDW Giant’s Filter System</strong></p> <p style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>1) The Media Filter</strong></p> <p>In today’s world, every political Echo Chamber giant has its own media channels, which serve as the giant’s eyes and ears. These media channels are for the Echo Chamber, by the Echo Chamber, and they’re the first line of defense in upholding the giant’s belief in the sacred narrative. To keep the giant strong and well-fed, they sensationalize the stories that confirm the narrative, like an amplifier. To keep the giant free of intellectual contamination, they downplay stories that challenge the narrative or neglect to report them at all.</p> <p>On any given day, just do a side-by-side at <a href=\"http://foxnews.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">foxnews.com</a> and <a href=\"http://msnbc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">msnbc.com</a>, or <a href=\"http://breitbart.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breitbart.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">huffpost.com/news/politics</a>, or <a href=\"http://townhall.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">townhall.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">salon.com</a>, and you’ll see the two major U.S. filters at work. One amplifies a story, the other muffles it. When they do report on the same story, their framings reverse who the protagonists and antagonists are, to mold the story to fit the narrative (Scott Alexander lays out some good examples <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>—and <a href=\"https://pudding.cool/2018/01/chyrons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a> is kind of interesting).</p> <p style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>2) The Sharing Filter</strong></p> <p>If the Media Filter determines what ends up in the PDW giant’s brain, the Sharing Filter sets the rules about how information circulates through the brain.</p> <p>A key safeguard against those in the tribe who don’t actually believe the narrative, the giant’s political culture provides powerful social incentives to keep everyone’s Outer Selves in line and saying the right things.</p> <p>Expressing narrative confirmation is socially rewarded while challenging the narrative is laden with taboo. Because remember how the Agreement-Decency thing works in an Echo Chamber:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8710\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2.png 1650w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2-600x421.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2-768x539.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/31.1-agreement-decency-v2-750x527.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p> <p>The Media Filter will never be perfect, but the Sharing Filter can clean up the mess. When compelling alternative viewpoints make it into the giant’s brain, they have hard time making it very far, as every neuron in the brain is socially incentivized not to pass it along to other neurons. The same system works as a market for narrative confirmation. When people share narrative confirmation, the most snappily worded and convincingly argued receive the biggest rewards when they’re shared, which then incentivizes others to share them too (Twitter retweet numbers are a nice example). The best of the best pieces of confirmation go viral, spreading like wildfire through the Echo Chamber.</p> <p style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>3) The Individual Bias Filter</strong></p> <p>Any scraps of compelling dissent not caught by the first two filters usually meet their doom at the gates of the final filter—the biases of the giant brain’s neurons: individual minds. Those who do believe the narrative are thinking from the low rungs, in <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html#unfalsifiable\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unfalsifiable Land</a>, where they’ll use all of those low-rung tricks from <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chapter 7</a> to make sure to stay unconvinced by any dissent that manages to reach them.</p> <p>Low-rung political thinkers, <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html#attorney\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reasoning While Motivated</a>, will do the “Can I believe this?” / “Must I believe this?” <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html#toggle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">toggle</a>&nbsp;on their Skepticism Meter:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/28-Skepticism-Spectrum.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8492\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/28-Skepticism-Spectrum.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"574\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/28-Skepticism-Spectrum.png 1665w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/28-Skepticism-Spectrum-600x287.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/28-Skepticism-Spectrum-768x367.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/28-Skepticism-Spectrum-750x359.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> <p>Like <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html#trains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trains in biased motion</a>, they’ll see any skeptics of their beliefs as worse thinkers than they actually are, making it easy to disregard the info right off the bat.</p> \n         <div class=\"wbwAside\"> \n          <h3><strong>The Thanksgiving Dinner Table Hideous Political Conversations Blue Box</strong></h3> \n          <p>It’s this third filter that lies behind phenomena like the whole “Oh my god I’m dreading the political conversations at the Thanksgiving dinner table so much” thing. When I hear someone say this, I know one of three things is happening:</p> \n          <p>1) The person talking about their Thanksgiving dread is part of a low-rung political giant and they’re dreading the one day of the year when they’re with high-rung political family members who will challenge them.</p> \n          <p>2) Same as #1 except the dreaded family members are also low-rung political thinkers, from the opposite Disney kingdom.</p> \n          <p>3) The person is a high-rung political thinker who is dreading their annual interaction with low-rung political family members.</p> \n          <p>Low-rung dreading high-rung, low-rung dreading low-rung, or high-rung dreading low-rung. The one thing I know is <em>not </em>the case is a high-rung thinker dreading interaction with a high-rung thinker who disagrees with them, since high-rung thinkers don’t dread having political conversations with each other. At least one of the parties involved in a nightmarish Thanksgiving political conversation is from the low-rung political world. And they’re dreading it because it’s a moment when their usual info guardians—the Media Filter and the Sharing Filter—will not be able to shield them. They’ll be exposed to challenges to the sacred narrative they identify with, and they’ll have no tools to handle that interaction. So the third, final filter of individual unfalsifiability will be left to fend off the challenge, which tends to make for an unpleasant interaction.</p> \n         </div> <p>We can imagine these three filters looking something like this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.1-filters-key.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8493 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.1-filters-key-750x571.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"571\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.1-filters-key-750x571.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.1-filters-key-600x457.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.1-filters-key-768x585.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.1-filters-key.png 1083w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>While high-rung giants gauge their filters to expose the truth, we can see how PDW filters work hand-in-hand to keep the giant glue strong.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-16-8422\" id=\"note-16-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.2-filters-v2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8685\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.2-filters-v2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1100\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.2-filters-v2.jpg 1892w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.2-filters-v2-600x282.jpg 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.2-filters-v2-768x361.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/29.2-filters-v2-750x352.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" /></a></p> <p>But Political Disney World doesn’t stop there. The filter system is great for managing the world’s real information, but when real information doesn’t cut it, a political giant has to take matters into its own hands.</p> <p style=\"font-size:28px\"><strong>Fallacies</strong></p> <p>If there’s one thing we’ve established in this series, it’s that humans aren’t good at reality. For us, trying to figure out what’s right and what’s real is like an obstacle course lined with cognitive pitfalls. The smartest people I know spend a <em>huge </em>amount of effort trying to become experts on their own irrational tendencies in order to become better thinkers, and they’re still pretty bad at reality. That’s why the high-rung Idea Lab culture is so important—it turns the reality obstacle course into a team effort.</p> <p>But what if reality isn’t your goal? What if reality is itself the obstacle?</p> <p>Political Disney World turns confirmation bias into its own team effort—it does confirmation bias on a systematic, industrial scale. And when the mission relies on people getting reality wrong, human cognitive deficiencies are invaluable tools.</p> <p>One such tool is the fallacy. If human reasoning is an outdated 1.0 software program, fallacies are the glitches and bugs.</p> <p>We fall victim to fallacies by mistake all the time. A classic example is the sunk cost fallacy. As an untalented illustrator, I learned long ago that it’s usually a terrible idea to draw elaborate backgrounds in my illustrations. Just draw the three stick figures talking over a white background—skip the street and the trees and the sky and the sidewalk they’re standing on. And yet—sometimes I forget that lesson and decide to get all Bob Ross, like “well what if…what if I just put a happy little tree over there next to the people…well that looks weird like a floating tree…so I’ll make some ground…how do you make ground again?…I’ll try drawing a line…that looks bad…ooh okay I’ll draw grass…” Suddenly it’s 18 minutes later and I’m drawing individual strands of grass and questioning my entire existence.</p> <p>At that point, a little part of my brain is like, “So you’re about halfway into finishing this background. The background doesn’t look good. It looks bad. The drawing would be better without it. It was a cute idea but it failed. So just delete the background and move on.”</p> <p>And then a much bigger, glitchier part of my brain is like, “Huh? No. Of course I’m not deleting this bad background I just spent 18 minutes doing half of. That would be a total waste of 18 minutes—which would be incredibly unsatisfying. I’m not allowing those 18 minutes to go to waste. I’m finishing the background. If it makes the drawing worse, then that’s just what’ll have to happen.”</p> <p>So I spend 18 more minutes finishing the background.</p> <p>Rationalist Julia Galef <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpnxd31y0Fo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">likens this situation</a> to walking to a store that’s 20 minutes away, only to learn 10 minutes into the walk that the store is closed… and then deciding to “finish the job” and walk all the way to the store anyway, since you already started. Obviously that would be deeply inane—but that’s exactly what I’m doing when I finish my bad background. To avoid having the 18 minutes I already spent go to waste, I’ll waste <em>another </em>18 minutes, even though the first 18 minutes is already gone and spent either way. It’s a sunk cost.</p> <p>We all commit the sunk cost fallacy. Sometimes it leads us to stick with jobs or relationships we know deep down are wrong for us. Sometimes we go the full distance with a long project even though, after having put some work into it, we’ve come to the realization that it wasn’t such a great idea. Sometimes we read the last 250 pages of a book we’re not liking very much because we’ve already read the first 100. In all cases, we do it because we simply can’t bear to acknowledge that some of our time has officially been wasted. So we double (or quadruple) down.</p> <p>It’s a reasoning error. It makes absolutely no sense—as Julia’s example illustrates—but we do it anyway. Because we’re bad at reality.</p> <p>The sunk cost is a famous one, but there are a <em>lot</em> of common fallacies. Wikipedia lists over 100 of them <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. Our reasoning software sucks.</p> <p>But fallacies aren’t always mistakes. If you’re trying to win an argument and you’re not doing so well, you might try pulling a fallacy out of your bag of dirty tricks. If your opponent doesn’t catch it, it’ll appear to be a beautiful point in your favor.</p> <p>Political Disney World is pretty big on both accidental and intentional fallacies. Let’s go through some of the most prevalent, in three categories:</p> <p style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Category 1: Fallacies that misrepresent reality</strong></p> <p>The practice of misrepresenting reality falls on a spectrum with “slight data nudging” on one end and “total fabrication” on the other. Low-rung politics has a long tradition of misrepresenting reality by concocting questionable studies and misleading statistics or by spinning real events in a way that best fits the narrative.</p> <p>A common type is what I call the <strong>Trend-Anecdote Swapper. </strong></p> <p>It’s simple: If you come across an anecdote that supports the narrative, you put it through the swapper and frame it as evidence of a larger <em>trend</em> to make it seem representative of broader reality. Meanwhile, if there’s an actual trend happening that really is representative of broader reality—but it’s a trend that makes your narrative look bad—you just put it through the swapper, and it’ll come out the other side framed as nothing more than a handful of freak anecdotes.</p> <p>For example, imagine your tribe’s narrative says that dogs are almost always good boys (and anyone who says otherwise is a bigot), while most raccoons are dangerous, vile creatures (and anyone who says otherwise is a bigot). Now imagine that one week, these six news stories happen:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.1-trend-anecdote-headlines-v2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8639 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.1-trend-anecdote-headlines-v2-600x408.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"408\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.1-trend-anecdote-headlines-v2-600x408.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.1-trend-anecdote-headlines-v2-768x522.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.1-trend-anecdote-headlines-v2-750x510.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.1-trend-anecdote-headlines-v2-782x530.png 782w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.1-trend-anecdote-headlines-v2-345x234.png 345w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.1-trend-anecdote-headlines-v2-103x70.png 103w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.1-trend-anecdote-headlines-v2.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> <p>The actual reality here isn’t really your friend. Your narrative, like all PDW narratives, leaves no room for mixed messages. Dogs are good. Raccoons are bad. Period. Meanwhile, the actual information at hand here suggests that maybe both can be good sometimes and bad sometimes. So you pull out the Trend-Anecdote Swapper and get to work.</p> <p>You start by categorizing and color-coding the stories as they actually seem to be.</p> <p><a

The pro-dog crowd could use the arrow to further nudge the day’s news in their favor by fiddling with blame in two of the stories:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.4A-trend-anecdote-headlines.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8650\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.4A-trend-anecdote-headlines.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.4A-trend-anecdote-headlines.png 2031w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.4A-trend-anecdote-headlines-600x351.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.4A-trend-anecdote-headlines-768x449.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.4A-trend-anecdote-headlines-750x438.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /></a></p> <p>Then, to top things off, the pro-dog media channels will add on their own twist:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.6-trend-anecdote-headlines.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8651\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.6-trend-anecdote-headlines.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.6-trend-anecdote-headlines.png 1435w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.6-trend-anecdote-headlines-600x382.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.6-trend-anecdote-headlines-768x489.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/30.6-trend-anecdote-headlines-750x478.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /></a></p> <p>Of course, that’s just the pro-dog side of things.

In Political Disney World, the beliefs and viewpoints of people in different tribes are premised on entirely different conceptions of reality. Of <em>course</em> they can’t find any common ground.<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote-17-8422\" id=\"note-17-8422\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a> <p style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Category 2: Fallacies that misrepresent an argument</strong></p> <p>In <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chapter 7</a>, we talked about how a viewpoint is nothing more than a hypothesis <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html#testing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">until it’s gone through testing</a>.</p> <p>The real test of any argument is how well it stands up in the face of rigorous criticism. When you’re confident in your viewpoint, you love a chance to throw it into the ring with other arguments and watch it show off its strength. Like real boxing, the stronger the opponents you’ve beaten, the better your ranking. That’s why a strong college paper always includes a strong counterargument—it lets the thesis “show off” in front of the professor.</p> <p><a

real opponents not afraid to tear apart bad arguments, oversimplified PDW narratives end up TKO’d in round 1. That’s why political Echo Chambers are so intent on making it taboo to criticize the narrative—it’s their way of banning anyone from landing a good hit on their sacred baby.</p> <p>But to generate the kind of intense conviction in its members that <em>of COURSE the narrative is correct</em>, political Echo Chambers need to make it <em>seem </em>like the narrative is a champion heavyweight boxer who demolishes anyone who tries to prove it wrong. So how can this happen when no actual living, breathing dissenters are allowed to fight the narrative?</p> <p>Here’s the trick: The Echo Chamber stages scripted fights that seem real to the Echo Chamber’s members, but where the narrative always comes out on top. To pull this off, they use one of the most tried and true tools of the low-rung intellectual world:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/33-man-machine.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8552 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/33-man-machine-413x600.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/33-man-machine-413x600.png 413w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/33-man-machine.png 493w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" /></a></p> <p>The man machine takes real criticism of the narrative and converts it into easy-to-beat opponents.

In 1961, social psychologist William Maguire wrote about what he called the “inoculation effect.” Vaccines work by exposing a person’s immune system to a weak version of a dangerous virus. After the body defeats the weak version of the virus, it develops an immunity against all versions of the virus, including the strong ones. Maguire found that people’s beliefs worked in a similar way. He <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/027e/3e86960b86a59a552d8ed21bb9c4815b5a16.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote</a>:</p> <p><em>[B]eliefs can be “inoculated” against persuasion in subsequent situations involving forced exposure to strong counterarguments by pre-exposing the person to the counterarguments in a weakened form that stimulates—without overcoming—his defenses.</em></p> <p>If Straw Man, Weak Man, and Hollow Man arguments are repeated enough inside a political Echo Chamber, they become people’s ubiquitous conception of what dissenters to the narrative think—eternal proof of how right the narrative is and how stupid anyone is who says otherwise. Soon, any version of dissenting arguments—even the strong ones—will be disregarded as nothing more than better-worded versions of the well-known absurd dissent. People will have become “immune” to changing their mind on the topic.</p> <p>This also makes it even less likely that anyone inside the Echo Chamber will dare challenge the narrative—because the second they do, people will hear it as a defense of all of those terrible arguments and evidence of the challenger’s own stupidity and awfulness. Social penalties will ensue.</p> <p>But argument-misrepresenting fallacies can do more than attack opponents. They can also be used for <em>defense</em>.</p> <p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>The Motte and Bailey</strong></p> <p>The “motte and bailey” fallacy is a recently named piece of age-old trickery (<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SHATVO-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coined by</a> Nicholas Shackel and <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">further popularized by</a> Scott Alexander).</p> <p>The name comes from a type of two-part medieval fortification common in Northern Europe between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries. It looked something like this:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.1-motte.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8572 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.1-motte-750x339.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.1-motte-750x339.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.1-motte-600x271.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.1-motte-768x347.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.1-motte.png 919w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>The bailey is an area of land that was desirable and economically productive to live on but hard to defend. It would always be vulnerable to attack. That’s where the motte came in. A motte is a hill in or adjacent to the bailey with a wooden tower on top of it. When the bailey was threatened, inhabitants would run up the motte and into the tower. The motte, unlike the bailey, was easy to defend and nearly impossible to conquer—so invaders who captured the bailey would be unable to conquer the whole fortification. Eventually, with arrows raining down on them from the motte’s tower, the attackers would give up and leave, at which point the inhabitants could resume life in their pleasant and profitable bailey.</p> <p>Shackel used the motte and bailey as a metaphor for a cheap argument tactic, whereby someone holding a convenient but not-very-defensible “bailey” viewpoint could, when facing dissent to that viewpoint, quickly run up the motte and swap out the viewpoint with a far stronger “motte” position.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.2a-motte.png\"><img

using the man machine reverse—instead of swapping an opponent’s strong argument for a weaker one, it swaps out your own questionable argument for an irrefutable one. The goal is to make it seem like the two arguments are essentially the same, and that anyone who agrees with the motte statement must also agree with the bailey argument. It’s an attempt to <em>stitch </em>one position to another and use it as armor.</p> <p>Political Disney World is a land of sprawling baileys, dotted with motte hills. And if you listen carefully, you’ll notice people darting up to their trusty mottes, using them as trump cards whenever their views come under fire.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.3-motte-examples.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8579\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.3-motte-examples.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"1177\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.3-motte-examples.png 1818w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.3-motte-examples-459x600.png 459w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.3-motte-examples-768x1004.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/37.3-motte-examples-574x750.png 574w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p> <p>Fallacies that misrepresent arguments let people twist, mold, and fabricate arguments in order to engineer faux boxing matches. These tactics go a long way toward making the PDW giant nearly invincible to the outside world. But when all else fails, low-rung political thinkers can reach into their bag for the dirtiest trick of all:</p> <p style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Category 3: Fallacies that misrepresent people</strong></p> <p>Paul Graham once laid out what he calls his <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hierarchy of disagreement</a>, which can be summed up like this:<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8422#footnote2-9-8422\" id=\"note2-9-8422\" rel=\"footnote2\">9</a> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.1-hierarchy.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-8582\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.1-hierarchy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"632\" height=\"474\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.1-hierarchy.png 1200w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.1-hierarchy-600x450.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.1-hierarchy-768x576.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.1-hierarchy-750x563.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" /></a></p> <p>According to Graham, the lowest forms of disagreement are attacks on the person arguing against you instead of the argument itself. On the very bottom level, name calling is the trashiest form of argumentation and the trademark of someone who knows they have little ability to win a real debate. Name-calling is also often a sign an argument’s substance isn’t really relevant because the disagreement is mostly a vehicle two people are using to vent anger onto each other. In any case, no one in human history has ever gotten to the bottom of anything while throwing insults. It can be fun though.</p> <p>One level up, you have the slightly more civilized ad hominem fallacy. People often use “ad hominem” as an umbrella term that includes name-calling, but here, we’re referring to the specific practice of discrediting dissent based on who the dissenter is instead of attacking the argument itself. Another form of ad hominem fallacy is bringing up your own authority on the matter as a way to add credibility to your argument.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.2-ad-hominem.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8583 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.2-ad-hominem-560x600.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.2-ad-hominem-560x600.png 560w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.2-ad-hominem-768x823.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.2-ad-hominem-700x750.png 700w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/38.2-ad-hominem.png 887w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p> <p>In Political Disney World, ad hominem arguments happen constantly, partially because people on the low rungs are childish arguers—but also because on the low rungs, ad hominem arguments are incredibly effective. The reason they’re effective is that the less someone knows about the substance of an issue, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4964-1_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the more they’ll form their judgments</a> based on how much they trust the messenger. In low-rung politics, people who seem trustworthy also tend to <em>seem</em> correct and well-intentioned, regardless of the quality of their arguments. And vice versa.</p> <p>Standard tribalism takes care of most of the trust allotment. Earlier this year, professors Steven Sloman and Elke Weber compiled <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/cognition/vol/188/suppl/C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a wide range of articles</a> exploring the science behind political polarization. Many of the <a href=\"https://behavioralscientist.org/the-cognitive-science-of-political-thought-practical-takeaways-for-political-discourse/\">findings</a> confirmed the intuitive: that people are highly uncharitable in their assumptions about those in their political out-group. For example, if an opposing candidate has mostly mainstream views but holds a few extreme positions, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718301240?via%3Dihub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">people tend to make the assumption</a> that the candidate’s supporters voted for them <em>because of</em>, not <em>in spite of</em>, the candidate’s extreme positions. But there’s no evidence that this is true. Another study <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027718303196\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found that</a> “constituents are likely to attribute the actions of in-group leaders as intended to benefit the country (national interests), and the actions of out-group leaders as intended to benefit the political leaders themselves (egoistic interests)”—even when the actions in question are identical.</p> <p>So people in PDW are already predisposed to not trust those who challenge the narrative—and therefore, to not believe their arguments, regardless of the substance. But a strong tradition of ad hominem reasoning helps cement this key stability mechanism.</p> <p>Enemies of a political Echo Chamber are regularly discredited based on their background, their religion, their race, their gender, their education, their profession, their friendships—none of which addresses whatever clearly-wrong, not-even-worth-listening-to argument they’re actually making.</p> <p>Dissenters are smeared by quotes pulled out of context, a tactic that can double up on misrepresenting the person <em>and </em>misrepresenting their argument. Often, a regrettable quote from a decade earlier is reason enough in PDW to rule out anything a dissenter ever says again—even if the dissenter swears they no longer believe that thing they said back then.</p> <p>If those don’t do the trick, there’s always mind-reading—where disciples of a narrative will assume the worst about the dissenter’s real, true, deep-down intentions (like people assuming that opposition candidates are motivated by selfishness while being more charitable with their preferred candidates). Political Disney World scales this up until everyone in the Echo Chamber is convinced that anyone who wants to curb immigration is racist, or everyone who opposes a war effort is unpatriotic, or everyone who supports tax cuts is greedy, or anything else that helps the Echo Chamber write off those who challenge the narrative.</p> <p>In the most extreme Echo Chambers, the discrediting of arguments and people form an interlocking chain of dismissal. Once a given position is branded as terrible and wrong, anyone holding that position is automatically branded as wrong-headed, which in turn leads people to write off all of their other positions as well. In other cases, once a well-known person is deemed by an Echo Chamber to be bad, their viewpoints become tarnished with the same reputation, which then extends to anyone else who happens to hold those same positions. It’s like a discredit disease that spreads.</p> <p>With a further step back, we can see how all of these fallacies work in tandem with the Echo Chamber’s information-filtering system. The filters let friendly info in, the fallacies twist it to make it even friendlier, then the filters further refine things by elevating the best-manipulated info into further prominence. This ongoing tag-team effort is so effective that not only will everyone in PDW have the same digitized viewpoint on every issue, they’ll be saying <em>the same exact sentences about it</em>, word for word.</p> <p>When everyone is saying the same thing, a feedback loop takes hold—the kind we talked about in Chapter 1 (when we were supposedly talking about our ancestors):</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/39-behavior-loop-with-cross-outs.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8584\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/39-behavior-loop-with-cross-outs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1042\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/39-behavior-loop-with-cross-outs.png 3154w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/39-behavior-loop-with-cross-outs-600x521.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/39-behavior-loop-with-cross-outs-768x667.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/39-behavior-loop-with-cross-outs-750x652.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></a></p> <p>You can take humans out of the Power Games…</p> <p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Politics in 3D</strong></p> <p>Our Psych Spectrum has helped us see the usual left-center-right—</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-1D.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8439 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-1D-750x228.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-1D-750x228.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-1D-600x183.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-1D-768x234.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-1D.png 1479w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a></p> <p>—in 2D, where it looks more like an arch.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-2D-arch-1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8653\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-2D-arch-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"831\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-2D-arch-1.jpg 2018w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-2D-arch-1-600x498.jpg 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-2D-arch-1-768x638.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/0-political-2D-arch-1-750x623.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p> <p>Our third dimension—Emergence Tower—lets us see an even bigger picture.

Put together, they make most political topics look like a camel.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/43-camel.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8588\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/43-camel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1750\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/43-camel.jpg 2500w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/43-camel-600x420.jpg 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/43-camel-768x538.jpg 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/43-camel-750x525.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\" /></a></p> <p>A camel curve moves slower towards progress than a bell curve. The science and business worlds can advance quickly because bad ideas fail quickly. In the world of ideas, Echo Chambers, with their sacred and taboo viewpoints, keep bad ideas alive way longer they would in a normal marketplace. With so many voters locked up in the humps, politicians have to spend a lot of their energy catering to the low-rung ideas and speaking to the low-rung political mentality. The humps distort the shape of the Overton window, making the national brain less intelligent, less adaptable, less rational, and less wise.</p> <p>None of this means the system isn’t working. As we’ve discussed, the vision of the Enlightenment wasn’t to completely repress the human Primitive Mind—it was to ensure that unlike most societies in the past, the Primitive Mind wouldn’t be able to completely take over. It wasn’t meant to generate perfect bell curves of national thinking—it was meant to thaw out static frozen towers enough to end up with stubborn but movable camel humps. With a species like ours, this may be the best we can hope for.</p> <p>Let’s zoom out further. If we move another floor up Emergence Tower, we can see a country like the U.S. as two huge political giants.</p> <p>One way to do that is to slice our 2D political space down the middle vertically, leaving us with a Left giant and a Right giant.</p> <p>The real Left—the <em>complete </em>Left—is the combination of the high-minded, high-rung progressive giant up top and the primitive-minded, Power-Games-playing blue giant down below. Same deal for the Right.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.1-left-right.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8589 size-large\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.1-left-right-746x750.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"746\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.1-left-right-746x750.png 746w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.1-left-right-150x150.png 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.1-left-right-597x600.png 597w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.1-left-right-768x772.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.1-left-right.png 945w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\" /></a></p> <p>Each of these giants is like a large-scale human being—the product of an internal struggle between fire and light.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.2-xray.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8590\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.2-xray.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1059\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.2-xray.png 1579w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.2-xray-567x600.png 567w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.2-xray-768x813.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/44.2-xray-708x750.png 708w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p> <p>Each of us is on our own little mountain, ebbing and flowing in maturity and wisdom. We all have good days and bad days, good years and bad years. We’re each a mix of admirable qualities and character flaws, and we spend our lives trying to become a little better. We’re all human, and so is our society.</p> <p>Like each of us, the political Left and Right are in a constant struggle to grow up. Sometimes they’re childish. Sometimes they’re wise. Like each of us, they can grow up with age—and like each of us, they also sometimes revert and go backwards.</p> <p>Every person is working on two projects all the time: them against the world and them against themselves. High-rung political giants are in the same situation, fighting a two-front battle at all times: a horizontal battle against their high-rung counterpart, in the struggle to determine how the country changes and evolves; and a vertical battle against the low-rung giant that masquerades under the same political banner—a battle that, if lost, threatens to destroy their reputation, hijack its movements, and undermine its progress.</p> <p>There’s another way political parties are like people: in both cases, the individual struggle of one can influence the individual struggles of others nearby.</p> <p>When a couple gets into a fight, it’s often because their Primitive Minds have started going at it with each other. The Primitive Mind of one member of the couple doesn’t want to fight with the Higher Mind of the other—it wants to fight with its primitive little friend. When it’s worked up, it calls the other Primitive Mind out to play, and it usually gets a response. A vicious cycle takes hold as things quickly devolve into nastiness. When one of the Higher Minds in the couple manages to wrest control of their person for long enough to get a word in—something like, “I do see where you’re coming from, I’d feel frustrated in this situation too”—the fight pretty quickly winds down. Once the Higher Minds start communicating with each other, they can regain the edge and take control of the interaction.</p> <p>Between what I’ve observed about politics and what I’ve read about history, political giants seem to work the same way. If, instead of looking at the two-giant U.S. as Left versus Right, we slice our political region horizontally, we see two pairs that function as teams as much as they do as adversaries.</p> <p>The high-rung giants argue with each other constantly, but they know they’re ultimately on the same team with the same overarching goal. It’s harder to see it on the bottom, but the low-rung giants are a team too. Remember, without Jafar, Aladdin is just some guy. The low-rung giants <em>need </em>their counterpart. It’s the key villain in their narrative—the key uniting force that holds everything together. Nothing delights members of a low-rung giant more than the other low-rung giant behaving badly. It makes them furious, but in a super fun way. It lights their fires and injects meaning into their lives. And it justifies a wave of their own childish behavior, which in turn fires up their rival giant even more—like what happens to a couple as they descend into a nastier and nastier fight. When the low-rung giants really get each other riled up, the high-rung giants become increasingly helpless and muted.</p> <p>People in the high-rung political world think of politics as a positive-sum game, and the way they do politics, it is. The clash of the high-rung giants is a classic Value Games clash—it yields progress and wisdom.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/45.1-clash.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8591 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/45.1-clash-435x600.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/45.1-clash-435x600.png 435w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/45.1-clash-544x750.png 544w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/45.1-clash.png 551w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\" /></a></p> <p>In the low-rung political world, politics is seen as a zero-sum game—when one side wins, the other loses, and that’s that.

Re-isolate myself from dissent, reconfirm my established beliefs, and restore my confidence (which the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-010-9112-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">backfire effect</a> suggests wouldn’t have taken long).</p> <p><strong>Option 2: Take the plunge.</strong> Let go of my comfortable conviction and embrace these new bad feelings of self-doubt and existential confusion.</p> <p>I went tumbling.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.3-childs-hill.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8677 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.3-childs-hill-600x596.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.3-childs-hill-600x596.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.3-childs-hill-150x150.png 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.3-childs-hill-768x762.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.3-childs-hill-750x744.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.3-childs-hill.png 813w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> <p>As I tumbled, it sunk in that to be as opinionated as I had been entering college, you either have to be an expert or full of shit—and I wasn’t an expert. I was a Democrat mostly for the same reason that I was a Red Sox fan. They were my team, and that was that.</p> <p>Pretty soon I had no idea what I thought or who I was or what was right or wrong. I didn’t feel like a proud Democrat anymore. Tim the Democrat was a fraud and I was determined not to be a fraud ever again. But a Republican? <em>Me?</em> A <em>Republican? </em>No way. I had been indoctrinated too hard for too long to fully switch teams. I started to dread political conversation because I wasn’t sure who I was supposed to <em>be</em> when these conversations happened. It was a bad situation. I was here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4-childs-hill.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8601 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4-childs-hill-600x596.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4-childs-hill-600x596.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4-childs-hill-150x150.png 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4-childs-hill-768x762.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4-childs-hill-750x744.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4-childs-hill.png 813w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p> <p>Insecure Canyon is where you are when you’re past the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html#epiphany1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Wait I actually don’t know shit” epiphany</a>, but not yet past the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html#epiphany2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Ohhhh no one <em>else</em> knows shit either” epiphany</a>. The two-part epiphany, when still incomplete, leaves a thinker self-aware enough to know what they don’t know but not yet wise enough to know that <em>not</em> knowing is a healthy, productive state. The unpleasant feeling of existential confusion and intellectual insecurity is the gateway drug to real intellectual growth—but when you haven’t had the complete epiphany, it doesn’t feel that way. It feels shameful and embarrassing. You feel stupid and wishy-washy, and you hope no one finds out how little you know. That’s where I was.</p> <p>And then it happened. I was in my freshman dorm room and one of my roommate’s friends was hanging out, and he said something like, “And really, all the reasonable people are centrist anyway.”</p> <p>It all clicked. I was a <em>Centrist</em>. It was the perfect new identity. Fuck all those political extremists. <em>I </em>was a thoughtful, nuanced, moderate thinker who acknowledged that both sides had some good points and some bad points.</p> <p>We all look back on our previous selves and cringe about certain things. We’ve each got a list. Right near the top of mine is me coming home for Thanksgiving during my freshman year of college and declaring to anyone who would listen about how I was a Centrist. Wincey as fuck.</p> <p>People in Insecure Canyon are super vulnerable. They’re perfect targets for indoctrination into a new dogma, because they’re still too hazy to understand how knowledge works, and they’re dying to feel smart again. That’s why many people in Insecure Canyon end up making the mistake Tim the Centrist Moderate Independent made—they jump onto another dogma boat. This feels like a step forward. But it’s the opposite. It’s a young chick flying for the first time, feeling the cold winds, and making a U-turn right back to the nest. This is what I did. I had tried to solve the bad feelings of Insecure Canyon by running back up to the top of Child’s Hill, just with a new identity cloak on. I went from a Fraud Democrat to a Fraud Centrist.</p> <p>The whole thing reminds me of a drawing from <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/01/the-great-perils-of-social-interaction.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another post</a>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/48-concept-of-you.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8602 \" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/48-concept-of-you.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"330\" height=\"350\" /></a></strong></p> <p>Thankfully, some self-awareness eventually crept in. My brief foray into Centrism turned out to be like getting out of a long relationship with a crazy person only to immediately jump into a rebound fling with the next person I met. But the fling had taught me something. If I were ever going to really figure out who I was and get myself into a healthy future relationship, I’d have to be okay with being single for a while.</p> <p>So my identity shifted again, this time to a guy who was Still Asking Questions. I became a SAQist.</p> <p>Over the next few years, I started to look up for the first time and notice the y-axis of the political space. This whole time, I had been staring down at the ground, searching for the right spot along the What You Think axis—when the real answer was <em>above </em>me.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4A-me-looking-up-1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8697\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4A-me-looking-up-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1937\" height=\"1508\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4A-me-looking-up-1.png 1937w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4A-me-looking-up-1-600x467.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4A-me-looking-up-1-768x598.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.4A-me-looking-up-1-750x584.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1937px) 100vw, 1937px\" /></a></p> <p>Looking up at the vertical axis for the first time, I felt like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9woRJ7-mD7Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these monkeys</a>.</p> <p>On the roller coaster, I was now standing here, a born-again SAQist, ready to start a life of climbing:</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.5-childs-hill.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-8603 size-medium\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.5-childs-hill-600x596.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.5-childs-hill-600x596.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.5-childs-hill-150x150.png 150w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.5-childs-hill-768x762.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.5-childs-hill-750x744.png 750w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50.5-childs-hill.png 813w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></strong></p> <p>I’d like to tell you that it’s been a straightforward trudge up Grown-Up Mountain since then.</p> <p>But old habits die hard, and it turns out it’s <em>really </em>hard to stay on Grown-Up Mountain. When I declared myself an unattached SAQist, I didn’t realize just how attached my Primitive Mind was to the color blue.</p> <p>I’d go through all the right motions—reading op-eds by the most convincing conservative writers and seeking out flaws in Democrat politicians or their platforms. I played the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html#why\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Why?” Game</a> with myself about my lingering instinct that the left’s policies were more logical and more reasonable and search for evidence that those instincts were no more than a bad habit. I genuinely began to feel conflicted and confused about whether the Right or the Left made more sense when it came to fiscal and foreign policy and the optimal size of government.</p> <p>But then election season would come around, and I’d feel like I was rooting for the Red Sox again. The Democrats still felt like “my people,” no matter how hard I tried to shake the feeling off. Were the Democrats actually just more in line with my values, or was it just my Primitive Mind doing this? Or was it a little of both?</p> <p>Whatever the cause of my attachment, the Republicans of the 2000s—with their Iraq War and their snowballs and their traditional marriage and their stem cell bans—weren’t helping the situation. As I tried to rid myself of the notion that the Democrats were “my people,” the Republicans—with their Sarah Palin and their Sean Hannity and their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxzONeK1OwQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Perry ad</a> and their <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2olwuAy3_og?t=814\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">just watch this for 30 seconds</a>—would continually make it crystal clear that they were <em>certainly </em>not my people.</p> <p>Well good news! Over the past decade, the Left finally did it. They regressed so far that they became as “not my people” as the Republicans. They actually went insane enough to free me from my tribal handcuffs. I spent a lot of years saying I was “an Independent” while not truly believing it. Today, I can say it with a straight face.</p> <p>It’s amazing how much clearer your vision gets when you really—<em>actually</em>—separate your identity from a tribe. I can see reality better now. The bad news is that I don’t like what I see with my new eyes. It’s…the situation is pretty scary.</p> <p>We’ve got a problem and we need to fix it.</p> <p>This whole series so far has been getting us ready to dive head first into that problem, with clearer eyes than normal. That’s where we’ll be headed in the final group of chapters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/01/sick-giant.html\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-7661\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"103\" height=\"56\" srcset=\"http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1.png 1100w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-300x164.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-768x419.png 768w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-600x327.png 600w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-374x200.png 374w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/next-1-239x130.png 239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 103px) 100vw, 103px\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wbwFont\">Chapter 10: <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/01/sick-giant.html\">A Sick Giant</a></p> \n              <div style=\"height:38px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p> <p>If you like Wait But Why, sign up for the <strong><a class=\"ClickPico PicoRule\">email list</a></strong> and we’ll send you new posts right when they come out.
