Your login credentials are one of your first lines of defense against intruders, so we’ve integrated <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/password-checkup/\">Password Checkup</a> into devices running Android 9 and above. This feature lets you know if the password you used has been previously exposed and what to do about it.</p><br/><p>Now when you enter a password into an app on your phone using Autofill with Google, we’ll check those credentials against a list of known compromised passwords — that is, passwords that have potentially already been stolen and posted on the web. If your credentials show up on one of these lists, we’ll alert you and guide you to check your password and change it. </p><br/><p>Learn more on <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9457609?hl=en#zippy=%2Cview-data-breaches-we-check\">our support page</a> about changing unsafe passwords.
