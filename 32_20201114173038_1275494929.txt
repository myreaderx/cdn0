In fact, the last five American presidents have been labeled \"illegitimate\" by their opponents, demonstrating a growing and dangerous trend that threatens bedrock principles of our democracy.</p><p>Bill Clinton's 1992 victory came as a result of a three-way race between him, George H.W. Bush, and the third-party candidate, Ross Perot. Garnering 43 percent of the popular vote, Clinton's support in the country seemed low, especially in light of the fact that Republicans blamed Ross Perot for siphoning off votes that their candidate could have received. As a result, Republican leaders at the time like Bob Dole <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-11-08-op-186-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">proclaimed</a> that Clinton did not have a mandate to enact his legislative agenda, hinting at his lack of true legitimacy. </p><p>This kind of sentiment led to opposition to what was perceived as Clinton's liberal agenda—allowing gay people in the military, raising taxes, and attempting to fix the healthcare system. The Republican opposition coalesced in the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/11/newt-gingrich-says-youre-welcome/570832/\" target=\"_blank\">Gingrich Revolution of 1994</a> and culminated in the impeachment hearings of Clinton's second term.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"Bill Clinton, Ross Perot, and George H.

Bush and Al Gore. Bush received fewer votes in the national count and won as a result of a Supreme Court decision after a wait of several weeks. The infamous Bush v. Gore decision stopped a recount of Florida votes, giving the state to Bush by just a few hundred votes. A later analysis revealed that a full statewide recount could have netted Gore the victory. As such, a perception of illegitimacy followed Bush (at least until 9/11).</p><p>Who was calling for Bush's impeachment at the time for getting the U.S. involved in the Iraq War under false pretenses (lack of WMDs)? None other than Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/13/in-2008-donald-trump-said-george-w-bush-shouldve-been-impeached/\" target=\"_blank\">who revealed</a> how he thought Clinton's impeachment was a total overreach compared to the fact that Bush got off scot-free for pulling America into a war it didn't need to fight.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"Al Gore supporters\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"97eac9928e7a188cc85ad84f4c2d228e\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"b933e\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Njc5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NjExNjQyN30.a4RM1ogPHgY6W2beG2YpF5wiGpR2pR8h2e_zP3oMfcU/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Trump, of course, is also the one who for years <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/09/politics/donald-trump-birther/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">questioned</a> the right of the next president, Barack Obama, to have such a position. Trump was the most high-profile \"birther,\" pushing the unfounded conspiracy that Obama wasn't a real American and was, in fact, born in Kenya. </p><p>Who else spread such theories? It's worth noting that Hillary Clinton supporters were <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/birtherism-and-trump/610978/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">known to circulate </a>chain emails with similar Kenya-oriented claims about Obama's origins.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"Donald Trump and Barack Obama\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"ea9649e84e63355e9a3d91164d58a44e\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"72426\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Njc1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMTM2NzYzMX0.g1qwA5BXlH7La5l6hp09s1Ev-EF_QV3R14F73OmTRk4/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><p>In his turn at the helm, Donald Trump's 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton was plagued strongly by the notion that he received help from foreign powers and didn't win fair and square. The Mueller investigation into his potential collusion with Russia found much support for this notion but didn't go as far as to charge the President. Still, harkening to the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sen-mccain-russia-s-election-meddling-unprecedented-attack-n700981\" target=\"_blank\">clear-cut conclusions</a> of various investigative and spy agencies, Democrats generally saw a major asterisk around Trump's election, with Hillary Clinton and Rep. John Lewis flat-out <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/john-lewis-trump-won-t-be-legitimate-president-n706676\" target=\"_blank\">calling him</a> an \"illegitimate\" president.<br/></p><p>The nearly two decades of political behavior that saw an escalation of legitimacy attacks against the country's most powerful elected leader bring us to 2020, with another crisis in the making, courtesy of Trump. With no evidence to back it up, the President has been claiming that the election has been stolen from him in favor of Joe Biden. While his arguments haven't found much support among the courts, Trump continues to make the claim, both to continue the fight and to weaken his opponent even if Biden does end up with the Presidency.</p><h3></h3><br><img alt=\"Donald Trump and Joe Biden\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"03506fe8a97e3135bd20e6520f3812b9\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"3d21e\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Njc2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMTIwNzUzNn0._eLNXNU7IvUaNhbpufjvDmOp4ZiXfAnCI_ZalxzDoq8/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><p>Where does this leave us, with each subsequent election creating a deep polarization and disappointing half the country to the point where they simply don't believe the other side and feel cheated? Nowhere good. Professor of Journalism Andrés Martinez described the situation aptly in 2017, in a way that resonates even louder today when we face a continuation of this sad trend:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">\"</span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">It's desirable, and quintessentially American, to strenuously oppose policies and ideas we disagree with,\" wrote Martinez in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/20/americans-have-seen-the-last-four-presidents-as-illegitimate-heres-why/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post.</a> \"But the haste of recent years to delegitimize opponents, and to call them un-American, is itself un-American. It leaves us with a bankrupt, even <em>illegitimate</em>, politics, devoid of shared narratives, aspirations, values and, increasingly, facts.\"</span></p><p>Martinez's prescience that facts will fall soundly at the expense of political ambitions is exactly where we find ourselves. The once-collegial chambers of government rife with unbreakable gridlock and loud accusations of misdeeds by opponents that your side doesn't even need to prove any more. A country where half the people feel the leader is illegitimate yet again but with much more anxiety and anger than ever before. A country tearing itself apart. </p></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ozUFZ-9EJIM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 14:30:02 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Njc3NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMjg4MTkwOH0.YLFi3AianGMsoMaxlHAt6HdNWuiDWlU72MvMV2Td-B0/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C710%2C0%2C60&height=700","linkMd5":"560d17f16e5555cec3293a2b364d255d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn52@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-04-141_f7e2399ce4ec5b62.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":231884,"destBytes":231884,"author":"Paul Ratner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Njc3NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMjg4MTkwOH0.YLFi3AianGMsoMaxlHAt6HdNWuiDWlU72MvMV2Td-B0/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C710%2C0%2C60&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn52@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-04-141_f7e2399ce4ec5b62.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Njc4Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTk2NjY4Nn0.BFQdBr44Btm5LNeFeKKB0qdqbUv3qAGJcPpcDds4Gss/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn96@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-34-980_c8159f2fb5e6a809.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Njc5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NjExNjQyN30.a4RM1ogPHgY6W2beG2YpF5wiGpR2pR8h2e_zP3oMfcU/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn24@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-34-961_b933e492b05641dd.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Njc1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMTM2NzYzMX0.g1qwA5BXlH7La5l6hp09s1Ev-EF_QV3R14F73OmTRk4/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn26@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-34-788_72426e9074fc7e11.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Njc2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMTIwNzUzNn0._eLNXNU7IvUaNhbpufjvDmOp4ZiXfAnCI_ZalxzDoq8/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn2@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-35-745_3d21ee43162eb242.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ozUFZ-9EJIM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn34@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-35-001_ecdd8e0d1c6b556e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001749},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"Study warns of delayed flu outbreaks after pandemic ends","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/covid-19-flu-outbreak","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3NDYxNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1ODA2NjkxMX0.UNIOrgvFI-hnJhBmiJLEPLvzI4zIaW20hAeH0qj8K3c/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C30%2C0%2C75&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>A new study out of Princeton suggests that measures to prevent COVID-19 are also preventing certain other diseases. </li><li>The nature of seasonal diseases means that people who avoid them this year may just be putting it off, leading to a large wave later. </li><li>These estimates don't mean we should be less preventive now, only that we must be sure to take care in the future. </li></ul><hr/><p> As the United States continues to struggle with the pandemic, the proven effectiveness of face masks to reduce the rate and risk of infection continues to be underutilized. Places that have implemented mask and distancing mandates are seeing generally lower rates of transmission and infection than those without these mandates, as more fully explained <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-06/tl-pss060120.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/21546014/mask-mandates-coronavirus-covid-19\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. <br/> <br/> However, one of the three iron laws of the cosmos is the law of unintended consequences; no matter what you do, there will be at least one.</p><p> As a study out of Princeton has just shown, this also applies to live-saving mask mandates. Given that many other diseases follow predictable cycles, a team of researchers has shown that the steps we're taking to prevent the spread of COVID-19 now may lead to larger outbreaks of seasonal diseases later. <br/> <br/> Before we go any further, we want to make it clear that we are not telling you stop wearing a mask, social distancing, or taking all the precautions against catching and spreading COVID. The point of this study and this article is to make people aware of a side effect of these measures so that we can better deal with them later, not to suggest that these measures not be taken.  </p><h3></h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UFX9oS2kpUA\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> A team of researchers based out of Princeton published a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/11/06/2013182117\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing the predictions of a model that estimates the after effects of our current efforts to avoid COVID-19.</p><p>As it turns out, Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and wearing masks help prevent more than just COVID-19. Instances of other diseases, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the flu, are also lower than they would otherwise be due to people taking these precautions. Cases of RSV may have declined by as much as a 20 percent already.  </p><p> This makes a lot of intuitive sense. Your mask doesn't care what kind of virus it keeps you from exhaling towards other people; it stops all of them. If you stay inside to avoid catching a particular disease, you still avoid all of them. This kind of thing has happened before. The precautions taken during the 1918 flu pandemic probably reduced measles cases by a third. <br/> <br/> However, these diseases come back seasonally and will be there waiting for us when the current pandemic ends. This might be a bit of a problem, as lead author Rachel Baker <a href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/11/09/large-delayed-outbreaks-endemic-diseases-possible-following-covid-19-controls\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a>:<br/> <br/> \"While this reduction in cases could be interpreted as a positive side effect of COVID-19 prevention, the reality is much more complex. Our results suggest that susceptibility to these other diseases, such as RSV and flu, could increase while NPIs are in place, resulting in large outbreaks when they begin circulating again.\"<br/> <br/> Think of it like this: As fewer and fewer people get these diseases due to our current mask and social distancing tendencies, fewer and fewer people have immunity to them. Immunity to RSV lasts only a few <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">years</a>. If people who would have gotten it this year don't, they may contract and spread it next year when they aren't working so hard to avoid respiratory infections, along with all the other people who were likely to get it next year anyway for typical reasons. <br/> <br/> The model is less exact for the flu, given the number of variables affecting how contagious the flu is from year to year, but a similar principle applies. </p><p><br/> There is a fair amount of uncertainty to these findings, as the authors admit. Outbreaks in some areas have been better studied than others. The behavior of these seasonal outbreaks is more thoroughly understood in Florida than in Minnesota, for example, and these predictions may not be as applicable there. The models are also highly dependent on what measures we take and when to fight COVID-19, and the worst-case ones rely on a lot of things happening in tandem. </p> So while we can't know exactly what that next flu season will look like, the essential finding of this study is that it is likely to be worse than it otherwise would be, everything else being equal. Various measures, such as getting more people vaccinated against the flu and keeping people home when they are sick with seemingly banal colds, will be necessary in the years to come.

Selaru from Johns Hopkins University. The scientists took inspiration from the <em>hookworm</em> – parasitic worm that is known to dig its sharp teeth into the intestines of the host. The scientists created shape-shifting microdevices called \"<em>theragrippers</em>\" that can mimic the worm and latch on to the intestinal mucosa of a patient. </p><p>The six-pointed devices, each as large as a dust speck, are made of metal and thin film that can allow them to change shapes. They are covered by a heat-sensitive paraffin wax and have the potential to release a drug gradually into the body. This method improves upon other extended-release drugs that tend to go all the way through the gastrointestinal tract before fully dispensing all medicine.</p><h3></h3><br/><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Normal constriction and relaxation of GI tract muscles make it impossible for extended-release drugs to stay in the intestine long enough for the patient to receive the full dose,\" <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-11-tiny-machines-medicine-efficiently.html\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> Selaru.\" We've been working to solve this problem by designing these small drug carriers that can autonomously latch onto the intestinal mucosa and keep the drug load inside the GI tract for a desired duration of time.\"</p><p>The scientists say that thousands such devices can be let loose in a GI tract. As the wax coating on tiny robots matches the body's inside temperature, theraggrippers automatically close and latch on to the wall of the colon. As they do so and dig into the mucosa, they start slowly releasing the stored medicine. In time, the devices lose their grip on the intestine tissue and leave the organ through usual gastrointestinal function. </p><h3>March of the microscopic robots</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"beb2343e06c26aa2bdd6658a72166dde\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TjdGuBK9mI?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><h3></h3><br/><p>The very small robots don't rely on electricity or wireless signals, and don't have room for batteries, antennas, or any external controls, explained Gracias.

Rauch cites a Cato Institute <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share\" target=\"_blank\">poll</a> that found a third of Americans worry their careers will be harmed if they express their real political opinions. Canceling is different than healthy criticism, Rauch writes, because canceling \"is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity[.]\"</p>\n<p>And conformity is a death knell for liberalism. In a homogenous society—one in which everyone has roughly the same background, religion, values, and goals—people will generally agree on what it means to be a good person and live a good life. But a key tenet of liberalism is pluralism: the idea that different people, traditions, and beliefs not only <em>can</em> coexist together in the same society but also <em>should</em> coexist together because society benefits from vibrant heterogeneity. </p>\n<p>\"Liberal thinking really arises out of a reflection on the fact that people disagree substantially about things,\" Chandran Kukathas, professor at Singapore Management University, says in a Big Think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLhVZ-RB3o\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> on pluralism and toleration. \"They have different ways of life.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><blockquote>[Cancel culture] is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity[.]</blockquote><h3></h3><br/><p>Throughout history, men and women who've changed the world have been living examples of pluralism—people whose lives and minds were unique products of a diverse, interconnected world. Alexander Hamilton was, as the musical <em>Hamilton</em> says, \"a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean\" before he came to the colonies. Marie Curie (neé Skłodowska) was the daughter of two Polish teachers, one atheist and one Catholic, and attended an underground university in Warsaw before immigrating to Paris. Sergey Brin was born in the Soviet Union to Jewish parents before his family fled persecution and came to the United States, where Brin co-founded Google.</p><p>A pluralistic society nourishes innovation and progress, where diverse people with unique life experiences develop and share ideas. If people stayed in discrete, homogenous communities, how many world-changing lives and ideas would never have existed?</p><p>Critics might say: It's one thing to welcome people from diverse backgrounds into your society; it's another to welcome diverse ideas, even if some are offensive or harmful.</p><p>But our vibrant, evolving world depends on diverse ideas and cultures. In a homogenous society, ideas and customs can be stagnant for generations. But in a pluralistic society, ideas and customs evolve by being brought into constant contact with alternative ideas and customs. In <em>On Liberty</em>, John Stuart Mill <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a>:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">…the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.</p><p>For humanity to benefit from pluralism—to benefit from the exchange of cultures and the collision of ideas—we must practice toleration. We must respect the rights of our colleagues and neighbors to think and live differently than we do.</p><p>When someone practices toleration, Kukathas says, they don't just put up with something but actually acknowledge it \"with a kind of open spirit.\" Intentional, meaningful tolerance includes making an effort to understand others' points of view. We don't have to agree, but we should seek to understand. And, ultimately, we have to tolerate ideas we disagree with if we want to live in a flourishing and peaceful society.</p><p>This is what cancel culture robs society of—the healthy and essential practice of toleration, without which pluralism and a peaceful society cannot be sustained. </p><h3></h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"0929dd8317daba43c05af8dc8b97f9a3\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDLhVZ-RB3o?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/WHPAKoGIo3I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 04 Nov 2020 21:26:49 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY3Njc1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDM0NDU5NH0.DhjB4SSOZGY7NZg0siCGFbIT-GrwOPIi765O2Cs8szA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"389ddb4aa829c18865b9ef91be17cd8e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn31@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-08-388_900f8ce0b7a0a340.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":28202,"destBytes":28202,"author":"Nicole Yeatman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY3Njc1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDM0NDU5NH0.DhjB4SSOZGY7NZg0siCGFbIT-GrwOPIi765O2Cs8szA/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn31@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-08-388_900f8ce0b7a0a340.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/WHPAKoGIo3I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn89@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-36-307_2685905e493d4072.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001752},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"Denmark to kill 17 million mink to prevent spread of mutated coronavirus","link":"https://bigthink.com/coronavirus/covid-mutation","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY4Njg2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1OTY0OTUxOX0.u8aQYoSf2_uahdpC2m9ysrGg4gWC9ayZRdf8Arp7VzY/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C105%2C0%2C70&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Danish officials say farm-raised mink have infected 12 people with a mutated strain of coronavirus.</li><li>Although those people didn't suffer especially serious symptoms, they responded relatively poorly to antibody treatments.</li><li>Unlike most other animals, mustelids (like mink) are especially susceptible to contracting coronaviruses.</li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>The Danish government plans to kill millions of farm-raised mink over concerns that the animals are transmitting a mutated form of the novel coronavirus to humans.</p><p>In May, Danish officials first <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2020/05/19/new-results-from-research-into-covid-19-on-mink-farms\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that mink had likely transmitted the coronavirus to a human working on a farm.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html\" target=\"_blank\">notes</a> that while COVID-19 has been found in some animals like cats, dogs and a zoo tiger, there's currently \"no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.\"<br/></p><p>That might seem strange. After all, the coronavirus almost surely originated in animals, likely bats. The virus then likely passed from bats to an intermediary host (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.580137/full\" target=\"_blank\">maybe a pangolin</a>) and then to humans. </p><p>In the animal kingdom, there are millions of viruses (many uncatalogued) spreading throughout various species. But the vast majority will never spill over into humans. And among the rare ones that do, most won't be anywhere near as destructive as the novel coronavirus.</p><p>That's because viruses have to overcome many hurdles in order to jump from species to species.</p><p>For example, the host species (known epidemiologically as a <a href=\"https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/reservoir-host#:~:text=Reservoir%20host-,Definition,as%20a%20source%20of%20infection.\" target=\"_blank\">reservoir</a>) needs to be shedding enough of the virus when it comes in close contact with another species, say humans. The virus would also need the right kind of protein to bind to human cells. Finally, it would need to replicate itself without getting detected and eradicated by the immune system.</p><p>In short, the stars need to align in order for a spillover event to trigger a pandemic. It's rare, but it happens sometimes.</p><h3>COVID-19 in Denmark's mink</h3><br><p>The concern with the coronavirus spreading among minks is twofold. First, mink raised on farms are kept in crowded conditions, making it easier for the virus to spread among the animals, and thus to humans, if the virus is successfully spilling over. <br/></p><p>Second: As the virus spreads among the mink, it's likely to mutate. Mutations don't necessarily make a virus more transmissible or deadly. Of course, that's theoretically possible. Researchers have already catalogued more than 12,000 mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. </p><h3></h3><br><img alt=\"virus illustration\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d5147b8305ab193215f98fabb6b53197\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"43192\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY4Njk0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyODI3OTg4NX0.woGejl_KqRfF_SbrEJFI6YvNIcFgW-zu096OpM7bCoQ/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>But the coronavirus is actually mutating at a relatively <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24833053-600-is-the-coronavirus-evolving-and-will-it-become-more-or-less-deadly/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">slow rate</a>, and the vast majority of those mutations are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02544-6#:~:text=Compared%20with%20HIV%2C%20SARS%2DCoV,from%20people%20with%20COVID%2D19.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unlikely to have an effect</a> on transmission rate, morbidity, or mortality.</p><p>Mutations could also hurt the virus, as Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Basel, told Nature: \"It's much easier to break something than it is to fix it.\"</p><p>(To be sure, <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-10-coronavirus-mutation-contagious.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> suggests some mutations might be making the coronavirus slightly more transmissible.)</p><p>But it's also possible that mutations to the coronavirus — even those that don't significantly change its effects on animals or humans — could increase the diversity among SARS-CoV-2 strains to the point where vaccines become less effective.</p><p>Without more data, it's too early to know whether that's a realistic threat in Denmark or other countries. But Danish officials chose not to front the risk.</p></br></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ykQK7FQxEwY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 05 Nov 2020 23:02:43 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY4Njg2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1OTY0OTUxOX0.u8aQYoSf2_uahdpC2m9ysrGg4gWC9ayZRdf8Arp7VzY/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C105%2C0%2C70&height=700","linkMd5":"1e6d182cbf003abf71a5226fd43e7a54","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn16@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-02-111_3ba83a058e7c1fa6.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":65210,"destBytes":65210,"author":"Stephen Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY4Njg2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1OTY0OTUxOX0.u8aQYoSf2_uahdpC2m9ysrGg4gWC9ayZRdf8Arp7VzY/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C105%2C0%2C70&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn16@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-02-111_3ba83a058e7c1fa6.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY4Njk0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyODI3OTg4NX0.woGejl_KqRfF_SbrEJFI6YvNIcFgW-zu096OpM7bCoQ/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn39@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-34-993_431924e436f2da88.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ykQK7FQxEwY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn41@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-34-999_f631897887585aa8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001752},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"The Matrix is already here: Social media promised to connect us, but left us isolated, scared and tribal","link":"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/social-media-matrix","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3NDUzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMzI2Njc2Nn0.GlzKVCEfXyRP1xzrtuoTNNHtD_NNtEUvIgO4gm_Xb-s/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C75%2C0%2C707&height=700\"/><br/><br/>About a year ago I began to follow my interest in health and fitness on Instagram. Soon I began to see more and more fitness-related accounts, groups, posts and ads.<hr/><p> I kept clicking and following, and eventually my Instagram became all about fit people, fitness and motivational material, and advertisements. Does this sound familiar?</p><p>While the algorithms and my brain kept me scrolling on the endless feeds, I was reminded of what digital marketers like to say: “Money is in the list.\" That is, the more customized your group, people and page follows, the less time and money is needed to sell you related ideas. Instead, brand ambassadors will do the work, spreading products, ideas and ideologies with passion and free of charge.  </p><p><a href=\"https://www.starclab.org/members/arash-javanbakht\" target=\"_blank\">I'm a psychiatrist</a> who studies anxiety and stress, and I often write about how our politics and culture are mired in fear and tribalism. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-arakcheieva-57850916/\" target=\"_blank\">My co-author</a> is a digital marketing expert who brings expertise to the technological-psychological aspect of this discussion. With the nation on edge, we believe it's critical to look at how easily our society is being manipulated into tribalism in the age of social media. Even after the exhausting election cycle is over, the division persists, if not widening, and conspiracy theories continue to emerge, grow and divide on the social media. Based on our knowledge of stress, fear and social media, we offer you some ways to weather the next few days, and protect yourself against the current divisive environment.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>The promise, the Matrix</h2><p>Those of us old enough to know what life was like before social media may remember how exciting Facebook was at its inception. Imagine, the ability to connect with old friends we had not seen for decades! Then, Facebook was a virtual dynamic conversation. This brilliant idea, to connect to others with shared experiences and interests, was strengthened with the advent of Twitter, Instagram and apps.</p><p>Things did not remain that simple. These platforms have morphed into Frankenstein's monsters, filled with so-called friends we've never met, slanted news stories, celebrity gossip, self-aggrandizement and ads.</p><p>The artificial intelligence behind these platforms determines what you see based on your social media and web activity, including <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ds/preferences/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">your engagement</a> with pages and ads. For example, on Twitter you may follow the politicians you like. Twitter algorithms quickly respond and show you more posts and people related to that political leaning. The more you like, follow and share, the faster you find yourself moving in that political direction. There is, however, this nuance: Those algorithms tracking you are often triggered by your <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-science-of-fright-why-we-love-to-be-scared-85885\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">negative emotions</a>, typically impulsivity or anger.</p><p>As a result, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc_Jq42Og7Q&fbclid=IwAR0rdHWlYYnBmmxVwTD36JZ__HQfaU9BcgifDNFuG4stTLLyQvykIh5cvNo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the algorithms</a> amplify the negative and then spread it by sharing it among groups. This might play a role in the widespread anger among those engaged in politics, regardless of their side of the aisle.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>The digital tribe</h2><p>Eventually, the algorithms expose us mostly to the ideology of one \"digital tribe\" – the same way my Instagram world became only superfit and active people. This is how one's Matrix can become the extremes of conservatism, liberalism, different religions, climate change worriers or deniers or other ideologies. Members of each tribe keep consuming and feeding one another the same ideology while policing one another against opening up to \"the others.\"</p><p>We are inherently tribal creatures anyway; but particularly when we're scared, we regress further into tribalism and tend to trust the information relayed to us by our tribe and not by others. Normally, that's <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/trump-the-politics-of-fear-and-racism-how-our-brains-can-be-manipulated-to-tribalism-139811\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an evolutionary advantage</a>. Trust leads to group cohesion, and it helps us survive.</p><p>But now, that same tribalism – along with peer pressure, negative emotions and short tempers – often lead to ostracizing those who disagree with you. <a href=\"https://civicscience.com/the-majority-of-americans-are-also-social-distancing-from-politics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In one study</a>, 61% of Americans reported having unfriended, unfollowed or blocked someone on social media because of their political views or posts.</p><p>Higher levels of social media use and exposure to sensationalized news about the pandemic is linked with <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32945123/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">increased depression and stress</a>. And more time spent on social media correlates with <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27723539/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">higher anxiety</a>, which can create a negative loop. <a href=\"https://www.journalism.org/2020/10/07/before-trump-tested-positive-for-coronavirus-republicans-attention-to-pandemic-had-sharply-declined/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">One example</a>: The Pew Research Center reports 90% of Republicans who get their political news only from conservative platforms said the U.S. has controlled the COVID-19 outbreak as much as possible. Yet less than half of Republicans who rely on at least one other major news provider thought so.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>The Matrix does the thinking</h2><p>Human thinking itself has been transformed. It's now more difficult for us to grasp the \"big picture.\" A book is a long read these days, too much for some people. Scrolling and swiping culture has reduced our attention span (on average people spend <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/capturing-attention-feed-video-creative\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1.7 to 2.5 seconds</a> on a Facebook news feed item). It has also deactivated our critical thinking skills. Even really big news doesn't last on our feed longer than a few hours; after all, the next blockbuster story is just ahead. The Matrix does the thinking; we consume the ideology and are bolstered by the likes from our tribemates.</p><p>Before all this, our social exposure was mostly to family, friends, relatives, neighbors, classmates, TV, movies, radio, newspapers, magazines and books. And that was enough. In that, there was diversity and a relatively healthy information diet with a wide variety of nutrients. We always knew people who were not like minded, but getting along with them was normal life, part of the deal. Now those different voices have become more distant – \"the others\" we love to hate on social media.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Is there a red pill?</h2><p>We need to take back the control. Here are seven things we can do to unplug ourselves out of the Matrix:</p><ul><li>Review and update <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ds/preferences/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">your ad preferences</a> on social media at least once per year.</li><li>Confuse the AI by flagging all ads and suggestions as \"irrelevant.\"</li><li>Practice being more inclusive. Check other websites, read their news and do not \"unfriend\" people who think differently from you.</li><li>Turn off cable news and read instead. Or at least put a disciplined limit on hours of exposure.</li><li>Check out less biased sources of news such as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NPR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BBC</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a>.</li><li>If you think everything your tribe leaders say is absolute truth, think again.</li><li>Go offline and go out (just wear your mask). Practice smartphone-free hours.</li><li>Finally, remember that your neighbor who supports the other football team or the other political party <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1324926298762870785?s=20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">is not your enemy</a>; you can still go for a bike ride together! I did today, and we didn't even have to talk politics.</li></ul><p>It's time to take the red pill. Take these seven steps, and you won't give in to the Matrix.</p><p><em>This piece was co-authored with Maryna Arakcheieva, who is expert in digital solutions and marketing</em>.<img alt=\"The Conversation\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/148799/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\"/></p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/arash-javanbakht-416594\" target=\"_blank\">Arash Javanbakht</a>, Associate Professor of Psychiatry, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/wayne-state-university-989\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wayne State University</a></em></p><p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

Is there an innate perception of beauty that's maintained throughout all scenarios? Interestingly, a new study concludes that our brains have not one but two separate \"beauty centers\" – one for art and one for faces.</p><p>Scientists carried out a meta-analysis of existing fMRI studies with around a 1,000 people. Led by Hu Chuan-Peng of Tsinghua University, China, the team zeroed in on 49 studies that performed brain analyses of people between 18 and 50. None of them were art experts, but some studies involved people reacting to art like paintings, sculpture, architecture and dance videos. Other studies under consideration looked at responses to human faces. All the studies used fMRI brain imaging technology as the subjects were making aesthetic choices or rating specific stimuli.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>The researchers used a meta-analysis technique called \"activation likelihood estimation\" (ALE) to find connections in studies which tracked brain activity patterns of people looking at something or something they perceived to be beautiful.</p><p>The approach showed that looking at beautiful faces causes activity in several parts of the brain, which is not observed when looking at faces that were not rated as beautiful – the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex as well as the left ventral striatum. Notably, looking at art did not result in more activity in any of those areas.

The device, inspired by the form of an elephant's trunk but having the movement of a snake, may be applied as an alternative to tools used to grasp and hold objects which are less flexible or capable of applying lower levels of <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-tongue-like-robot-gripper-can-slurp-its-way-into-t-1845620959\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pressure</a>. <h3></h3><br/><p> Dr. Thanh Nho Do, the UNSW Medical Robotics Lab director, and Ph.D. candidate Trung Thien Hoang were the senior and lead authors of a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admt.202000724\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> published in <em>Advanced Materials Technologies</em> this month describing the device.  </p><p><br/> Most grippers used by individuals, professionals, or industrial machines are based on the human hand or a claw. While there are advantages to this design, it is not ideal for grabbing oddly shaped objects or ones that are much larger or smaller than the grabber itself. They can also be challenging to use with <a href=\"https://www.manufacturing.net/home/news/21202083/robotic-snake-grips-picks-up-objects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fragile items</a>. <br/> <br/> This is where this new design stands out. <br/> <br/> As a long and flat object, it can take advantage of having a larger surface area than a hand or claw. This increases the holding force without needing to apply more pressure, a principle that would be known to anyone who has tried to hold something with their fingernails rather than their palm. The coiling motion is made <a href=\"https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/new-%E2%80%98robotic-snake%E2%80%99-device-grips-picks-objects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">possible</a> by the \"manufacturing process involving computerised apparel engineering and applied newly designed, highly sensitive liquid metal-based tactile sensors for detecting the grip force required,\" according to study co-author Professor Nigel Lovell.  </p><p>It also features a very precise force sensor, which allows it to detect how much grip is needed and to prevent it from breaking the object. The grabber's ability to change shape is considered a further advantage, as it allows it to enter into small spaces to collect items, as seen in the demonstration with a pencil in a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201109110242.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tube</a>.  </p><h3></h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIelv-iABQs\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> A prototype gripper used during testing weighed a mere 8.2 grams and lifted an object of 1.8 kilograms (almost 4 pounds) – that's more than 220 times the gripper's mass. Another one that was 11.8 inches long wrapped around an item with a diameter of 1.2 inches. The production methods for the device are scaleable, and variations of the design can be made much larger.</p><p> The researchers suggest that the tool could find wide application in fields where fragile objects are handled, such as agriculture, the exploration industries, rescue operations, assistant services, and other areas where claw or hand-shaped grippers are impractical or sub-optimal.<strong></strong></p><p><strong> </strong>Dr. Do has also stated, \"We are also working on combining the gripper with our recently announced wearable haptic glove device, which would enable the user to remotely control the gripper while experiencing what an object feels like at the same time.\"<br/> <br/> He also suggested that the gripper could be mass-produced for commercial use within a year if a manufacturing partner can be <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201109110242.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">found</a>.  </p></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/FA7qKBam3oM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 18:07:15 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3ODUwOS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTY3OTc3M30.hhLjrUV-3FIZ21Qa0oiuyTe3lGWBn9TzDHwpedcQj-I/img.png?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C9%2C0%2C9&height=700","linkMd5":"14333bade541126acd2edda1ca683701","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn23@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-06-527_fb1c6b5433cb1b05.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":13128,"destBytes":13128,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3ODUwOS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTY3OTc3M30.hhLjrUV-3FIZ21Qa0oiuyTe3lGWBn9TzDHwpedcQj-I/img.png?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C9%2C0%2C9&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn23@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-06-527_fb1c6b5433cb1b05.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/FA7qKBam3oM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn13@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-35-675_373c723bcf2e584a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001752},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"Should parents de-emphasize gender norms?","link":"https://bigthink.com/videos/gender-norms","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDcwNjcyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzOTY4MTI4Mn0.wlGW7OEo6TSmH4fsCiPEy_CghC-pisYM3ICN0yznZJo/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>The idea that blue is for boys and pink is for girls plays out in gender reveals and in the toy aisle, but where does it come from and what limits is it potentially placing on children?</li><li>Lisa Selin Davis traces the gendering of toys and other objects back to the 1920s and explains how, over time, these marketing strategies were falsely conflated with biological traits. </li><li>The \"pink-blue divide\" affects boys and girls on a psychological level.

Images show just how much contamination can be spread by one of our most common everyday experiences.</p><p>A survey of 2,000 UK adults found 55 percent of the respondents not putting the lid down before flushing. This is while a majority (72 percet) said they were paying much more attention to cleanliness than before. The catch is that toilet bowl water is full of harmful bacteria and pathogens, even if flushed several times. </p><p>What's so bad flushing with the toilet lid up, you ask? To make it painfully obvious the researchers demonstrated how germs propel out of a toilet during a flush. They used high-speed camera technology to capture thousands of small droplets and aerosol particles flying up from a toilet if the lid isn't there to stop them. The power of the toilet flush can disperse the largely invisible aerosol droplets full of germs to surfaces in the vicinity as well as people's faces.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"7574f33a852ae30b7362d955a1b36afe\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"eb7a0\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDczMTA4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNDc2NDUyNX0.Dr5MxYoe_JCCpXEUKouXFfiT8nQ_BfOwDdsox6PIKEE/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><p>The new study was carried out by <a href=\"https://www.onepoll.us/\" target=\"_blank\">One Poll</a> and was commissioned by <a href=\"https://www.harpic.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Harpic</a>, which makes cleaning products.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"There has never been a more important time to take extra care around our homes, although the risks associated with germ spread in unhygienic bathrooms are high, the solution to keeping them clean is simple,\" an R&D associate at Harpic shared in a statement.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"14fb21b484ab17d34e32e1aa9bb9cdef\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"d0f6d\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDczMTA4NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0OTczODIxMH0.s7XgoIHv5nnfT1c0adP1FG9rOlW3tD3Dp7K8LgYztu4/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3></h3><br/><p>The study also inquired why people aren't putting the lid down and found that 47 percent of the surveyed just didn't know there was anything potentially risky about that.

Not helping matters is how much time people spent last week doom-scrolling their social media <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-now-may-be-the-best-time-to-take-a-long-break-from-social-media\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">feeds</a>, checking every few minutes for news that either doesn't arrive or merely stresses them out further.</p><p> Perhaps now is an excellent time to review how many studies show that too much social media can stress you out and consider simple ways to cut back.  </p><h3>We\nused to smoke during five-minute breaks at work; now, we check the\nfeeds. \n\n\n</h3><br/><p> A variety of studies show that too much time spent on social media can stress us out, leave us <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/digital-world-real-world/202002/anxiety-and-social-media-use\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">anxious</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/12/cutting-back-on-social-media-reduces-loneliness-depression-study-finds.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">depressed</a>, and ironically increase feelings of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/12/cutting-back-on-social-media-reduces-loneliness-depression-study-finds.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">loneliness</a>. These findings have been confirmed for both adults and <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0706743719885486?journalCode=cpab\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">children</a>. <br/> <br/> These effects are caused by several factors. The curated images of other people's lives we see on the screen can leave us feeling like we're comparatively inadequate. The often spoken of \"<a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/blog/fear-of-missing-out/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fear-of-missing-out</a>\" is a real thing. When you have dozens of people doing something once, with continual updating it can appear like everybody is doing something all the time. The political aspects of social media can make things worse. Even when people agree with you, the slew of information can be too much, says Dr. Erin Elfant, a clinical psychologist working out of California. <br/> <br/> She goes on to mention that social media provides a perverse incentive for being <a href=\"https://www.ksby.com/news/social-medias-impact-on-stress-during-contentious-election-season\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stressed</a>:<br/> <br/> \"When we tend to say something that is a strongly worded opinion, we tend to get more response for that which also means that it positively reinforces us getting really stressed.\"</p><p>It seems like a vicious cycle. Posting things that make people react is the point, even if that reaction is to make them stressed. Whatever works at getting a reaction will be posted again. <br/></p><h3>How to spend less time on social media</h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fE_QoebLUFQ\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> There are a variety of ways to make avoiding checking your feeds every six seconds a little easier.  </p><p> <strong>Delete your apps</strong></p><p> Making it a little harder to get to social media can help you use it less. Beyond making a kind of initiative sense, this method is supported by empirical evidence. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nudge Theory </a>in behavioral economics is based around this. People often do what's easiest, and that can be manipulated for good. Having to spend that much more effort getting to your social media page might be the thing that keeps you off it. <br/> <strong><br/> Set time limits on your usage.</strong></p><p>If you don't want to delete the apps outright, that's fine; there are other options. Most smartphones can show you a breakdown of how much time you're spending on an app, either through included features or through third-party apps that are readily <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/5-ways-to-cut-back-on-social-media\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available</a>. You can easily track your screen time and change your behavior accordingly. </p><p>If you use a web browser to access these sites, you can use a variety of <a href=\"https://launchparty.org/google-chrome-extensions-that-help-block-time-wasting-websites/\" target=\"_blank\">extensions</a> to control how long you're allowed to browse before blocks kick in. Others allow you to set times when you can't access the sites, like working hours, or to set other conditions. <br/> </p><p> <strong>Consider what you're following</strong></p><p> If you're like me, you've been invited to endless pages by other people, which you accepted to be polite. After a few years, you start to wonder why you still get updates from these random pages that mean nothing to you. If you aren't going to cut back, you can reduce your stress and your feed's clutter with a review of what pages you're following. Is there a page (or person) whose posts only make you mad? You should consider not following them anymore.  </p><p> Plus, if there is less to look at, you may find yourself spending less time on social media as a result. A feed with only 1 pages will have fewer updates to review than one with 20.  </p><p> <strong>Set a day of rest</strong></p><p> There's a reason most cultures had a designated day of rest; we need it. <br/> <br/> The idea of a <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/why-and-how-to-do-a-digital-detox-4771321\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">digital detox</a> is increasingly popular, and an offshoot of that is setting a \"<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/digital-sabbath-20_b_5288740\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">digital sabbath</a>.\" Much like the religious one, the idea here is that you take a set amount of time (either the weekend or a part of it) as a day of rest during which you cannot use or check social media. <br/> <br/> This solution has the added benefits that you're not giving up on social media, just limiting your use to specific days, and that you can make the rules for it as strict or lax as you require. You could ban all internet use outside of email on the sabbath, or you could just keep yourself from looking at Twitter. </p><p> <strong>Turn off notifications</strong></p><p> If all else seems like too much, try just turning off your notifications. You should be deciding when you want to look at social media, not the social media pages. Who knows, if you aren't told every time your aunt posts a new image of her cat, you might not find the need to look at each one of the pictures.  </p><p> Social media has an extremely mixed track record of doing what it was supposed to do in terms of bringing people together in a new and fun way. Given how much stress it's caused us lately, maybe cutting back can do us all some good.  </p></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ww5Su-CpILc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Nov 2020 20:28:27 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDcwNjE1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMzg3Mzc4OX0.8ZIM55Ld34zEdCybSYuXyRklJQlh-cVac-IUBPgIe3Q/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C534%2C0%2C230&height=700","linkMd5":"91bde0bd976bcd31aeda838e48d3f16d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn29@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-07-405_a2be0ee32884fbcb.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":56390,"destBytes":56390,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDcwNjE1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMzg3Mzc4OX0.8ZIM55Ld34zEdCybSYuXyRklJQlh-cVac-IUBPgIe3Q/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C534%2C0%2C230&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn29@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-07-405_a2be0ee32884fbcb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/ww5Su-CpILc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn18@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-35-712_014ec9acb68c1715.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001748},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"9 of the most shocking facts about global extinction - and how to stop it","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/david-attenborough-extinction","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3OTU5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MDk3NTQ2Nn0.8uT5kyOpgduqPQDIxl2h-AoJNvQB8rmSK4H9ZIwm9ns/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C1423%2C0%2C144&height=700\"/><br/><br/><p>Earth's fate and the devastation of the natural world were recently put under the microscope with the release of Sir David Attenborough's Netflix documentary<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80216393\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> A Life On Our Planet</a>.</p><hr/><p>It marks a departure from his usual nature documentary format and instead grieves for the damage wreaked by climate change and other forms of human interference.</p><p>It's an emotional watch, as the naturalist recounts the environmental changes he has seen first-hand throughout his career, such as the devastation of the Borneo rainforest and its native orangutan population.</p><p>Here are nine reasons we too should be concerned about the future of the planet and the millions of species which call it home.</p><h3></h3><br/><h4>1. More than one million species are now at risk of extinction</h4><p><a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Over a million species</a> of animal and plant life are now threatened with dying out – more than ever before in human history, according to the International Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).</p><h4>2.

Species dying off more frequently than ever before</h4><p>Species are dying off <a href=\"https://news.brown.edu/articles/2014/09/extinctions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1,000 times more frequently</a> today than during the 60 million years before the arrival of humans, according to a 2014 study by Brown University in the US. The report reinforces the \"urgency to conserve what is left\", said lead author Jurriaan de Vos</p><h3></h3><br/><h4>5. Freshwater species declining faster than anything else</h4><p>Populations of freshwater wildlife species are declining disportionately faster than others, dropping by<a href=\"https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-us/?utm_campaign=living-planet&utm_medium=media&utm_source=report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> an average of 84%</a> between 1970 and 2018, WWF's Living Planet Report 2020 showed. The figure also marks a<a href=\"https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-us/?utm_campaign=living-planet&utm_medium=media&utm_source=report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> rise of 1% on the 83%</a> reported two years ago.</p><h4>6. Swathes of tropical forest lost to agriculture</h4><p>Some<a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 100 million hectares of tropical forest</a> were lost between 1980 and 2000, according to the IPBES. This was largely down to cattle ranching in Latin America and plantations in South-East Asia, researchers added.</p><h3></h3><br/><h4>7. Nearly 40% of plants at risk of extinction</h4><p><a href=\"https://www.kew.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/State%20of%20the%20Worlds%20Plants%20and%20Fungi%202020.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Four in 10 (39.4%) plants</a> are at risk of dying out, according to the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew's State of the World's Plants and Fungi report. An additional challenge is identifying them before extinction, with 1,942 new species of plants identified last year alone.</p><h4>8. Industrial agriculture driving decline of insects</h4><p>Dramatic rates of decline could lead to over <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320718313636\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">40% of the world's insect species</a> disappearing within decades – with habitat loss due to industrial agriculture the main driver behind the decrease, according to a study published in Science Direct.</p><h4>9. Bird species also seeing populations threat</h4><p>Some<a href=\"https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/2020-02/ipbes_global_assessment_report_summary_for_policymakers_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> 3.5% of domesticated birds</a> have become extinct since 2016, the IPBES reported. In addition, nearly a quarter (23%) of threatened birds have already been affected by climate change, The global assessment report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services added.</p><h3></h3><br/><h4>Why is biodiversity important?</h4><p>Both the 2019 IPBES and 2020 WWF reports stress that the loss of habitats and species pose as much of a threat to life on Earth as climate change.</p><p>For biodiversity is not only vital for a flourishing natural world.

It's been a rough year for ol' science, which probably hasn't been under attack by so many people since the (last) Dark Ages. Conspiracy theorists at heart, anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers, and perhaps most unbelievably of all, flat-Earthers have been loudly calling into question the pretty-much unquestionable.</p><p>In any event, physicist Steven Wooding — the guy who brought us the <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/experts-predict-there-are-36-contactable-alien-civilizations-seriously?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1\" target=\"_self\">contactable alien civilization calculator</a> last spring — has offered up a lovely gift for science on its special day: the <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/flat-vs-round-earth\" target=\"_blank\">Flat vs. Round Earth Calculator</a>. It consists of three experiments that can prove to anyone who believes in math that the Earth really is round. We can probably assume, of course, that there are now people arguing that 2+2=5. For these folks we'll point out simply that if the Earth really were flat, cats would have long ago pushed everything over its edge.</p><p>Be sure to scroll down the calculator page for Wooding's entertaining treatise on why the whole flat-Earth idea is so forehead-smackingly stupid.</p><h3>Experiment 1: Catch a sunset twice</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"294982a49a33773d038f756f7227b37d\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"64198\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2ODQxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1Mjk0Mzg5NX0.VR2LnQx4TKhyTwmSoZSkDfsOMgqac4d6Drm49vyYCGA/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>At the top of the calculator is the \"Select an experiment\" drop-down menu. Let's start with the \"<a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/flat-vs-round-earth#sunset-twice-experiment\" target=\"_blank\">sunset twice</a>\" experiment.</p><p>Wooding notes that you can prove the Earth is round by standing up quickly right after the Sun goes down and getting ahead of the shadow cast by the horizon so you can see the sun set a second time. If the planet were flat, once it went over the edge from your first viewing position it would be gone.</p><p>You may want to find out the time of sunset before testing out the calculator. There are many places online to find this information. <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/\" target=\"_blank\">Here's one</a>.</p><p>To use the calculator, begin by selecting a city in your time zone. Wooding has pre-entered the sunset duration for you, though you can look up the precise value online for your location.</p><p>There are three ways to increase your height, selected from the \"Ideas\" menu: standing up from a lying down position, taking the sky-lift elevator at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Burj Khalifa Hotel</a> in Dubai, or sending up a drone with a camera on it. Most of us will select the first option.</p><p>Next, you enter your starting height (the default for lying down is .6562 feet), how long it will take you to stand up, and then the final standing elevation, presumably of your eyes.</p><p>What the calculator finds for you is the percentage of the second sunset you'll see. Note that for the sky-lift and drone tests, you see a lot more of that second sunset given the greater height and your accelerated ascent speed.</p><h3>Experiment 2: Disappearing object</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d6fd8797e0bffb64f96d6104e04d09c4\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"fdac5\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2ODQxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MDIzOTU5MX0.NUrgcREKhtrD4TfGtDTDB7_WuCbYTreoXSTnWCsE3Mw/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>Thanks to the curvature of the Earth, you can make an object on a distant lake shore seem to <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/flat-vs-round-earth#disappearing-object-experiment\" target=\"_blank\">disappear</a> with a change in viewing height.</p><p>You'll need binoculars for this one.

That includes recreational and medicinal marijuana in South Dakota, medical marijuana in Mississippi, and recreational marijuana in Arizona, Montana and New Jersey.</p><p>But Oregon passed the most sweeping and historic reforms, voting to partially decriminalize all drugs—even heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. Oregon's measure 109 also legalized the therapeutic sale and use of psilocybin mushrooms, which, as a <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/psychedelics-depression\" target=\"_self\">new era of psychedelic research continues to show</a>, have proven remarkably effective at treating conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. </p><p>Of course, drug decriminalization isn't legalization. Oregonians caught in possession of small amounts of hard drugs will be fined $100, whereas they would've been fined up to $6,250 and sentenced up to a year in jail under the previous law. The initiative, called the Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act, also allows people caught with drugs to avoid paying the fine if they undergo a health assessment at an addiction recovery center.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"Today's victory is a landmark declaration that the time has come to stop criminalizing people for drug use,\" <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oregon-first-decriminalizing-hard-drugs-01edca37c776c9ea8bfd4afdd7a7a33e\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which was behind the measure. \"Measure 110 is arguably the biggest blow to the war on drugs to date.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><div class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"c5811192ec0f155d42d5c9410cb009f1\" id=\"49425\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-custom-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1323839290246389760\"><div style=\"margin:1em 0\">Oregon made history tonight by becoming the first state to decriminalize drug possession!

But as Americans generally continue to shift toward favoring drug reforms, citizens and policymakers will be watching Oregon to see how the experiment plays out, and the outcomes will likely influence voters in other states. Here are a few things to keep an eye on.</p><h3>​Arrest and incarceration rates</h3><br/><p>Reduced arrest and incarceration rates for drug possession are likely to be the most obvious changes. The Oregon Criminal Justice Commission <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/pdf/IP44%20-%20REI%20Statement%20Supplement_1602708982790.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> that the new laws will reduce convictions for drug possession by about 90 percent, from 4,057 convictions in 2019, to a projected 378 in 2021.<br/></p><p>The commission's report also estimates that drug convictions among Black and Indigenous Oregonians may drop by 94 percent, and that racial disparities in drug arrests could drop by the same amount.</p><p>If more Oregonians stay out of the criminal justice system, it could help more people find employment, housing, addiction services and student loans, all of which can be harder to access with a drug conviction on your record. </p><p>It's also conceivable that the new initiative will reduce contentious interactions between Oregonians and law enforcement, which, potentially, could lead to lower arrest rates for other infractions, and create fewer opportunities for police interactions to turn violent.</p><p>Alternatively, if the initiative frees up time and resources for Oregon law enforcement, the state could see arrests rise for other types of crimes. That may include arresting more dealers and traffickers, considering the new laws only apply to users carrying small amounts. If police focus on the suppliers, it will likely change the dynamics of Oregon's illegal drug trade.</p><h3>​Drug use rates</h3><br><p>How will removing the threat of jail and steep fines change drug use and overdose rates? It's hard to say for sure, but Portugal's 2001 decision to decriminalize drugs provides some clues. In the years following decriminalization, the nation's drug overdose deaths and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portugal-drug-decriminalization/\" target=\"_blank\">HIV infection rates dropped significantly</a>, while <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1464837\" target=\"_blank\">drug usage either stayed constant or decreased</a>.<br/></p><p>That drug use remained constant or decreased may be because Portugal only decriminalized drugs, meaning drugs weren't legally available for purchase at something like a marijuana dispensary.

It also means that a teenager caught in possession of heroin or meth will only receive a ticket, which in many counties means that parents won't be informed of their child's drug use.\"</p><p>Still, even if Oregon's measure reduces the number of people who get treatment, that wouldn't necessarily be an indictment of decriminalization writ large, but rather the specific way the state is allocating funds. Kitzhaber concluded his post with a sentiment shared by both drug reform advocates and some of the measure's opponents: \"Incarcerating people who suffer from addiction should not be tolerated.\"</p><h3></h3><br><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"1f7bc5a3d5d9b078bad4b151ae3da84f\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIpqZmdBgvw?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span>Drug prevention advice for parents Watch the newest video from Big Think: https://bigth.ink/NewVideo Join Big Think Edge for exclusive videos: https://bigth....</br></br></br><p class=\"\"><br/></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/bz9XeAdAJUg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Nov 2020 21:13:09 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDcwNjQ3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTQ3Nzk3Mn0.SfqkFEQhHopbXxfywgH8u2f0w9p6ba70S9jeQjRXJ4w/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C4%2C0%2C128&height=700","linkMd5":"2c41845cc92059537d78dd70d016e64e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn55@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-04-057_e5bd4db7dc1c58e6.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":701,"sourceBytes":37004,"destBytes":37004,"author":"Stephen Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDcwNjQ3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTQ3Nzk3Mn0.SfqkFEQhHopbXxfywgH8u2f0w9p6ba70S9jeQjRXJ4w/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C4%2C0%2C128&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn55@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-04-057_e5bd4db7dc1c58e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/bz9XeAdAJUg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn58@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-35-899_7dda1d421da4debc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001748},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"3 ways to get your point across while wearing a mask – tips from an award-winning speech coach","link":"https://bigthink.com/coronavirus/covid-mask-speech-coach","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY5MDc1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0ODYyOTU3Mn0.XwpHkiGuccOBgPE_T5FrJxdsa01RIn1qhhHZ_G8mqF4/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C295%2C0%2C252&height=700\"/><br/><br/>You wear your mask, keep six feet between yourself and others and are committed to safety. <hr/><p>But the measures that help minimize your risk of COVID-19 can also have an impact on your interactions with others. </p><p>As you stroll the aisle of a supermarket, you approach someone who looks familiar. To avoid an awkward exchange, you flash them a friendly smile. It's not until you pass you remember: Your smile was hidden behind a mask. Unloading your groceries at home, you see your neighbor. You excitedly ask her how she is, but when she doesn't respond, you worry your mask has muffled your voice. </p><p>As the head coach for <a href=\"https://www.comm.msstate.edu/current-students/student-opportunities/clubs-and-organizations/speech-and-debate-council/about\" target=\"_blank\">Mississippi State University's Speech and Debate Team</a>, my job is to teach effective communication. Without question, masks have disrupted social interactions. But communication has many components. You can adjust and enhance your communication by focusing on some of the other pieces that aren't hidden behind a mask.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>The face</h2><p>Facial expressions are the <a href=\"https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/loose-leaf-communication-matters-floyd/M9781259707766.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">primary way people exhibit emotion</a> and decipher the feelings of others. Happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear and surprise <a href=\"https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780805083392\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">can be communicated through facial expressions alone</a>. But when part of the face is masked, it becomes more difficult to recognize these cues.</p><p>If you cannot read someone else's emotional state, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1023608506243\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">your ability to empathize with them may be compromised</a>. Likewise, if your own mask is hiding your emotional state, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2009.0142\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">others may not be able to empathize with you</a>. Wearing a mask can also make you <a href=\"https://tulsaworld.com/video/news/1-in-3-people-feel-self-conscious-leaving-the-house-in-a-mask/video_507f95a9-20a5-5f4b-803a-9522e4974c11.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">feel more distracted and self-conscious</a>, further weakening your connection to others.</p><p>Fortunately, you can regain some control over communication by working with what you have left – the eyes. If you want to increase understanding with a masked individual, you should look them in the eyes – which may be easier said than done. Eye contact <a href=\"https://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/09/26/eye-contact-makes-us-more-aware-of-our-own-bodies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">triggers self-consciousness, consumes extra brain power</a> and becomes <a href=\"https://digest.bps.org.uk/2016/07/07/psychologists-have-identified-the-length-of-eye-contact-that-people-find-most-comfortable/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">uncomfortable after only three seconds</a>. But bear in mind, eye contact can also make you <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167216669124\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">appear more intelligent</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0162291\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">trustworthy</a>.</p><h2>Body language</h2><p>You might be surprised how much information is conveyed by the body itself.</p><p>For instance, when someone is happy, they stand up straighter and lift their head; when they are sad, they slouch and drop their head; and when they are angry, their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315663425\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">whole body tenses up</a>. Learning how people use their bodies to convey emotion may help reduce the uncertainty you feel when communicating with someone in a mask.</p><p>Become aware of your own body language, too. When engaged in a conversation, you can appear more attentive by turning your body toward the individual, leaning in or nodding. To let another person know you want to start speaking, straighten your posture, hold up your index finger <a href=\"https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Richmond-Nonverbal-Behavior-in-Interpersonal-Relations-7th-Edition/PGM136145.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">or nod more frequently</a>. Finally, be aware that imitating the posture of another person <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/oct05/mirror\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">can increase how much they like you</a> and even agree with you.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>The voice</h2><p>Don't forget the impact of your voice. It's not just what you say, it's how you say it. Along with the actual words, you also use <a href=\"https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/loose-leaf-communication-matters-floyd/M9781259707766.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">volume, tone, pauses and fillers to convey your message</a>. For instance, a lower-pitched whisper may denote sadness or insecurity, whereas a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-6393(02)00084-5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">higher-pitched shout could show anger or intensity</a>.</p><p>Try this – say the phrase \"I didn't see you there\" as if you were scared. Now pretend you are happy. Now confused. Chances are, anyone listening to you could easily identify your emotions without even seeing you. While studies show that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-science-of-how-you-sound-when-you-talk-through-a-face-mask-139817\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">masks do not significantly alter your voice</a>, you may feel that your speech gets muffled when wearing a mask.</p><p>If you feel the need to speak louder, just be aware that raising your voice can alter the message you are trying to send. Changing the tone of your voice can change the whole conversation, so instead of increasing volume, try improving enunciation.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2>Putting it all together</h2><p>While masks may make conversations feel more daunting, you are equipped to communicate, even with part of your face concealed.</p><p>Before your next interaction with a friend, think of ways to improve your connection. Pull your hair back so they can see your eyes clearly and find a quiet place to talk. Use your body and voice to convey the emotions you fear your mask might hide. Maybe most importantly, don't expect it to go perfectly. Just like any conversation, mistakes will be made.</p><p>When someone can't understand you, try rephrasing your statement, saying it a bit more slowly and enunciating more. If you are struggling to understand someone else, try to ask close-ended questions, like \"Do you want to go to the park?\" instead of open-ended ones, like \"Where do you want to go?\"</p><p>By all means, continue the proper measures to keep yourself safe, but don't neglect your relationships as a consequence. Social distance doesn't have to mean socially distant.<img alt=\"The Conversation\" src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/146644/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic\"/></p><p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/cheryl-chambers-1156633\" target=\"_blank\">Cheryl Chambers</a>, Instructor of Communication and Head Coach, MSU Speech & Debate Team, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/mississippi-state-university-1970\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mississippi State University</a></em></p><p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

To blast it with radiation, they took it to the Medical Industrial Radiation Facility at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a high-energy electron beam facility.</p><p>Expecting that Europa's oceans would contain a mix of water and salts similar to those on Earth, they were investigating the response of various materials to radiation. They began with magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride — essentially Epsom salt and table salt — both believed to be in Europa's ice.</p><p>They weren't surprised to see some glowing caused by energetic electrons getting through the moon's ice and energizing molecules beneath it. The glow is generated when the molecules relax after exposure.</p><p>However, the variety of colored glows emitted by radiated compounds was a surprise, according to co-author Bryana Henderson. \"We never imagined that we would see what we ended up seeing,\" Henderson said. \"When we tried new ice compositions, the glow looked different. And we all just stared at it for a while and then said, 'This is new, right? This is definitely a different glow?' So we pointed a spectrometer at it, and each type of ice had a different spectrum.\" (Spectrometers divide light into wavelengths that can signify specific compounds.)</p><p>\"Seeing the sodium chloride brine with a significantly lower level of glow was the 'aha' moment that changed the course of the research,\" said co-author Fred Bateman.</p><h3>Both sides now</h3><br/><p>We can see our own moon because it reflects sunlight. Most spectrometer readings of Europa have thus far been derived from observations of its light-reflecting bright side.</p><p>\"If Europa weren't under this radiation,\" said Gudipati, \"it would look the way our moon looks to us — dark on the shadowed side. But because it's bombarded by the radiation from Jupiter, it glows in the dark.\"</p><p>This means that the moon's dark side also emits light in the form of its glow, so here come the spectrometers. Gudipati said of the research, \"We were able to predict that this nightside ice glow could provide additional information on Europa's surface composition. How that composition varies could give us clues about whether Europa harbors conditions suitable for life.\"</p><p>He adds, \"It's not often that you're in a lab and say, 'We might find this when we get there. Usually, it's the other way around — you go there and find something and try to explain it in the lab. But our prediction goes back to a simple observation, and that's what science is about.\"</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/GdBjyC8oQ_A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 19:56:38 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3MTIzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MTY5ODY5M30.YwVQpQC-gSuLBHOkCOitmD5JjZWtasY_Iyg0gDXy9p0/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"b02a1c1e3e068efa4a028bc5d801a6b5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn90@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-14-015_54ddd3034bffac76.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":30018,"destBytes":30018,"author":"Robby Berman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3MTIzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MTY5ODY5M30.YwVQpQC-gSuLBHOkCOitmD5JjZWtasY_Iyg0gDXy9p0/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn90@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-14-015_54ddd3034bffac76.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3MTI1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NDI3NDc0NX0.JbEiK8PdcXijlCQpx64kRa31ZK7LHYBxWbSNvYDnPtk/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn53@2020_6/2020/11/14/17-30-35-164_82e0af9a87c933ef.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3MTI0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxMzczOTc0MX0.yHxmPxW2kGnOS781_VJTNQilyM6u42dr16-ySPJqpKU/img.jpg?width=980":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/GdBjyC8oQ_A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn99@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-36-750_cef260182b63f3b7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001749},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"How your masturbation habits are impacting your sex life","link":"https://bigthink.com/sex-relationships/female-masturbation","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2Nzg1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NDg1NTc1OX0.vLdh-URllxN0siuofImzqmNc5VN5Kqn-77nd5MOGAjc/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C324%2C0%2C325&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>As many as 40% of women experience difficulty reaching orgasm during heterosexual partnered sex.

In addition to the ongoing opioid epidemic, an increase in overdose deaths, likely related to COVID-19 lockdowns, is being <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/08/13/901627189/u-s-sees-deadly-drug-overdose-spike-during-pandemic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>. While opioid addictions and the pain they cause tend to get the most attention in the news, other drugs are also being used at high rates in some areas. Among them are stimulants such as meth. <br/> <br/> Despite the tremendous length of time humanity has been dealing with addictive substances, we're still not great at actually finding solutions to it. Many treatment programs use a variety of methods of limited effectiveness alongside ones with better track records. However, a rarely used but well-supported program offers a remarkably effective solution to addiction with a straightforward method: paying former drug users to stay clean. It is currently getting increasing amounts of attention.  </p><h3>Kind\nof surprising it took us this long to try that idea. \n\n\n</h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HLwUi7r7_T8\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> The idea of positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior is familiar to most people. Using a technique dubbed \"c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_management\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ontingency management</a>,\" these programs apply the concept in a new way. When someone undergoing treatment attends enough meetings and appointments or goes a particular length of time without relapsing, they are given <a href=\"https://drugabuse.com/contingency-management/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rewards</a>, often in the form of <u><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/meth-addiction-treatment.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">money</a></u>.</p><p>How this is done differs by program; some just hand out cash prizes, others give out coupons, a few hand out tokens. Many don't offer a consistent amount, and some use systems where cash prizes are mixed with other rewards on a random basis. Despite these variations, the principle remains the same: good behavior that moves somebody towards their goal is rewarded.  </p><p> The idea has been extensively studied and found to be very effective, more so than many other procedures frequently used in addiction treatment. It is also very effective when used in conjunction with other <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002715&type=printable\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">therapies</a>. While most of the studies of contingency management appear to focus on its use against <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17907865/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stimulant addiction,</a> studies on its effectiveness against alcohol abuse also <a href=\"https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/122-127.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exist</a>. <br/> <br/> However, you can probably already see the difficulties of spreading the program; the idea of giving people cash for staying off drugs can be a hard sell. Most of the internet pages that explain the idea mention that no study has found people spend the money particularly irresponsibly, suggesting that the notion that they would is widespread.  </p><p> A recent <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/meth-addiction-treatment.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times article</a> on the subject included the coordinator of a treatment program voicing his concern that this very thing could happen. The same article pointed out that these programs might also, technically, be illegal. Many insurance companies won't pay for treatments that utilize this method.  </p><p>This is a shame, as the benefits of this method are beyond doubt.<br/></p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tThe\nmoral questions of treating addiction\n\n</h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HWrbUwNGoWc\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> As you might expect, this isn't the only area where moral considerations crash into what is proven to help people beat their addictions or be healthier people. </p><p>The idea of government-backed needle <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ssp/syringe-services-programs-faq.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exchanges</a>, where people in need of needles for what are often illegal purposes can get a clean one despite why they may need it, goes back to a Dutch program in the 1980s. It has a long history of doing what it sets out to do in terms of keeping dirty, disease-causing needles, off the streets.  </p><p> Proponents of these programs cite evidence that they reduce the instances of diseases (such as AIDS) often spread by dirty needles, they provide easier access to social services for those who need them most, and they are generally agreed to improve the condition of people struggling with addiction. <strong><br/> <br/> </strong>Despite this data, many people still oppose the idea on the grounds that providing needs or a space to use them amounts to an endorsement <a href=\"https://khn.org/news/conservative-indiana-adopted-needle-exchanges-but-still-faces-local-resistance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">of their use</a>. <br/> <br/> Limited studies suggest therapies incorporating LSD have shown promise in treating <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lsd-should-be-considered-for-alcoholism-treatment-study-says/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">alcoholism</a>. While the lack of extensive research on the use of psychedelics in this area is enough to prevent a pilot program from coming to a town near you, the objections to treating alcohol addiction with powerful hallucinogens also make it unlikely.  </p><p> A similar problem exists with specific treatments currently used to help those recovering from opioid addiction. Methadone, an opioid drug, is used to prevent withdrawal symptoms in patients battling an addiction to make it easier for them to stay off illicitly acquired drugs. These programs are strongly supported by studies demonstrating their <a href=\"https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/5044/1/5044.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">effectiveness</a>.  </p><p> Despite this, some still object to the idea of using one painkiller to wean people off <a href=\"https://www.careinnovations.org/wp-content/uploads/MATOpioidOvercomingObjections.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">another</a>.  </p><p> Drug addiction is a painful thing. Humanity still isn't great at dealing with it. While the evidence in favor of contingency management and various other treatments is increasingly robust, their usage is limited by several factors, including moralizing. If we will end up using this treatment to help end addiction in our communities or shun it in favor of moral purity currently remains unknown.  </p></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/oYNT3AZba_0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Nov 2020 20:06:25 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDcwNTk2Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MDQwMjUzMX0.6C6y7XhCxzOSBiWAJgb6MKo4-HryAOUixtFlSLSkYmI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C140%2C0%2C184&height=700","linkMd5":"f0510132a7fea1d1e342fc0f24e4f104","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-02-420_a261ed650fb83141.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":106756,"destBytes":106756,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDcwNTk2Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MDQwMjUzMX0.6C6y7XhCxzOSBiWAJgb6MKo4-HryAOUixtFlSLSkYmI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C140%2C0%2C184&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-02-420_a261ed650fb83141.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/oYNT3AZba_0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn59@2020_1/2020/11/14/17-30-34-741_7ecd96e21bba28b8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001747},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"Virgin Hyperloop completes world's first human test","link":"https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/hyperloop-test","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3NTA3MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MTg0NTUzOX0.K8qiUGqyKBbprbBFls_Y_fCJSI_fF55ao0iXU6Cbpfw/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C170%2C0%2C38&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Hyperloops are a new type of transportation technology that involves vacuum tubes and passenger pods traveling at ultra-fast speeds.</li><li>Although no commercial hyperloops exist yet, a handful of companies around the world are building test tracks, some in partnerships with national governments.</li><li>Hyperloops could prove to be a faster and more environmentally sustainable form of transportation than flying and high-speed rail, though many obstacles remain.</li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>Virgin Hyperloop has successfully completed the world's first passenger test of hyperloop technology, a new form of high-speed transportation.</p><p>The test was conducted Sunday in a desert outside of Las Vegas, where the company built a 500-meter vacuum tube as a test track.

Black Beauty is 4.45 billion years old and comes from the Martian crust, providing a rare window into the early days of <a href=\"https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/in-depth/\" target=\"_blank\">Mars</a> and the solar system. \"It is a gold mine of information. And extremely valuable,\" Bizzarro tells <a href=\"https://news.ku.dk/all_news/2020/11/researchers-present-wild-theory-water-may-be-naturally-occurring-on-all-rocky-planets/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Copenhagen News</a>. At $10,000 per gram, the researchers purchased 50 grams for $500,000. </p><h3>Early Water</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"704699570a755afa740a81b70e90cff2\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"b1557\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3NDY1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NzMzNTQ2NX0.7WAs8y6IDCPkr65xT76wyabW0F6ecLXPDVUeG-8bVe8/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>Black Beauty indicates that liquid water was present on Mars in the first 90 million years after it was formed. To deduce this, the researchers had to crush and dissolve 15 expensive grams of the meteorite for analysis. \"It suggests that water emerged with the formation of Mars. And it tells us that water may be naturally occurring on planets and does not require an external source like water-rich asteroids,\" says Bizzarro.</p><p>Supporting this were signs of asteroid impacts that resulted in the release of a great deal of oxygen, something the scientists say could only have occurred if water was present. \"We have developed a new technique that tells us that Mars in its infancy suffered one or more severe asteroid impacts\" says Deng. \"The impact, Black Beauty reveals, created kinetic energy that released a lot of oxygen. And the only mechanism that could likely have caused the release of such large amounts of oxygen is the presence of water.\"</p><h3>Mystery solution?</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"87960e3e5ad8d9f0d39954e400746cb8\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"02e74\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3NDc1Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzk1MDY0MH0.eMw-JPwYcXTDa7dfYfjg2CUSFwwxpBaBK-0vlXTQEFI/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>The analysis may also provide an answer to one of the lingering mysteries of Mars: How could such a cold planet have accommodated the water for the lake and river remnants we see there today, as shown above? Black Beauty bears indications that early asteroid impacts released a significant amount of greenhouse gases that warmed the now-chilly orb for a time. \"This means,\" says Deng, \"that the CO2-rich atmosphere may have caused temperatures to rise and thus allowed liquid water to exist at the surface of Mars.\"</p><p>The researchers are not yet finished with their expensive rock, and are currently engaged in further study of the microscope water-bearing minerals it contains.

During this period of life, they're developing the knowledge and social skills that will serve them in their future pursuits, yet the pandemic has either stripped them of these critical connections or diluted the potency of such interactions through the hazy blue light of a computer monitor. Add to that the mental stressors of massive upheaval and unknowns, and it's little wonder that parents, teachers, and community leaders are worried about young people.</p><p>But according to a survey performed by the National Institute for Health Research, the kids are doing all right.

This ongoing study aims to chronicle the relationship between social media use and adolescents' mental health. Because the study participants took the initial survey in October 2019, researchers were able to compare the students' pre-pandemic baseline with their responses several months into lockdown. (Schools closed in the U.K. in mid-March; follow-up surveys were completed in April and May.)</p><p>The researchers discovered that mental health among the U.K.'s adolescents has, surprisingly, improved during these trying times. Although 90 percent of students agreed that COVID-19 is a serious issue, their responses indicated an overall decrease in their risk of anxiety, an increase in their well-being, and no major changes to their risk of depression.</p><p>The most improvement was seen in students struggling with poor mental health. Students with low well-being scores in October last year showed a 10-point gain on the Warwick-Edinburgh Wellbeing Scale; meanwhile, students with previously average-to-high well-being scores showed no significant change. Students at risk of anxiety and depression also showed small advances in their Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores. The only group showing a heightened risk of depression were girls, and the difference was slight.</p><p>What caused this mental uplift among U.K. youth? While the study does not attempt to answer that question, the researchers speculate it may be \"due to the removal of stressors within the school environment, such as pressure of academic work, and challenging peer relationships including bullying.\" </p><p>Another possibility is that this cohort's pandemic stressors are more externally focused. They cited their top three concerns as worrying their friends or family would catch the disease, worrying over friends and family's mental health, and worrying about missed school. Far fewer were anxious about catching the disease or the lockdown's effect on their friendships, job prospects, or the larger economy.</p><h3>Maintaining critical connections</h3><br/><p>The researchers asked about students' connectedness with school, peers, and family, too. Students reported an increased connection with school and no change in their relationships with friends and family. Those with the lowest connectedness scores in the baseline survey again saw the greatest gains in well-being scores and anxiety reduction scores. And, of course, social media use has supersized.</p><p>The researchers write, \"As schools fully re-open, it is important to consider ways to prevent a rise in anxiety back to pre-pandemic levels.\"</p><p>There are limitations to the study, however, and we should be careful not to extrapolate these data too broadly. Younger children, the researchers note, do not have the same level of access to social media as their older peers nor are their vital social interactions as easily digitized. The playground cannot be translated into text and emojis with the same fidelity as the lunchroom clump. As a consequence, younger children may be experiencing a very different pandemic. That may also be true for young people undergoing transitional periods in their life.</p><p>Nor did the researchers see the same improvements in vulnerable student populations, such as LGBTQ teens and those with disabilities. These students reported higher anxiety and depression scores pre-pandemic and did not see the same improvements in the pandemic follow-up survey. This outcome suggested to the researchers that these students continued to experience stressors even when not attending school physically.</p><p>Finally, there's no indication that teens in other countries will face the pandemic the same. In countries with weaker social safety nets, such as the U.S., students may be far more worried about the virus's impact on their health and future prospects.</p><h3>Love in the time of COVID</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"e79f38ede41f077864502fed9c56854e\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_oaTmbdv4Ps?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>The National Institute for Health Research's report showing young teens are more resilient than adults may give them credit, but it bases its findings on student responses from mere months into the pandemic. Unfortunately, we won't know how remote education and prolonged shutdowns will affect them until they've been experienced. This reality means parents still play a critical role in supporting their children's mental health.</p><p>Parents looking for strategies can find resources at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/parental-resource-kit/adolescence.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Centers for Disease Control</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/staying-home-during-covid19-help-teens-cope\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Johns Hopkins Children's Center</a>, and other health institute websites. In general, experts recommend keeping adolescents on a routine that supports learning, exercise, and social connection. This schedule should lead them to accomplish goals, partake in their interests, and engage with social activities—even if those social engagements must be taken online.</p><p>Yes, screen time will increase but parents need to remember that <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/screen-time-for-kids\" target=\"_self\">not all screen time is created equal</a>. There's a difference between screen time dedicated to, say, playing board games with friends versus mindlessly wandering the social media wastes. Parents will still need to incorporate boundaries and converse regularly with teens on what information they are receiving about coronavirus and the pandemic.</p><p>As Nilu Rahman, Johns Hopkins Children's Center senior child life specialist, said: \"Teens have great access to the internet and some of what they're reading about the coronavirus and the pandemic might be scaring them, even if they don't say so.\" Rahman added that \"parents should make sure kids are not going down rabbit holes and getting confused or frightened by false information.\"</p><p>Parents should also remain alert for changes in behavior, as these may signal boosted stress or other underlying mental health concerns. Rahman recommends parents look out for extreme eating habits, changes in sleep patterns, signs of self-harm, increased isolation, or their children not enjoying their favorite hobbies and past times.</p><p>\"Parents know their children best,\" she says, \"so if something seems off about their teen, they should trust their instinct and find out what's going on, especially if the child has a history of depression or anxiety.\"</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/sGGrdpcQ-Bk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 18:25:17 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2NDQ1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MzE1ODI4Mn0.s_HA-XonEXZwHlzryWLhVUjkPaKL5zKdFu2ss-W04yw/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C425%2C0%2C141&height=700","linkMd5":"a1cec051723797b28d264a5a0e67a29a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn43@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-02-448_3b7e008b5893ba50.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":114992,"destBytes":114992,"author":"Kevin Dickinson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2NDQ1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MzE1ODI4Mn0.s_HA-XonEXZwHlzryWLhVUjkPaKL5zKdFu2ss-W04yw/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C425%2C0%2C141&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn43@2020_3/2020/11/14/17-30-02-448_3b7e008b5893ba50.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2NDM5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1OTIyMjQ2NX0.3nKlCkjZgn6V4cDEtcDUklSt69Hg6QiB7c_GUF2H-6w/img.jpg?width=980":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/sGGrdpcQ-Bk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn34@2020_4/2020/11/14/17-30-34-827_1ec3c4eb208f80f2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001752},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"'Mindful' people are better goal-setters according to new research","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/mindfulness-goal-setting","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3ODMzMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTE5MTU3MH0.JNXZpVXCEaW0skCVIsrhIN5u2VAR6n8Pta7EFzEaeL4/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C1599%2C0%2C1640&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Self-concordant individuals set goals in alignment with their beliefs and values, according to new research. </li><li>Internal motivations score higher than external influences, such as money or fear of shame. </li><li>Mindful individuals achieve more satisfaction, as their goals align with their authentic selves. </li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>The practice of mindfulness involves the development of nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment. While derived from Buddhist meditation practices, it became an important tool for clinical psychiatrists in the 1970s as a means for treating numerous psychological conditions, including depression, excess stress, and addiction.</p><p>Mindfulness has since gained mainstream attention. The discipline is now marketed for training productive workers and reducing anxiety at work and in daily life. Reams of research on the effects of mindfulness have been produced in the last few decades, noting a number of positive effects on a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5741505/\" target=\"_blank\">variety of psychiatric disorders</a>. </p><p>Mindfulness is a holistic practice. The general idea is observing physical sensations and psychological experiences—desires, emotions, feelings, thoughts. Given that a <em>feeling </em>is both a physical sensation and a thought process, the goal is to integrate body and mind in a heightened sense of awareness. That is, to understand that body and mind are not separate, and to learn to use <em>all </em>sensations in your somatic toolkit. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656620301045\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recent study</a>, published in Journal of Research in Personality, suggests that \"mindful\" people have an important trait: they set better goals. That is, they set the <em>right</em> goals for themselves.</p><p>The researchers, from three Canadian universities (Carleton, University of Toronto, and McGill), wanted to know if mindfulness plays a role in achieving your goals. As the team writes, </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"The purpose of the present research was to investigate whether trait mindfulness is positively associated with self-concordant goal setting, and in turn greater goal progress.\" </p><h3>Goal Setting Is a Hamster Wheel.

In terms of goal-setting, self-concordance implies that your goals are made due to intrinsic motivation, whether because they're meaningful or because they represent your values. </p><p>Non-concordant goals are generally pursued for external factors, such as money, or due to societal pressure, like the fear of being shamed. Since mindfulness practitioners <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.20237\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tend to exhibit</a> high levels of self-awareness, the researchers theorized such individuals would be better at setting—and achieving—their goals. </p><p>Nearly 800 undergraduates were recruited for a short survey. Each volunteer wrote down three personal goals for the coming week. They were then asked to rate each of the following questions on a seven-point scale: </p><ul><li>Because somebody else wants you to, or because you'll get something from someone if you do</li><li>Because you would feel ashamed if you didn't – you feel that you should try to accomplish this goal</li><li>Because you really believe it is an important goal to have</li><li>Because of the fun and enjoyment which the goal will provide you—the primary reason is simply your interest in the experience itself</li><li>Because it represents who you are and reflects what you value most in life</li></ul><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"82ba886b71a7ea973cb4d11ba5a65452\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"aeb83\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc3NTE2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2ODEyNDM2OH0.TxcifntRNS3tN_F4Jn7bztGXeMagFbf6T2Rxk5EKgmg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=37%2C0%2C89%2C0&height=700\"/><p>The first two reasons on that list are considered non-concordant, while the latter three are more likely to be ranked higher by mindful individuals. To judge that, each student filled out a 15-item Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale. The general thrust of the questionnaire is to discover how present an individual is when performing their daily tasks.</p><p>As hypothesized, students that scored higher ranked the latter motivations higher. The researchers believe self-awareness helps individuals decide \"which goals are self-appropriate.\" Maintaining goals that are realistic with your values, beliefs, and life circumstances make them not only easier to achieve, but will also be aligned with what matters most to you. </p><p>As the researchers phrase it, </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"By habitually paying attention to their thoughts, feelings, sensations, and emotions, mindful individuals may develop a greater ability to recognize goals that are congruent with their authentic selves.\"</p><p>By setting attainable goals—also, perhaps unsurprisingly, an indicator of Flow States—mindful individuals score higher on self-esteem measures as well. Instead of dreaming of the impossible and being continually frustrated by disappointment, mindfulness teaches boundaries that you can work within. </p><p>Don't think of boundaries as a limitation. Mindful individuals treat them as a source of strength, as the practice of mindfulness helps you achieve goals in alignment with your authentic self. When looked at it from this perspective, the pursuit of other goals appears not only futile but emotionally and mentally damaging. </p><p>--</p><p><em>Stay in touch with Derek on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/derekberes\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.

These findings may prove useful in helping those with or at risk of developing anxiety or post traumatic stress disorder.</div><h3>Nothing quite like a full night’s\nrest</h3><br/><p> The <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2451902220302822?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, titled \"Partial and Total Sleep Deprivation Interferes with Neural Correlates of Consolidation of Fear Extinction Memory,\" was published by a team of researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and Harvard Medical School and can be found in the journal <a href=\"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/biological-psychiatry-cognitive-neuroscience-and-neuroimaging\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging</a>.</p><p>The researchers split 150 test subjects into three groups. The first got a full night's sleep, the second was \"sleep-restricted\" to a few hours' rest at the beginning of the night, and the third was utterly sleep deprived. Starting the next morning, they were all subjected to \"fear conditioning\" and \"fear extinction.\" <br/> <br/> The conditioning involved participants seeing one of three colors on a screen, two of which were paired with a mild electric shock. The idea being that this teaches a person to begin to develop a fear of that color. Later, the subjects underwent \"fear extinction,\" which had them viewing one of the colors again, but without the shocks. This step is intended to teach subjects that there is no longer a reason to fear that image and that it is now \"safe.\"<br/> <br/> Later that evening, the test subjects viewed the colors again while having their brains scanned. This allowed the scientists to see if their brains were reacting to the colors with fear despite having \"learned\" that electric shocks were no longer a threat. <br/> <br/> Curiously, the brains of those getting no sleep resembled those of the people who enjoyed a full night's rest twelve hours later in that the fear response was absent. Those getting only a few hours of sleep showed signs of fear in their brain activity. This suggests that getting only a little rest might be <em>worse</em> than getting none at all, at least when it comes to learning and unlearning fear responses. </p><p>Brain activity recorded during the tasks painted a similar picture. Those who got a full night's sleep had more activity in the prefrontal cortex, an area tied to emotional regulation. In comparison, those getting only half a night's rest saw more activity in the regions associated with fear. Those getting no sleep had less activity in the fear areas overall.  </p><p>The research team suggests that restricted sleeping may lead to a severe reduction in the time we spend in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rapid Eye Movement</a> (REM) phase of sleep. While best known for being the part of the night when we dream, it is also when memories are consolidated. REM tends to occur at the end of 1.5-2 hour periods during sleep.  </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tHow can we use this information?\n\n\n\n\n</h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Y-qLKZWyDs\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> This study may help explain why people in high-stress jobs with short sleep schedules, such as emergency response workers, medical professionals, or soldiers, can leave people even more anxious or shell shocked.<br/> </p><p>Conceivably, this could be used to help develop new treatments for these conditions.

Even if this was the end of the story, women still provided an inordinate amount of calories for the tribe, as fruits, vegetables, and nuts accounted for the bulk of sustenance.</p><p>As with many myths, this longstanding story might not be completely accurate. Thanks to <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/45/eabd0310\" target=\"_blank\">recent archaeological findings</a> in Peru's Andes Mountains, published in the journal Science Advances, up to half the women in mobile groups in the Americas were big-game hunters. </p><p>University of California, Davis archaeologist Randall Haas started shifting his view of ancient hunting practices in 2018 while leading his crew 13,000 feet above sea level in Wilamay Patxja. Upon uncovering the remains, he automatically assumed one body was male due to the proximity of weaponry. </p><p>He was wrong. </p><p>The team unearthed a total of over 20,000 artifacts, including the remains of six bodies in five burial pits. One pit, which contained a teenage woman, included a toolkit with spearpoints and shafts. Tools for dissecting game were also discovered. In total, 24 stone tools were unearthed, including projectile points for killing large game, heavy rocks for stripping hides and cracking bones, and red ocher to preserve hides. </p><p>Previously, such tools were thought to be used for cutting or scraping when discovered near female remains. Haas says we need to rethink that approach, which is likely the result of modern bias. Buried near these pits were the remains of Andean deer and vicuña, two commonly hunted animals in Peru. </p><p>Haas's group then reviewed the remains of 429 bodies spread over 107 sites in the Americas. These individuals lived between 6,000 and 12,500 years ago. Big-game hunting tools were buried with 11 women and 16 men. The Wilamay Patxja dig is not an outlier. </p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"fd6aa1ee19f1c34d41c47afaede5b53f\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"5e4a1\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2NDQ0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MTA5NDUxM30.APHNOCmNft84y1FNYXVn0nBRsQywi7UwjBnRXufFHnY/img.jpg?width=980\"/><h3>Why Female Gladiators Were Polarizing Figures in Ancient Rome</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"c4f5a67f268f643208d401a9224efce9\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/565gLzKgRvM?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>Extrapolating from the most recent dataset, Haas estimates that between 30-50 percent of big-game hunters were women. This doesn't imply that it's a global phenomenon, although female warriors were <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/women-warriors-hunter-gatherers-battles-mongolia\" target=\"_blank\">recently identified</a> in California, dating back roughly 5,000 years. Likewise, women warriors were <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/female-game-hunters-ancient-americas\" target=\"_blank\">discovered</a> in Mongolia 1,500 years ago and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/skeleton-ignites-debate-over-whether-women-were-viking-warriors\" target=\"_blank\">in Scandinavia</a> about a millennium ago.</p><p>Researchers say these findings challenge our understanding of gender identities. Modern analysis can discover the biological sex of these individuals, though we cannot make assumptions about the role of men and women by current standards. As University of Miami archaeologist, Pamela Geller <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/11/prehistoric-female-hunter-discovery-upends-gender-role-assumptions/\" target=\"_blank\">says</a>, </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"With few exceptions, the researchers who study hunting and gathering groups—regardless of which continent they work on—presume that a sexual division of labor was universal and rigid. And because it is commonsensical, they then have a hard time explaining why female-bodied individuals also bear the skeletal markers of hunting or have hunting tool kits as grave goods.\"</p><p>There's always the possibility that hunting tools were ritualistically buried alongside varied members of the tribe, including women. Yet we also have to remember that there were no supermarkets on the savanna. Tribal life was an all-hands-on-deck affair. Female hunters should surprise us no more than stay-at-home dads today.

Some have posited that laughter is the best medicine. Others have achieved fame and fortune by making people laugh. Laughter is one of the great universals of the human experience, even if people from different cultures tend to find different things funny. With that knowledge, it may surprise you to learn that most philosophers have taken a negative view of comedy, laughter, and humor throughout history. </p><p>Today, we'll look at that history and what modern thinkers have to say about it. Using these insights, we can then try and make sense of the never-ending debate over what should and should not be the subject of a joke. </p><h3>The Philosophy of Humor\n\n</h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WTl_xjOyZsc\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> Believe it or not, the same people who debated the existence of chairs for two millennia had some differing ideas on what humor was and if it was good or not. Plato famously thought that comedy was bad, vicious even, and that most if not all laughter came at somebody else's expense. He viewed laughter as a \"passion,\" and considered being taken by it as a loss of self-control, as did many philosophers before him. In <em>\"</em>Republic,<em>\" </em>he proposes that in his utopian city certain important people should never laugh and that strict censorship should keep objectionable, presumably hilarious works away from people.</p><p>Several centuries later, the great stoic philosopher <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epictetus/\" target=\"_blank\">Epictetus</a> encouraged people to \"Let not your laughter be loud, frequent, or unrestrained\" and, allegedly, never laughed once in his life, which he considered a point of virtue. <br/> <br/> Most of Western Philosophy took its cues from Plato and the stoics for a very long time and spoke poorly of humor as a result. Many famous thinkers, such as <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes/\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Hobbes</a> and <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/\" target=\"_blank\">Rene Descartes</a>, attributed most laughter to a sense of superiority over others. <br/> <br/> However, <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/\" target=\"_blank\">Immanuel Kant</a>, the famously boring philosopher, went in another direction. He supported the idea that laughter was caused by the incongruity of what we expect to happen and what <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/humor/#IncThe\" target=\"_blank\">happens</a>. A good joke, he reasoned, builds up expectations, which it then resolves \"into nothing.\" This idea, that humor is based on differences in expectations and reality, is prevalent in both philosophy and psychology. <br/> <br/> He even provided a series of jokes to explain himself, the best example being:<br/> <br/> \"The heir of a rich relative wished to arrange for an imposing funeral, but he lamented that he could not properly succeed; 'for' (said he) 'the more money I give my mourners to look sad, the more cheerful they look!'\"</p><p>Despite this, Kant and the philosophers who agreed with him didn't think comedy was \"good\" per se. They're just suggesting that laughs not based on malice are possible. It has only been recently that philosophers have paid much attention to the pro-comedy minority. This becomes even stranger when you realize how many heavy hitters are on that team.  </p><p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle/\" target=\"_blank\">Aristotle</a>, the most famous student of Plato, continued his policy of disagreeing with this teacher by deciding that comedy could be okay. He argued that living a good life requires that you enjoy yourself from time to time and that humor is a part of that. He further maintained that being witty is a <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/aristotles-11-guidelines-for-living-a-good-life\" target=\"_blank\">virtue</a>.  <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/\" target=\"_blank\">St. Thomas Aquinas,</a> a great philosopher in his own right, largely agreed with Aristotle and expanded on these notions. He argued that, as sleep provides physical rest, laughter provides psychological rest. He also noticed the social benefits of laughing with other people. These ideas have been expanded on by other writers up to the present day.  </p><p>We have even reached a point where many public intellectuals will incorporate wit into their work on purpose. Most notable among these people are <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/u/slavoj-zizek\" target=\"_blank\">Slavoj Žižek</a>, who makes enough jokes to fill a <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/slavoj-zizek-jokes\" target=\"_blank\">book</a>, and <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/\" target=\"_blank\">Bertrand Russell</a>, whose quotes include moments of absolute <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell\" target=\"_blank\">hilarity</a>. <br/> <br/> While most people probably wouldn't consider being funny a \"<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/virtue-ethics-the-moral-system-you-have-never-heard-of-but-have-probably-used\" target=\"_blank\">virtue</a>\" in the same way that Aristotle did, his ideas on humor, often called the \"<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/humor/#HumPlaLauPlaSig\" target=\"_blank\">play</a>\" theory, are likely the foundation of most people's understanding of what humor is and if it is of any use or not. <br/> <br/> Of course, even if you take the view that humor is a good thing, or even just that it isn't inherently bad, there is still the question of how to use it properly. For this, we'll have to turn to the never-ending debate over the ethics of humor.  </p><h3>  To joke, or not to joke, that is the question. \n\n\n</h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0_NUyPt2Q4\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> Even after addressing the problem of whether comedy is good, bad, or neutral, the issue of what can be the subject of laughter still has to be resolved. As we've seen, this issue goes back to Ancient Greece. It should surprise nobody that we still debate it. But what should and shouldn't we joke about? Is there a clear line? Does context matter? Professor John Morreall of William and Mary can provide us some guidance. He has worked in the philosophy of humor for decades and has written several essays, <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/humor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">articles</a>, and books on the subject. <br/> <br/> He restates in his essay \"<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sjp.12390?af=R\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Good, The Bad, and the Funny: An Ethics of Humor</a>\" a proposal that he has made before; that a general principle can be applied to humor, \"Don't play with something which you should take seriously.\"<br/> <br/> This seems like a simple enough idea; if matches aren't something to be played with, then perhaps racial stereotypes aren't either? But where is the line in cases like this?</p><p>To explain how this might be used, he offers examples of broad categories of jokes that rely on making fun of certain types of people. In the classic \"Dumb Blonde\" joke, the idea that all blondes are a bit slow is entertained. However, Dr. Morreall argues that to find the joke funny doesn't require that we really believe that blondes are stupid nor that anybody thinks the moon is closer than <a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/160752952-dumb-blonde-jokes-alabama\" target=\"_blank\">Florida</a>. </p><p>It is possible to play with these notions without taking them seriously or coming away from the joke with a bias towards blondes. Other jokes cross the line, though. Some harmful stereotypes that people believe can be kept in circulation through jokes, or reinforced in a way that causes harm later. In these cases, it may be morally objectionable to use the stereotype for laughs due to the harm it can cause elsewhere. A similar line of reasoning exists for jokes that utilize issues of deadly seriousness; some things should not be made light of for fear of causing us not to take them seriously. <br/> <br/> An example of a line crosser Dr. Morreall cites in several of his essays is the cover of National Lampoon's \"Dessert Issue.\" In a spoof of the cover of the \"Concert for Bangladesh\" album, the magazine depicts a starving child in the form of a partially eaten chocolate statue.  </p><p>The argument here is that by making the cover of a famous aid concert the subject of mockery, we can belittle the severity of the issue of the humanitarian crisis it refers to. <br/> <br/> On the other hand, Dr. Morreall also argues that there are many positives humor can bring. He mentions the joy it can bring, the social benefits of being able to laugh with friends, the ability of a good pun to lower tensions, and the ability of many jokes to let us step back and consider the absurdities of a topic we don't notice when we're too close to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOM0t6TRrg4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">situation</a>. <br/> <br/> Given the universality of laughter, humor seems to be one of the more important elements of the human condition. While philosophy has taken a strangely negative view of it for most of its history, more recent thinkers have begun to tout the benefits of a laugh now and then.  </p><p>So go on, enjoy a lousy pun. It's probably virtuous.  </p></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/I2BcTF-gZ-o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 05 Nov 2020 20:34:41 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY4NTk2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MDQ0MDkyOX0.eUzg4XzqHEAqpI_iL0R25fJfUaE4vazD9R4rYMJctrM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"6e763d751317c8b83197484d23011b06","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn18@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-14-179_f104d3230c830593.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":69528,"destBytes":69528,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDY4NTk2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MDQ0MDkyOX0.eUzg4XzqHEAqpI_iL0R25fJfUaE4vazD9R4rYMJctrM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn18@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-14-179_f104d3230c830593.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/I2BcTF-gZ-o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn37@2020_2/2020/11/14/17-30-34-863_08fe18ec54bb4ea8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001752},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"A normal tourist map, \"but everything is negative\"","link":"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/critical-tourist-map","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc2NDAzNS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNTYyOTc3MH0.VIUEGvBTsmFRydGBtWnoJFaJ60OgMvgMmxzN8ROcdkY/img.png?width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;height=700\" />\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul class=\"ee-ul\"> \n <li>Your standard tourist map is irrepressibly positive about its location—but not this one.</li>\n <li>Norwegian activist/artist Markus Moestue reveals the dark and shameful sides of Oslo.</li>\n <li>He hopes his 'Critical Tourist Map' will inspire others to reveal the dark side of their cities.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>\"Only negative stuff about Oslo\"</h3>\n<br />\n<span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"afa824839d1b396332eec13dde629cf1\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HI1paJLc9Bo?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span>\n<p>Tourism is a conspiracy of euphemisms. Visitors only want to see the best parts of the places they visit. And the places they visit only want to show them their nicest bits. But now, Norwegian activist/artist Markus Moestue is completely reversing that premise. His 'Critical Tourist Map' of Oslo shows the worst, most shameful parts of the Norwegian capital. \"It's just like a normal tourist map,\" he says, \"but everything is negative.\"</p>\n<p><span></span>In a clip on his website, he's seen wheeling a self-made kiosk across Oslo to distribute his work to passersby: \"You guys want a free tourist map?

No. People want to go to Oslo and then they want to go back home, and they want to say: <em>I've been to Oslo. I've seen Oslo.

But \"it sometimes feels like Norway has no colonial history and nobody ate any sugar in the 17th century.\"</p><p><span></span>However, don't mistake Mr Moestue's negativism for nihilism. Ultimately, his map has a positive point to make: \"I feel that Norway is using too much resources <em>appearing</em> to be good, and too little effort actually <em>doing</em> good!\"</p><p>And there's another thing the artist hopes is map will achieve: \"I'm hoping others will make their own tourist maps about their own cities.

The best evidence that Neanderthals not only fought but excelled at war, is that they met us and weren't immediately overrun. Instead, for around 100,000 years, Neanderthals resisted <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/were-other-humans-the-first-victims-of-the-sixth-mass-extinction-126638\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">modern human expansion</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/365323/original/file-20201024-23-10ckr5s.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Map of Eurasia and Africa showing territories of different human ancestors and relatives.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/365323/original/file-20201024-23-10ckr5s.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip\"/></a></p><p>The out-of-Africa offensive. (Nicholas R. Longrich)</p><p>Why else would we take so long <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/genetic-studies-reveal-diversity-of-early-human-populations-and-pin-down-when-we-left-africa-65745\" target=\"_blank\">to leave Africa</a>? Not because the environment was hostile but because Neanderthals were already thriving in Europe and Asia.</p><p>It's exceedingly unlikely that modern humans met the Neanderthals and decided to just live and let live. If nothing else, population growth inevitably forces humans to acquire more land, to ensure sufficient territory to hunt and forage food for their children. But an aggressive military strategy is also good evolutionary strategy.</p><p><img alt=\"Painting of Napoleon Bonaparte on horseback.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/364007/original/file-20201016-21-sodxh.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip\"/></p><p><em>Homo sapiens</em> has a history of aggressive military expansion.</p><p>Instead, for thousands of years, we must have tested their fighters, and for thousands of years, we kept losing. In weapons, tactics, strategy, we were fairly evenly matched.</p><p>Neanderthals probably had tactical and strategic advantages. They'd occupied the Middle East for millennia, doubtless gaining intimate knowledge of the terrain, the seasons, how to live off the native plants and animals. In battle, their massive, muscular builds must have made them devastating fighters in close-quarters combat. <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.0168\" target=\"_blank\">Their huge eyes</a> likely gave Neanderthals superior low-light vision, letting them manoeuvre in the dark for ambushes and dawn raids.</p><h3></h3><br/><h2><em>Sapiens</em> victorious</h2><p>Finally, the stalemate broke, and the tide shifted. We don't know why. It's possible the invention of superior ranged weapons – <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/indications-of-bow-and-stonetipped-arrow-use-64-000-years-ago-in-kwazulunatal-south-africa/89AF638BE5E64CEAC63363EFDD4D5E8F\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030544030500230X\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">spear-throwers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/329436a0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">throwing clubs</a> – let lightly-built <em>Homo sapiens</em> harass the stocky Neanderthals from a distance using hit-and-run tactics. Or perhaps <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/106/38/16034\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">better hunting and gathering techniques</a> let <em>sapiens</em> feed bigger tribes, creating numerical superiority in battle.</p><p><img alt=\"US army soldier stands guard at damanged street corner.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/364012/original/file-20201016-13-jevkl6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip\"/></p><p>US Army, Iraq War, Ramadi. <em>Homo sapiens</em> is extremely skilled at war.</p><p>Even after primitive <em>Homo sapiens</em> broke out of Africa <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1376-z\" target=\"_blank\">200,000 years ago</a>, it took over 150,000 years to conquer Neanderthal lands.

Ultimately, we won. But this wasn't because they were less inclined to fight.
