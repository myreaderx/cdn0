While people are returning to public transit — with transit directions on Maps increasing 50% compared to last year in the U.S. — safety remains top of mind. That’s why we’re expanding <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/grab-seat-and-be-time-new-transit-updates-google-maps/?_ga=2.253480841.100386329.1625605750-1298931660.1611775847\">transit crowdedness predictions</a> to over 10,000 transit agencies in 100 countries so you’ll know if your line is likely to have lots of open seats, hit full capacity, or be anywhere in between. With this information you can decide whether you want to hop on board or wait for another train. Because pandemic or not, no one likes standing in a jam-packed subway car. </p><br/><p>These predictions are made possible through our AI technology, contributions from people using Google Maps, and historical location trends that predict future crowdedness levels for transit lines all over the world. All these predictions were designed with privacy in mind. We apply world-class anonymization technology and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfAdemDkLsc\">differential privacy techniques</a> to Location History data to make sure your data remains secure and private.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><figure class=\" article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--4 h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-4 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"A GIF of transit crowdedness predictions being used on Google Maps in a Pixel phone\" class=\"article-image--medium\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Transit_Crowdedness_Predictions.gif\"/></figure><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Transit crowdedness predictions are expanding to over 10,000 cities in 100 countries</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>In New York and Sydney, we’re piloting the ability to see live crowdedness information right down to the transit car level.

New York City, Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, and Washington D.C. lead the pack as some of the cities with the most crowded lines. Nationally, you’re most likely to get a seat at 9 a.m, whereas cars may be standing room only between 7-8 a.m. In the evening, leaving earlier than rush hour will up your chances of grabbing a seat, with lines being far less crowded at 3 p.m. than they are between 4-5 p.m.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><figure class=\" article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--4 h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-4 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"A screenshot of a Pixel phone that shows transit directions and crowdedness predictions on Google Maps\" class=\"article-image--medium\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Train_Level_Crowdedness.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>See live crowdedness at the transit car level in Sydney and New York</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Be intentional with your time</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>After living through a global pandemic, people have told us that they want to be more intentional about how they spend their time.

You’ll see which modes of transportation you’ve used and the distance and time you’ve driven, flown, biked or walked. You can also see how much time you’re spending at different places — like shops, airports and restaurants — and instantly drill down to see all the places you visited.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><figure class=\" article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--4 h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-4 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"A GIF of Google Maps’ new Timeline Insights feature on a Pixel phone\" class=\"article-image--medium\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Timeline_Insights.gif\"/></figure><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>See helpful insights and trends about places you visit</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Reminisce about past trips and plan future ones when you feel safe</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>If you’re feeling nostalgic but not quite ready to travel yet, head on over to the Trips in Timeline tab which is now live for everyone on Android.
