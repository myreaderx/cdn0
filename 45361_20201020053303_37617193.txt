Initially, Coinbase ignored me. My succession of emails to their official \"whitehat@coinbase.com\" domain were ignored until I posted that they weren't replying on <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/217qig/coinbase_not_replying_to_current_security/\">reddit</a>. Still as of now, my tweets to them over a months time were completely ignored: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/infosec_au/status/440788098713006080\">[1]</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/infosec_au/status/441213387700072448\">[2]</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/infosec_au/status/441456233451499520\">[3]</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/infosec_au/status/443027529431920640\">[4]</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/infosec_au/status/445164418863616000\">[5]</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Timeline of disclosure:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#1 Feb 28th, 2014 - First contact made to \"whitehat@coinbase.com\".\n#2 Mar 4th, 2014 - Twitter reminder\n#3 Mar 4th, 2014 - Second contact made to \"whitehat@coinbase.com\" due to no reply.\n#4 Mar 5th, 2014 - Twitter reminder [2]\n#5 Mar 10th, 2014 - Twitter reminder [3]\n#6 Mar 16, 2014 - Third contact made to \"whitehat@coinbase.com\".. still no reply.\n#7 Mar 16, 2014 - Twitter reminder [4]\n#8 Mar 24, 2014 - Reddit posts on /r/bitcoin and /r/coinbase.\n#9 Mar 25, 2014 - Email reply received from Julian from Coinbase.\n#10 Mar 26, 2014 - My response, explaining that Julian had missed the main part of the vulnerability disclosure.\n#11 Mar 29, 2014 - Coinbase joins HackerOne bug bounty management platform.\n#12 Mar 30, 2014 - I send another report via HackerOne to make sure they have acknowledged the full risks of the design flaw.\n#13 Mar 31, 2014 - Confirmation as a \"wont-fix\" bug.\n</code></pre>\n\n<div id=\"technical\"></div>    \n\n<h4 id=\"technicaldetails\">Technical Details</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://shubh.am/bugs/coinbase.htm\">Here</a> are the emails to and from Coinbase. I'll cut to the important parts of my report in this blog post, however feel free to read the entire report.</p>\n\n<p>In my report, I claim that the ability to send unlimited money requests allows for an individual to determine whether or not a user is a part of Coinbase, as well as his/her first and last name listed on Coinbase.</p>\n\n<pre><code>1. Unlimited money request emails\n2. Email Address / User enumeration on Coinbase\n3. Information Disclosure of Coinbase Accounts (First and Last name)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The major security flaw, is not just the fact that full names are disclosed, but more so that there is no rate limiting or prevention of API abuse. This means that an attacker/spammer can iterate through hundreds and thousands of emails without being limited, and can potentially pick out the emails which are confirmed to be members of Coinbase.</p>\n\n<p>Before you get the impression that this isn't a security flaw in itself, please let me explain.</p>\n\n<p><u>Phishers can use this flaw for harm. I believe it is a security issue on Coinbase, which will merely <em>assist</em> <strong>mass, targeted phishing.</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>Once authenticated on Coinbase, all an attacker has to do to confirm validity of users is, send the following requests:</p>\n\n<pre><code>POST /transactions/request_money HTTP/1.1  \nHost: coinbase.com  \nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0  \nAccept: */*;q=0.5, text/javascript, application/javascript, application/ecmascript, application/x-ecmascript  \nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5  \nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate  \nX-CSRF-Token: xE9Hal1nexOgbEUaBiRWksgIE+hNzUMf/DDxz3JPVT8=  \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8  \nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest  \nReferer: https://coinbase.com/transactions  \nContent-Length: 213  \nCookie: [redacted]  \nConnection: keep-alive  \nPragma: no-cache  \nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nutf8=%E2%9C%93&#38;authenticity_token=xE9Hal1nexOgbEUaBiRWksgIE%2BhNzUMf%2FDDxz3JPVT8%3D&#38;transaction%5Bfrom%5D=[email_they_wish_to_validate]&amp;transaction%5Bamount%5D=1&#38;transaction_amount_converted=463.58&#38;transaction%5Bnotes%5D=  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where [email<em>they</em>wish<em>to</em>validate] in the POST Data would be changed to the victims email, and the Cookie HTTP header would be filled out with the attackers cookie.</p>\n\n<p>The response which Coinbase returns, will determine whether or not the requested email address is valid.</p>\n\n<p>For a valid email address, it would look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK  \nServer: cloudflare-nginx  \nDate: Mon, 31 Mar 2014 14:55:33 GMT  \nContent-Type: text/javascript; charset=utf-8  \nConnection: keep-alive  \nCache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate  \nSet-Cookie: request_method=POST; path=/; secure  \nSet-Cookie: _coinbase=[redacted]  \nStatus: 200 OK  \nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000  \nVary: Accept-Encoding  \nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  \nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN  \nX-Rack-Cache: invalidate, pass  \nX-Request-Id: ac56d4ca-7dc2-444b-9505-d2ed44bf4a7d  \nX-Runtime: 0.589700  \nX-Ua-Compatible: IE=Edge,chrome=1  \nCF-RAY: 113d6373b13d04b6-SYD  \nContent-Length: 3827\n\n  ...

[redacted]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's evident that we can see a name \"John Citizen\" (for example purposes), in the above response. This confirms two things for us:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The email we requested is <strong>valid</strong> on Coinbase, as a user exists.  </li>\n<li>The email we requested is <strong>associated</strong> with the name <strong>John Citizen</strong> on Coinbase.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Phew, now the spammer has taken scraped email addresses, and now has figured out that you're a valid user of coinbase <strong>AND</strong> now has your full name.  </p>\n\n<div id=\"poc\"></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"proofofconceptandreallifeexample\">Proof Of Concept and Real Life Example</h4>\n\n<p>In order to demonstrate the nature of this security vulnerability, I thought it would be wise to display how a phisher would actually go about doing a campaign  using techniques above:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1</strong>. Scrape email addresses from bitcoin related websites, and organise them into a large list.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Within 30 minutes, I was able to gather 400 unique email addresses, distinctively associated with Bitcoins</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ik2M9Zw.png\" alt=\"bitcoinemails\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>2</strong>. Test for emails which are actual Coinbase accounts, and extract their First and Last names, associated to the emails.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3</strong>. All sorts of panic happens.</p>\n\n<p>This is what the attack in progress looks like:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://shubs.io/content/images/2014/Mar/1.gif\" alt=\"exampleattack\"></p>\n\n<p>Here is what your inbox looks like:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/nauHivq.png\" alt=\"inbox\"></p>\n\n<p>People start worrying:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/VUlLMdC.png\" alt=\"twitter\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>4</strong>.

Some people think you're sending them Bitcoins.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/63zvbVr.png\" alt=\"sorryman\"></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<div id=\"conclusion\"></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h4>\n\n<p>Seriously, Coinbase let me send 16 pages worth of Bitcoin requests. <br>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Vo7ngYc.png\" alt=\"rate\"></p>\n\n<p>Reminds me of the auto-dialler from Simpsons, the AT-5000: <br>\n<img src=\"http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/37/files/2011/11/AutoDialer_AT5000.jpg\" alt=\"AT5000\"></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<div id=\"help\"></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"helpgetthisbugfixed\">Help get this bug fixed!</h4>\n\n<p>Coinbase didn't listen to me, but maybe they'll listen to you.
